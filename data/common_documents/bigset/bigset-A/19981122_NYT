Outzen steps up at QB, directs FSU comeback
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Mario Edwards wondered what it took to get a
little attention, much less respect. Four interceptions against
Wake Forest last week, and here came Florida quarterback Doug
Johnson, insisting he'd never even heard of the Florida State
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he had to say something,'' Edwards responded Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I took it a little personally,'' Edwards said. ``I'd
like to get a headset on him and ask if he knows who I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of FSU's 23-12 victory on a misty day at Doak
Campbell Stadium, Johnson became fully acquainted with Edwards and
friends. Florida came to town averaging 489 yards of offense but
managed only 204 in this one, its second-lowest output since Steve
Spurrier has been in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line,'' Johnson said, ``they were better than us.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, FSU _ ranked fourth in last week's Bowl
Championship Series ratings _ remains on the fringe of contention
for the Fiesta Bowl. The 11-1 Seminoles still need help in the form
of upsets above, but avenging last year's 32-29 loss at Florida
would do for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most satisfying win for me in 10 years
because we lost our quarterback and had a backup in there,''
Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they did, though Marcus Outzen didn't necessarily play
like just any backup. The sophomore from Fort Walton Beach, Fla.,
weathered blitzes that produced a total of five sacks to complete
13 of his 22 passes for 167 yards and a touchdown. He also picked
up 29 yards on a pair of quarterback draws to set up the field goal
that put the game away with less than five minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outzen was a winner,'' said Bowden, who lost starter Chris
Weinke to a neck injury last week. ``He played within himself. He
did the things he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   What Outzen and the offense couldn't do, college football's No.
1-rated defense could, limiting Florida (9-2) to one touchdown and
its lowest yardage total since a 194-yard day against Tennessee in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, though, the Seminoles weren't feeling quite so cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Florida went ahead on a 50-yard pass from Johnson to Travis
McGriff (aided when cornerback Tay Cody slipped), and the Gators
had a chance for more. Johnson, though, made a poor decision as he
rolled away from pressure on a third down from the FSU 19 and threw
an interception to rover Sean Key.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him moving, and I just dropped back a little,'' Key
said. ``He threw it right to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles took advantage, driving to a 36-yard Sebastian
Janikowski field goal to cut the deficit to 7-3. Another Janikowski
kick, this one from 42 yards out, drew FSU within a point with
13:37 still remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   That's when things really started going the Seminoles' way.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a third-and-eight from his seven, Outzen was sacked
near the goal line and fumbled, the ball trickling into the end
zone. Florida's Gerard Warren fell on it for an apparent touchdown,
but FSU guard Jason Whitaker came in and knocked the ball loose,
and tackle Ross Brannon recovered for a safety.
</P>
<P>
   Bad call?
</P>
<P>
   ``(Warren) never had possession,'' Spurrier said. ``He fell on
it, but he never had it in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   FSU saved five points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge break for us,'' said Bowden. ``Even after the
free kick, we held them to a field goal, so it was only five points
all together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles got off easy again when the Gators drove to a
first-and-goal at the seven. Eugene McCaslin's third-down run from
the five gained nothing, and Florida got only a 22-yard Jeff
Chandler field goal and a 12-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Spurrier's team might as well have packed up
and headed home right then. The rest was all FSU, and the turning
point was a particularly galling one from the Gators' point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   On first-and-10 from the Florida 32, Outzen's pass for Peter
Warrick was so short that Warrick was ready to turn defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming up to make the tackle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the ball popped out of safety Marquand Manuel's hands
and right to Warrick, who again reversed his field and wound his
way through the rest of the secondary and into the end zone for the
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The FSU defense took it from there. A diving interception at the
seven by Edwards with just under six minutes left in the third
quarter ended Florida's last real threat, and Warrick provided the
finishing touches.
</P>
<P>
   His holding penalty brought back a 48-yard touchdown run by
Travis Minor, but the former high school quarterback made amends
quickly. On the next play, Warrick took an end-around handoff,
pulled up and found flanker Ron Dugans alone down the right
sideline for a 46-yard touchdown with 13:30 remaining, putting FSU
up 20-12.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski's third field goal, this one from 41 yards,
effectively ended the argument with 4:31 left, though the FSU
defense had made its case much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just dominated them in the second half,'' said Edwards.
``We've been a second-half team all season, and we wanted to do it
again today, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And what did he think of Doug Johnson after all was said and
done?
</P>
<P>
   ``If they like him, they ought to keep him,'' Edwards said with
a smile. ``Either way is fine with us.''

Freshman leads Oklahoma State past Baylor
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
STILLWATER, Okla. _ Reserve tailback Reggie White closed out his
redshirt freshman season and the year for Oklahoma State with a
bang Saturday, running for a pair of touchdowns in the final five
minutes to break a tie and spark the Cowboys to a 24-10 victory
over Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, White, who is from Liberty, brought a
disappointing end to what has been an unfulfilling season for the
Bears and senior Anthony Overstreet.
</P>
<P>
   Overstreet, one of 12 seniors playing their final game for
Baylor, carried 22 times for a career-high 113 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But his was about the only solid performance for the error-prone
offense as the Bears start looking to next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hundred-yard day,'' Overstreet said, ``but a last-game
victory would have been much better. We didn't get it. The thing to
do now is tell the younger guys they need to move on, decide
they're winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will eventually happen because they have great guys coming
through for Baylor. It will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive year, the Bears finish with a 2-9
record and go 1-7 in the Big 12 South.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys closed out with back-to-back victories for the first
time since 1988 and wound up at 5-6 overall, 3-5 in the Big 12
South.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of three-plus quarters Saturday, however,
neither Baylor nor Oklahoma State did much to excite the crowd of
28,750 at Lewis Field.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes, turnovers and penalties were the order of the day
until White's scoring runs of nine and eight yards broke the 10-10
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   The first and second TDs of his career had exactly the big-play
effect one team needed to break the malaise of both squads.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really what it was,'' said defensive back Rodney Smith,
who forced a fumble and tipped a pass that turned into a Baylor
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense was playing good, our defense was playing good.
Their offense just happened to make a big play and things turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense indeed held sway much of the afternoon. But when White
came on for starting tailback Nathan Simmons, who left with an
injury, the momentum shifted dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our football team played hard right down to the last
second,'' Baylor coach Dave Roberts said. ``That's what I told them
in the locker room. I said ``Hey, it was a great effort.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an incredible effort by the offense and defense. We
had our moments and we weren't able to execute at times. A great
deal of that was due to Oklahoma State's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that game went back and forth. In the end, we just weren't
able to execute and get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Penalties were a contributing factor. The Bears were whistled 13
times for 112 yards in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive ineptitude played a role, too. Baylor was intercepted
once, fumbled four times (although losing only one) and suffered
seven quarterback sacks totaling 56 yards in losses.
</P>
<P>
   That helped offset the running of Overstreet, who rushed for 84
yards in the first period alone.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor totaled 304 yards of offense to 345 for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Oklahoma State's yardage came from the passing of
redshirt sophomore quarterback Tony Lindsay, who completed 8-of-17
for 179 yards and scored on a one-yard run in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   That TD trimmed a 10-0 Baylor lead to 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Bears being sacked four times on their first three
possessions (including twice immediately after the opening
kickoff), placekicker Matt Bryant nailed a 45-yard field goal at
3:05 of the first period for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   When Lindsay and running back Nathan Simmons failed to connect
on a pitchout on the ensuing series, defensive end James Calvin
recovered the fumble, setting up a five-yard scoring run by Elijah
Burkins.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State cut into the 10-0 lead on Lindsay's scoring run
at 9:55 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   A fumble by Overstreet and cornerback Evan Howell's recovery in
the third period led to a 28-yard Tim Sydnes field goal that tied
the score at 10 early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the Bears really began to struggle in the
face of the Cowboys' defense.
</P>
<P>
   When quarterback Jermaine Alfred completed a 12-yard pass to
fullback Derek Lagway for a first down at 5:23 of the third period,
it was the Bears' last first down until 1:13 of the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Oklahoma State had gone out front 24-10, thanks to
White.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred, who completed 16 of 33 passes for 227 yards to go with
one interception, briefly caught fire in the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He had a 54-yard toss to Morris Anderson and another of 40 yards
to Darrius Thompson as the Bears gained the Cowboys' five with one
second remaining.
</P>
<P>
   They were unable to capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The win was great,'' said strong safety Trent Alexander, one
of the 14 OSU seniors. ``But I guess I would have liked more points
on the board. I wish we could have beaten Baylor a little worse
than that, especially for the seniors.''

King delivers crowning blow to Houston bid
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW ORLEANS _ Shaun King's strong-arm tactics Saturday kept piling
up points for Tulane, but the Houston Cougars couldn't keep pace
after a valiant first half.
</P>
<P>
   As Tulane scored on its first four series of the second half,
the Cougars dropped off the radar screen, falling 48-20 at the
Louisiana Superdome. The Green Wave wrapped up a berth in the
Liberty Bowl with the undisputed Conference USA championship.
</P>
<P>
   King completed a school-record 18 straight passes during one
stage of the game in leading Tulane to its first 10-0 start since
1931. The Wave can polish off a perfect season by defeating
Louisiana Tech on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   UH coach Kim Helton was unstinting in his praise of King, who
connected on 26 of 33 passes for 319 yards and five touchdowns with
no interceptions to raise his season totals to 2,897 yards, 33 TDs
and only six interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   King, the NCAA major-college passing leader this season, raised
his passing efficiency rating to what would be an NCAA-record 180.4
with one game to go. He has thrown 140 passes without an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the MVP in the country,'' Helton said of King,
suggesting he's worthy of the Heisman Trophy. ``Without that
quarterback, they don't win five games. He is really something
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to bronze his shoes, but if there is another
quarterback who has done as much for his school, I haven't seen
him. He looks to me to have what all the great ones have, the
ability to make great plays. It takes a lot to play quarterback
when you know you have to go out and score 45 every game.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a celebratory day, with Tulane assured of its
first bowl game since 1987 and police hauling trespassing Tulane
students off the field in handcuffs, the future of both coaches was
a much-discussed topic.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane's Tommy Bowden reportedly is the front-runner for the
Clemson job. Helton, who has three years and nearly $900,000 left
on his contract, will meet this week with athletic director Chet
Gladchuk to discuss his future.
</P>
<P>
   In remaining one of the nation's four unbeaten teams (with
Tennessee, Kansas State and UCLA), Tulane outgained UH 294-127 in
the second half. The Cougars, completing their second consecutive
3-8 season (2-4 in C-USA), led 7-0 and 10-3 in the first half but
never overcame a critical 23-second, 14-point swing in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Kerwin Cook grabbed a pass deflected by Tulane teammate John
Wilson and converted it into a 38-yard scoring play to tie the
score at 10. On UH's ensuing possession, Jerrian James fumbled
after a pass reception, and Alphonso Roundtree recovered for Tulane
at the Cougars' 22.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, King lofted a pass into the right corner of
the end zone, where Adrian Burnette outleaped UH's William Fields
for the scoring pass that put Tulane ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Ketric Sanford's 50-yard run on the game's third play gave
Houston an early 7-0 lead. Sanford finished with 138 yards rushing
on 21 carries and totalled 1,054 yards for the season.
</P>
<P>
   After UH's Mike Waddell and Tulane's Brad Palazzo traded field
goals, the Cougars' defense stopped Tulane on fourth down at the UH
one, but that only delayed the Wave's tying TD on the tipped pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great athletes make great plays,'' Helton said. ``We had a
chance for the ball, and he went and got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Palazzo's 44-yard field goal capped Tulane's first series of the
second half. The Cougars failed to convert on third-and-three, and
Tulane quickly struck again.
</P>
<P>
   King, who operated a no-huddle offense from the shotgun most of
the day, fumbled the center snap, calmly picked up the ball and
rifled a 15-yard scoring strike to JaJuan Dawson in the left corner
of the end zone. A four-yard TD pass to Dawson completed a 74-yard
scoring drive on Tulane's next possession for a 34-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   King put the game out of reach early in the fourth quarter with
a 14-yarder to P.J. Franklin, who caught 10 passes for 136 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jason McKinley (14-for-20, 166 yards, no interceptions) threw a
nine-yard touchdown pass to Orlando Iglesias for UH's last score
following Iglesias' 51-yard catch and run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has been touched by God this season for some
reason,'' Bowden said of his Tulane squad. ``I think that Shaun
King had a normal performance today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the No.1 quarterback on an undefeated team, and he has
had a broken (left) wrist for most of the year. I've come to expect
performances like this from him. He definitely deserves Heisman
consideration this year.''

Bishop, Kansas State edge Missouri
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLUMBIA, Mo. _ Michael Bishop did not wow Heisman Trophy voters
with the eye-popping stats he is capable of on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But like he has done all season, the Kansas State senior made
the plays his team needed him to make to keep its
national-championship dreams alive.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop completed 13 of 26 passes for 157 yards and finished with
a game-high 104 yards rushing on 23 carries, accounting for two
touchdowns as the Wildcats eked out a 31-25 win over No. 19
Missouri at Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I really don't care about the Heisman,'' Bishop
said. ``I'm here to play for my team. I'm going to do everything I
can do for my team. As far as the Heisman, the way I play speaks
for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take the national title over the Heisman any day, because
that'll mean we had an undefeated season and accomplished a lot of
goals. The Heisman, that's more of a goal for a person. Playing
with a team like we have this season, I'm looking at team goals.
Our team goal is to win the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop had no choice but to step up if the Wildcats were to win.
Eric Hickson, the school's all-time leading rusher, sat out the
game with a badly sprained ankle, and backup Marlon Charles
suffered what is believed to be a fractured hip early in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop took the over primary running duties, with 15 of his
carries coming in the second half. The senior from Willis had a
touchdown run in the third quarter and ran for all but three yards
on a fourth-quarter scoring drive that provided the decisive points
as the Wildcats overcame a halftime deficit for the second
consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State (11-0, 8-0 Big 12) finished unbeaten in the regular
season for the first time in school history and has won 19
consecutive games. The Wildcats will face Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12
Championship Game on Dec. 5, and with a win there, they could
qualify for a spot in the Fiesta Bowl to decide the national
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you whether we're the No. 1 team in the nation or
the No. 2 team,'' K-State coach Bill Snyder said. ``I haven't
watched Tennessee play. I haven't watched UCLA play.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri (7-4, 5-3), which has lost 35 consecutive games against
top-10 opponents, nearly ruined the Wildcats' shot at No. 1 with a
spirited effort before a sellout crowd of 68,174. Tigers
quarterback Corby Jones had his best passing game of the season,
and receiver John Dausman had the best outing of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Jones completed just 14 passes in his final home game but rolled
up 249 yards through the air and threw two touchdown passes.
Dausman was responsible for much of that, netting 169 yards on six
catches. The Tigers as a team amassed 440 yards, a season high
against Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the game I've been dreaming of,'' Dausman said. ``I
just happened to be in the right place at the right time. This
whole week we were determined to come out and shock the world. We
almost did it, but almost doesn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not take Kansas State long to erase a three-point
halftime deficit. Charles keyed a swift four-play, 66-yard drive
with a 55-yard burst around right end on the first play from
scrimmage in the third quarter. Bishop carried it in three plays
later with a one-yard sneak off right tackle, and the Wildcats were
on top 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-and-out by Missouri, Kansas State went back to
work. David Allen returned a punt 47 yards to the Tigers' 11, and
two plays later, Bishop ran an option left and pitched to Frank
Murphy, who sprinted nine yards into the end zone. Martin
Gramatica's extra point gave Kansas State a 24-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Missouri did not fold. The Tigers got their first decent
special-teams play of the game, a 58-yard kickoff return by Ryan
Payne, to set up a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dausman then made a diving 37-yard catch to start an 86-yard
drive and closed it with a 20-yard touchdown grab on a nice corner
route on the first play of the fourth quarter to pull the Tigers
within 24-22.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri went for two, but Jones' pass to Devin West fell
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tigers got the worse end of an exchange of punts,
getting pinned at their two-yard line and not being able to move
the ball from there, Kansas State took over at the Missouri 37 and
called Bishop's number time and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I had to step up, but if coach calls for me
to run the ball, I'm going to run it and run it hard,'' Bishop
said.
</P>
<P>
   Five Bishop runs moved the ball to the three-yard line. Two
plays later, Murphy was met with a hard lick at the goal line by
linebacker Barry Odom. The ball bounded into the end zone, where
Murphy was the first to crawl on top of it for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had a touchdown run of a yard on fourth down called back
because of a holding penalty, forcing the Tigers to settle for a
field goal on their next drive. Missouri's second three-pointer of
the game matched its total for the entire season and left Kansas
State on top 31-25.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect punt by Kansas State's James Garcia left the Tigers at
their one-yard line with 3:04 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Jones ran for five yards on a fourth-and-four from the seven to
get one first down, and Dausman made a 33-yard catch and Kareem
Wise an 18-yard grab to move the Tigers to the Wildcats' 37.
</P>
<P>
   But four consecutive incompletions sealed the Tigers' fate.

Broncos' run parallels Dolphins' immortal season
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is almost uncanny how their seasons have stayed on the same
track, the 1972 Miami Dolphins, the first perfect team in the
postwar era, and the 1998 Denver Broncos, who wish to be the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Both kept winning with backup quarterbacks, Earl Morrall, a
38-year old geezer for the Fish, and Bubby Brister, a kid of 36 for
the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Both relied heavily on the running game to control the clock and
keep their defense off the field. Miami had three terrific backs,
Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick and the elusive Mercury Morris. Denver has
only one, but Terrell Davis is a blend of all their talents.
</P>
<P>
   Then, and now, the players talk of going unbeaten but are not
obsessed with the notion. Nor are the coaches, Don Shula or Mike
Shanahan. At this stage of the season, 26 years ago, the Dolphins
had won 10, going on 11 at New England's expense. The Broncos host
the Raiders on Sunday as they try to stretch their streak to 11.
</P>
<P>
   Shula had come close once before, as the coach of the Baltimore
Colts in 1967. They were unbeaten, and tied twice, as they ended
their season against the Rams on the road. The Rams had a loss and
two ties, including one between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they completely dominated us,'' Shula said.
</P>
<P>
   LA's Fearsome Foursome _ Merlin Olsen, Rosey Grier, Deacon Jones
and Lamar Lundy _ sacked the great Johnny Unitas seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It taught me something about undefeated teams,'' Shula said.
``We were undefeated right up to the last game and we lost
everything. An experience like that teaches you what is meaningful.
Championships are meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   For win No. 10, the Dolphins had been forced to come from behind
against the New York Jets, Morrall scrambling for 31 yards and a
touchdown, and Morris scoring the game-winner on a 14-yard sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The game was fraught with personal overtones. The Jets had stung
Shula's best Baltimore team in the epic 1969 Super Bowl. And the
week before this rematch, the crew-cut Morrall said, ``I wouldn't
want my son to be like Namath.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark was taken as a slam at Joe Willie's long, wavy locks
and his playboy lifestyle. Earl was one of four Miami captains who
walked to midfield for the pre-game coin toss, and he found himself
facing Larry Grantham and Namath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Grantham from having played golf with him,'' he said.
``We shook hands. Then the official introduced me to Namath. He
didn't put out his hand and he didn't look at me. I couldn't help
laughing. I was still laughing when I ran off the field. Hell,
there were a lot of people I didn't want my son to be like when he
grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   The final score was 28-24, one of three squeakers the Dolphins
had to survive on the road to immortality. They nudged the Vikings
16-14 and the Buffalo Bills 24-23. The Broncos have won by margins
of 17 or more points in all but three games. Their closest calls
were against Seattle by five, the Patriots by six, and the Bengals
by seven.
</P>
<P>
   Brister hasn't made Denver fans forget John Elway, but he has
turned out to be a serviceable replacement. Just as Morrall amazed
and amused his teammates with his touchdown gallop, Brister raised
eyebrows by going 38 yards for a score on a bootleg, in the process
pulling away from a Kansas City defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be truthful,'' Bubby said, ``I turned it on because I was
scared of getting hit.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Miami met San Diego in Game 6, and in the first quarter
Bob Griese rolled out to his left, looking deep for Paul Warfield.
Ron East of the Chargers lunged for him, and cracked his helmet
against Griese's right leg just above the ankle bone. The Purdue
product did not get up. He was out for the rest of the regular
season with a broken bone.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Shula had said to him when he called the hospital,
Griese said, ``He wanted to know why I didn't see Jim Kiick, who
was open on the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob was joking, we think, or possibly preparing for his future
career as a TV analyst. But you may assume there was no
good-natured repartee in Denver when Elway suffered the bruised
ribs that would keep him out of the past four games. Rather, you
picture Shanahan reaching for his copy of the Book of Common
Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's status has been game-to-game, but the lively performance
of his understudy, Brister, has given the Broncos the luxury of
letting him heal. Elway built part of his legend by playing with
pain, a poster boy for the Throw-Away-Your-Crutch-and-Run school of
football.
</P>
<P>
   Morrall led the Dolphins as far as the championship game, a
21-17 win over the Steelers, the team's 16th victory in a row. By
the Super Bowl, Griese was recovered and Shula went back to his
starting quarterback _ a call without sentiment. The Dolphins
knocked off the Redskins 14-7 to run the table. They won them all,
17-0.
</P>
<P>
   Elway finally collected his Super Bowl ring a year ago. To
repeat is a fairly awesome task. With expansion, the Broncos will
need to win 19 wins to join or surpass the Dolphins, including _
such sweet scheduling _ the next-to-last game of the season at
Miami.

FROGS FINISH AS WINNERS
</HEADLINE>

By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ TCU coach Dennis Franchione has this rule, a simple
rule really: Gatorade baths only follow championships.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione simply smiled, though, as Horned Frogs players
drenched him as time expired in a 41-18, season-ending victory
against winless Nevada Las-Vegas yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   A championship? No.
</P>
<P>
   Something bigger? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got something back that had been lost ... winning,'' Horned
Frogs lineman Greg Davis said, his thoughts returning to last
season's 1-10 finish.
</P>
<P>
   A incredible thought on a day when 1997 seemed a million miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   By defeating UNLV (0-11, 0-8 Western Athletic Conference), a
winning season had been secured for TCU (6-5, 4-4 WAC).
</P>
<P>
   ``That may have meant as much to them as a championship to a
team who has won a championship a couple of times,'' Franchione
said.
</P>
<P>
   His first season ended with a decisive, statement-sending game.
</P>
<P>
   Allow Frogs senior linebacker Joseph Phipps to summarize:
``We're back.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a Horned Frogs team that discovered new ways to lose in
1997 and spent a good portion this season waiting until the fourth
quarter to decide games finally discovered a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   They put the hapless Rebels away early.
</P>
<P>
   TCU had opened the game with a 15-play, 75-yard touchdown drive,
capped by a 1-yard plunge from sophomore tailback LaDainian
Tomlinson.
</P>
<P>
   TCU then turned a pair of Rebels turnovers, a fumble and an
interception, into scores. UNLV took only four snaps in the opening
15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never let them play on their emotion,'' Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   There was supposed to be a lot of emotion surrounding Rebels
coach Jeff Horton's final game. Surprisingly, little existed. A
crowd of 15,441 showed up to witness the end.
</P>
<P>
   Horton had been offered a reassignment Tuesday, and his players
were hoping to send this affable and well-liked coach away with a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys played as hard as they could,'' Horton said.
</P>
<P>
   With goals of its own to fulfill, TCU simply played harder.
</P>
<P>
   There was the business of getting tailback Basil Mitchell his
1,000-yard season. He needed 109 in his final game. He got 220 and
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   There was the business of the winning season. The last one came
in 1995, and there had been only five in the past 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that I wanted was to win, but I wanted it all
to happen,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   He both reached and surpassed 1,000 yards on a 74-yard touchdown
run. It gave TCU a 35-6 lead going into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The second half couldn't seem to go by quickly enough, the
players on the TCU sideline getting antsy to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we knew sometime in the second quarter that we were
going to win,'' said sophomore cornerback Greg Walls, who had a
69-yard interception return in the second quarter for a 28-0 Frogs
lead.
</P>
<P>
   UNLV never got closer than 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left for TCU was to wait for time to expire. When
it did, Frogs players trickled toward stands behind their bench.
</P>
<P>
   A couple hundred Frogs fans were waiting there clapping.
</P>
<P>
   A few players jumped. A few players hugged. A few players
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside them stood Franchione, quietly wiping his head with a
towel. He smiled, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some rules, it seems, were meant to be broken.

BRUINS SHOW NEEDED FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Joe Thornton went toe-to-toe with Mark Tinordi 3 minutes 10
seconds into last night's Bruins-Capitals game, fans at the
FleetCenter likely thought they were seeing the main event.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be just a preliminary bout, though, in a game
won in overtime by the Bruins, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than eight minutes later, Washington's Craig
Berube slashed Don Sweeney in the corner and all hell broke loose.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney went after Berube, and they began to engage in a
wrestling match, in came Ken Belanger to level Berube against the
boards. Before you knew it, defenseman Dale Hunter was whaling away
at Peter Ferraro and Ken Klee was dueling Grant Ledyard. Belanger
and Dmitri Mironov then went from talking to fighting, which
brought in Ken Baumgartner.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who had been sent to the penalty box by linesman Brian
Murphy, jumped back into the fracas and was intercepted by Bruins
goalie Byron Dafoe. That, naturally, brought Capitals goalie Olaf
Kolzig out of his crease into the battle.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, referee Mark Faucette needed an adding
machine to tally up the penalty minutes. He doled out 124 minutes
to the Capitals, including game misconducts to Tinordi, Hunter,
Mironov, Berube, Klee, and Kolzig. The Bruins were tagged with 109
minutes, and banished with game misconducts were Baumgartner,
Sweeney, Ledyard, Belanger, Ferraro, and Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   With their goalies gone, Pat Burns and Capitals coach Ron Wilson
went to their benches for backups Rob Tallas and Rick Tabaracci and
were forced to scramble the rest of the way with patched-up lines
and defensive pairings. ``It was three-line hockey, both sides,''
said Burns. ``Our best line against their checking line. It wasn't
very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   For Belanger, obtained from the New York Islanders two weeks ago
for Ted Donato, it was the second game misconduct in two games in
which he's seen action. ``It's been a tough go,'' said Belanger,
referring not only to the ejections but also the injury he suffered
when he took a puck to the nose in practice. ``Hopefully next game
I can get a couple of periods in.''
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't regret taking a stand. ``Washington came out
right away and started playing real dirty, and we're not going to
take that stuff,'' he said. ``A game like this builds character. I
mean, you have everybody sticking up for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns also took exception to the way the Capitals played, but
said he wasn't surprised. ``They did that last night, too (against
Ottawa),'' said Burns. ``When they get down, that's their tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns was happy with the way his players reacted. ``Sticking
together was the main thing,'' he said. ``We're going to be
attacked more this year. I knew that. (Sergei) Samsonov has a
harder time now; they're going to go after him. And if we don't
have those people go out there and settle things down, that's
what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas, who had 30 saves _ including some beauties in overtime _
in his relief stint, did not relish his role. ``You're coming into
a situation where the game is going pretty good, and all of a
sudden it takes on an emotional high,'' he said. ``To jump into
that situation is tough, especially when you haven't played in such
a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's part of the game. The emotions rise, and all of a
sudden things break out. It was great to see Ken Belanger really
stick up for his teammate and go in there. That's something that we
need, and if we have to do that every night, we will.''

   BONN _ Hitler's Alpine retreat, from where he plotted the
invasion of the Soviet Union, is to become a Shangri-la for rich
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The Bavarian government Friday announced plans to build a
200-room luxury hotel and spa complex on the majestic slope of the
Obersalzberg, crowned with the mountaintop cafe formerly known as
the ``Eagle's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years the government in Munich has been looking for a
private investor to develop the precious 260-acre site, but its
searches have proved only half successful. The enterprising new
lease-holder is the semi-public Bayerische Landesbank, whose
subsidiary will be spending DM70 million on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies remain unconvinced of the Obersalzberg's
tourist potential. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the
location. On a clear day the view over the mountain ranges of
southern Bavaria and northwest Austria is magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   But the tranquility sought by the Fuhrer as he pored over battle
charts is no longer there. Despite the hotel's remoteness, guests
will find it difficult to get away from the maddening crowds,
especially of the neo-Nazi variety.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the U.S. Army moved out in 1995, the peak has been
attracting shaven-headed pilgrims, who climb the summit in search
of memories of wartime glory or Nazi memorabilia. There is a
special gathering every year on April 20, Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Obersalzberg was nothing more than Hitler's summer
residence. He received many foreign visitors there, notably Neville
Chamberlain and Benito Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   But since he hated Berlin, the Fuhrer spent as much time
communing with Alpine nature as he could. His most important aides,
including Martin Bormann, Hermann Goering and Albert Speer, had to
get chalets in the neighborhood to be close to their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Second World War was planned from the biggest chalet
of them all, the Berghof.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of the war the Berghof and most of the other
Nazi residences were destroyed by allied bombers. In 1952, the
ruins were blown up on the orders of the Bavarian government.
Hitler's guest house was taken over by the U.S. army, and used as a
resort. Three years ago, the Americans pulled out, handing the
property back to the Bavarians.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plans unveiled Friday, the guest house will be
demolished, and in its place will the new hotel be built. The
project has attracted a great deal of controversy, with one Jewish
group describing it as a ``shameful concept.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter criticism that it is insensitive to the past, the
Bavarian government is also erecting a historical documentation
center on the summit. This will focus on the rise of the Nazi party
and Hitler's reign of terror. Other sections will show Hitler's
early connections with the Alps, and the history of the mountain up
until the American retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The museum should be completed by the middle of next year. The
hotel will not be ready until 2002. &QL;

UCLA RIDES FRESHMAN TAILBACK'S FOUR TDs TO 34-17 WIN OVER(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: A game story slugged FBA-UCLA-USC will move in the ``s''
sports news file.) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. -- UCLA's football team retained its deed to
Los Angeles. Next objective: the national title.
</P>
<P>
   The unbeaten Bruins stole the ball seven times and got four
touchdowns from freshman tailback DeShaun Foster on Saturday in
defeating cross-town rival USC 34-17 before 88,080 spectators at
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA extended to eight games its win streak against USC -- an
unprecedented feat in a series that dates to 1929. At the game's
conclusion, a heavily partisan crowd taunted the Trojans with
chants of ``Eight more years!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids just respond,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said of the
Bruins. ``They know how to win. There's just a belief that we can
win every game we play.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA certainly has been doing that lately. The Bruins have won a
school-record 20 games in a row -- including 10 this year -- and
are hoping to play for the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl
in Tempe, Ariz., at season's end.

   The Bruins, ranked third in the nation by The Associated Press,
are rated No. 2 in the Bowl Championship Series, a process that
will determine the two participants for the national title. UCLA
will try to defeat Miami in a regular-season finale in two weeks
and then hope to remain ahead of Kansas State in the complicated
bowl formula.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's victory -- the most lopsided outcome in the series in a
dozen years -- was made possible by an opportunistic defense that
recovered five USC fumbles and intercepted two passes from the
Trojans' freshman quarterback, Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't at our best today on the offensive side,''
said Paul Hackett, USC's first-year coach. ``We haven't turned the
ball over all year, and then all of a sudden we have four or five
people turning it over.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA made USC (7-4) pay dearly for its clumsiness.
</P>
<P>
   Foster had three touchdown runs, one of 65 yards and two more of
1 yard each, and caught a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback
Cade McNown. His four touchdowns set a UCLA record for a true
freshman (a first-year player who has not used a redshirt season).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to contribute a little, and I'm glad I did,'' said
Foster, who rushed for 109 yards on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Other key contributors for the Bruins were safety Jason
Stephens, who recovered two fumbles, intercepted a pass and forced
a fumble; linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, who had four quarterback
sacks and forced a fumble; and cornerback Marques Anderson, who
forced two fumbles.

<P>
   BONN _ Hitler's Alpine retreat, from where he plotted the
invasion of the Soviet Union, is to become a Shangri-la for rich
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The Bavarian government Friday announced plans to build a
200-room luxury hotel and spa complex on the majestic slope of the
Obersalzberg, crowned with the mountaintop cafe formerly known as
the ``Eagle's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years the government in Munich has been looking for a
private investor to develop the precious 260-acre site, but its
searches have proved only half successful. The enterprising new
lease-holder is the semi-public Bayerische Landesbank, whose
subsidiary will be spending DM70 million on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies remain unconvinced of the Obersalzberg's
tourist potential. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the
location. On a clear day the view over the mountain ranges of
southern Bavaria and northwest Austria is magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   But the tranquility sought by the Fuhrer as he pored over battle
charts is no longer there. Despite the hotel's remoteness, guests
will find it difficult to get away from the maddening crowds,
especially of the neo-Nazi variety.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the U.S. Army moved out in 1995, the peak has been
attracting shaven-headed pilgrims, who climb the summit in search
of memories of wartime glory or Nazi memorabilia. There is a
special gathering every year on April 20, Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Obersalzberg was nothing more than Hitler's summer
residence. He received many foreign visitors there, notably Neville
Chamberlain and Benito Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   But since he hated Berlin, the Fuhrer spent as much time
communing with Alpine nature as he could. His most important aides,
including Martin Bormann, Hermann Goering and Albert Speer, had to
get chalets in the neighborhood to be close to their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Second World War was planned from the biggest chalet
of them all, the Berghof.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of the war the Berghof and most of the other
Nazi residences were destroyed by allied bombers. In 1952, the
ruins were blown up on the orders of the Bavarian government.
Hitler's guest house was taken over by the U.S. army, and used as a
resort. Three years ago, the Americans pulled out, handing the
property back to the Bavarians.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plans unveiled Friday, the guest house will be
demolished, and in its place will the new hotel be built. The
project has attracted a great deal of controversy, with one Jewish
group describing it as a ``shameful concept.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter criticism that it is insensitive to the past, the
Bavarian government is also erecting a historical documentation
center on the summit. This will focus on the rise of the Nazi party
and Hitler's reign of terror. Other sections will show Hitler's
early connections with the Alps, and the history of the mountain up
until the American retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The museum should be completed by the middle of next year. The
hotel will not be ready until 2002. &QL;

<P>
   The possibility that babies with defects might be cured inside
the womb came a step nearer Friday with the announcement that
doctors in America had successfully performed fetal surgery on a
boy with spina bifida.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Kipfmiller, now aged six months, is doing well after the
groundbreaking operation, carried out when he was a 23-week-old
fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the treatment will bring hope to other parents
whose babies are shown to have defects during screening early in
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first operation on a fetus was carried out at Guy's
Hospital in London five years ago, when surgeons used a fine needle
to clear a blockage in the heart. A handful of similar operations
has been carried out in Britain since but much of the experimental
work is now conducted in America.
</P>
<P>
   The operation on Noah was much more complex, involving closing
the spine in the middle of the back where the skin and bone had
failed to form, leaving the spinal cord exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Spinal bifida is a congenital defect that varies in severity and
children born with it may be paralyzed and suffer hydrocephalus
(water on the brain), which can cause brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Scott Adzick, the surgeon who led the research team at
the Children's Hospital, Philadelphia, said the child's mother,
aged 27, and father had refused the offer of an abortion. ``They
were going to take care of the child either way so they decided to
give the baby the best possible chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The operation involved lifting the mother's womb through an
incision in her abdomen, and opening it so that the baby's back was
exposed. Skin taken from its back was grafted over the exposed
spinal cord to protect it and a drainage tube fitted to remove
fluid accumulating in the skull.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons then replaced the amniotic fluid with a solution,
put the womb back and sewed up the woman's abdomen. The baby was
born seven weeks later by Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   It is still too early to gauge whether the boy will have a limp
but he has been spared the worst effects of the condition. He has a
slight abnormality in his left foot and a right club foot, which
can be treated.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Adzick, who describes the case in The Lancet, said:
``He is a very nice baby. The orthopedic specialists are looking
after him and he has an exercise program. We are pleased with the
way he is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Adzick has previously operated on a fetus who was
found to have a benign tumor growing in his chest that threatened
to obstruct the normal development of his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to correcting birth defects that would cause
paralysis or death if left until after birth, fetal surgery offers
other potential benefits. Incisions heal without scarring and
researchers believe transplants carried out while the immune system
is still immature may overcome the problem of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   However, the developments raise acute ethical difficulties.
Transplants would involve using organs from aborted fetuses, which
might have to be kept alive until the organs were at the right
stage of development to make them suitable for transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Public disquiet at the prospect of ``farmed fetuses'' makes the
introduction of such transplants unlikely. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ Here is the joke going the rounds of the French National
Assembly. ``Q: How can you tell that Daniel Cohn-Bendit is German?
A: He invades France every 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny the Red is back, and this time he is Green.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after leading the French student revolt of May
1968, Cohn-Bendit has become a mainstream French politician, even
though he is not French. He will head the list of the main French
Green party, Les Verts, in the European Parliament elections next
June.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the born troublemaker, the
eternal boy, has become almost the first truly European politician,
able to operate successfully in two EU countries.
</P>
<P>
   He sits at present in the European Parliament as a member of the
German green party, the Grunen. His close friend and one-time
revolutionary disciple, Joschka Fischer, is foreign minister in the
pink-green coalition running Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit, 53, cannot claim to be the first pan-European
politician because there is one rather perverse precedent. The late
Sir James Goldsmith bankrolled two viscerally anti-European
political movements and stood for election in both Britain and
France. How successful he was is a matter of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   How successful will Cohn-Bendit be? Judging by his first week in
the job, very successful, very entertaining _ and very destructive.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a few days, the youthful revolutionary turned
middle-aged European federalist and ecologist has caused huge
problems within the pink-red-green coalition running France.
</P>
<P>
   He has infuriated the Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin,
by throwing salt in the wound of the one issue most calculated to
divide the French left: illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit called in his acceptance speech before the Green
conference for all illegal immigrants to be legalized. Worse, he
said that such a grand gesture would help Jospin win the
presidential election in 2002, another taboo subject for the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, annoy the prime minister? Nooooo,'' Cohn-Bendit said
afterwards, opening wide his big boyish, mischievous blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   As energetic, eloquent and hirsute as ever, he has also
infuriated the Communists, who remember the embarrassment he caused
them in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit has set a target of making the Greens the second
party of the French left, overtaking the ``fuddy-duddy'' Parti
Communiste. He tried to soothe the Communists last week by
describing their dull, gnome-like leader, Robert Hue, as
``obviously not a Stalinist.'' Somehow this did not help.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit is also far from universally loved within the French
green movement. There is residual jealousy that such a ``German
cuckoo,'' as one green activist described him, should take the top
place on their European election list, pontificating about ``my
ideas'' rather than ``our ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel claims a ``double identity.'' He is German, but feels
French. His parents fled Nazi Germany in 1933, and he was born at
Montauban, just north of Toulouse in the French southwest.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, to his great grief at the time, returned to Germany
in 1957, when he was 12. He insisted on returning to France to
study when he left school, with consequences which briefly shook
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit was expelled from France after the events of May
1968. He became a German revolutionary, a kindergarten teacher,
then a local politician in Frankfurt in the 1980s before emerging
as a green and extreme European federalist in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He is able to run for election in France because the Maastricht
treaty allows any EU citizen to stand in any EU country in European
or local elections.
</P>
<P>
   He remains an engaging, playful figure, capable of generating
great emotion, but also mocking himself. Until his return to
France, he played football in a Frankfurt park with his friends
every Sunday, wearing a shirt carrying the number 68.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit now describes his revolutionary ideas of the 1960s
as a mistake. He emigrated late, following many left-wingers of his
generation, into the ecological movement. But he was always
regarded as an awkwardly internationalist figure by the
inward-looking German greens. He argued for German military action
against the Serbs in Bosnia, and for wholesale support of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
   His present position is an unusual mixture of European
federalism, standard leftism and libertarianism: in favor of much
greater power for Brussels; against nuclear energy; in favor of
more government intervention to create jobs; for the legalization
of soft drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Such views cut a jagged line across the Socialist, Radical,
Communist and Green coalition which has been governing France, with
remarkably few family rows, since last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists are skeptical on Europe and keen on nuclear
power; the radicals are anti-Europe and tough on immigration. The
Socialists are pro-European but cautious on immigration and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin is struggling to keep all these factions talking from one
bland script. But Cohn-Bendit famously refuses all scripts, and
talks off the cuff.
</P>
<P>
   He is threatening to take on all the other parties _ including
the Greens' Socialist and Communist allies _ by travelling around
making speeches in the political fiefdoms of the party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He says he intends to break away from the normal dreary
exchanges about federalism versus nationalism, the failings of the
Brussels bureaucracy and the dangers of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
   He intends to purvey ``une idee jouissive de l'Europe.'' This
means, strictly speaking, a ``joyous concept of Europe'' but could
also be translated ``an orgasmic sense of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in the space of a few days, to Jospin's great
alarm, Daniel Cohn-Bendit has achieved the impossible. He has made
the European Parliament elections interesting. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The good news about ``Aerobics with an Attitude,'' a
popular workout class offered by Crunch, a gym with several
branches in New York City, is that only the trainer is expected to
get into character. The rest of us, thankfully, were just fine in
T-shirts, shorts and trainers.
</P>
<P>
   But our teacher, Anthony Truly, once a dancer with the Tennessee
Ballet, is expected to dress up _ and how.
</P>
<P>
   As 16 of us waited for the music to start pumping to kick off
our class, Truly was prepping himself in the workout studio's
wall-to-wall mirror. He smeared on a last layer of lipstick,
adjusted his long black wig and tied his leopard-spot chiffon scarf
just so.
</P>
<P>
   At the dot of 6 o'clock, he is ready. The remainder of his
costume consists of squeaky-tight spandex shorts, fishnet stockings
and a pair of preposterous platform plimsolls that give him at
least another five inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this my beauty routine,'' he declares. ``Well,
darlings, watch me: because I am THIN!''
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a 60-minute sampling of an aerobics course that
has become one of the most talked-about in the city. It is an
invigorating and muscle-shredding experience that offers
participants both the opportunity to sweat off some unwanted
calories and to enter, if only for an hour, the bitchy, man-hating
(and, of course, man-worshipping) world of the New York drag queen.
</P>
<P>
   Truly's lessons _ he teaches another class called ``Abs, Thighs
and Gossip'' _ are examples of a series of fantasy aerobics
routines on offer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They are proliferating across the U.S. as gyms struggle to find
gimmicks to compete for members in an industry that, while it
exploded in the past decade, is showing signs of flattening out.
</P>
<P>
   The choices in Manhattan get dottier by the week. At the New
York Sports Clubs chain there are classes taught by a former
American football player who gets his students working on
exhausting patterns of dodges and tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, you can find a ballet-themed class taught by a dancer
with the New York City Ballet and _ for those who really feel the
need to suffer _ a ``boot camp'' class led with a touch of sadism
by a former U.S. Marine.
</P>
<P>
   Most eccentric, perhaps, are the fireman workouts at Crunch,
taken by Eric Torres, a real-life fireman. Classes begin with a
tape of an emergency telephone call and the crackle and hiss of the
dispatcher sending out the engines.
</P>
<P>
   Red lights flash and Torres orders his class to heft bundles of
fire hose _ the real thing, weighing up to 25 lb. _ and begin
stepping as if they are rushing up 80 flights.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy workouts are an attempt by gyms to keep their members
from getting bored _ and going elsewhere, to their sofas or to
competitors. With more and more gyms entering the market,
maintaining membership is a constant battle. On average, a gym will
lose a third of its members each year.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle comes against a backdrop of disappointing growth.
According to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub
Association, fewer than 10 percent of Americans belong to gyms. In
New York, the figure is 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gyms are beginning to understand that if someone has been
exercising for a few years, they want to keep their workouts
invigorating and experience something new,'' says Maeve McCaffrey
of the IHRSA. ``Now they have these choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men who may feel a bit awkward in the ballet class, who might
worry that their feet will never keep up, are going to feel more
comfortable with the firefighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Truly himself is not exactly modest about his classes, which are
also broadcast weekly on the ESPN sports cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people want me,'' he vamps. ``They depend on Truly, they
live vicariously through her, because they see she's so
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the only two other men joining me in Truly's class the other
evening, one, Juan Fortino, who is a singer, is a loyal regular.
``I like it, because he has no fears about his own body,'' Fortino
enthuses. ``He is totally without inhibitions and that helps me
feel more comfortable with my body.''
</P>
<P>
   This reporter would like to be able to say the same. &QL;

   An Internet site is advising childless couples to take advantage
of $500 ``embryo adoption'' procedures as a money-saving
alternative to other fertility treatments. The advice has been
denounced as ``scandalous'' by one of the world's leading fertility
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Macnamee, director of operations at Bourn Hall in
Cambridge, England, where Louise Brown, the first test-tube baby,
was conceived, said such entreaties ``exploited the devastating
emotions which surround infertility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky-based website, ``Conceiving Concepts,'' tells
prospective parents that embryo adoption is a ``lower cost'' option
than in vitro fertilization treatment and ``comes with little or no
paper- or legal work.''
</P>
<P>
   British couples wishing to follow the advice would probably need
to travel to the United States to obtain a ``cheap'' embryo, as it
is unlawful to import embryos into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Embryo adoption is the term used when a couple who are both
infertile receive a spare frozen embryo created by another couple
during their own in vitro fertilization. The biological parents
have to give their permission for their embryo to be used in this
way.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Watson, a fertility consultant who runs Conceiving
Concepts, does not organize embryo adoption herself but gives
couples information on where to go for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost can range from $500-$1,500 per cycle,'' she said.
``It usually has a 10-15 percent success rate. I'm not involved in
doing embryo adoption myself. I am just giving information about
what embryo adoption is and how to go about getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, embryo adoption is tightly regulated. Various
centers such as Bourn Hall, the Midlands Fertility Services and the
Centre for Assisted Reproduction at Park Hospital, Nottingham,
carry out the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Macnamee said Bourn Hall's success rate was the world's best
but treatment costs are expensive at his clinic and he could only
think that such low prices meant clinics were offering to sell
embryos rather than including the price of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible to treat someone for $500... It is a
scandalous trade in gametes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority
said that, at present, embryo adoption was not widespread. However,
the authority could not prevent people going abroad for treatment. &QL;

IT'S OFFICIAL: THE FRENCH DO NOT WASH

   PARIS _ It is official. The French do not wash.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one in two French people take a bath or shower every
day; the French buy less than half as much toilet soap as the
Germans and the British.
</P>
<P>
   This statistical manna to Francophobes everywhere is provided by
a series of studies carried out by the French government and
perfume and health industries.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures should, perhaps, be taken with a pinch of bath
salts. Personal experience on crowded Metro and Tube trains in
recent years suggests that the British smell more often, and worse,
than the French.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, that discrepancy can be explained by another
statistic. Although the French do not wash very much, they are
Europe's biggest consumers of perfume and deodorants.
</P>
<P>
   According to a synthesis of opinion polls and surveys published
Friday in Le Figaro, only 47 percent of French people take a shower
or bath every day, compared to 70 percent of Britons and 80 percent
of the fanatically clean Dutch, Germans and Scandinavians.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Italians wash more than the French, it seems. (The
cleanliness of the Spanish, Portuguese and Greeks is best
discreetly passed over.)
</P>
<P>
   The statistics are reinforced by a sad comment by a
near-anonymous French doctor (Dr. J.-F. H. of Saint Cloud). ``For
many of us (French doctors),'' he said, ``the deodorant spray is a
tool of the trade at least as important as the stethoscope.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. H., practicing in one of the wealthiest Paris suburbs,
complained that he dealt with unwashed bodies and dirty
underclothes every day of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Edouard Zarifian, an eminent French medical psychologist,
explained the phenomenon this way. For the French, he said,
``eating and drinking are natural functions. Washing is not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the northern European countries and the United States, he
said, washing had long been associated with hygiene in the mind of
the public. In France and other Latin countries, it never had. Even
French doctors, he said, were very lax about washing their hands
after examining patients.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics gathered by Le Figaro suggest that the French buy
very little soap: 600 grams a year each, compared to 1,300 grams
for each German and a sparkling 1,400 grams for each Briton.
</P>
<P>
   However, these figures are for toilet soap only. They fail to
take account of the thrifty French habit of buying blocks of cheap,
kitchen soap to place in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of such evil-smelling soap are ten time higher in France.
Small wonder the French do not wash. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The phone rings, but nobody is there. Or rather, nobody human.
``A call is coming through for you,'' says a computer voice.
``Please don't hang up.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice sounds at once authoritative and almost comical:
evidently, the call has come through at such lightning velocity
that even the person who dialed the number is a few seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pause. A long pause. ``Please stay on the line,'' the
computer voice resumes. ``An agent will be with you shortly.'' An
agent? All of a sudden this doesn't sound so promising.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a seemingly innocent incoming business call
is threatening to turn into a clammy encounter with some
salesperson trying to flog household insurance or dental floss.
</P>
<P>
   There is a further pause. Finally, the computer voice announces:
``We are sorry, but all of our agents are unavailable.'' And the
line goes dead.
</P>
<P>
   No explanations. No chance to find out who inflicted this
infuriating tease on an unsuspecting telephone subscriber. Not even
an opportunity, as the law theoretically demands, to tell the
organization in question never to make such a call again, ever.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the hazards of telecommunication in modern-day America,
a place where computers are gradually taking over from human beings
and the poor human being, increasingly, is being given no right of
reply.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now _ and not just in America _ the phone user
has been confronted with a dizzying range of mechanized responses,
from home answering machines to voice mail to answering services.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who calls the switchboard of a medium-to-large
organization can expect to be talked through an often bewildering
range of options without ever encountering a live human voice.
(``For a full schedule of post-cosmetic surgery therapy classes,
press 5; to find out more about our rhinoplasty techniques teaching
seminar, press 8; to hear a review of these and other options,
press...'').
</P>
<P>
   In a country quaintly attached to the use of letters as well as
numbers on the telephone dialpad, the services of a receptionist
are rapidly being discarded in favor of recorded messages such as:
``If you know the name of the person you are calling, please dial
the first three letters of their name now.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are calling the company for the first time and don't have
any particular name at hand, all you can do is howl with
frustration or wait in the ever vainer hope that the computer will
eventually shut up to be replaced, as the jargon has it, by a
representative who will assist you shortly.

bottom of her list, like a computer reading out all the options

   Telephone communication in America may be getting faster and
slicker, but old honest to goodness human contact seems to be going
seriously out of fashion. &QL;

<P>
   The phone rings, but nobody is there. Or rather, nobody human.
``A call is coming through for you,'' says a computer voice.
``Please don't hang up.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice sounds at once authoritative and almost comical:
evidently, the call has come through at such lightning velocity
that even the person who dialed the number is a few seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pause. A long pause. ``Please stay on the line,'' the
computer voice resumes. ``An agent will be with you shortly.'' An
agent? All of a sudden this doesn't sound so promising.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a seemingly innocent incoming business call
is threatening to turn into a clammy encounter with some
salesperson trying to flog household insurance or dental floss.
</P>
<P>
   There is a further pause. Finally, the computer voice announces:
``We are sorry, but all of our agents are unavailable.'' And the
line goes dead.
</P>
<P>
   No explanations. No chance to find out who inflicted this
infuriating tease on an unsuspecting telephone subscriber. Not even
an opportunity, as the law theoretically demands, to tell the
organization in question never to make such a call again, ever.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the hazards of telecommunication in modern-day America,
a place where computers are gradually taking over from human beings
and the poor human being, increasingly, is being given no right of
reply.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now _ and not just in America _ the phone user
has been confronted with a dizzying range of mechanized responses,
from home answering machines to voice mail to answering services.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who calls the switchboard of a medium-to-large
organization can expect to be talked through an often bewildering
range of options without ever encountering a live human voice.
(``For a full schedule of post-cosmetic surgery therapy classes,
press 5; to find out more about our rhinoplasty techniques teaching
seminar, press 8; to hear a review of these and other options,
press...'').
</P>
<P>
   In a country quaintly attached to the use of letters as well as
numbers on the telephone dialpad, the services of a receptionist
are rapidly being discarded in favor of recorded messages such as:
``If you know the name of the person you are calling, please dial
the first three letters of their name now.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are calling the company for the first time and don't have
any particular name at hand, all you can do is howl with
frustration or wait in the ever vainer hope that the computer will
eventually shut up to be replaced, as the jargon has it, by a
representative who will assist you shortly.
</P>
<P>
   These experiences are alienating enough, but the new trend in
U.S. telephony goes even further. Computers not only receive phone
calls; they make them, too.

UCLA BEATS USC AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ The fates and metaphysics that govern the USC-UCLA
rivalry conspired Saturday to once again create legend from flesh,
tapping an unassuming UCLA freshman tailback as the man of the
moment and, perhaps, a player for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   But as kickoff approached, DeShaun Foster was a cauldron of
emotion and pain.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he was facing high school nemesis Carson Palmer,
the USC quarterback who had defeated Foster in three prep
showdowns. For another, Foster had spent part of Friday at the UCLA
Medical Center battling strep throat, and he slept just a few hours
that night, tossing and turning as the pain persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Foster took a painkiller and felt better before the game, but it
did not numb a bitterness that had lingered since his junior year
at Tustin High School, when USC recruited him... as a defensive
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bothered me,'' he said. ``I wanted to prove to them I'm a
tailback.''
</P>
<P>
   Case closed.
</P>
<P>
   Six years to the day walk-on quarterback John Barnes torched the
Trojans for 385 yards, Foster entered city series lore himself _
rushing for 109 yards and scoring all four UCLA touchdowns in a
34-17 victory before 88,080 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeShaun is an amazing player,'' UCLA offensive tackle Kris
Farris said. ``He can be so dominant it's unbelievable. He brings
so much to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's performance _ combined with a stingy and opportunistic
defense _ fueled the Bruins' eighth consecutive victory over USC
and their 20th straight overall, two shy of Washington's Pac-10
record set in 1990-92.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11-round, single-elimination tournament that defines
their national championship charge, the Bruins (10-0, 8-0) have
reached the final challenge: a Dec. 5 showdown at Miami, with a
potential berth in the Fiesta Bowl at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``All year, everyone said that the other teams should beat us,
but nobody has,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``I'm proud of
where we've been, what we've done, and where we're going.''
</P>
<P>
   For USC, it wasn't so much a bitter defeat as a bungled
afternoon. The Trojans (7-4, 5-3) failed to stop UCLA's running
game and committed a season-high seven turnovers. Four of USC's
eight first-half possessions ended with fumbles. Some were caused,
some weren't, but they were all important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you play a team of UCLA's caliber, you can't turn the
ball over, which is what we did on every play,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``You have to give UCLA credit. They did a nice
job.... We were not at our best today, and the score shows (it).''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA rushed for 227 yards Saturday and has now gained 1,527
during its eight-game dominance of USC. Foster accounted for 65 on
one play, blazing through a seam on the left side for a touchdown
that gave the Bruins a 21-10 lead early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was phenomenal,'' Toledo said. ``I took him aside and told
him every player who's sick plays great. Remember Michael Jordan?''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans won't soon forget Foster, who chose UCLA over Texas
and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't recruit him _ that's what I know about him,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Because USC never threatened in the second half, the game was
devoid of the big plays, massive momentum shifts and fabulous
finishes that have defined recent encounters. It was, simply, UCLA
doing what it does best: pounding its opponent at the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game plan was to run at them,'' Farris said. ``We read
that (USC linebacker Chris) Claiborne was complaining that nobody
was running at him all year. Well, we were going to run at him _
straight at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Foster's head, the UCLA locker room was a vortex of
emotion. It lacked the elation that usually accompanies a victory
over USC, as the Bruins quickly turned their gaze to Thanksgiving
break and the Hurricane Bowl beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Not a minute elapsed without someone mentioning Foster or the
defense. Much-maligned three weeks ago, it has saved its best for
the stretch, stuffing Washington last week and containing the
Trojans on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   USC totaled 387 yards but did not complete a pass longer than 23
yards, as Bruins cornerbacks Jason Bell, Marques Anderson and Ryan
Roques tackled soundly and covered superbly. Linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo played his best game, with nine tackles and four sacks,
and seven players took turns causing or corralling USC turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they'd play us a lot tougher than they did,''
Ayanbadejo said.
</P>
<P>
   The final ingredient to UCLA's postgame persona was vengeance a
month in the making. When Hackett called Oregon the ``best team in
the Pac-10'' and Claiborne said ``UCLA wishes it had our defense,''
the Bruins kept quiet and locked the comments away.
</P>
<P>
   At high noon Saturday, they reappeared in the form of a
five-minute highlight film. The comments were plastered across the
screen with a disparaging audio clip from Hackett, plus replays
from the seven-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   A week of crisp, unemotional practices had ended with a cascade
of adrenaline and anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to think about it too much when you hear it, so
you store it in your brain,'' defensive end Pete Holland said. ``We
let it simmer and then released the anger today. They didn't show
us much respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to go 8-0 in the conference, and we've done that.
Now, we go on to our second goal, and that's to finish
undefeated.''

ALLISON LIFTS BRUINS IN OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad blood began last spring during a contentious first-round
playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins lost that battle and haven't forgotten it. The
Capitals won and eventually went on to the Stanley Cup finals, but
they're as known for their trench warfare as for scoring goals.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, it came to a head at 11:42 of the first period
when 12 players, including both starting goalies, were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins went on to win the game, 5-4, with Jason Allison
scoring his second goal of the game with 30.2 seconds remaining in
overtime. Washington had forced the extra period by rallying from
deficits of 3-0, 3-2, and 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   For Boston, which is 3-1-3 in its last seven games, Dmitri
Khristich had one goal and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden couldn't believe
his eyes as he saw the parade to the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if it happened again?'' said Sinden. ``We've got over
17,000 people here. (What would you say:) `Now the game is over,
everybody go home; get out of here because we have no players'?
Jesus Christ, is there common sense involved here or what? I'm not
saying they didn't do it by the rules, but logic or common sense
has to prevail somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   What option did referee Mark Faucette have? ``What he can do is
say, `I'm not going to go by the rules; I've got to run a game
here,' and then face his superiors later,'' said Sinden. ``In other
words, they're the rules, but if I'm going to take everybody out of
the game, everybody is going to go home. You have to say, `What
about the fans?' That's the way I think it should be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the front-office man, Sinden did see one potential silver
lining: ``You know what it does? It shows us we can play with 13
players, and our payroll will (go right down).''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden would have preferred to see Faucette throw out two
players from each club and call it even. As it turned out, Ken
Baumgartner, Ken Belanger (who has been tossed out of his only two
games with the Bruins in the first period), Peter Ferraro, Grant
Ledyard, Don Sweeney, and Byron Dafoe all were tossed for Boston,
while the Capitals lost Ken Klee, Mark Tinordi, Dale Hunter, Dmitri
Mironov, Craig Berube, and goalie Olaf Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   The total: 238 minutes in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had a 2-0 lead at the time on power-play goals by
defenseman Darren Van Impe and Khristich at 2:22 and 7:30,
respectively. After all the chaos died down, Allison made it 3-0 at
15:49.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Simon pulled the Capitals to within a goal at 4:53 of the
second, and Peter Bondra's shorthanded strike at 12:50 closed the
gap to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Anson Carter gave Boston some breathing room at 1:59 of the
third, but Washington defenseman Brendan Witt scored at 8:57 and
forward Steve Konowalchuk tied it at 14:20, setting the stage for
Allison's heroics.
</P>
<P>
   One subplot to the game was coach Pat Burns and Capitals
counterpart Ron Wilson exchanging sign language. Burns later said
he was irritated by Washington's tendency toward cheap shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did that (Friday), too; they finished the game with
Hunter, Berube, Tinordi, and Simon against Ottawa,'' said Burns.
``When they get down, that's their tactic. That's what I was upset
about. Any time someone gets ahead on them, it's hang on because
here they come. But we fought back and we won in overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns expected the rough stuff from Washington. ``I could feel
it coming when we took the lead,'' he said, ``and fortunately we
had the proper people out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset at (Wilson's) gestures, too. They've got 30 seconds
to go against Ottawa, they're losing, 4-1, and they've got Hunter
on the ice, Berube, Simon, and Tinordi on the power play? Give me a
break. They did that to us in the playoffs last year, too. I just
said, `You've got the muscle there; of course you're going to do
that.' It's something that goes back to the playoffs last year.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's likely to continue. Mark your calendar for Dec. 28, the
teams' next meeting, at the MCI Center.

USC DEVASTATED BY TURNOVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ USC wide receiver R. Jay Soward spent Saturday
morning running through a hotel ballroom as a final road test for
his badly sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to sleep not knowing if I would play,'' Soward said.
``It was a miracle this morning I was able to run.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the last good fortune USC would experience the
remainder of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Five fumbles and two interceptions later, the dazed Trojans were
trying to find an explanation for their mistake-prone 34-17 loss to
UCLA before 88,080 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There were no scapegoats for USC's eighth straight loss to UCLA.
Check that. Maybe you could collectively blame the five different
players who experienced fumbleitis, although they just happened to
be most of the best offensive players on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Soward, Carson Palmer, Larry Parker, Chad Morton and Antoine
Harris all coughed up the ball, most in critical situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really sickening to watch them unfold, even mine,''
Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Was it impossible to explain how a team that had lost 10 fumbles
all season gave up five in one day? Not really, if you were
expending every ounce of energy on defense because your
butter-fingered offense kept forcing you back onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we don't know how to take care of the ball,''
linebacker Chris Claiborne said. ``It was no jinx or anything. It's
basic fundamental football. Five fumbles? God. It's kind of
degrading at times. The score doesn't depict how we played.''
</P>
<P>
   If Claiborne was disgusted, imagine how some of the culprits
felt. Parker had just caught an 18-yard pass in the second quarter
when he was hit by UCLA's Marques Anderson and promptly dropped the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just being careless. Not taking care of the ball,''
Parker said. ``I got careless myself and it just got loose from
me.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the type of game that will keep an detail-freak like USC
coach Paul Hackett up all night searching for an answer. He scanned
his memory before he even walked off the field Saturday, wondering
if was possible to explain such a dismal performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot ourselves in the foot,'' Hackett said. ``I tried to go
through them in my mind. Five different guys. Our own mistakes, our
own errors. It's not one person. We have not fumbled all year. We
have not thrown interceptions. Oregon did the same thing against
them, so you cannot say it was not UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever was to blame, it wasn't easy for the Trojans to swallow.
It just might have been the most embarrassing loss of the year,
because of the fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turnovers killed us,'' offensive lineman Travis Claridge said.
``I've been here three years and I've never seen that many
turnovers in a game. Not even in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the fumbles, the Trojans had some other issues to
deal with, like Soward.
</P>
<P>
   He said his ankle was 90 percent fit Saturday, then wondered why
he didn't play for nearly 21 minutes in the first half after his
early fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I didn't come back,'' Soward said. ``Which I
didn't think was very fair at all. I did what I could do. Honestly,
I thought I could have had more opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward finished with three receptions for 22 yards, far fewer
than the 441 yards he compiled in his first two USC-UCLA games.
</P>
<P>
   But his teammates found it hard to believe he was even 90
percent healthy for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the same receiver. He didn't have the same
explosion,'' Palmer said. ``R. Jay wasn't R. Jay today.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither were the Trojans. They didn't feel the heartache of a
close loss to UCLA, like in '97, or a blown lead, like in '96, but
they weren't feeling any better about the eighth loss in a row to
their crosstown rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just put the ball on the ground and they won,'' Soward
said. ``Every loss is a hard loss. I'm not a loser, man. Just to
come here with the luck I have had is kind of hard.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Soward has the option of returning for one more season
for a final crack at the Bruins. Some of his teammates weren't so
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one's really tough. I'm a senior,'' Parker said. ``I walk
away from this game thinking if we had done this or that, we would
have beaten them.''

TCU RALLIES FOR `UGLY' VICTORY AGAINST UTEP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Back when Lee Nailon was deciding whether to
enter the NBA draft, TCU coach Billy Tubbs wondered what it would
be like to play without the All-American center.
</P>
<P>
   He got an extended look last night. The conclusion: The Horned
Frogs can be thankful the big guy stayed in school.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon battled foul problems all night, playing a season-low 16
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Frogs struggled before rallying in the final
minutes for a 75-70 victory against the UT-El Paso Miners at Don
Haskins Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty ugly, but we'll take it as a victory,'' said TCU
guard Prince Fowler, who clinched it by making three of four free
throws in the final four seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs improved to 4-1, while UTEP dropped to 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs was also glad to leave El Paso with a hard-earned victory,
considering that his best player spent more time on the bench than
he did on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of our team,'' he said. ``That was a heck of
a win, considering our first-line players weren't allowed to play.
I think the people of El Paso would have enjoyed seeing Lee Nailon
play.''
</P>
<P>
   They did see Nailon score six of his 11 points _ 10 less than
his average _ after re-entering the game with 8:33 remaining to
help rally the Frogs from a 58-56 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back and scored some nice baskets,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't nearly enough to win the game. The Frogs needed
offense from somewhere else, and they got it from an unlikely
source.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom-used forward Shannon Long scored 13 points, including
seven in the final eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shannon Long did just a super job for us,'' Tubbs said. ``He
was a turning point in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Long, a transfer from Connors State Junior College in Oklahoma,
averaged a little more than four minutes in playing in three of the
first four games. He had missed the only shot he attempted.
</P>
<P>
   But last night, he made all four of his shots from the field and
five of eight free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to have a breakthrough game sometime,'' he
said. ``I wasn't looking to shoot, but my man was slow on his
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs needed every one of Long's points, because they didn't
get them from the usual sources.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Carroll did it in the first half, when he scored 12 points,
but he also battled foul problems in the second half. He finished
with a team-high 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler didn't battle foul trouble. His problem was putting the
ball in the basket. He made just two of his 15 shots, including
1-of-11 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Marquise Gainous, the Frogs' second-leading scorer with 15.5
points per game, made 3-of-9 shots and finished with 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Long, though, came through. So did backup guard Michael Causey,
who played a steady 22 minutes and was on the floor down the
stretch, and Jon Day, who contributed nine solid minutes in the
middle when Nailon was on the bench in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of this team,'' Tubbs said. ``We run a lot of
players in there, and our bench did an outstanding job.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to beat the pesky Miners.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, though, playing without Nailon isn't something the
Frogs want to make a habit of.

HULL-LESS STARS SETTLE FOR TIE WITH BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Brett Hull did the one thing that would draw the ire
of all 20,294 fans at the Kiel Center last night _ he didn't show
up.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who averaged 51 goals a season for 10 years with the
Blues, was scheduled to make his first regular-season appearance in
St. Louis since signing with the Stars as a free agent in the
summer, but was held in Texas after suffering a bruised kidney
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   That was a huge disappointment to the largest crowd the Kiel
Center has seen this season _ a group who bought tickets early to
either cheer or jeer one of the city's favorite sons. But the loud
boos that rained from the rafters when it was announced Hull would
not play turned to bellowing cheers when the Blues scored twice in
the third period to tie the Stars, 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hockey game was going to go on whether Brett was here or
not,'' said a satisfied Kelly Chase, who helped the comeback with a
hard-working shift that resulted in the second goal of the game for
the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Blues coach Joel Quenneville said the game felt like a victory.
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock was just as definitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't match their speed and tenacity, you get beat. And
that's exactly what happened,'' said Hitchcock, before remembering
this was actually a tie. ``This might be a \Rstandings\S point, but
it felt like a loss, especially when you give up a 3-0 lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars moved to 10-3-3, good for 23 points and one of the
best records in the NHL. However, they have given up third-period
leads to get saddled with ties three times, and also have lost once
after leading in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play with the lead, you have to play with patience,
and I don't think we've been doing that this year,'' center Guy
Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Chase helped set up a goal by Blues center Mike Eastwood when he
outhustled the Stars to a loose puck. That came at the 4-minute,
17-second mark of the third period, and Pierre Turgeon then tied
the game three minutes later, chasing starting goalie Roman Turek.
Ed Belfour held on through 10 shots in the final 18 minutes to
secure the tie.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Marshall, who finished with a goal and an assist, had a
chance to win in overtime after stealing an Al MacInnis pass and
breaking in on Blues backup goalie Rich Parent. However, Marshall's
shot went off the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had him beat, but woulda, shoulda, coulda, it didn't go
in,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars scored twice on the power play _ Mike Modano's fifth
goal and Jamie Langenbrunner's third _ but were outshot 34-18 for
the game, despite getting eight chances with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars registered three shots in the final 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Stars exited unhappy and the Blues (7-5-5) said they
were excited about the point, but disappointed with not seeing
Hull. Fans in St. Louis will have to wait until April 3, when the
Stars are scheduled to make their only other visit to the Kiel
Center this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was anxious to come here, so it's too bad for him,''
Carbonneau said of Hull, who was resting in Texas and is listed as
day-to-day. ``I think he's just got to recover right now and be
healthy. That's what's most important.''

PATRIOTS' PLAN HITS HOME FOR OWNER JONES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Foxboro Stadium, the parking lot is such a mess, fans build
fires in the potholes and use them for tailgate parties.
</P>
<P>
   The drive from Boston also means a long, teeth-grinding crawl
along Highway 1 _ two lanes, two bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners have traveled that same road before, some
figuratively as well as literally.
</P>
<P>
   So, make no mistake. If New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft
ever puts last week's announcement about moving to a new stadium in
Hartford, Conn., to a league-wide vote, it will be a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stadium is inept today,'' one owner said, ``and all you
have to do is project four or five years into the future to see
that it will really be behind the times.''
</P>
<P>
   That owner: Jerry Jones, who clearly has stadium issues of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   The King of the Cowboys thinks that in five years his franchise
could be in the same boat, roosted in a stadium that will hinder
his team's ability to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competitive today,'' Jones said of Texas Stadium. ``Not
competitive five years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' case is intriguing. Kraft, a native of Boston and
graduate of Harvard Business School, purchased the team in 1994 for
$170 million, saying he didn't want the franchise to fall prey to
buyers who might move it elsewhere. He became the Patriots' fourth
owner in six years.
</P>
<P>
   As early as a year before the sale, NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue had called Foxboro Stadium ``an unacceptable venue for
the long-term future of the New England Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kraft bought the team, anyway. He then turned to
Massachusetts legislators to help him build the Patriots a new
home.
</P>
<P>
   They just did, in a manner of speaking.
</P>
<P>
   The state's speaker of the House, Thomas M. Finneran, has
blocked every attempt by Kraft to find funding for a new football
stadium. Two days before the Hartford announcement, Finneran told
the ``Salem Evening News,'' ``I'm going to give tax breaks to some
fat-\Rrump\S millionaire and \Rcheat\S our kids?''
</P>
<P>
   The same attitude, in part, is why Owner Jones sits here today,
rebuked by voters, having to play the Seattle Seahawks with that
lousy hole still in the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Will Texas Stadium, as Jones suggests, be a competitive burden
five years from now? Jones already has the sweetest stadium deal in
sports. But that doesn't matter _ owners decide if and when they
want new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Jones envisions a 100,000-seat Texas Stadium with a retractable
roof, a theme park in the parking lot, Super Bowls every five or so
years and more luxury suites than Sodom and Gomorrah combined.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, he would like the city of Irving to pay for it. The
cost? Some estimates have said $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but even at that high of a price tag, if Jones' team had
behaved itself a few years ago, a funding plan might be in place
for the stadium renovation. The negative publicity engendered by
Barry Switzer and Michael Irvin, to name two, might not have
scuttled Owner Jones' original scheme, but it couldn't have helped.
</P>
<P>
   Jones spent a reported $800,000 in a grand bid to get Irving to
withdraw from Dallas Area Regional Transit, reasoning the money
would be better spent on upgrading Texas Stadium. The referendum
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jones has turned his hopes to the 1997 state bill that
awarded municipalities the right to impose additional, nonsales
taxes to fund stadium and arena projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic it can be done,'' Jones said yesterday.
``Irving is very progressive, and we've got some things in place
now that can help us get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones talked about a ``three-pronged participation'' on the part
of the city, the Cowboys and the paying customers to provide the
funding. The NFL, it should be noted, has set a ceiling of $55
million on any debts that a club may assume.
</P>
<P>
   What the city of Irving's stadium committee needs to decide is
how and when to structure a funding package that can rouse the
support of voters. The Cowboys have a smiling new head coach. They
have generated minimal, by comparison, scandalous headlines. Their
Super Bowl stock is rising with each passing week.
</P>
<P>
   Irving is caught between a rock and a hard place with a hole in
its roof. Owner Jones won't say it, but imagine the stir in the
suburbs if he suddenly announced the most famous team in football
is shopping for a new address.
</P>
<P>
   It is more than possible, as the Patriots loudly reminded us
last week.

RESPECT IS UCLA'S REWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Which comes first, the tackle or the turnover?
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett suggested it was the latter last month,
insinuating that Oregon had fumbled away the overtime game it lost
to UCLA as if the Ducks' offense had been operating in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Ducks) don't turn the ball over against UCLA, they win
the game handily,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   His armchair analysis didn't set well with the Bruins, who like
to think their aggressive tackling has a thing or two to do with
their foes' fickle fingers. So it was the UCLA defense set out
Saturday to prove it wasn't by happenstance that it came into its
game against Hackett's Trojans with the top turnover margin in the
Pacific-10 conference and the third-best margin in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   With Hackett's words pulsating through their bodies like
adrenaline, the Bruins intercepted two passes and forced six
fumbles _ same as they had against Oregon, imagine that _ to spark
UCLA's 34-17 win in front of a Rose Bowl crowd of 88,080.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Bruins' eighth consecutive victory in the intracity
series and their 20th win in a row dating back to early September
of 1997. To hear the UCLA defensive players crow in the game's
afterglow, Hackett deserved a part of a game ball for being, like
the football itself, full of hot air.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big thing we used as motivation,'' said sophomore
defensive end Kenyon Coleman. ``He was saying the Ducks fumbled the
game away but turnovers don't just happen. We cause them. We showed
them that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Or did they?
</P>
<P>
   After watching Marques Anderson strip the ball from R. Jay
Soward on the Trojans' seventh play from scrimmage; after observing
Pete Holland pick quarterback Carson Palmer's pocket; after seeing
Anderson strip Larry Parker; after beholding Brendon Ayanbadejo
peel the ball from Chad Morton; after wincing as Windrell Hayes was
husked by Jason Stephens, Hackett said, ``We kept shooting
ourselves in the foot. It was our own mistakes, our own errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if the thought had just occurred to him he added,
``You've got to give (the Bruins) their due. That's a fine football
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad Hackett couldn't have been at least as charitable off
the field as his players were on it. Like grapes into wine, the
Bruins converted three of the Trojans' five lost fumbles into 13
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't just playing for a victory,'' said UCLA sophomore
cornerback Marques Anderson. ``We were playing for respect.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not be the best defensive corps in the country or even
in their conference (after Saturday we can say with certainty that
that distinction belongs to USC). But say this about the Bruins;
they come through in the crunch. They held USC to 38 net yards
rushing in the second half and didn't allow the Trojans to convert
a single third down in the fourth quarter (USC did convert one
fourth-down try).
</P>
<P>
   ``We were watching ESPN and they were talking about how the
defense has given up the most yards ever,'' said freshman
linebacker Ryan Nece, not even bothering to disguise his disdain.
``What they're not seeing is this defense is making plays when it
counts.''
</P>
<P>
   The players on the beleaguered Bruins defense had been counting
down the days to Saturday's showdown ever since Hackett's comments
made their way into print on October 21. Hackett's words were
Xeroxed and placed on everybody's locker at the start of the week,
just in case the ensuing 32 days had dimmed the defense's
collective memory.
</P>
<P>
   To Heck with Hackett. For a team campaigning for a national
championship, it made for a pretty serviceable slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think his words weren't in the back of their minds the
whole time,'' said junior offensive tackle Kris Farris of the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Something sure seemed to have gotten into Ayanbadejo. The senior
linebacker from Santa Cruz scuffled with Trojans guard Jason Grain
all afternoon. The two repeatedly tarried after the whistle, trying
to see who could get in the last word or shove.
</P>
<P>
   With four sacks Ayanbadejo clearly won the battle as well as the
war, though you'd never have known it by looking at him as the
final few seconds ticked off the clock. He was pacing the UCLA
sideline with blood dripping from the top of his shaved head.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Brian Poli-Dixon wiped Ayanbadejo's pate so he would be
presentable when the television cameras corraled him. Once
surrounded, Ayanbadejo did not exactly shirk the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their team didn't respect us,'' said Ayanbadejo, who could
afford to run his mouth; he doesn't have to face USC again. ``They
were talking smack all week. Then they came out and didn't play for
nothing. We beat their butts. We whipped the dog out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ayanbadejo, one of the last things he said to Grain
was: ``Now do you respect UCLA football?''
</P>
<P>
   And?
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `yeah,''' Ayanbadejo said with a priggish smile.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Bruins won over any other converts remains to be
seen. It's possible their defensive stand will get slighted, what
with Tennessee handily beating Kentucky and Kansas State taking
care of Missouri in other big games contested Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the Vols and Wildcats remain unbeaten, does it matter
how No. 3 UCLA fares on Dec. 5 at Miami?
</P>
<P>
   If an 11-0 record isn't enough to put the Bruins in the national
championship game, so be it. As far as consolation prizes go, the
Rose Bowl isn't half bad. We agree with Anderson who said, ``If the
(pollsters) can't recognize we've won 20 games in a row,
something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like something's not right when the opposing coach can't
acknowledge how the Bruins won this one.

HACKETT COULDN'T HACK IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ For the coach who said Oregon had the best football
team in the Pacific-10 Conference, the coach who predicted a
low-scoring game because USC and UCLA rarely commit turnovers,
reality bit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hackett messed up, he trusted his Trojans to keep a grip on
the ball, and they practically handed a 34-17 victory and another
year's bragging rights to the Bruins at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Which means there will be no Hackett Miracle in 1998. The
Trojans can still beat Notre Dame next week and will play in a bowl
because they've won seven games. So there's progress.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to USC-UCLA, upon which many Trojans fans draw
their trend lines, it was a case of different coach, same result.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was asked what he learned in his rookie outing against
UCLA as a head coach, 18 years after he served as a USC assistant
to John Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the days I was here, we played this game in the Coliseum
every year and we split the stadium down the middle, half red and
half blue,'' Hackett said raspingly outside the Trojans locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different. It is dramatic when you come to their place
and play in a hostile environment. That's a tribute to their fans
and what they've created here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett hinted he'd like to see the same environment at the
Coliseum on Nov. 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a skeptic will say Hackett has to learn about
more than ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   He has to learn to practice what he preaches to his players,
which is not to insult the biggest opponent of the year. Have no
doubt, the Bruins read about Hackett's praise of Oregon last month,
and they used it for motivation Saturday, whether they needed it or
not.
</P>
<P>
   He has to learn that once the emotions take their inevitable
flight in this game, almost anything can happen !ital!except!off!
low scoring. In UCLA-USC, past results are !ital!never!off! a
promise of future performance.
</P>
<P>
   And he has to learn another lesson of UCLA-USC history, which is
that you've always got a chance to come back unless you give it
away.
</P>
<P>
   In '96, with the Bruins trailing by 17 and barely 6 minutes left
in the game, coach Bob Toledo made a fourth-down decision to go for
a field goal and that modest boot set up their incredible rally.
Saturday, with the Trojans down by 17 and 9:34 to play, Hackett
called for a fourth-and-15 pass into the end zone, and when it
ticked off Mike Bastianelli's fingertips, they were sunk.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be a skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   The other side is that Hackett couldn't have done much different
that would have prevented the Trojans' eighth straight loss to the
Bruins. Unless he'd gone out and carried the ball himself.
</P>
<P>
   Five Trojans _ once each _ fumbled the ball away and Carson
Palmer threw two interceptions. The turnovers led to a Bruins
touchdown and two field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't about them, it was about us,'' Hackett said. ``We
have a lot of work to do, obviously.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It was) our own mistakes, our own errors, and it was not just
one person. That has not been a problem all year.... But Oregon
came in here (the Rose Bowl) and turned the ball over, so you can't
say it's not UCLA (causing it).
</P>
<P>
   ``You've gotta give them their due. That's a fine football
team.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll, it's about time.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Hackett had expanded on his Oregon comment during the
past week. He said he'd meant the Ducks were the best team in the
conference at the time they nearly beat UCLA Oct. 17. He said the
Bruins were the best now.
</P>
<P>
   To catch up, the Trojans have a lot of work to do, obviously.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard to say how much after what happened
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could also say, `Same players, same result,' '' receiver
Billy Miller said. ``This had nothing to do with Coach Hackett.
This is on every man in this room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely progress,'' said linebacker Chris
Claiborne. ``We moved the ball today and played pretty good on
defense. The turnovers, that's up to us (players). The coaches can
tell us what to do during the week, but we're the ones who play. We
played really good in spots. That's what really hurts us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Trojans dressed, staffers in the locker room were ripping
down cardinal-and-gold motivational signs, including one that read,
``Expect to Win.''

   Maybe next year, maybe not.

<P>
   But at least the coach will know what to expect.

SUPPORT BUILDS FOR BLAKE AFTER UPSET OF TEXAS TECH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ If he made his final postgame walk as the
football coach at Oklahoma yesterday, John Blake did so with a
defiant look in moist eyes and with the cheers of well-wishers
ringing in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Four times, Blake stopped to receive hugs as he traveled from
the playing surface at Owen Field to the Sooners' locker room after
a 20-17 victory against Texas Tech. Two of the hugs came from
members of the school's board of regents, who will meet at 3 p.m.
today to decide the future of a coach who has overseen the worst
three-year stretch (12-22) in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Regents acknowledged today's vote of the seven-member board
could be close. C.S. Lewis, a Tulsa-based regent, said momentum
built by three victories in the team's final four games, which
allowed the Sooners to finish 5-6, could enhance Blake's
opportunity to serve out the final two years of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to gauge the impact of yesterday's victory, Lewis said:
``I don't know, but it sure won't hurt John's chances. If I were a
betting man, I'd bet the meeting lasts a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Melvin Hall, chairman of the OU board of regents, were
among the well-wishers to embrace Blake as he left the field.
Around them, fans leaped to slap Blake's broad back or to shout
words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's pressure on the other side now!,'' bellowed Duncan
Parham, an OU letterman in 1986-87.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two more years, Baby!,'' hollered Bob King, a former OU
assistant athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   In a raucous OU locker room, players expressed unanimous support
for their embattled coach. Many, including defensive end Darryl
Bright, said they plan to attend today's meeting as a show of
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go. A lot of us will,'' Bright said. ``If you keep
changing a program and starting over from ground zero, you never
get stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake attempted to drive home that message during his postgame
interview session, which began with a round of applause from fans
as Blake took the podium. It ended with Joe Dickinson, OU's
first-year offensive coordinator, offering to resign if that would
help Blake save his job.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, a former Cowboys' assistant who followed Howard
Schnellenberger's one-year stay as coach in 1995, said he was
unsure if he saved his job with yesterday's victory. But he
stressed that the OU program is headed in the right direction under
his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never said I was going anywhere. I've got a job,'' Blake
said. ``Through this tough time, I've gotten stronger. I was a
willow tree at first. Now, I'm an oak tree with knots in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake cited his disciplined approach as an asset in his favor.
Detractors counter that the discipline does not carry over to the
field. Oklahoma finished the season with 990 yards in penalties,
the most in the Big 12 and the most in Blake's three seasons as
coach. The Sooners also suffered a league-high 26 turnovers, but
had only one yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the statistics, said tight end Jason Freemen,
Blake runs a tight ship and has the program headed in the right
direction after seasons of 3-8, 4-8 and 5-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a bunch of thugs around here in the past. Now,
they're all gone,'' Freeman said. ``After all the things people
have put us through, to show the kind of character it takes to be a
winner, this team has it. It didn't show up in the win column, but
I wouldn't trade this team for an 11-0 team right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Let him live out his contract.' This program needs the
stability. In another two years, if he doesn't do the job, get
somebody else then.''

UCLA DEFENSE IS SOMETHING WILD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Nearly 30 years ago, USC fielded a defense that came
to be known as the Wild Bunch.
</P>
<P>
   It swarmed the field so vigorously and wreaked so much havoc
that you'd have sworn there were more than 11 guys out there. Nope.
Just Jimmy Gunn, Al Cowlings, Charlie Weaver and a few other
assorted maniacs.
</P>
<P>
   In the rich lore of the USC-UCLA series, the Bruins had never
produced anything to match it. Until Saturday. Until Jason
Stephens, Brendon Ayanbadejo, Marques Anderson, Ryan Nece and
colleagues badgered the Trojans unmercifully and picked them clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing whatever it took to get that ball out,'' Nece,
an inside linebacker, said after UCLA forced seven turnovers in a
34-17 win over USC at the Rose Bowl. ``We were trying to get every
man out there to the ball. That's what you've got to do. You've got
to swarm like bees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone's up there dangling, there's a place for 11
hats.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA repeatedly found its target. And USC didn't aid its own
cause any by repeatedly waving the ball around in attempts to get
extra yardage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very careless protecting the ball,'' said freshman
quarterback Carson Palmer, somewhat of an authority on the subject.
Not only was he intercepted twice, but he lost a fumble in the
second quarter (Pete Holland slapping it free, Nece recovering)
while carrying the ball in front of him as if it were a toaster
oven.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA forced six fumbles and recovered five of them, three of the
plays directly leading to 13 points in the first half. The Bruins
also got a key interception from Stephens after USC had pulled to
within 10 points in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA graciously welcomed all this charity. Then they crowed
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our best defensive show this year,'' said Ayanbadejo,
who had a career-high four sacks and knocked one fumble loose. ``We
were hitting them hard. We were too fierce for them. They couldn't
contain us. They couldn't hold onto the ball. They couldn't stop
us.''
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't take three or four steps, it seemed, without
stumbling and dropping something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oregon had the same problems,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said,
referring to an earlier UCLA victory in which the Bruins stole the
ball five times. ``I mean, that defense comes after the football.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think that just two weeks ago, it was UCLA's detractors
that were coming after that defense, especially after it yielded 34
points in a win over Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really makes you wonder where we've been the whole
season,'' Stephens said while surveying the carnage of this rout.
</P>
<P>
   Added defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti: ``Three weeks ago,
they were ready to get my head on the guillotine, or whatever you
want to call it. It's the same defense it was two weeks ago, except
it played harder and better.''
</P>
<P>
   And no, he insisted, UCLA's radical improvement on that side of
the ball is not owed to a simplification of the system, an
oft-voiced theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did more today,'' Aliotti said, ``than we had done all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   USC is in no position to dispute that assertion. An accounting
of the most devastating plays turned in by the Bruins:
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!In the first quarter, while wiggling for extra yards
after making a catch at his own 23-yard line, USC wide receiver R.
Jay Soward was stripped by Anderson and Tony White recovered. That
set up UCLA's second touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!In the second quarter, receiver Larry Parker was
struggling for yards in a similar manner when Anderson again
knocked the ball loose. Stephens' recovery and 27-yard return set
up a Chris Sailer field goal.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!Chad Morton's fumble on the ensuing possession
(Ayanbadejo caused it, Larry Atkins covered it) led to another
Sailer field goal and a 27-10 UCLA lead.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!After USC pulled to within 10 points in the third
quarter, Palmer underthrew receiver Billy Miller and Stephens
gathered in the pass. ``I thought he was throwing it to me,''
Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just knew we had to come out with pure intensity,'' said
Anderson. ``The old Bruin swarm. Attack from the first play.''
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded. To a manic extent.

NOTHING SURPRISES USC'S PALMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ His first USC-UCLA encounter was exactly what
Carson Palmer expected.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't fazed by the 88,800 people filling the Rose Bowl
stands, and the taunts of the UCLA faithful fell on deaf ears. The
pageantry of the entire afternoon, something he dreamed about since
he starting flinging a football around, felt comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was everything I expected and anticipated,'' said the
6-foot-4, 220-pound, 18-year-old rookie with an arm beyond his
years.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, he even looked ahead to see his high school friend and
rival DeShaun Foster coming up with a big effort. But there was one
thing he missed during the days, months and years leading up to his
first chance to direct the Trojans against their cross-town rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought they would come after me that hard, that
often,'' Palmer said while toweling off after a hot shower failed
to wash away the pain and disappointment of a 34-17 loss to the
Bruins on Saturday at the Rose Bowl. ``They showed us so many
different looks and just kept coming.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Bruins quit coming, which didn't occur until the final
second ticked away, Palmer quietly walked off the field. This time
Palmer didn't seek out Foster for a postgame chat as he did on a
muddy Cal State Fullerton field last December when Carson's Santa
Margarita High team beat DeShaun's Tustin outfit in the classic CIF
Southern Section Division V championship game.
</P>
<P>
   This time Palmer also couldn't match the heroics of Foster, who
rushed for 109 yards on 15 carries, caught three passes for 18
yards and scored four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised he played such a good game,'' Palmer said.
``I knew he was a great back. He just outran us.''
</P>
<P>
   The assessment of his own play, however, was radically
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I did anything to change the game,'' he said
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, if you can possibly ignore the scoreboard, don't
necessarily back him up. Palmer completed 28 passes in 43 attempts
for 252 yards with a touchdown pass of 11 yards to Antoine Harris.
Cade McNown, his Heisman Trophy candidate counterpart on the other
sideline, was 12 of 20 for 146 yards with a touchdown and two
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmer's good came with some bad. He didn't square his
shoulders while rolling away from pressure, missed wide-open
teammate Billy Miller and connected instead with UCLA's Jason
Stephens in the third quarter. He was also intercepted by Larry
Atkins in the final moments of the game. He was sacked four times
and lost a fumble after being hit by defensive end Pete Holland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't show me nothing,'' UCLA linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo said. ``He was talking like he won the Heisman Trophy.
He didn't do nothing but get sacked and throw a couple of picks.''
</P>
<P>
   USC receiver Mike Bastianelli bristled at such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the kid is a great quarterback,'' said Bastianelli.
``This loss is not his fault by any stretch of the imagination.
This loss is a team loss, we all had a hand in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer lost a fumble in the first half, but so did teammates R.
Jay Soward, Larry Parker and Chad Morton. And the Trojans offensive
line had no answer for the swirling pressure applied by the Bruins'
defensive front and linebackers Ayanbadejo, who had four sacks, and
Ryan Nece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just loved how he kept his composure back there,'' Miller
said of Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   The composure came in handy when Palmer broke away from the
grasp of UCLA linebacker Ramogi Huma, burst up the middle
untouched, rolled left and threw a pretty floater that ticked off
Miller's fingertips inside the Bruins 5-yard line. Then, with 9:42
left in the game and the Trojans desperately trying to hang on to
hope, Palmer stayed calm in the pocket, threw while being cracked
in the chin by a Bruin and got the ball into the hands of a diving
Bastianelli, who couldn't hold on in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did some things that could have helped us win this game,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the sun sunk, Palmer was left to feel the pain that
kept Miller, a veteran of four losses to UCLA, slumped in front of
his locker, still in his uniform, long after most of his teammates
had made their way out of the cramped visitors' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get rid of this feeling I feel right now,''
Palmer said. ``I can't wait until next year.''
</P>
<P>
   `Wait until next year' is a theme the Trojans have adopted for
the past eight seasons. One day it has to end, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts knowing I'll never get another chance at these
guys,'' Bastianelli said. ``Carson will beat these guys three years
in a row. I have no doubt about that.''

LAST PLAY ANGERS HACKETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF AND JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ It just wouldn't be a USC-UCLA game without
controversy, and Trojans coach Paul Hackett was upset Saturday over
a play the Bruins ran at the end of their 34-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   With less than 30 seconds left, UCLA quarterback Cade McNown
faked a pitch and reversed field for a 23-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what that last play of the game was about,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Did Hackett think it was uncalled for? ``Yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was then asked if he was upset because the game was no
longer on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking me if the game was on the line?'' he said in
amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Sun or Aloha bound? The Trojans' bowl possibilities only cleared
up slightly, thanks to Oregon's loss to Oregon State. Both teams
finished 5-3 in Pacific-10 Conference play. The Sun Bowl, which
takes the conference's third-place team, has the option of taking
either school.
</P>
<P>
   That might favor the Trojans, because the Ducks prefer to go to
the Aloha Bowl, which selects fourth. USC's administration prefers
going to the Sun Bowl because the Trojans open the 1999 season in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   It also means more practice time for the Trojans, because the
Sun Bowl is New Year's Eve. The Aloha Bowl is on Christmas, and USC
may not be able to hold the maximum number of practices because of
finals. Aloha Bowl officials have already said they would like USC.
</P>
<P>
   Managers game: In the annual game between the team managers
Thursday night, USC defeated UCLA 36-35 at Spaulding Field.
</P>
<P>
   No more Heisman: USC's defense tried to find something to be
proud about after the loss. Its only consolation was UCLA
quarterback Cade McNown's stats: He completed 12 of 20 passes for
146 yards with two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we might have taken him out of the Heisman race with
that,'' linebacker Chris Claiborne said. ``We kept him in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming along: UCLA defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti was
thrilled with his unit's performance, holding USC to 17 points and
no big plays. The Trojans scored three times, but only one followed
a lengthy drive. Their other scores resulted from UCLA turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   USC rushed for 135 yards, but averaged only 3.9 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did very well against the run,'' Aliotti said. ``They had a
lot of rushing yards, but they didn't really rush the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Blood boiling: UCLA linebacker Ryan Nece spoke to his father
earlier this week and had no doubt which way Ronnie Lott was
leaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was rooting for me, but you can't break his USC
blood,'' said Nece, a redshirt freshman linebacker who had seven
tackles, a sack and a fumble recovery in one of his best games of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nece had plenty of motivation. In addition to facing his
father's school, USC didn't recruit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little extra going on inside,'' he said. ``At
first (when he wasn't recruited), I was a little bitter. Now, SC is
my enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Big blocks: UCLA's rushing success was due, in part, to
effective downfield blocking by its receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Melsby took out Claiborne on a 16-yard screen pass to
DeShaun Foster that set up UCLA's second touchdown. On Foster's
65-yard run, freshman receiver Jon Dubravac joined tackle Kris
Farris and fullback Durell Price in clearing a seam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw on film that their safeties made a lot of tackles,''
Melsby said. ``We thought if the receivers could block the safeties
and leave the runners for the cornerbacks, that would eliminate a
major tackler. The big runs were directly a result of the receivers
blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking back: When UCLA took a 34-17 lead early in the fourth
quarter, Farris recalled the 1996 game, when USC held a 17-point
lead with seven minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying, `Remember '96,''' Farris said. ``This SC team
reminded me a lot of us in '96.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Right tackle Brian Polak played the entire game
despite a sprained ankle and knee that forced him to miss three
practices this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Jason Bell (ankle) and defensive end Kenyon Coleman
(knee) suffered minor injuries. But with a week off, they are
expected to be ready for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   USC linebacker David Gibson suffered a a bruised thigh and did
not play in the second half. USC officials said Gibson will be able
to play next week, which means his status is likely 50-50 for the
Notre Dame game. &QL;

UCLA DEFENSE HEATS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If UCLA's defense didn't lead the nation in
points allowed or yards given up, it was certainly No. 1 in the
country in another category: catching flak.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just talking heads or talking opponents --- USC
linebacker Chris Claiborne proclaimed that if the Bruins had USC's
defense they'd win the national championship --- who ripped the
Bruin defense. Even UCLA coach Bob Toledo had piled on.
</P>
<P>
   All season, the Bruins bit their lips. Yes, they needed to
tackle better. Sure, they could improve their coverage. Yeah, a
pass rush might be nice every now and again.
</P>
<P>
   And then Saturday they bit something else.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, in easily their best defensive performance of the
season, clamped down on USC, notching a season-high seven turnovers
and six sacks in a 34-17 win over USC before a sellout crowd of
80,080.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor of the Rose Bowl afterward the Bruins showed they
had some bark, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kicked their ass,'' said UCLA's first-year defensive
coordinator Nick Aliotti, who was called out by Toledo two weeks
ago after another poor outing. ``I usually don't say that, but we
kicked their ass. It's been a tough 10 weeks. To feel like I do
just isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti had a right to feel better Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Ayanbadejo had four of the Bruins' six sacks, nearly
doubled his season total. Cornerbacks Jason Bell and Marques
Anderson played splendid man-to-man coverage on virtually every
down. Freshman safety Jason Stephens, who'd never had a turnover,
intercepted a pass and recovered two fumbles. For the first time
this season, you didn't need more than one hand to count the missed
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there were the turnovers, five fumbles and two
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stat of the game was turnovers,'' said UCLA quarterback
Cade McNown. ``When we can force that many turnovers, it puts us in
a position to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins came in with two defensive objectives: take the big
play away from USC and make freshman quarterback Carson Palmer beat
them.
</P>
<P>
   USC's longest plays were 27 yards --- runs by Palmer and Chad
Morton --- and Palmer threw two interceptions and fumbled the ball
away two more times. Nearly half his 252 yards passing came in the
final 13 minutes, after UCLA led, 34-17.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver R.Jay Soward, the Bruin killer who has been bothered by
a twisted ankle, was a non-factor: 3 catches, 22 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they'd go more vertical,'' said Bell. ``I think they
believe they have guys who can just run past us. They tried a few
times, but they didn't get any and they gave up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   USC drove for only one touchdown. Ten of its points came after
turnovers set the Trojans up at the UCLA 27, which they parlayed
into Adam Abrams 36-yard field goal, and at the UCLA 4, which they
converted into Petros Papadakis' 1-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruin defense didn't have to look far to find its
motivation. Never mind the national championship. Or the rivalry
with the Trojans. They simply turned on the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching TV last night and Morton said he was going to
run it down our throat,'' Anderson said. ``There's so much
arrogance from SC. We wanted to come out and hit 'em in the mouth
and let 'em know we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We whipped the dog out of 'em,'' said Ayanbadejo, who led the
Bruins nine tackles and also broke up a pass. ``We were hungry,
wild dogs out there. This was the longest week of the season. It
felt like we were practicing for a month. I didn't get to bed until
3 a.m. (every night) until last night. I was ready to play 'em at 3
a.m. on Wilshire in front of my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget that UCLA's defense was ranked 91st in the nation and
that they were shredded by Oregon, Stanford and Oregon State, said
Ayanbadejo.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, with Ayanbadejo and Atkins the only senior
starters, has been there when it needed to be. There were the two
goal-line stands against Cal, the overtime sacks against Oregon and
Anderson's game-saving strip against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense is the big question mark,'' said Ayanbadejo. ``The
media look down on us, TV looks down on us, but we make plays. Not
just some of the time, not just once in a while, but all of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Saturday was the first time he felt like he played for a
national championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti also noticed the difference a day makes. ``Three weeks
ago, my head was in a guillotine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday he could smile and say: let them eat cake.

FLETCHER AND FRIENDS ONE STEP CLOSER

   PASADENA _ Freshman Anthony Fletcher, a UCLA defensive end from
San Dimas, knows the importance of his team's win over cross-town
rival USC on Saturday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In Fletcher's eyes, the No.3 Bruins' 34-17 drubbing of the
Trojans proved that much-maligned blue and gold defense is a great
deal stronger than its detractors suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The real test for the team is a Dec. 5 game against the No.22
Miami Hurricanes. Even so, Fletcher and his colleagues on the
defense are suddenly thinking about the Fiesta Bowl and a national
championship. They played their hearts out Saturday to get the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally we're playing more aggressively,'' Fletcher said. ``We
consistently made more good plays today than we've done all year.
We're proving what we want to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   The win before 80,080 noisy fans was UCLA's eighth straight over
USC. It was made possible largely because the Bruins forced seven
turnovers and pressured Trojans quarterback Carson Palmer. Among
those applying the pressure was Fletcher, who early in the fourth
quarter recorded one of his team's six sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really pumped,'' Fletcher said. ``I don't think it
really helps getting hyped up for these type of games. You know
they always say you should play these games like any other games.
But, I mean there was... you go out and dislike the other team so
much just because you are rivals, you can't help playing hard _
even harder _ than you usually do.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said he realized too late just how tough Fletcher and
other members of the Bruin defense were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard about their low (defensive) rankings and we didn't
expect them to play as well as they did,'' Palmer said. ``But, they
just came out here and outplayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, which clinched the Pac-10 title last weekend, is 10-0 for
the second time in school history, joining the 1946 Bruins, who
finished 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, who led early 3-0, hurt themselves by losing four
fumbles in the first 22{ minutes. The turnovers directly lead to 13
UCLA points. In the end USC gave up seven turnovers to the Bruins'
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the stat of the game right there,'' UCLA quarterback
Cade McNown said. ``When we can force that many turnovers, that's
something. Our defense was spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA senior safety Tod McBride agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the defense came to play,'' he said. ``It was emotional
game and we went out to perform. I thank God to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was especially poignant for McBride as it was his last
regular season game before a hometown crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotions were flying high. It was great and wild, but it
hurts at the same time,'' McBride said. ``I feel good that I've
never lost to 'SC. Hopefully we can keep the streak going long
after I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bruins linebacker Ramogi Huma, the win was simply great.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about this game that just turns everybody
on,'' Huma said. A lot of people this week talked down about our
defense. That is what gave us attitude and we just came out
exploding.''

FOSTER GIVES USC THE CHILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER   
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC recruited DeShaun Foster to play defense.
</P>
<P>
   Life is difficult enough around Exposition Park without this new
factoid hurled atop the pile. The Trojans' run of misery against
UCLA now stands at a series-record eight straight losses after
Saturday's 34-17 Bruin win at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And now the school once known as Tailback U. will have to deal
with the Foster legacy. It's just a day old, but moments like this
in the series tend to linger. Like, forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' true freshman from Tustin High School, despite a bad
case of strep throat, ran for 109 yards and scored all four Bruin
touchdowns Saturday, three rushing and one receiving. In the first
quarter, he shook a tackle by Rashard Cook to score on a four-yard
pass from Cade McNown, then dove over from a yard out on a early,
pivotal fourth down play.
</P>
<P>
   His third score was a 65-yard blast in the second quarter that
came less than a minute after USC had closed to 14-10, and his
final was a reprise of his one-yard dive that closed the show in
the fourth quarter. He would have scored five TDs, but the ball
popped out of his hands on a later fourth quarter dive.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone at UCLA was complaining. Bob Toledo concedes
Foster would have made a swell safety at USC, but he likes him
where he is right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's phenomenal,'' said Toledo after the Bruins' 20th straight
win, facilitated in part by seven Trojan turnovers. ``He was sick
last night, sick enough for us to take him to the hospital. I saw
him at breakfast and told him `anytime a guy gets sick the night
before a game, he plays great. Remember Michael Jordan?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The freshman bought it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he said that to get my mind off my throat,'' Foster
said. ``I just wanted to get to a point where I didn't feel weak.
The doctors gave me something before the game to numb my throat.''
</P>
<P>
   And he then proceeded to leave USC numb.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a junior tearing up grass at Tustin High, most major
schools called seeking an audience. UCLA was among them, and Toledo
made it abundantly clear he wanted him as a runner. He showed
Foster video of Skip Hicks functioning quite well in the
McNown-directed offense. Toledo wanted him to know this was no mere
left-coast, backs-left-out offense.
</P>
<P>
   USC was non-commital. Now why USC would take such a posture is
astonishing, because the Trojans haven't had a great running back
since Marcus Allen. USC's descent from Tailback U. to Tailback Who
may be the most criminal violation of Los Angeles sports in the
last two decades (O.J. excepted).
</P>
<P>
   By the time USC noticed Foster was enroute to 3,398 rushing
yards and 59 touchdowns last year as a senior, Foster had committed
in his heart to UCLA. ``I was never in to USC, anyway,'' Foster
said. ``But I thought about that a lot this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins thought they would run well Saturday, regardless of
who had the ball. They looked at USC's resume and noticed Troy
hadn't seen many rushing teams, and those who could, did. Florida
State was one, and Arizona State's J.R. Redmond almost beat USC by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Bruins ran for 227 yards, with Jermaine Lewis (47
yards) and Keith Brown (23) chipping in solid efforts. ``We ran the
ball at them,'' McNown said. ``It wasn't even an issue. We knew we
could run on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins admit they know when Foster is in the game. He
wastes little energy moving laterally and carries defenders down
field. Pity the poor defender who tries to tackle him high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of our guys ran well. But no one shakes defenders
like DeShaun,'' McNown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a lineman, we try not to care who the back is. You don't
want anything to make a difference in the way you play,'' said
center Shawn Stuart. ``But we know he's a strong runner who doesn't
go down on first contact. When a lineman knows that, he'll hold his
block a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so pretty to watch a running back shed tacklers.''
</P>
<P>
   And Foster has three more years left ahead of him, and about 10
more pounds of mature muscle to add to his 6-1, 205-pound frame,
and all the confidence that comes from success like Saturday's.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there's that intangible of eight straight wins over your
rival. The who, what and how of UCLA's win was less important to
the Bruins than the simple pleasure of again beating USC. For one
day, national rank mattered less than city rank.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's showed the team a highlight reel of the last seven wins
in the series and that video clip of USC coach Paul Hackett's
month-old comment that ``Oregon was the class of the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be like all the other seniors before me who could
say they never lost to USC,'' said linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo,
who had four second-half sacks of USC freshman quarterback Carson
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make for great reunions,'' said McNown. ``We'll all
comeback and talk about how we never lost to our rival.'' And maybe
about the safety USC let get away.

FINALLY, KINGS GET RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Maybe good things are in store for the Kings as they
head into a much needed six-day rest.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Storr returned to the nets for the first time in more than
a month on Saturday and the Kings responded with just their second
victory in the month of November, a 5-0 decision over the Chicago
Blackhawks before 12,011 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Storr, who was last seen struggling to finish a Oct. 18 game
against Colorado despite a groin injury, made 21 saves to help snap
the Kings' longest losing streak (six games) since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   With their lineup ravaged by injuries to Rob Blake, Jozef
Stumpel, Stephane Fiset and Doug Bodger, among others, Los Angeles
got big games from role-player Nathan LaFayette and slumping Yanic
Perreault.
</P>
<P>
   LaFayette had a goal and two assists, while Perreault, who
hasn't scored a goal since Storr last played, had two assists and
provided a leaping screen on Glen Murray's power play goal in the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings broke on top at 11:45 of the first period on a shot
off the unlikey stick of LaFayette. The Los Angeles center won a
draw cleanly from Doug Gilmour, got a pass from Perreault and beat
goalie Jocelyn Thibault, who was screened by Craig Johnson and one
of his own defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   It was LaFayette's second goal of the season and only the 17th
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the second period, LaFayette's good corner work got the
puck to Perreault in the right circle and the he quickly slid a
nice pass to Johnson, who tipped it past Thibault with 33.7 seconds
left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   While the Kings are attempting to struggle through their injury
problems, the Blackhawks obviously have plenty of their own woes
and a whole new look.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chelios missed his fourth straight game and Thibault made
his first start in goal since being acquired from Montreal along
with Dave Manson. Los Angeles also faced Gilmour and Paul Coffey
for the first time in Chicago uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all of the changes, the Blackhawks are 1-9-1 in
their last 11 games and 5-11-3 this season. Chicago came into the
game allowing a whopping 3.5 goals a game.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kings took a 3-0 lead on Murray's goal early in the
third period, the game became a fighting contest of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Laperriere landed a flurry of punches in a fight with Trent
Yamney and then spent several minutes exchanging verbal barbs with
the Chicago defenseman as they sat in their respective penalty
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bob Probert and Mark Visheau's turn next, before Remi
Royer cross checked Olli Jokinen and started another battle.
</P>
<P>
   After some calm was restored, Jokinen got the best type of
revenge when he scored his fourth goal of the year at 18:19 of the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop the Blackhawks, who continued to try and
stir things up.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Ferraro took advantage of that when he scored a power play
goal with 38.2 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Storr wasn't tested often, but he was more than up to the task
when he was. His best save came five minutes into the second period
and with the Kings leading 1-0. Mike Maneluk broke in alone and
Storr stretched his right arm out and stopped the winger's
backhander.

NORTHRIDGE LETS TITLE SLIP AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POCATELLO, Idaho _ A defense that bent all season finally gave
way to a tidal wave that most likely swept Cal State Northridge out
of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Everything fell the Matadors way in the race for the Big Sky
Conference title, until the defense allowed an 80-yard drive in the
final few minutes of the conference race.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Burford connected with DeRonn Finley on a 3-yard touchdown
pass with 32 seconds remaining as Idaho State stunned No.23 CSUN
32-29 on Saturday at Holt Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Matadors won, they would have earned the Big Sky's
automatic berth to the Division I-AA playoffs. Instead, at 7-4, the
Matadors' season appears over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, none,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said of the Matadors'
postseason chances. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is prevalent because the Matadors blew what should
have been an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   Montana set the stage for CSUN when it defeated Montana State
28-21 earlier in the day. It meant a Matadors' win would send them
to the playoffs for the first time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   All that was needed was a victory against Idaho State (3-8, 2-6
Big Sky), a program wallowing on the bottom of the conference with
lame duck coach Tom Walsh on the sidelines for the final time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Matadors defense allowed 22 points in the second half
and 15 in the final six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bust your (butt) all season and have a chance to win the
Big Sky championship in one game and you lose. Oh, man, does it
hurt,'' CSUN sophomore safety Jeremy Golden said. ``You go through
life and things like this make you stronger. Time is the only thing
that will make this go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice the Matadors took the lead in the fourth quarter only to
have the Bengals storm back, but the final time seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Like he did the previous week, quarterback Marcus Brady drove
the Matadors into the end zone with less than five minutes
remaining to give CSUN the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Experiencing problems with the kicking game again _ Ethan Beck
missed an extra point _ Ponciano opted to go for it on fourth-and-1
from Idaho State's 8-yard line with 2:15 to go. Melvin Blue dived
for the first down and three plays later Brady hit Aaron Arnold on
a 10-yard slant for a 29-24 lead with 1:28 left. However, the
two-point conversion failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I did think we were going to win there,'' said
Brady, who threw for 312 yards and three touchdowns. ``I thought
our defense would step up like it did all season.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't. On the next play from scrimmage, Brian Goodell got
behind CSUN cornerback Mel Miller for a 55-yard gain. A pass
interference moved the ball to CSUN's 10 before two running plays
up the middle netted two yards. Then Idaho State split three
receivers to the right and snuck DeRonn into the open for the
decisive score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we could get open on that play because we practiced
against it all week and it always worked,'' DeRonn said. ``We
didn't care about knocking them out of the playoffs. We wanted to
win so we could show people we weren't quitters.'
</P>
<P>
   In one of the crazier plays to grace a football field, the
Matadors were presented with a go-ahead gift on the first play of
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 17-17 and the Bengals driving, CSUN safety
Jeremy Golden was the recipient of an inexplicable gift. Idaho
State had the ball on the CSUN 28 when center Jim Corder's snap
shot past quarterback Kevin McCarthy. Golden, coming on a blitz,
got a perfect bounce, picked it up and raced 67 yards to give the
Matadors a 23-17 lead with 14:51 to play. But Ethan Beck, who
kicked a 47-yard field goal in the second quarter, hit the right
upright on the extra point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought we were going to lose,'' Matadors senior
safety Vito Clemente said. ``I couldn't believe the 0:00 on the
clock and we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's defense had an earlier opportunity to make a statement
but failed when it allowed the Bengals to march 88 yards in 10
plays to take a 24-23 lead. The final strike was a 23-yard post
pattern to Finley, who beat Miller for the score with 5:29
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   However, the drama wasn't over because Finley was flagged for
spiking the ball and Pete Garces was left with a 35-yard PAT. Of
course, the distance was no problem since Graces tied a Big Sky
record with a 60-yard field goal in the first quarter.

COYOTES STILL HOWLING  
 OT WIN RUNS STREAK TO 11 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Something had to give on Saturday night when the
Edmonton Oilers visited the Coyotes at America West Arena for a
showdown between two of the NHL's hottest clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It took three periods of regulation and all but 52 seconds of
overtime to settle it, but the Oilers finally gave.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Tocchet's blast 4:08 into overtime beat Edmonton goalie
Mikhail Shtalenkov and lifted the resilient Coyotes to a 3-2
victory, their second overtime triumph in two nights and their 11th
game in a row without a loss.
</P>
<P>
   It capped a remarkable Phoenix comeback and, coupled with a 3-3
tie between Dallas and St. Louis, left the Coyotes (11-2-2) atop
the NHL with 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   To do it, the Coyotes had to beat a team on just about as big a
roll as their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers came in having scored 58 goals this season, tops in
the NHL. The Coyotes entered having given up only 20 goals, the
league low.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes had shared first place in the Pacific Division and
the best record in the NHL with Dallas. The Oilers entered the game
leading the Northwest Division and were third in the NHL with 21
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes started the game among the best teams on their home
ice early in the season with a 5-1-1 record. The Oilers, with a
6-3-1 mark coming in, had fashioned one of the NHL's best road
records.
</P>
<P>
   And it looked as if it would be the Oilers who kept their run
going.
</P>
<P>
   But Brad Isbister's breakaway goal at the 16:40 mark of the
third period forced overtime, and Tocchet finished the job with
overtime nearly gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real sense of determination,'' Phoenix Coach Jim
Schoenfeld said. ``There was a feeling that if we keep working, we
can pull this one out. And when you do get the victory, it
strengthens your conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with this club's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a bad period, we're going back to the basics,''
Tocchet said. ``Last year, it might take us three games to get back
to the basics. This year, it takes 20 minutes, and that's the
key.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes appeared headed toward a gut-wrenching loss on a
night when they had outplayed the Oilers, but ran into a goalie
even hotter than their own.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton's Todd Marchant had given the Oilers a 2-1 lead at the
13:16 mark of the third period, taking a pass on the right wing
from Craig Millar and beating Nikolai Khabibulin.
</P>
<P>
   And despite bombarding Shtalenkov with 34 shots to that point,
the Coyotes had beaten him only once on Greg Adams' first goal of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Coyotes finally solved Shtalenkov, getting two goals in
their last five shots.
</P>
<P>
   Isbister took a pass from Keith Carney, rushed in, deked left,
got Shtalenkov to commit, beat him on the glove side to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tocchet's slap shot extended the Coyotes winning streak to
five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes also pushed their string of games in which they have
yielded two goals or less to 14. It's the longest such streak since
the league expanded in 1967, and Phoenix is now within four games
of matching the NHL record of 18. &QL;

   PASADENA, Calif. _ Things couldn't be better for UCLA's football
team these days. The school band begs to play for the head coach.
Movie stars drop by the locker room after victories, and a freshman
running back comes off his sick bed to score four touchdowns and
rush for more than 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, the crosstown rivals are sent home in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The third-ranked Bruins, helped by a punishing running attack
and seven Southern California turnovers, beat the Trojans, 34-17,
on Saturday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The victory advances UCLA's pursuit of a berth in the Fiesta
Bowl and a chance to win the school's first national championship
since 1954. It was also the Bruins' eighth straight win over USC
and extended their overall winning streak to 20, the longest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (10-0, 8-0 Pac-10), second in the Bowl Championship Series
standings last week, believes it should clinch a spot in the Fiesta
Bowl with a victory Dec. 5 at Miami. It's not that simple, however,
because Tennessee, which is at the top of the BCS rankings, and
Kansas State, which is third, also are undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sewn up three of our four goals this season,'' UCLA
quarterback Cade McNown said. ``We won the Pac-10 championship,
(clinched) a bid to the Rose Bowl and beat USC. Now there's one
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins seem to be waking from a midseason lull that saw them
win close games against Oregon, California, Stanford and Oregon
State in consecutive weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Those days seemed long past Saturday afternoon when many of the
88,080 in attendance directed chants of ``Eight more years''
derisively at the Trojans (7-4, 5-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very, very excited about what we've done, where we've
been and where we're going,'' said UCLA Coach Bob Toledo, who left
his post-game interview session to greet the band, which had been
beckoning him to appear for a serenade.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA freshman running back DeShaun Foster was in no mood for
revelry, even though he scored four touchdowns _ tying a school
record _ and rushed for 109 yards, all but two of which came in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Foster came down with strep throat Friday night at the team's
hotel and spent part of the evening at a hospital. He felt about as
ready to play as actor James Caan, who was in the UCLA locker room
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   After five hours of sleep Friday night, he awoke feeling better
and saw Toledo at breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo told him: ```DeShaun, any time a guy gets sick, they
usually have a great game. Remember Michael Jordan?''
</P>
<P>
   Foster smiled but wasn't all that confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was just trying to get my mind off being sick,'' he
said. ``I just wanted to get to the point where I could deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   We all would like to get to that point. Foster showed Saturday
that he could become one of the nation's elite backs in the future.
He caught a 4-yard touchdown pass, making a nifty move to avoid a
defender, scored twice more in short-yardage situations and broke a
65-yarder in the second quarter that helped UCLA build a 27-10
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe the play, Foster said he just cut inside a
block and sprinted to the end zone. McNown, sitting next to him,
chuckled at the description.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more to it than that,'' McNown said. ``I had a
chance to watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, who led a rushing attack that gained 227 yards on 45
carries, likes to keep things simple. ``He just goes to the hole
and runs,'' McNown said. ``He doesn't think about all
implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Foster's performance Saturday, the Bruins were most
encouraged by their defense, which has only two senior starters.
The Bruins harassed USC freshman quarterback Carson Palmer for much
of the day, sacking him six times and intercepting him twice.
</P>
<P>
   USC mounted a bit of a comeback in the third quarter, holding
the Bruins to nine yards and scoring a touchdown to close within
10.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmer threw an interception late in the quarter, and Foster
scored his fourth touchdown early in the fourth quarter to put the
game away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you play a team of UCLA's caliber, you can't turn the
ball over, which is what we did on every play,'' USC Coach Paul
Hackett said. &QL;

WILDCATS AFTER MORE ACCLAIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ Kansas State coach Bill Snyder predictably was
not thinking about how his team's 31-25 victory against Missouri
yesterday would play nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really pleased with a lot of things we did today,''
Snyder said. ``That's what was on my mind coming off the field
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Most notable was the fact that the Wildcats' heralded defense
gave up a season-high 440 yards of total offense. And though
Missouri's defense also gave up some big plays, the Tigers did a
decent job on quarterback Michael Bishop, who nevertheless finished
with 104 yards on 23 carries and was the game's leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some mistakes,'' Bishop said. ``But we can live with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder broke precedent last week and said several times that he
thought Bishop deserved to win the Heisman Trophy. But a
trophy-winning performance wasn't on Bishop's mind any more than
how the Wildcats' victory will be received nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I really don't care about the Heisman,'' Bishop
said. ``I'm here to play for my team. I'm going to do everything I
can do for my team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Heisman, the way I play speaks for itself. I'll
take the national title over the Heisman any day, because that will
mean we have an undefeated season and accomplished a lot of our
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heisman is more of a goal for one person. Playing with a
team like we have this season, I'm looking at team goals. And our
team goal is to win the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri finished the regular season 7-4, equaling last year's
regular-season record. But coach Larry Smith, who has revitalized
the program in five years, has mixed feelings about the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this 7-4 was harder than last year because of who we
played,'' he said. ``But I think we're three or four plays away
from being 10-1. It may be putting some pressure on this team, but
I think we've got to win a bowl game to feel good about this
season.''
Points after
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State's depth at running back suffered another blow.
Already without leading rusher Eric Hickson, who did not play
yesterday because of an ankle injury, the Wildcats lost backup
Marlon Charles to a possible hip fracture. Charles set up the
go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter with a 55-yard run on the
first play of the second half. ... Kansas State has won 15
consecutive Big 12 games. ... Snyder's 77 victories equal the
program's total from 1959 to 1988.

UCLA GROUND GAME, TURNOVERS DOOM USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ |They say you can never erase the pain of
losing the big game in high school. DeShaun Foster knows. &QL; 
The last time the UCLA freshman running back was on the same field
with Southern California freshman quarterback Carson Palmer, Foster
rushed for 377 yards and six touchdowns, but Palmer threw for 419
yards and five touchdowns. Palmer's Santa Margarita team beat
Foster's Tustin team to win the 1997 Southern California
championship in December. &QL; 
``That game will be in my mind forever,'' Foster said. ``But this
one's sweeter.'' &QL; 
``This one'' was UCLA's 34-17 victory against USC yesterday in the
Rose Bowl. Foster set a Bruins freshman record with four touchdowns
_ three rushing, one receiving. He would have scored a fifth
touchdown, but fumbled into the end zone. &QL; 
Foster gained 109 yards on 15 carries. ``We could have run all
day,'' UCLA quarterback Cade McNown said. Basically, they did. The
Bruins, 10-0 and ranked No. 3 by The Associated Press, rushed for
227 yards to win their 20th consecutive game and run their winning
streak in this rivalry to an unprecedented eight. &QL; 
Friday, Foster was hospitalized with strep throat. Before the game,
UCLA coach Bob Toledo pulled Foster aside. &QL; 
``I told him that when a player is sick, he often has a great
game,'' Toledo said. ``I said, `Remember Michael Jordan?' DeShaun
just smiled. I told him he was going to be the player of the
game.'' &QL; 
With UCLA leading 14-10 _ and all USC's points coming after
intercepting McNown twice _ Foster asserted the Bruins' dominance.
On a second-and-2 from the UCLA 35, he broke through over left
tackle, stepped through a tackle attempt by Daylon McCutcheon and
outran Antuan Simmons for a touchdown. &QL; 
``I got a good kick-out block, and it was just green grass,'' said
Foster, who added that his throat hurt after the game. &QL; 
``There was more to it than that,'' McCown said. ``I had a chance
to watch it. He just brushed off McCutcheon like he wasn't there.
That was very impressive.'' &QL; 
So was UCLA's maligned defense. The Bruins forced seven turnovers,
including five fumbles. ``That's the stat of the game,'' said
McNown, who was a modest 12-of-20 passing for 146 yards and a
touchdown. &QL; 
This game was supposed to be strength against strength _ UCLA's
offense against USC's defense _ and weakness against weakness _
UCLA's defense against USC's offense. The Bruins' strengths and
weaknesses were superior. &QL; 
``Any time you play a team of UCLA's caliber, you can't turn the
ball over, which is what we did on every play,'' said USC coach
Paul Hackett, whose team is 7-4. &QL; 
An exaggeration, but the point is well taken. With a freshman
quarterback, USC needed perfection. Palmer was making his third
career start and first in this cauldron of emotion and civic
football pride. He had displayed an indifferent cool all week. &QL; 
``We introduced him to the USC-UCLA game,'' Bruins safety Larry
Atkins said. &QL; 
Palmer was 28 of 48 for 252 yards and was sacked six times. He
couldn't win the game nor could he stop the UCLA fans, who reminded
the Trojans of their rivalry futility with the chant of ``eight
more years, eight more years.'' &QL; 
``They were talking trash all week,'' said UCLA linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo, who had four sacks. ``Now we can talk trash. Eight
years of being losers. We're the champs. Undefeated, undisputed
Pac-10 champions. We whipped their butts. We whipped the dog out of
them.'' &QL;

ONE GAME CAN CLINCH THE HEISMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One game. Sometimes all it takes is one star-quality
performance, a vote-grabbing game, to turn Heisman Trophy
contenders into winners.
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman Trophy isn't a one-game award. It's designed to go
to the best player in college football for a season. However, a
single game can separate the contenders from the pretenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a moment where the nation's football fans are focused
on your team,'' said Chris Fowler, host of ESPN's ``College Game
Day''. ``If a player can step up and perform, if you do that and
you have a solid season in addition to that, you can take a quantum
leap in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas running back Ricky Williams made his Heisman hop with 150
yards against Nebraska in the Longhorns' 20-16 victory against the
Huskers. Williams, who needs 63 yards against Texas A&AMP;M on Friday
to become Division I-A's career rushing leader, appears to be the
favorite to win the 1998 Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was definitely the game that made you think it's
definitely his, not probably his,'' said Tim Layden, ``Sports
Illustrated'''s college football writer. ``Nebraska is the closest
thing that Williams has had as far as a defining game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nebraska game certainly helped him, but nobody else has
stepped up,'' added Steve Wieberg, ``USA Today'''s national college
football writer.
</P>
<P>
   That could change. The Downtown Athletic Club sent 920 ballots
to Heisman Trophy voters, the majority of whom are media, on Nov.
11. The voting deadline is Dec. 11, although voters may return
their ballots any time after receiving them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no straw polls on this that are accurate, so we
don't really know how it's going to turn out,'' Fowler said. ``I
don't think anybody wins it until November. I think that people
will hold their ballots. The smart voters will want to wait until
the final games on Dec. 5. I haven't made up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's Tim Couch, UCLA's Cade McNown and Kansas State's
Michael Bishop _ all quarterbacks _ had the opportunity to impress
Heisman voters yesterday. All three played in games important to
the national championship race.
</P>
<P>
   All three won, but none had breakout games. Williams and the
Longhorns had the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``One game isn't going to win it for a guy,'' said Andrew
Bagnato, college football writer of the ``Chicago Tribune''. ``But
there are games where people are looking for the player to assert
himself. Last year, \RCharles\S Woodson did that against Ohio
State, and \RPeyton\S Manning didn't do it against Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 snapshot: Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning walking
off Florida Field in Gainesville, a frustrated loser for the fourth
time against the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   A second 1997 snapshot: Michigan defensive back Charles Woodson
returning a punt for a touchdown, catching a pass to set up a score
and intercepting a pass to stop an Ohio State drive.
</P>
<P>
   And the 1997 Heisman Trophy went to ... Charles Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stars were all aligned for Woodson that day,'' Layden
said. ``Michigan was a strong team, playing a huge game against
their big rival. And he made the plays that helped Michigan win
that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season was the classic example of one game swaying the
Heisman vote. Manning's Tennessee team lost to Florida in
September. Even though Manning had been the preseason favorite to
win the award, he couldn't overcome that loss. Woodson was a
breakout performer for a team that won the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the ``one-game phenomenon'' has taken shape during
the past 40 years. In 1959, LSU's Billy Cannon boosted his Heisman
profile with his legendary punt return against Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the focus on a single moment became sharper.
Florida quarterback Steve Spurrier volunteered and kicked a
game-winning field goal against Auburn in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the one-game theory was proved in unusual
fashion. UCLA quarterback Gary Beban threw for 301 yards and two
touchdowns against USC, but the top-ranked Bruins lost when a
junior running back named O.J. Simpson scored on a 64-yard run.
Beban won the 1967 Heisman, but Simpson's run gave him a head start
on winning it in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 15 years, the one-game wonders have increased.
Boston College quarterback Doug Flutie sealed his 1984 Heisman with
his miraculous last-second touchdown pass against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Making a one-game impact is especially valuable in a year when
the Heisman race is wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan wide receiver Desmond Howard made a spectacular,
game-winning touchdown catch against Notre Dame in 1991. ``For
Desmond Howard, that award was his from the day he stretched out
and made the touchdown catch in the end zone against Notre Dame,''
Weiberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Ohio State running back Eddie George, performing in
front of a press box full of writers (and Heisman voters), broke
open the Notre Dame game with a long touchdown run. The postgame
conversation: ``Hey, is this guy a candidate now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a reason why the Heisman can be decided by one game is
the big games draw a lot of attention, national TV,'' said Kirk
Herbstreit, analyst for ESPN's ``College GameDay''. ``If you can
display your talents in that game, that's going to enhance your
chances. If you have one big game and do OK in the rest, I think
that can be enough.''

CLINTON GIVES PEP TALK TO U.S. TROOPS IN KOREA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ President Clinton sharpened U.S. warnings
to North Korea Sunday as he convyed Thanksgiving greetings to
front-line American combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   The commander-in-chief, wearing a green aviator jacket and a
baseball cap emblazoned with ``President Clinton,'' issued his
latest warning to North Korea during a rousing, 12-minute pep talk
to troops at Osan Air Base, a facility bristling with F-16
fighters, A-10 ground attack aircraft and Patriot anti-missile
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The president said North Korea must halt nuclear weapons
development and stop what he described as ``efforts to develop and
proliferate chemical and biological weapons and ballistic
missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to press North Korea to take these steps for
peace and security,'' Clinton told Air Force personnel. ``But until
it fully commits itself to a constructive role on this peninsula,
we must remain ready. And thanks to you, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton drew loose parallels between North Korea's reluctance to
respond to outside entreaties and Iraq's stubborn defiance of an
eight-year international campaign to inspect the degree to which
the Baghdad government has developed weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though our attention lately has been focused on Iraq's
efforts, North Korea is also a major concern,'' Clinton said.
``Here at Osan, you are critical to this most dangerous
battleground _ deterring and if necessary defending against
chemical and biological attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who returns to Washington, D.C., Monday night, has
devoted much of his visit to Japan and South Korea to trying to
persuade North Korea to halt test firings of 3,300-mile-range
missiles and construction of an underground site that U.S.
officials suspect may have a role in developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton beamed as he fraternized with hundreds of the 37,500
U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attended church services at the multi-denominational
Memorial Chapel at Yongsan, the U.S. military headquarters located
on 630 acres in downtown Seoul. Seated adjacent to the president
was Army Gen. John H. Tilelli Jr., commander of U.S. forces in
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning the political travails that await Clinton
back home, Rev. Jerry Robinson recalled the humorous tale of a
young boy saying his prayers. The youngster, after appealing to God
to take care of his family, added: ``Please take care of yourself,
God, because if anything happens to you, we are all sunk.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaplain injected: ``Ain't that the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent 10 minutes after the service greeting
parishioners, some of whom were in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   After swapping his business suit for the aviator jacket and
baseball cap, Clinton took a 22-minute helicopter flight to the
Korean Training Center, the mountainous live-fire training complex
12 miles south of the 151-mile long Demilitarized Zone dividing
North Korea and South Korea since the armistice in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shook troops' hands, signed autographs, stood for
photographs and passed out free telephone calling cards to eager
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conducted an impromptu promotion ceremony for Private
First Class Matt E. Prickett, from West Liberty, Ohio, who moved up
to Specialist 4th class.
</P>
<P>
   Learning that Sunday was another soldier's birthday, Clinton
spontaneously led troops singing ``Happy Birthday'' for the 2nd
Infantry Division's top enlisted soldier, Command Sgt. Maj. Charles
Thomas, of Wilson, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciate him doing it,'' said Thomas, who turned
45. ``It definitely caught me off guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lunched with the troops, as well, digging into
green-plastic packaged combat rations known as MREs _ Meals Ready
to Eat. Clinton's meal included a grilled chicken breast patty,
Mexican-style rice, crackers, jelly, condiments and pound cake.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, mindful that many of the GIs would be here in Korea
without their families on Thanksgiving, appealed to Americans back
home to remember the troops women in uniform here on the Korean
peninsula. During his remarks at Osan, he also mentioned the names
of four GIs killed in a training accident last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``May the American people never forget this work is difficult
and dangerous,'' Clinton said, adding: ``I hope that all Americans
as they sit down to their turkey and give thanks for all our
blessings will consider the debt of gratitude we all owe to our men
and women in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke just a few miles from Juk Mi Pass where 540
American GIs, rushed in from Japan in response to the North Korean
invasion in 1950, battled 5,000 troops storming southward. During
seven hours of combat, Task Force Smith suffered 150 killed in
action _ the first of more than 36,916 Americans killed in combat,
110,000 wounded and 8,200 missing in a war in which 5.7 million
Americans served.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should doubt today our joint commitment to freedom,''
Clinton said.

 &HT;    Miss Lettermans' late show? Tune into funny fifth year special
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Late Show With David Letterman Fifth Anniversary Special''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   9:30 tonight on CBS (26520)
</P>
<P>
   The Verdict: Truly special.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great unanswered questions of the '90s is: Did David
Letterman change, or did we? He used to be the hipsters' darling, a
post-modern Ernie Kovacks who was continually re-inventing what it
meant to do a talk show.
</P>
<P>
   But hardly anybody talks about Dave any more. His ``Late Show''
usually takes awhile each night to rev up, particularly compared to
chatterin' Jay Leno (Letterman was always the lesser monologist).
The Top 10 List has become the Top 10 Limp.
</P>
<P>
   But once you get 20-30 minutes into each show, Letterman usually
takes the measure of Leno. His reactions are fresher, and when the
moon is full and Drew Barrymore climbs onto his desk, there's still
a sense of freshness and spontaneity about the show. And in terms
of getting the best musical guests, there's no contest; Letterman
(more likely his bandleader Paul Shaffer, or the booker, or
whoever) is more knowledgable about who's cool than the backstage
guard at the MTV Awards.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been too tired for ``Late Show'' lately, CBS has a
major treat for you: a 90-minute special that is as flat-out funny
as anything that's aired this year. And you can turn out the light
at 11.
</P>
<P>
   The special is a mix of five years' worth of greatest-hits clips
and very solid new material. The old stuff includes Madonna's
bleep-out attack on Dave, Drew Barrymore's flash-dance, and
earth-to-Farrah Fawcett's memorable zone-out; Dave's wonderful
unscripted talks with kids and his ``Candid Camera'' bits, like
taking over the drive-through at a Taco Bell and harassing
customers. New stuff includes a celeb-laden Top 10 list with Cindy
Crawford, Puff Daddy and Dave's Mom (what a green room that must
have been as they waited to get on) and a great bit with Steve
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Just how painstaking Dave is (on himself and on his staff) can
be seen in the obligatory collage of musical guests. Rather than
just string 'em all together, ``Late Show'' juxtaposes them
cleverly: John Fogerty sings ``I ain't no millionaire's son'' right
before Jakob Dylan and the Wallflowers appear; a singing Dan Rather
segues to Michael Stipe and R.E.M. (``What's the Frequency
Kenneth'' is based on a Rather line).
</P>
<P>
   So even if it's been a while since you've stayed up for Dave _
or especially if it's been a while _ this anniversary show is an
absolute don't-miss.

   Clinton Tours Korean troops
</P>

   By Bob Deans

   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   TONGDUCHON, South Korea _ It was a bivouac birthday Charles
Thomas will never forget.
</P>
<P>
   Shivering in the mud amid the craggy peaks and windblown valleys
of an isolated U.S. Army training camp just 12 miles south of the
North Korea border, Command Sgt. Thomas, a native of Wilson, N.C.,
was a long way from home for his 45th birthday on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton helicoptered in aboard Marine One,
however, he learned that Thomas was unlikely to be blowing out
candles this year, so he led perhaps 100 U.S. and South Korean
infantry troops and tank crews in an impromptu singing of ``Happy
Birthday to Charles,'' who then joined the president in a lunch of
MREs, those packaged meals that fortify U.S. troops in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciate him doing it, it was unexpected,'' Thomas
told Commerce Secretary William Daley, who was part of Clinton's
delegation. ``It definitely caught me off guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas wasn't the only soldier to be feted by the Commander in
Chief.
</P>
<P>
   Matt E. Prickett of West Liberty, Ohio, turned out for Clinton's
arrival wearing the insignia of a lowly Private First Class E-3,
and was promoted to Specialist E-4 in a bit of improvisational
presidential pomp and ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' Clinton said as he pinned on the
designation of Prickett's new rank before an array of U.S. and
Korean tanks and armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   After an MRE (that's Pentagon lingo for ``meals ready to eat'')
of processed chicken breast, strangely akin to Vienna sausage in
taste, spicy rice, crackers and pound cake, Clinton boarded the
presidential helicopter and journeyed south to the U.S. Air Base at
Osan.
</P>
<P>
   There, poised before some rather explicit tools of U.S. foreign
policy an F-16 fighter jet and an A-10 ground attack plane Clinton
expressed his thanks for the work American forces abroad do
everyday on behalf of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came, more than anything else, to say on behalf of all the
American people, we thank you for your service to the United
States,'' Clinton told some 3,000 cheering flyers and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask so much of you to travel far from home, to work long
hours, to risk your lives,'' Clinton said. ``You have made the
world a better place and ... you have made us very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who avoided the draft as a Vietnam-era youth, has had a
sometimes rocky relationship with the military, where careers are
often dashed by the sorts of relationships Clinton has acknowledged
to have had with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, though, Clinton was at ease and warmly welcomed by
the men and women who speak of their Korea duty as life on
``Freedom's Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 37,000 American troops posted in South Korea are
just a couple hours by tank or a few minutes by jet fighter from
North Korea's own combat-ready forces.
</P>
<P>
   For these troops, the oft-used term ``in harm's way,'' is no
mere platitude.
</P>
<P>
   It manifested itself vividly on Sunday morning, when Clinton
attended services at the Yongsan Army Base in Seoul, at the
Memorial Chapel, dedicated, simply, to the American fighting men
and women who've lost their lives in the defense of their country
and it's wide-reaching interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Chapel's simple altar is rimmed with flags from every state
in the Union put into use for individual memorial services held
when American forces lose their lives here in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whisper gently to each soldier, airman, sailor and marine,''
Chaplain Jerry Robinson implored in the morning prayer, ''let not
your heart be troubled.''
</P>
<P>
   And with his nation's president sitting attentively just three
rows away, Robinson closed the service with a light story about a
little boy who kneeled by his bedside to ask for protection and
blessings for his family, before ending with the appeal, ``But
please take care of yourself God, because if anything happens to
you, we are all sunk.''
</P>
<P>
   To which the Chaplain added simply yet poetically, ``And ain't
it the truth.''

   After Asian Trip Clinton Faces Rocky Fall
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Deans
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Winding up a five-day Asia swing, President
Clinton returns tonight to Washington, where he faces pressing
domestic and international concerns amid a widening impeachment
probe on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   He may soon be nostalgic for Asia.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of his Asian tour, Clinton's aims were
modest. The White House said it was a trip designed to reassure
Washington's closest Pacific allies that they remain important to
the United States despite economic turmoil and regional security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   As he left Korea Sunday evening, Clinton not only appeared to
meet those goals but he may have made progress with one of the
thorniest issue: how to deal with North Korea. By explaining in the
strongest terms to date his rationale behind trying to engage North
Korea, Clinton gave coherence to several of his administration's
diplomatic initiatives to find some common ground with the United
States has in the past treated as a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   But how much will all of this help Clinton with his own agenda
back home?
</P>
<P>
   Not much.
</P>
<P>
   Short of war, foreign policy successes, even when they are
clearly enunciated and relevant to people's lives, seldom generate
anything other than the faintest murmur of a domestic echo. The
political ping Clinton gets from reaffirming the status quo in the
Pacific alliance will hardly drown out the din of scandal he'll
return to in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton immediately faces a new round of inquiries before the
House Judiciary Committee, even as Attorney General Janet Reno is
expected to announce by Tuesday whether to appoint an independent
counsel to look into questions about Vice President Al Gore's 1996
fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee begins this week looking into
allegations stemming from a former White House volunteer's claim
that the president once groped her during an Oval Office meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), has said he would like
the panel to wind up over the next three weeks its review of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation into Clinton's
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The panel could vote by mid-December on whether to send articles
of impeachment to the full House for action.
</P>
<P>
   With public opinion strongly behind him, Clinton will try to
stay above the fray publicly at least and continue to let his
battery of personal and White House attorneys address the daily ebb
and flow of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust the American people, and I hope Congress will do the
right thing,'' Clinton said on Saturday. ``I think the less I say
about what should happen to me at this point, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear depositions this
week from two witnesses in the case of former White House volunteer
Kathleen Willey, who has said Clinton once groped her during a
private Oval Office meeting, a charge the White House has denied.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has also subpoenaed Robert Bennett, Clinton's
lawyer in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, and the
president's closest confidant, Bruce Lindsey. Both are expected to
appear before the committee during the week after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal troubles are only one facet of a crowded
international and domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   He'll receive no rest, for example, from Iraqi dictator Saddam
Hussein, who narrowly escaped air strikes last weekend and has
already begun fudging on the terms of his reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used a visit Sunday to the U.S. Air Base in Osan to
underscore the role of military muscle behind the diplomacy he's
used to try to end Saddam's quest for chemical and biological arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest threats the world now faces is weapons of
mass destruction,'' Clinton told some 3,000 pilots, mechanics and
their families gathered at the windswept base 30 miles south of
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before an F-16 fighter jet and an A-10 tank killer two
of the types of aircraft that were tasked to the strikes Clinton
ordered then aborted last weekend against Iraq, Clinton warned
darkly that he remains prepared to order strikes again if that's
what's needed to ensure that Baghdad permits United Nations
inspections teams to ferret out and destroy Saddam's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to succeed in promoting peace,'' Clinton told a
cheering crowd, ``is uniquely due to the fact that we can back up
our diplomatic efforts when necessary with military strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his visit, North Korea reacted in typical fashion. In
a harsh editorial, North's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)
stated: ``The Korean peninsula has become a most tense and
sensitive hotspot in the world as a result of the U.S. reckless war
provocation moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, U.S. and North Korean officials plan to sit down
over the next four months in at least five different venues to take
up a series of separate but related issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ International inspections of an underground construction site
to ensure it won't be used to make nuclear bomb material;
</P>
<P>
   maintenance of a four-year-old freeze in the country's alleged
nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   _ North Korea's ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   _ The construction of a $4 billion pair of nuclear power plants
in North Korea by the United States, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   _ The exchange of remains and information about troops killed or
missing in action from the 1950-1953 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talks on how to build confidence and perhaps one day make
peace between Koreans from the North and South.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings aren't solutions.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, establishing dialogue as the way to help focus a policy
resting on diplomacy, nonproliferation and deterrence is a far cry
from where things stood just four years ago, when communications
between Washington and Pyongyang ranged from acrimonious to
non-existent and the two countries wound up on a dangerous war
footing over the issue of how to end North Korea's menacing quest
for nuclear bombs.

does it,'' she said. He is not messy, she said. He is just a man
who knows what the inside of a box looks like, when it closes shut.
``I don't like closing up nothin','' said Williams, who served 30
years in Angola Prison for a killing he played no part in. He was
freed last year, though he knew that being turned loose and
actually living free, free in his own mind, are not the same. He
walked into prison at 19. Now he is almost 50, living in a world he
does not remember, constantly afraid some minor blunder, some
trivial brush with the law, some bad luck, will steal his freedom
again. By Rick Bragg.

   FOOL-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ ``Fool Moon,'' created by and
starring Bill Irwin and David Shiner, has been to Broadway twice
before, in 1993 and 1995, and it returns for an engagement that
runs through Jan. 3. This isn't a themed seasonal show of the kind
provided by Radio City Music Hall or Madison Square Garden, nor is
it even particularly topical. Much of it could have been performed,
with only limited revisions, in a town square in Italy during the
Renaissance, and the audience would have gotten it. Ben Brantley
reviews.

   TOWN-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ The city that never sleeps is

energies slowly surfacing. Ben Brantley reviews.

   NYER-POLICE-AUTHOR _ In his personal essays for The New Yorker
magazine, the author known only by the pseudonym ``Marcus Laffey''
has written eloquently about the sorrows of potters' field and the
daily grind of a New York City police officer's beat. Last week, he
signed a book deal for a reported $995,000 to write a personal
memoir of his life as a police officer. The sale of the book has
drawn attention to the fact that the author does, in fact, write
from behind the protection of a false name, which raises a flurry

appropriate? And why does The New Yorker choose to let him? By Alex

MORE PATENTS BEING GRANTED TO HERBAL ENTREPRENEURS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa., N.J., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Three years ago, the U.S. Patent Office published new guidelines
that loosened its standards for granting certain medically related
patents.
 &HT;    The biotechnology sector, in particular, had sought such a
change, complaining that the Food and Drug Administration should
determine whether a potential drug was safe and effective. The
Patent Office, it argued, should stick to deciding whether
something was novel enough to deserve a patent.
 &HT;    Under old standards for granting so-called utility patents, the
Patent Office took a critical view of medicinal claims, often
refusing to issue a patent if the applicant could not prove a
drug's usefulness. Biotechnology companies contended that without
patent protection in the first place, they could not get financing
for clinical testing to prove claims.
 &HT;    But biotechnology companies are not the only ones to benefit
from the policy shift.
 &HT;    A recent, informal database search suggests that herbal
entrepreneurs are forging ahead with patent applications that a few
years ago the Patent Office would have turned down cold. Five years
ago, only a handful of patents appear to have been granted for
herbal preparations with medicinal purposes. So far in 1998, at
least a dozen such patents have been issued.
 &HT;    ``I'm a little bit amazed by some of these,'' said Colin
Sandercock, a partner at the law firm of Foley &AMP; Lardner in
Washington. ``What you're seeing is the Patent Office taking the
position that in light of the new guidelines, they are not going to
challenge the efficacy of the claimed treatment.''
 &HT;    Many of the new patents, Sandercock said, are very limited in
scope, and might be easily and legally circumvented should they
prove to be popular. ``With the keen interest in vitamins and
herbal remedies, many people are probably getting patents primarily
for a marketing edge,'' he said.
 &HT;    Here are a few patents granted this year under the new rules:

   A New Application for Ancient Herbs
</P>
<P>
   An herbal patent issued last week appears to be rather sweeping
in its claims for the use of herbs in treating HIV, leukemia and
various forms of hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   The patent was jointly granted to Shie-Ming Hwang, a chemist in
Columbus, Ohio; his cousin Hsiu-Hsien Tsai, a physician in Taiwan,
and Pai-Chu Kung, a pharmacist and Tsai's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai, who was trained in Western medicine, became frustrated
with poor results when using interferon to treat patients with
Hepatitis B, Hwang said. So Tsai turned to traditional Chinese
herbal medicine, concocting a powder of 11 herbs that was mixed
with water and taken several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a formal clinical trial, but it appeared to
significantly lower levels of Hepatitis B,'' Hwang said.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent laboratory testing suggests that the herbal
combination may help patients with HIV and leukemia. But how is it
that the use of these herbs, which have been used for thousands of
years in Chinese medicine, can be patented? The answer appears to
be that the three inventors have come up with a new use for the
ancient herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Hwang, Tsai, and Kung received patent 5,837,257.

   Combining Herbs for Weight Loss
</P>
<P>
   St. Johnswort has attracted considerable attention for its
reputed success in combating depression. And ephedrine, an herb
known for its amphetamine-like qualities, has developed a
reputation for accelerating weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Haveson, of Yardley, Pa., contends that the two herbs,
when taken together, act synergistically to suppress appetite and
burn calories. A patent he received for a combination of the herbs
cites a small, unpublished study as evidence. In that study, a
dozen overweight individuals lost eight pounds in six weeks by
taking both St. Johnswort and ephedrine twice a day, according to
the patent.
</P>
<P>
   Haveson received patent 5,798,101 for his herbal combination.

<P>
   An Herbal Substitute for a Nicotine Patch
</P>
<P>
   Plantago, a weed known as common plaintain, has been extolled
for centuries for its healing properties. Since the 1920s, this
herb has also been reputed to suppress the desire of smokers to
reach for a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Cody, of Boonton Township, N.J., has invented the herbal
answer to the nicotine skin patch: a transdermal version of
Plantago. Rather than delivering nicotine slowly to the
bloodstream, though, it delivers an extract of the herb.
</P>

   Cats have has appreciated catnip for millennia. But it has never
held much allure for dogs. Enter valerian, until now mostly known
for its putative sedative power over humans.
</P>
<P>
   Vsande Childers-Zadah, of West Palm Beach, Fla., has patented
the use of valerian root in chew toys and food treats for pets.
Valerian is irresistible to both dogs and cats, the patent
contends.
</P>
<P>
   Childers-Zadah received patent 5,786,382.
</P>

   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

NEW RIOTING IN INDONESIA LEAVES 6 DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A gang fight between Muslims and Christian
migrants erupted into fierce rioting Sunday in this already tense
city. Officials reported that six people were killed and nearly a
dozen churches were burned or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The rioting was not related to the political demonstrations and
military gunfire that have kept the city on edge for more than a
week. But it was a sharp reminder of the potential for violence
that lies just beneath the surface of Indonesia as it suffers
through a period of political turmoil and deep economic pain.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two years _ beginning well before the political and
economic crisis that forced former President Suharto from office in
May _ the country has suffered an epidemic of local riots touched
off by grievances and conflicts of all sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The clash Sunday involved Catholic migrants from the eastern
island of Amboina and did not at first focus on the ethnic Chinese
who have been the target of much of the recent violence here. But
the arson and looting spread quickly into Chinese neighborhoods,
where residents armed and barricaded themselves in a now-familiar
drill.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Sunday's violence appeared to have erupted
following a dispute at a gambling hall and a stone-throwing attack
by Ambonese Catholics on a mosque.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst outbreak of violence to hit Jakarta's Chinese
neighborhoods since the huge riots in mid-May that helped push
Suharto from office. Most of the damage from those riots remains,
with shops still standing in burned-out rows and several department
stores blackened and empty.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted officials as saying that at least 11
churches had been vandalized and four burned on Sunday. A gambling
hall was set on fire, and a Catholic girls school was set alight
and ransacked. Scores of shops were burned or looted, and cars and
motorcycles were also set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Armored personnel carriers rolled through streets of smashed
storefronts, and troops fired tear gas and volleys of gunfire in an
attempt to subdue the crowds. By evening the riots had subsided and
lines of soldiers, redeployed from areas of the city where students
had been marching last week, stood guard against the mobs.
</P>
<P>
   The day had started quietly as the city, filled with sunshine,
seemed to settle down from more than a week of disturbances related
to a parliamentary session that set the groundwork for a general
election next year.
</P>
<P>
   Following the deaths of 16 demonstrators in clashes between
students and soldiers, the city has been filled over the past week
with student demonstrations, winding through the streets on foot or
on buses.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's violence quickly became deadly as gangs fought each
other with knives and sticks, throwing rocks and smashing windows.
</P>
<P>
   Mobs waved the green flag of a Muslim political party as they
surged down alleys in a Chinese quarter, where they targeted
gambling halls and karaoke bars as well as Christian churches,
witnesses said. At one church, they said, looters played musical
instruments from the church before smashing or stealing them.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on its continuing inquiry into its shootings of
demonstrators last week, the military said Sunday that live bullets
had been found in the bodies of some of the victims. But it said
they were of a kind that is not used by the military.
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman, Syamsu Maarf, also said 163 soldiers had
been disciplined for the shootings and beatings, including 12
officers who had failed to control their troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Armed Forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, who like many Indonesians
uses only one name, also repeated Sunday the government's assertion
that the violence last week was instigated by political figures
intent on bringing down President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   ``These radical groups mobilized the students and joined with
them,'' the general said. ``They also mobilized civilian mobs.''

<P>
   Nothing raises a company's profile like a billion-dollar deal.
So it is that the spotlight now shines on BMC Software Inc. and
Boole &AMP; Babbage Inc., two companies that have long labored in the
obscure world of systems management.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, BMC, based in Houston, agreed to acquire Boole,
based in San Jose, Calif., in a stock swap valued at more than $900
million. Analysts praised the merger as bringing together two
strong players with compatible cultures. Both companies have
consistently met or exceeded Wall Street earnings estimates; both
sell to the same major corporate and governmental customers, but
their products do not overlap.
</P>
<P>
   BMC's shares fell $2 after the deal was announced Nov. 2, to
$46.0625; they closed on Friday at $46.8125, down 37.5 cents. Boole
shares, which jumped $3.50 on the news of the deal, to $30.125,
closed Friday at $30.625, down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Systems management software is a broad category of programs that
function behind the scenes to make sure that big mainframes and
far-flung networks of distributed computers keep working reliably
and efficiently. Perhaps the best analog on the desktop is a
product like Symantec Corp.'s Norton Utilities, which alerts users
to hard disk errors or operating system glitches and then does its
best to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   But a major corporate computing system, whether based on a
traditional mainframe or spread among Unix servers, is a vastly
more complex environment than a personal computer, so the products
that monitor and trouble-shoot these systems must be powerful and
sophisticated as well.
</P>
<P>
   And while corporations and other large organizations have always
been concerned about maintaining high availability in their core
computing systems, the move to electronic commerce and the Internet
has made this a strategic need. Companies like FDX's Federal
Express, which lets customers track packages on its Web site,
depend on BMC's and Boole's programs to keep those systems up and
running at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these companies have been in business for a long time _
since 1980 for BMC, and 1967 for Boole &AMP; Babbage, which was named
for two 19th-century mathematicians. And to a great extent, they
owe their existence to the federal antitrust suit brought against
IBM Corp. three decades ago. The suit was ultimately dropped, but
it opened the door for rivals to sell hardware or software
compatible with the IBM mainframe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to the antitrust suit, companies like Boole &AMP; Babbage
did not exist because mainframe software was given away for free,''
said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research. ``You're dealing
with companies that were the pioneers of the software industry,
well before Bill Gates finished high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Boole and BMC got their starts offering software for IBM
mainframes, and they still derive the biggest share of their
revenue from this business. But both have also moved into so-called
client-server systems, in which computing is split between larger
server machines and small clients. Those servers might be
mainframes, Unix systems or Wintel machines; the clients could be
Sun work stations, personal computers or a bank's network of
automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, we provide all of the tools and controls to make
sure these critical applications deliver data to the end user,
regardless of platform,'' said Paul Newton, Boole's president and
chief executive. Newton plans to remain with the combined company
for about a year to oversee the transition.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between the two companies' product offerings
is that while Boole's primarily monitor the network itself, making
sure servers serve and routers route appropriately, BMC's products
work with major applications, like an Oracle database or SAP's R-3
software, insuring that data is available and structured correctly.
Most big companies use both.
</P>
<P>
   When they do their jobs right, products like Boole's Command
Post or BMC's Patrol are invisible to end users. But they provide
information systems management staff a virtual dashboard with which
to monitor problems and optimize performance. In many cases, the
programs can spot an error, alert network administrators to its
existence and repair the problem without ever interrupting the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the system rolls over and croaks, we get it back up and
running in a very rapid, automated manner,'' said Max Watson, BMC's
chairman, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors include IBM itself, through its Tivoli unit;
Computer Associates; Candle Inc., a privately held company in Santa
Monica, Calif., and Platinum Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Platinum sued to block the merger. The company
contends that Boole had agreed not to merge with any other company
after talks between Boole and Platinum broke down earlier this year
and that, in return, Platinum had agreed not to make a hostile
takeover bid for Boole. Boole officials said last week that the
suit was without merit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   BMC has grown faster and enjoyed greater profit margins than
Boole, but both companies have had consistent earnings growth.
Excluding one-time charges, BMC reported earnings for its fiscal
second quarter, ended Sept. 30, of $74.7 million, or 33 cents a
diluted share, up 55 percent from the corresponding period a year
earlier. Revenue increased 45 percent, to $235.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Boole reported earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, ended
Sept. 30, of $10.3 million, or 34 cents a diluted share, up 41
percent from a year earlier. Revenue grew 11 percent, to $58.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he was confident that the combined company would
bring Boole's growth and margin rates up to BMC's levels. ``Boole
has a pretty good win rate, they just don't have a big enough sales
force,'' he said. ``I anticipate growing them faster than they ever
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree that the merged companies should benefit from a
broader product offering and will be well positioned to serve
companies moving into electronic commerce and online transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the combination is a powerful one that will redefine
this space,'' said Jon Oltsik, an analyst with Forrester Research.
``They are moving from tools to make information technology
professionals' lives easier, to tools to make applications more
readily available to customers. That's a space that not only
appeals to the technology folks, but the business folks as well.''

BUILDING (AND CELEBRATING) A NEW-MEDIA COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANET STITES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In October, the New York New Media Association held
Cybersuds, its monthly networking event, in an empty office space
downtown provided by the real estate firm of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   The mix included two partners from the Bryan Cave law firm, who
were canvassing the crowd for potential clients; an associate from
the Coopers &AMP; Lybrand accounting firm working the door; and a woman
sporting a bare midriff with a name tag that simply read
``Shasha.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the diversity of the New York new-media community _ and
the fragmentation that often keeps it from being taken seriously.
That said, the association's Cybersuds events have proved to be a
bellwether of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the founders tell it, NYNMA (pronounced NIN-muh) was
founded in October 1995 so that ``we could stop flying to
California every other week to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a serious new-media industry already operating here
in New York,'' said Cella Irvine, NYNMA's incoming chairman. ``But
it was fragmented and diverse. We launched Cybersuds to help people
in New York do business with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Cybersuds, organized in the fall of 1994, took place
at the trendy El Teddy's in Manhattan's TriBeCa neighborhood. It
was not a propitious beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stood in the bar,'' recalled Ms. Irvine, whose day-job
title is general manager of Microsoft's New York Sidewalk. ``The
next time we asked for a private room upstairs. Eventually we got
kicked out because we couldn't get the bar tab high enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Cybersuds grew exponentially over the following year,
as much a monthly social scene as an industry event. It also became
a source of controversy: Was it simply a beer bash and pick-up
party or a real business event? For a time, finding a potential
strategic partner and a date for the weekend were one and the same.
Still, it was relatively painless to attend, and even the most
serious new-media executive could leave with at least one solid
contact to make it worth his or her while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cybersuds is an important part of the industry,'' said Alice
Rodd O'Rourke, executive director of NYNMA. ``People go who are
looking to try to get into the industry or looking to hire people.
At the end of the day, we find something very valuable in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also became the association's signature event, which
until the last year overshadowed its other, more ambitious
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The association, which charges $125 for individual memberships,
offers, among other programs, expert panels to help entrepreneurs
develop their businesses and an executive breakfast series to
promote industry networking. It also organized an Angel investors
group to put entrepreneurs together with potential seed capital.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Cybersuds prompted the organization to start a
mini-trade show called Super Cybersuds, an event that gave
companies in Silicon Alley _ a loosely defined area downtown that
has been popular with new-media concerns _ an opportunity to show
off their wares.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of Super Cybersuds, Ms. Rourke said, was to create a
trade show focused solely on the New York new-media community,
giving Silicon Alley an opportunity to see how far it has come and
where it is heading.
</P>
<P>
   The first two Super Cybersuds were held at a studio in Queens.
Last year, the event moved up in scale, attracting nearly 2,500
people to the swanky Puck Building in the SoHo district of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And on a cold, windy evening earlier this month, more than 3,000
people trekked to Chelsea Piers on the Hudson River waterfront to
gnaw on carrot sticks and check out 100 exhibits by a mix of
Silicon Alley start-ups, established corporations like Ericsson,
the Sweden-based electronics giant that maintains a new-media
laboratory in Manhattan, and trade publications.
</P>
<P>
   People squeezed past each other to visit the booths and pick up
what freebies they could _ penguins from Ericsson AB, bubble pens
from Digex Inc. and popcorn from Kozmo.com. And though the crowd
size reached an uncomfortable level, there was a spirit of
excitement and accomplishment in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of Cybersuds from industry frat party to trade
show offered evidence of how quickly New York's new-media industry
had emerged and matured. It was also a victory in the association's
struggle to be taken seriously and to be seen as relevant.
</P>
<P>
   If Super Cybersuds is to become a true trade show _ the
direction it seems to be headed _ it may simply need a little more
elbow room and a new name to distance itself from its sister event.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways the new-media scene _ as distinct from the
industry _ has become a social outlet that for another generation
might have been discos or clubbing: the ``Bright Lights, Big City''
of the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Any given week brings four or five parties to celebrate Web
sites being started or restarted or offices being opened. Trendy
venues like Irving Plaza, the Knitting Factory and Webster Hall all
count new-media companies high on their client list. New York new
media have their own gossip columnist, Courtney Pulitzer, who works
by day as a public relations account executive, by night as a
professional partygoer.
</P>
<P>
   While all the festivities make for a vibrant community, the
industry is still struggling to prove that it really is an
industry. Some of the more over-the-top events, which have included
body-piercing and go-go dancers, have raised eyebrows in the
investment community and made others uncomfortable, including more
conservative entrepreneurs who are desperately seeking respect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it may prove difficult for New York new media to divorce
itself from its Silicon Alley roots. The industry may always be
about profit and loss, venture capital, public offerings and
Shasha, too.

FEAR OF LAWSUITS AFFECTS LOCAL TV NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By PAMELA MERCER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One out of every five local television news directors
around the country say their stations have declined to broadcast
some news reports in the last year because of fears of possible
lawsuits, according to a recent survey conducted by the University
of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that an additional 28 percent of the news
directors polled reported omitting key information from a news
report out of similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was conducted by the Center for the Advancement
of Modern Media at the University of Miami School of Communication,
tracked the responses of 360 local television news directors and
compared them with the results of a survey taken three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of those questioned who said their stations had
been sued for libel in the last three years increased by 8
percentage points, to 38 percent, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   To stave off possible lawsuits, stations are consulting lawyers
more frequently before broadcasting news reports than they did in
1995. Also, the percentage of those who have hired professional
news consultants in the last three years grew to 78 percent from 59
percent three years ago, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing concerns about liability, however, more news
stations have resorted to aggressive news-gathering tactics. This
is because while legal concerns among the stations have deepened,
the added competition from more nightly news magazines and 24-hour
news channels has threatened their ratings, forcing them to seek
out riskier stories in a bid to grab the audience's attention,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a greater propensity to sue,'' said Paul Driscoll,
one of the study's authors. ``More business executives carry
insurance that allows them to sue.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There is so much pressure on news directors to get
higher ratings that they've got to do all kinds of stories that
will keep the audience's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   More television news programs _ 63 percent, compared with 53
percent three years ago _ resorted to the use of hidden microphones
and hidden cameras as a means for gathering material, according to
the survey.

CONCERNS ABOUT JAMMING SURROUND NEW AIR-NAVIGATION SYSTEM

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An improved navigational system for airplanes is
nearing completion, but no one seems certain how well the
satellite-based technology meets the aviation industry's
extraordinary need for reliability.
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. missile attack on Iraq, if tensions escalate to that
level, could provide a clue. Ten days ago, when an air strike
against that country appeared imminent, civilian air navigation
experts were intent on learning whether Iraq would be able to jam
the electronic signals of the satellites, which are used for both
military and civilian applications. And with many foreign-policy
analysts still expecting an eventual attack, the navigational
system may yet have its trial by fire.
</P>
<P>
   The new method is based on the Global Positioning System, a halo
of two dozen satellites originally meant for troops and missiles
but now also used by hikers, farmers, surveyors, trucking companies
and many pilots of private planes to determine quickly and
accurately where they are.
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines have also begun using GPS for long trips over
water where there are no ground-based navigation aids available, as
well as for landings and to augment other navigational methods. The
Federal Aviation Administration formerly planned to use GPS to
replace all ground-based navigation aids. But to address
reliability concerns, the FAA is now thinking of retaining at least
a third of the old system, which consists of an aging network of
radio beacons called VHF omnidirectional radios, which are used for
long-distance navigation, and instrument landing systems, which are
available at a small number of runways.
</P>
<P>
   If GPS were widely adopted for civilian aviation, air-traffic
controllers could safely squeeze airborne jetliners closer together
near big airports and the system would give even tiny airports
first-class guidance capabilities. But GPS is subject to jamming _
electronic interference that can disrupt signals from the
satellites to navigational receivers. Just how big a problem
jamming might be _ whether through mistakes or through deliberate
steps by foreign enemies, terrorists or vandals _ is open to
debate. And with such uncertainty, no one knows for sure how much
of the old system should be maintained as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   Some answers may come from the Johns Hopkins University Applied
Physics Laboratory, which is in the latter half of a six-month,
$500,000 study of whether GPS should replace all existing forms of
civil aviation navigation aids. The study was recommended by a
White House task force a year ago, because of concerns about
jamming, and it is being sponsored by the FAA and organizations
representing the major airlines and private plane owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking at is, Does GPS cover us in all
circumstances?'' said Helen Worth, a spokeswoman for the
laboratory, which is in Laurel, Md. ``If there is a circumstance
where it could be disabled,'' Ms. Worth said, ``I would say that's
an area of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The GPS system has already been accidentally jammed at least
three times. In December 1997 and again in February of this year,
airlines reported losing GPS signals near Albany, N.Y.
Investigators eventually found that an Air Force laboratory in
nearby Rome, N.Y., had used a five-watt transmitter to test the
reception ability of antennas, and inadvertently left the
transmitter running.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA official cited a third case, involving a McDonnell
Douglas plant in St. Louis that was testing a jammer for use on
fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
   But in these cases, because the full complement of conventional
aviation navigation aids is still in place, the jamming was only an
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   Hostilities with Iraq, if they resume, would be a new category.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the Super Bowl of jamming,'' said
Langhorne Bond, a former head of the FAA who has been arguing in
recent months that his former agency needs to maintain a backup
system and not rely solely on GPS.
</P>
<P>
   Bond and others say that a new attack on Iraq would be the first
instance of using GPS-guided weapons against a target country that
knew they were coming. In the Persian Gulf war in 1990, many of the
cruise missiles had no GPS systems; with those missiles that did,
the Iraqis had no experience with such weapons. In last summer's
U.S. cruise missile attacks against presumed bases of Osama bin
Laden in Afghanistan and the Sudan, the targets had no warning.
</P>
<P>
   GPS receivers, whether a sophisticated device in a cruise
missile or a portable gadget in a hiker's backpack, listen for
signals from several of the satellites, which circle the globe at
an altitude of 10,900 nautical miles, each broadcasting its
location and identity. The receiver records the time of arrival of
each satellite's signal to calculate the distance from the
spacecraft. By combining several calculations from several
satellites, a process known as triangulation, the receiver can
determine its position.
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines already use GPS on long over-water routes, and
private pilots use it widely for all sorts of flights. For civil
aviation, the allure of GPS is that the satellites are already in
place, in the form of those circling satellites. The FAA is
installing supplementary equipment on the ground to make the
signals even more accurate. For the airlines, making use if it is
largely a matter of equipping a plane with a GPS receiver. By
contrast, the conventional civilian navigation system is expensive
to maintain, and the FAA has never had enough money to put
sophisticated instrument landing systems at all the airports that
want them.
</P>
<P>
   But the older system does have its advantages. While individual
components of it can fail or even be knocked out deliberately, the
failure of a single ground-based radio beacon is a little like the
failure of a single street light _ seldom critical. For any given
plane, if no other navigation aid were available, GPS jamming would
at least temporarily force the aircraft to fly blind, or even land
blind.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What is more, GPS signals are very weak compared with signals
from existing civilian aviation radio beacons. That is why an Iraqi
conflict would be looked to as a rare real-life experiment in GPS
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that they have no specific evidence of Iraqi
preparations to jam the signals, but that such efforts have been
anticipated for years and could be quite simple. A Rand report
commissioned by the government three years ago raised the
possibility of an adversary using numerous battery-powered jammers,
each weighing only one or two pounds, and radiating as little as
one watt of energy _ only slightly more powerful than a hand-held
cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly speaking, jamming would involve filling the satellite's
radio channel with electronic noise that effectively drowns out the
relatively weak navigational signal emitted by the satellite _ a
mere whisper at one-tenth of one quadrillionth of a watt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planning assumption would have to be that they would try
to jam,'' John Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of
American Scientists, said of the Iraqi military. ``It's not that
difficult, and they've had a lot of guys who haven't had anything
else to worry about for the last six or seven years, other than
figuring out what, if anything, they can do to make our life more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamming a military receiver is harder than interfering with a
civilian one, because the coded signal that the satellites send to
military receivers is spread over a radio spectrum 10 times as wide
as the civilian one, 20 megahertz compared to 2 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   For jamming, the difference is comparable to using a ball-point
pen to draw a line to obscure the newspaper type in this sentence
(the civilian GPS signal) as opposed to drawing the same line
through the headline on this article.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles are also equipped with inertial guidance
systems, which would carry them across any gaps in the GPS signal,
as well as systems that can sense the shape of the terrain below,
and compare that with maps stored in their databanks. Once a
missile is in sight of a target, GPS is irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the military aim is only to get very close to the
target and assume the destructive power of the missile will take
care of the rest. For an airliner making a landing, merely close is
not good enough. And if the average accuracy of missiles is
decreased by jamming, a military commander can send two or three to
raise the chance that at least one making it to the target;
airlines would not stay in business very long by dispatching two or
three planes in zero visibility to insure that at least one load of
passengers safely reaches the destination.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a military conflict and if the Iraqis add GPS
jamming to their arsenal, the lessons for civil aviation might be
limited. The Pentagon, for example, might not disclose how well GPS
performed. Or, if the missiles work well anyway because of
alternate guidance systems on the missiles, the Pentagon itself may
not even know how well the GPS elements worked.
</P>
<P>
   But these possibilities have not stopped civilians from showing
interest. ``I think this is going to be absolutely fascinating,''
Bond said.

   An executive at a consulting firm that has done work in the
field said that the technology for jamming was not hypothetical.
``It's here today,'' said the executive, who asked not to be
further identified. If the Iraqis were to use such technology,
which he said was entirely possible, he added that it would be
``important for us to know what it portends for a civilian system,
and what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ryan, an air traffic expert at the Air Transport
Association, the trade group of the major U.S. airlines, said the
group was hoping that the Johns Hopkins research team would find
``mitigation techniques'' to deal with GPS jamming. One approach,
he said, might be an antenna that can be steered to screen out
stray signals, or a receiver that can filter them.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that the military approach to the problem would
probably be less subtle. If the St. Louis jamming episode had
occurred in a war zone, said George Donohue, a navigation and
technology expert who has held high positions both at the Pentagon
and the FAA, ``we'd have bombed McDonnell Douglas.''

   NEW YORK _ This, as you probably know, is Thanksgiving week, the
week signaling the headlong rush toward the holidays that increases
the exasperation factor in most New Yorkers' lives tenfold. It's
the time when you have to shop and you least want to, when traffic
moves at mere inches a minute, when pedestrians start bumping into
one another like bats without radar.
</P>
<P>
   People respond differently to this cruel and dangerous time.
Some go to bed, some go to bars, some go to tropical islands. But
the most sensible response is to go to ``Fool Moon,'' the wordless
comedy revue that finds the poetry in life's most basic
frustrations, at the Brooks Atkinson Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fool Moon,'' created by and starring Bill Irwin and David
Shiner, has been to Broadway twice before, in 1993 and 1995, and it
returns for an engagement that runs through Jan. 3, considerately
covering the span of holiday hell. This isn't a themed seasonal
show of the kind provided by Radio City Music Hall or Madison
Square Garden, nor is it even particularly topical. Much of it
could have been performed, with only limited revisions, in a town
square in Italy during the Renaissance, and the audience would have
gotten it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet through a series of mimed sketches, in which Irwin plays
sweet to Shiner's sour, these fine physical clowns produce an
evening that, in its deceptively silly way, bears the same
relationship to contemporary urban dwellers that Sophoclean tragedy
did to ancient Athenians. It's catharsis that's offered here, and
not of a trivial order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fool Moon'' is in the tradition of the silent movies of
Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd, works in which life is a nonstop
maddening wrestling match with the world at large. The show's first
moments, in which the bellicose Shiner fights through rows of
audience members to find a seat, are a canny, fun-house mirror of
what most theatergoers have to go through just to see a play. Then
suddenly there's Irwin, up on the stage, fighting against a
recalcitrant microphone cord and losing the battle. Nothing, on
either side of the proscenium arch, is going right.
</P>
<P>
   Through the remaining, fleet-footed two hours, Irwin and Shiner
face adversaries ranging from a plate of spaghetti to their own
backup band, the charmingly poker-faced Red Clay Ramblers, whose
music is usually directly at odds with the stars' aspirations to
dance. Even Irwin's and Shiner's arms and legs can't be trusted;
they have lives of their own, though you've rarely seen helpless
awkwardness rendered with such balletic grace.
</P>
<P>
   Audience members are recruited for several sketches, yet these
are never the exercises in humiliation you fear they could be.
Shiner's hatchet-man hostility (he seems to embody every nasty
thought you've ever had about your fellow humans) and Irwin's
gentle bewilderment counteract each other, defusing the potential
for both the sticky whimsy and mean-spiritedness often associated
with mime.
</P>
<P>
   For the show's penultimate sequence, Shiner plays silent movie
director (with Irwin kibitzing) to four audience recruits, and
somehow their self-consciousness and anxiety is shaped into
charming theater, something with its own rhythms and comic form.
It's a bit like the famous sequence in the musical ``Sunday in the
Park With George'' in which all the animate and inanimate elements
onstage converge into Seurat's masterpiece painting.
</P>
<P>
   Art has been allowed to triumph over chaos, at least
temporarily. When you walk out of ``Fool Moon,'' the crowds and the
noise seem less threatening and certainly far less annoying. Of
course, that feeling only lasts for a couple of minutes. But what a
relief it was.

CHINESE LEADER VISITS RUSSIA AND JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Jiang Zemin left China Sunday for
consecutive visits to Russia, where he is to meet with the ailing
president, Boris Yeltsin, and Japan, for the first visit ever by a
Chinese head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's visit to Russia is the latest of several summit meetings
between the giant neighbors, who appear determined to foster
friendly ties despite a history of bitter feuding.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Beijing last year, China _ which remains a
Communist dictatorship _ and Russia _ which under Yeltsin overthrew
Communism _ declared a ``strategic partnership.'' It was part of an
effort by both countries to balance the influence of the United
States in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But China recognizes that its relations with the West,
especially the United States, are far more important to its
development in the years ahead. Jiang also has made an agreement
with President Clinton to build a strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, their economy flat on its back, are hoping for
more profitable ties. ``Economic cooperation should be upgraded
from simple trade patterns to large-scale cooperation,'' Russia's
ambassador to China, Igor Rogachev, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Trade between the two countries has declined this year and is
only a small fraction of the volume of China's trade with the
United States or Japan. Its main driving force these days seems to
be China's purchase of Russian fighter jets, submarines and other
weapons as it seeks to upgrade its backward armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang will reportedly offer humanitarian aid to the Russians, a
reversal from the 1950s _ before a bitter split _ when Soviet
advisers tried to help China build a socialist state.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and Jiang also expect to celebrate the completion of a
border agreement, essentially finished last year, demarcating the
common 2,700-mile border that was the site of conflicts in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 25, Jiang will fly to Japan for five days. Although
China and Japan have many economic ties, they remain wary
neighbors. China still nurses grievances from the brutal Japanese
occupation of much of its territory in the 1930s and 1940s, and
worries that Japan will be drawn into U.S. plans for the possible
defense of Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks the Chinese have engaged in unusual public
diplomacy, with officials expounding on the need for Japan to issue
its most forthright apology ever for its past sins. In a visit to
Tokyo earlier this month, the South Korean president received a
clear apology from the Japanese and Japanese officials suggested
that they would do the same for China.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped Chinese officials from dwelling on the
matter. It is not clear what the practical consequences of a
stronger apology would be, but the issue is clearly a sensitive one
in the Chinese psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then, some Japanese political figures will jump
up to deny the country's past aggression in China,'' China's
foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, said last week. ``Japan has never
completely abandoned its militarist past in the same way as Germany
has with the Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   China is also pressing Japan to make a clear public statement
about the status of Taiwan, much as Clinton did during his visit to
China last summer when he reiterated the opposition of the United
States to formal Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   China worries that under the U.S.-Japanese security agreement,
Japan might get involved in defending Taiwan from attack. It has
also objected to plans to allow Taiwan to participate in a
U.S.-Japanese research project on anti-missile defenses.

 `WHY SINATRA MATTERS': COMPELLING CASE FOR TOUGH GUY WHO DANCES
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(jw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Journalist Pete Hamill, who had known Frank Sinatra casually
over the years, was left feeling dissatisfied by the coverage of
Sinatra's death on May 14. While the reporting was both prominent
and extensive, Hamill writes in his evocative tribute, ``Why
Sinatra Matters,'' ``much of the language of farewell had a stale,
even hollow quality, probably because most of the obituaries had
been ready for too many months.''
</P>
<P>
   On television, the words ``about loss and farewell'' had ``an
odd insincerity,'' Hamill continues; ``they could have been
discussing someone from the 19th century.'' He adds, ``It was
difficult, reading and watching all of this, to remember why
Sinatra mattered to so many people, and why he will continue to
matter in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the music, yes, but there was so much more, he says.
``Through a combination of artistic originality, great passion and
immense will, he transcended several eras and indirectly helped
change the way all of us lived.''
</P>
<P>
   In what follows, Hamill traces the essential threads of
Sinatra's turbulent life, gracefully knitting them into his own
memories of growing up in an era when the singer's yearning voice
was always in the background, especially in the middle of the night
``when he tells the bartender that it's a quarter to 3 and there's
no one in the place except you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamill sees two themes in particular standing out in Sinatra's
life. One was his experiences as the only child of Italian
immigrants in Hoboken, N.J., which because of the times he lived in
made him a lonely, angry outcast by nature, often at odds with the
establishment. One of the prices he paid for this was to become
associated in the public's mind with Italian gangsters. (Hamill
argues that while Sinatra by his own admission knew many mobsters
through his work as a nightclub and casino entertainer, they were
never responsible for advancing his career.) His triumph was to
become one of three heroes _ Fiorello La Guardia and Joe DiMaggio
being the others _ who helped integrate the children of Italian
immigrants into American life.
</P>
<P>
   The other major theme developed by Hamill is the three-act drama
of Sinatra's career that comprises its initial rise, its terrible
fall in the late 1940s and its great comeback in the early 1950s
after he won the part of Angelo Maggio in the film of James Jones'
``From Here to Eternity.'' The fall had to do with his relations
with the press, his trouble with women and his liberal politics.
They cost him his audience of adoring female fans. The pain of the
experience increased his loneliness, yet eventually contributed to
his comeback. The comeback constituted his redemption, which won
him his true audience, the men who had once resented his early good
luck and hubris.
</P>
<P>
   Everything went into his music, Hamill argues. For all the fame
of his exploits, Sinatra is essentially his music. As he refined
his extraordinary technique, he ``slowly found a way to allow
tenderness into the performance while remaining manly.'' When he
``finally took command of his own career, he perfected the role of
the Tender Tough Guy and passed it on to several generations of
Americans.'' Hamill concludes, ``That is one reason why he
continues to matter; Frank Sinatra created a new model for American
masculinity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I liked him enormously,'' Hamill admits. If he fails to make
you feel the same amount of affection for Sinatra, he certainly
conveys his hero's rough charm. But does he persuade you that
Sinatra's music is ``high art'' worthy of being mentioned in the
same paragraph as Mozart's? Not quite. High art implies a
completeness and a scale of humanity that Sinatra's work does not
achieve. The redemption Hamill claims for his subject never brought
Sinatra to a reconciliation with women, at least not in the story
that this book tells.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill hints darkly of Sinatra's inability ever to free himself
from his mother. (``When I would get out of hand,'' Hamill quotes
Sinatra telling him, ``she would give me a rap with that little
club; then she'd hug me to her breast. I married the same woman
every time.'') After his painful breakup with Ava Gardner in 1953,
Hamill writes, ``he transformed himself into the Sinatra who wore a
hat. The swinger whose best friends were men. The man with a lot of
women, which was, of course, like having no woman at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He says: ``The message was there in the music, the attitude,
even the hat: He had come through a hard, dark time, and he wasn't
ever going back into the darkness.'' The darkness being women,
presumably. This is not a message worthy of high art. In Hamill's
handling at least, those wee small hours of the morning are a
landscape of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his book does admirably convey why Sinatra's music has
been so much a part of the lives of so many generations. In one
chapter's epigraph, Hamill quotes a lovely paragraph from ``La
Merica: Images of Italian Greenhorn Experience,'' by Luciano De
Crescenzo, describing how departing immigrants used to bring on
board balls of yarn, leaving one end of the line with someone on
land. ``As the ship slowly cleared the dock, the balls unwound,''
and ``after the yarn ran out, the long strips remained airborne,
sustained by the wind, long after those on land and those at sea
had lost sight of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   When the book ends, ``it's like a thousand people have just left
the room,'' as Hamill says of Sinatra's death. But like the strips
of yarn, his music keeps floating, sustained by memory. Which is
enough to tell us why Sinatra matters.

 &HT;    Ga. Tech's O'Leary admits considering Auburn vacancy
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary admitted Sunday that
he has talked to Auburn athletics director David Housel about the
Auburn coaching vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said he spoke to Housel by telephone after Housel was
granted premission by Tech athletics director Dave Braine to
contact O'Leary. O'Leary admits his interest in the job, but has
not had a formal interview and reiterated his position of not
wanting to discuss the matter until the end of the season, which
ends Saturday against Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Housel could not be reached for comment Sunday. Interim Auburn
coach Bill Oliver, Temple coach Bobby Wallace, Florida defensive
coordinator Bob Stoops and former TCU coach Pat Sullivan have
interviewed for the vacancy created when Terry Bowden resigned Oct.
23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with them and enjoyed talking with them,'' O'Leary
said. ``They understand what's going on and what has to take place.
I have a season to fulfill...It was a good conversation and
basically my season was most important to me and getting it done
correctly. I won't lose focus on that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary has a five-year rollover contract with Georgia Tech, but
would not have to pay a penalty if he were to leave Tech for Auburn
or any other job. Braine has recently initiated negotiation with
O'Leary's agent Jack Reale to sign O'Leary to a 10-year contract,
which would include a buyout clause.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary has said he won't address his contract situation until
after the season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same as I've said all along. I'm very happy here,''
O'Leary said. ``I've got to fulfill my season. That's the only
thing I really have to say about that.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a brief reprieve on Sunday, another episode of stormy
weather will batter the Northwest and northern California on Monday
as a powerful Pacific low churns toward Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   As a surge of very moist air is lifted by an approaching cold
front, heavy rain will occur along the northern California coast on
Monday morning. The area of excessive rain will shift into
northwest California by afternoon. Local flooding is likely,
particularly in those areas that have recently received substantial
rain.
</P>
<P>
   As the damp air is lifted and cooled by the higher terrain,
heavy snow will accumulate in the Siskyou and Sierra mountains,
mainly above 6,500 feet. Meanwhile, windswept heavy rain will also
occur in western parts of Washington and Oregon where some exposed
coastal locations measure wind speeds past 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Generally tranquil conditions will cover the remainder of the
nation as the jet stream retreats toward Canada. In the East,
breezes from the southwest will direct unseasonably mild air toward
the northeastern states. Amid ample sunshine, afternoon readings
will reach the 60s from the Ohio Valley to southeastern
Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, a large high-pressure system will promote
dry and warm weather from the southern Plains to the lower
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A moisture-starved cool front will bring clouds and a few
sprinkles to the Great Lakes on Monday. Elsewhere, an area of
showers will surround low pressure over the northeast Gulf of
Mexico while partly sunny and humid conditions persist in southern
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: All About Wind
</P>
<P>
   High-wind warnings were discontinued for western Washington late
on Saturday as wind speeds dropped below 40 mph. Steady strong
winds are caused by large horizontal pressure contrasts in the
atmosphere. Extreme gusts occur when turbulent air motions, similar
to eddies in a rushing stream, mix winds from aloft to the earth's
surface. Winds at altitudes of 10,000 feet, undaunted by friction,
commonly exceed 50 mph, providing added energy for ground-level
winds. Early on Sunday, a high-wind watch was issued, in
anticipation of strong winds developing Monday.

   FREEDOM-REGAINED (New Orleans) _ Hayes Williams is haunted by
closed doors. In the long, narrow house on Lopez Street every
inside door is ajar, cabinets are open, kitchen drawers are pulled
half-out. His fiance, Linda Wilson, will come home from her job at
the pharmacy and find the house this way, and she thinks about
scolding him a little. ``But I'll stop, when I think about why he
does it,'' she said. He is not messy, she said. He is just a man
who knows what the inside of a box looks like, when it closes shut.
``I don't like closing up nothin','' said Williams, who served 30
years in Angola Prison for a killing he played no part in. He was
freed last year, though he knew that being turned loose and
actually living free, free in his own mind, are not the same. He
walked into prison at 19. Now he is almost 50, living in a world he
does not remember, constantly afraid some minor blunder, some
trivial brush with the law, some bad luck, will steal his freedom

 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How would you promote a television show called ``10'' that
visits the beaches of Miami seeking the best-looking guys and girls
and lets audiences vote for their favorites?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you work for WAMI, Barry Diller's new television
station in Miami, and it is the Thanksgiving season, you create a
commercial that scans bikinied bodies while a voiceover says that
``10'' offers ``all the breasts, legs and thighs you can handle.''
Executives at WAMI (pronounced whammy) like to refer to the show as
an ``egalitarian, populist beauty pageant.''
</P>
<P>
   The WAMI approach to local television also includes ``Ken's
Freakquency,'' a midnight tour of the outre _ replete with body
paint, snakes and nose rings _ that derives its name from the
R.E.M. song ``What's the Frequency, Kenneth?'' And then there is
the nightly 11 o'clock newscast ``Lips,'' consisting solely of a
woman's rouged mouth reading headlines in a sultry voice.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in the latest television test kitchen of Diller, the
man whose career highlights include building the Fox Network in the
1980s on the risque (``Married ... With Children'') and the tabloid
(``A Current Affair'') and introducing the world to cubic zirconium
through the QVC home-shopping channel. Now Diller, as part of the
work of his sprawling video empire, has turned his commercially
astute, if sometimes jaundiced, eye to the world of local
television.
</P>
<P>
   WAMI, channel 69 in Miami, is one of 13 television stations
owned by USA Networks Inc., of which Diller is chairman. The
company also includes the cable service USA Networks, a television
production operation called Studios USA, the Sci-Fi Channel, Home
Shopping Network, Ticketmaster and Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch.
For the first nine months of this year, the company had profits of
$26 million on revenue of $1.87 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since USA Networks converted WAMI from a Home Shopping Network
affiliate in June, the Miami station appears to have become an
experiment in redefining local TV in the era of video diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Industrywide, local television advertiser spending has been
perking along at an impressive pace and is expected to grow 4
percent next year, to a total of $12.5 billion. But analysts point
out that the explosion of national and regional cable services and
broadcast networks makes it harder than ever for an individual
local station to make its voice heard. Currently, for example,
there are 173 national cable services, compared with only 79 in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   And so WAMI's oddball melange of shows reflects the challenge of
creating any new service in an increasingly competitive environment
_ particularly on a low budget.
</P>
<P>
   Starting new programming services ``is always done in an
unfriendly environment,'' Diller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like bouncing off the side walls of a squash court,'' he
said. ``It's like constant carom shots, and you find your way like
a fool. And each year, as fragmentation continues, it certainly
gets more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of WAMI's local programming is camp or farce. For
example, ``The Times,'' a half-hour early-evening newscast somewhat
more conventional than the 11 p.m. ``Lips,'' investigated the
16-year prison term for armed robbery that had been served by a
Cuban national, Alberto Alfonso. The original sentence had been 13
years, but he remained behind bars because the United States does
not have an agreement with Cuba that would have allowed him to be
sent home at the end of his sentence. After the program was
broadcast, Alfonso was eventually freed and The Miami Herald cited
WAMI's role in bringing his case to light.
</P>
<P>
   WAMI also broadcasts ``City Desk: The Herald,'' a
documentary-style program that tracks Miami Herald reporters on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Diller's decision to focus anew on the local broadcast audience
is something of a departure from the television industry trend in
recent years. Virtually all new programming efforts over the last
decade have focused on cable services, with their enviable ability
to attract both national advertising and fees from local cable
operators. But Diller's theory is that local broadcast programming
has been ignored and that people want a sense of what is going on
in their local communities.
</P>
<P>
   WAMI is situated smack in the heart of Miami's trendy South
Beach section, in a glass-walled studio in the Lincoln Road Mall,
where some programs are shot indoors and others on the mall itself.
</P>
<P>
   Though the programming is clearly aimed at the young and hip and
the average age of the staff seems somewhere south of 30, Diller
said he never programs ``for demographics,'' adding, ``I just try
to do what is contrarian and interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some evidence, though, that members of the young-adult
audience attractive to advertisers are beginning to watch WAMI.
``The Times,'' for instance, got a 1 rating in the current November
sweep period, meaning that 1 percent of the television households
in the Miami area were watching.
</P>
<P>
   Though the number is tiny, a Diller lieutenant voiced cautious
optimism. ``There are signs of life,'' said John Miller, president
of USA Broadcasting, the programming arm of USA Network. ``The
question is: Does this get to be a business?''
</P>
<P>
   The competition is daunting. There are 16 television stations in
Miami, led by the Spanish language Univision-owned station, WLTV.
WLTV's most recent local news rating was a 7.1.
</P>
<P>
   But WAMI's ``The Times'' newscast remains Diller's favorite part
of his station's lineup. One recent newscast carried a feature on
worker absenteeism, in which the anchor, Amy Atkins, facetiously
wondered where some of her station's own staff might be.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``Times'' segment _ broadcast in August after a local
politician with a reputation for being a dandy, Humberto Hernandez,
was indicted in a voter fraud scandal _ included a demonstration by
a physical trainer of how to stay fit in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a genuinely alternative news show,'' Diller said of
``The Times.'' ``We have done one murder in five months. By
definition, that is an alternative news program.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Alternative,'' though, is not necessarily a word that goes far
with advertisers, particularly when there are dozens of hours of
local news each week in the Miami market.
</P>
<P>
   WAMI expects to take in about $4 million in revenues this year
and hopes to double that number next year, according to a company
executive who insisted on not being identified. USA Networks has
already invested about $12 million in the station and projects a
budget of about $18 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   To break even, Miller explained, the station needs about 4
percent of the Miami market's $455 million annual advertising pie.
But getting there, he said, will require that WAMI attract a 2.5
percent to 3 percent share of the viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, for the key time period of 4 p.m. to 11 p.m., we
have about a one share,'' Miller said. ``People say they want
innovation, but the room to do it is narrower. It is hard to appeal
in ways that people are comfortable with. You can see the pressures
that push people toward the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a handful of cautious advertisers, including McDonald's,
are at least testing the WAMI waters. ``It is common for local ad
buyers to look at new and fun ways to reach customers,'' said Anna
Rozenich, a McDonald's spokeswoman. ``So our current participation
is a small part of the overall marketing mix in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the Miami market particularly tricky is the fragmentation
caused by its mix of English- and Spanish-speaking viewers. Chuck
Budt, who heads WAMI's advertising effort, said that of the $455
million spent last year on advertising in the Miami market, about
$75 million went to the Spanish-language stations. In Miami, Budt
said, ``companies such as Budweiser have two ad budgets'' _ one for
the English-language media and one for the Spanish media.
</P>
<P>
   WAMI has tried to introduce programs for the younger Spanish
market, whose members typically are fluently bilingual. One is a
talk show, ``Generation N,'' whose title is a play on the term
Gen-X. The executive producer, Bill Tech, and the host, Maria
Budet, are both native Miamians of Cuban descent.
</P>
<P>
   The program ``is for the young, hip, Hispanic market,'' said
Matti Lesham, the station's editor in chief. ``Much of the
programming on the main Spanish language stations here is aimed at
an older audience.''
</P>
<P>
   But segmenting cultural groups will never generate the numbers
of viewers that coverage of, say, a hot sports team can deliver.
Thus was Diller determined to establish his station with Miami's
sports audience by paying $6 million for the broadcast rights to
the Miami Heat basketball games. ``Sports helps enormously,''
Diller said. ``When you are unknown, having something known is of
enormous benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for WAMI, the National Basketball Association's
lockout has put the Heat on the sidelines so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sports tickets also provide the most obvious tie-ins with the
company's Ticketmaster telephone and online sales business, and,
through sports-related paraphernalia, with USA's Home Shopping
Network business.
</P>
<P>
   To keep costs down and exposure up, WAMI has assiduously been
promoting itself, often forgoing more traditional, costly
advertising. One recent ploy of the station's ebullient marketing
chief, Chris Sloan, and a team of WAMI executives was a pilgrimage
through the streets of South Beach chanting ``WAMI Krishna'' and
handing out copies of WAMI's programming schedule.
</P>
<P>
   And with an eye toward the appeal of freebees, an on-air contest
promoted by the life-styles guru Robin Leach awarded as its prize a
free family weekend at a palatial local beachfront villa.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the vagaries, why is Diller, at this stage in his
career, devoting so much attention to development of a single local
TV station? For one thing, he may eventually be able to spread the
start-up costs over his other stations. If a programming concept
like ``10'' or ``The Times'' takes off, USA could expand the
concept _ or the WAMI show itself _ to USA's 12 other local
stations around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And for that matter, the start-up costs are relatively small.
Leshem, for example, discovered the co-hosts of ``Ken's
Freakquency,'' Patrick Doody and Chris Valenziano, flipping burgers
at Johnny Rockets, a fast-food restaurant, after they graduated
from the University of Miami Film School.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we told them they would earn $850 a week, they kind of
incredulously said `For both of us?''' Lesher recalled. ``We said,
`No, for each of you.' They nearly fell off their chairs.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It slices! It dices! But no matter which way you cut it, K-Tel
International has been keeping investors awake at night, much as
its commercials for gadgets and records once did for late-night
television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, K-Tel shares were soaring after the
company announced agreements to sell music over the Internet at Web
sites run by Playboy Enterprises and the Microsoft Corp. But last
week the stock plunged on news that Nasdaq was threatening to
delist the company for lack of adequate assets.
</P>
<P>
   Even for Internet-related stocks, where investor enthusiasm is
often out of sync with business realities, the tale of K-Tel is an
extreme one.
</P>
<P>
   Until April, K-Tel was selling music compilations like `` '70s
Teen Heartthrobs'' through discount and record stores. On some
days, only a few hundred shares in the thinly traded company
changed hands. No analyst at a major brokerage firm followed the
company.
</P>
<P>
   But then K-Tel announced that it would open an Internet record
store, and its shares jumped to nearly $40 from about $4, adjusted
for a subsequent split. The share price fell to earth again, but
had two more spikes earlier this month when the company announced
its Microsoft and Playboy agreements. On some days, more than 20
million shares changed hands, a huge number for a company that has
only 8.3 million shares outstanding and 4 million of those owned by
its founder.
</P>
<P>
   But if the company has been quick to announce its Internet
intentions, it has raised questions about its silence on less
favorable developments.
</P>
<P>
   Its president and chief operating officer, David Weiner,
resigned in September and was replaced the next month by Lawrence
Kieves. But K-Tel did not announce these changes until Nov. 3, when
reporters, calling about the Playboy announcement, discovered its
change in presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Then, K-Tel did not announce for about three weeks that it had
received a warning that it might be delisted from the Nasdaq
National Market because it does not have the required tangible net
assets.
</P>
<P>
   When that information became public on Tuesday in the company's
quarterly filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, K-Tel's
stock, which had been as high as $39 the week before, plunged to
$10. It closed at $12 on Friday, down 31.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers have pounced like lions on a slab of raw meat. At least
seven shareholder suits have been filed, accusing the company of
concealing the Nasdaq warning while orchestrating a public
relations campaign to increase the share price so it could raise
money.
</P>
<P>
   K-Tel executives said in interviews that the company was not
legally obligated to announce the Nasdaq letter. They said they did
not consider it significant because the company, which is now
arranging financing, was confident it could raise the capital
required to stay listed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the 12th letter I've gotten from Nasdaq in my
career,'' said Kieves, the new president, who previously worked at
several small publicly traded companies. ``People have a microscope
on this company and hyper-react to it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Coffee Jr., a Columbia University Law School professor,
said a company was under no legal requirement to disclose
information before its quarterly SEC filing unless it was trying to
sell stock or had made misleading statements. Plaintiffs could
contend that it was misleading to announce the Playboy and
Microsoft deals without also mentioning the Nasdaq letter, but
K-Tel could argue that those deals were not connected to the
delisting warning, he said. But Coffee said that even if K-Tel was
not legally liable, it might be violating Nasdaq rules by being ``a
little lax about keeping its shareholders informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying listed will probably not be a problem. The company's
founder and chairman, Philip Kives, could restore its assets to the
required $4 million, from $900,000 now, with an equity infusion.
The bigger problems are finding the tens of millions of dollars
that might be needed to compete in the Internet business and fix
its existing business.
</P>
<P>
   K-Tel, with sales last year of $85 million, has lost money in
three of the last four years. In the quarter that ended Sept. 30,
it lost $3.1 million as revenue dropped 25 percent, to $18.8
million, partly because it discontinued some businesses but also
partly because of slumping record sales.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The company has exhausted its credit line and has borrowed $3.4
million from Kives to finance operations, according to its latest
SEC filing. Kives, who is 69 and is based in Winnipeg, Manitoba,
owns 42.3 percent of K-Tel. He had owned nearly 80 percent, but
sold more than 2.6 million shares after the price went up in April.
He declined to comment on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   A farm boy from Saskatchewan, Kives was peddling knife sets on
the Atlantic City boardwalk when he hit upon the idea of using
television. In 1962, he started K-Tel, which stands for Kives
Television, advertising contraptions like the Miracle Brush lint
remover. (The Veg-O-Matic vegetable slicer and dicer actually
belonged to a competitor, but K-Tel acquired it.) The company then
branched into selling music compilations like ``Hooked on
Classics,'' in which classical music was played to a disco beat.
</P>
<P>
   K-Tel fell into bankruptcy in 1984 after disco slumped and its
investments in real estate and oil and gas turned sour. Its direct
sales of gadgets on television are now largely confined to Europe.
In the United States, K-Tel mainly sells music compilations through
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The new president, Kieves, 50, is related to Kives (their
grandfathers were brothers), but the two men did not meet until
1986.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn native, Kieves spent the first part of his career in
government in Washington and New York City, his last post as
commissioner of business development under former New York Mayor
Edward Koch. Though he was never formally charged with any
wrongdoing, Kieves was forced to resign in 1986 for owning about
$10,000 worth of stock in a company that was getting some financial
assistance from the city.
</P>
<P>
   After that he was an executive at several small
video-distribution companies and started Network Event Theater,
which went public.
</P>
<P>
   Kieves said K-Tel's brand name and existing business would give
it an advantage in Internet retailing. ``It's a smart extension of
our core business, and the market reacted very favorably to it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Market leaders like Amazon.com and CD Now are selling $10
million to $15 million of music over the Internet each quarter. If
K-Tel could do that _ right now it does not report its Internet
sales because they are not significant _ it would practically
double its revenue. And Internet music sales are expected to soar.
</P>
<P>
   But the market is already crowded. K-Tel's Web site,
www.ktel.com, had only 121,000 people visiting in September
compared with 2.2 million for CD Now, according to Media Metrix, a
New York company that tracks Web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Internet competition will require a lot more money
than K-Tel has. CD Now paid Yahoo $4 million to appear on Yahoo's
portal for two years, and paid $18.5 million for a link with Lycos.
CD Now is also merging with its major rival, N2K, to give it more
heft. K-Tel has agreed to pay Playboy at least $900,000 over two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting into being a category-killer online retailer may have
stretched them too thin,'' said Nicole Vanderbilt, senior analyst
at Jupiter Communications, a market research firm. She said K-Tel
might have been wiser to concentrate on selling its music
compilations over the Internet, rather than trying to be a
broad-based music retailer.
</P>
<P>
   The listing of K-Tel's service on the Microsoft Network's
shopping channel might not help much. K-Tel is only one of six
retailers listed in the music and video section, and Amazon.com has
featured billing. The Playboy deal could be more significant
because K-Tel would be the exclusive record vendor on Playboy.com,
with 900,000 people visiting in September, according to Media
Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   But K-Tel undoubtedly faced naysayers when it pioneered in
selling records on television. ``For us not to take advantage of
this new medium,'' Kieves said, ``would be a grave mistake.''

`THE LATE SHOW FIFTH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL': ACERBIC BARBS AND GOOFY
TRICKS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   When David Letterman is bugged about something, he doesn't let
it go easily. He begins ``The Late Show With David Letterman Fifth
Anniversary Special'' by noting that this special celebrates ``Five
years on CBS or, if I had played my cards right, 17 years on NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his mordant running jokes on ``The Late Show'' involves
these linked annoyances in his career: losing the NBC ``Tonight''
show job to Jay Leno and, in the last couple of years, watching the
CBS incarnation of his show struggle in the ratings as the network
has floundered.
</P>
<P>
   That joke calls attention to an immutable truth: In the
late-night battle, there is a great divide between Jay people, who
are an easygoing, don't-challenge-me sort, and Dave people, always
ready for a barbed remark amid the silly, absurdist situations.
</P>
<P>
   This special turns highlights of the last five years into 90
minutes with virtually no dull spots, and proves why Letterman is
still consistently the best, funniest, sharpest late-night host.
</P>
<P>
   The show includes a new Top 10 List prepared for the
anniversary, with guests lining up to share ``Things I Always
Wanted to Say to Dave.'' The list includes New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, Mia Farrow, Michael J. Fox and Puff Daddy, who continues
the ragging on CBS by telling his host, ``Of all the old guys on
`60 Minutes' you're my favorite.'' Jerry Seinfeld also turns up
with some surprising news about Dave's mom, as viewers
affectionately know his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The funniest of the taped comedy bits features Letterman and
Steve Martin in a home video capturing the tender moments, the
lovers' spats, the frolicking on the beach of ``Dave and Steve's
Gay Vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   And a montage of interview snippets reveals how, with one wry
glance at the camera, Letterman turns his guests' most bizarre
behavior into humor. Watch for Farrah Fawcett's on-camera meltdown,
Madonna's bleep-filled taunting, Drew Barrymore leaping on the desk
and taking the term ``flash dance'' literally.
</P>
<P>
   There are also reminders that contrary to Letterman's acerbic
reputation, some of the hysterical moments on ``Late Show'' come
from loony, benign comedy, like Letterman putting on Shaquille
O'Neal's jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Since he began losing to ``Tonight'' in the ratings, there have
been nights when Letterman has not looked like a guy who enjoys his
work much, leading his fans to fear he might call it quits sooner
rather than later. This prime-time special reveals that a world
without the Letterman show would be a world of extreme deprivation.

SMALLER CABLE COMPANIES HOMING IN ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attempts to transmit Internet data over cable-television wires
have generally focused on only the largest cable-system operators.
But high-speed data options for smaller cable companies and their
customers are set to expand over the next few weeks as Internet
companies move into rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Softnet Systems, a small company based in Mountain View, Calif.,
intends to announce an agreement Monday to acquire Intelligent
Communications, a private concern based in Fremont, Calif., for
about $10.5 million in stock, according to executives close to the
companies. Softnet hopes that the deal will enable it to offer
small cable operators a direct satellite link to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And next week at the Western Cable Show in Anaheim, Calif., At
Home Corp., an Internet venture that is backed by many of the
United States' largest cable carriers, intends to announce a
ready-made data solution for small and medium-sized cable
operators, according to executives close to At Home.
</P>
<P>
   Only a minuscule fraction of U.S. consumers are now able to tap
the Internet at speeds faster than the 50 or so kilobits a second
allowed by analog modems. The cable television and local telephone
industries are vying to be the first to offer widespread Internet
access at office-caliber speeds, which are much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Softnet reached deals to sell its operations that
distribute office telephone equipment and that create microfiche
documents for about $12 million in cash and short-term notes. The
company now hopes to focus on its ISP Channel unit, which helps
small cable operators get their customers online.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Brilliant, the chief executive of Softnet, is looking
to Intelligent Communications to carry out that strategy. Founded
in the early 1990s by former Xerox Corp. executives, Intelligent
Communications had about $3 million in revenue last year and owns
technology that allows two-way Internet communications using
satellites and relatively small dish antennas _ about 5 feet in
diameter _ according to executives close to the planned acquisition
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Softnet's business plan is based on the assumption that
satellites provide a more economical way than do expensive
high-speed fiber-optic cables to link cable systems in remote areas
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, At Home intends to stick with terrestrial links for
its new system, according to executives close to the plan. The big
difference between At Home's previous deals with cable companies
and the new plan is that under the new system, At Home would bear
more of the initial cost of creating those links (and cable
affiliates would bear less), and At Home would keep a bigger
percentage of the future profit.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ While their counterparts abroad have often led
movements for social change, university students in Israel have had
a well-earned reputation for indifference when it comes to
political protest.
</P>
<P>
   But after a month-old strike for lower tuition that has been
fought tenaciously in the streets, on television and in government
offices, Israel's 200,000 college and university students are
emerging as a powerful voice for rearranging national priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing support from union leaders, the unemployed and poor
towns and neighborhoods, the students are demanding a shift from
the country's traditional preoccupation with security to greater
attention to social needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a conceptual revolution,'' Nir Amir, an engineering
student participating in a round-the-clock vigil and hunger strike
outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem,
said Sunday. ``We want to put education and society first. Security
is important, but if we don't have a society that is built soundly,
we'll disintegrate and security won't do any good.''
</P>
<P>
   What began on the eve of the new academic year as a campaign to
halve college tuition has mushroomed into a broader struggle to
redefine Israel's most pressing needs. Arguing that education is
Israel's greatest resource and therefore the nation's highest
priority, the students are demanding more generous government
scholarships and loans to make university education accessible to
all qualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Universities in Israel are privately run with government
support, with tuition ranging from about $2,500 to $5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The student protests have delayed the start of the academic
year. Taking to the streets in recent weeks, thousands of students
across the country have held demonstrations and blocked roads,
leading to violent confrontations with police officers in which
dozens have been arrested and injured.
</P>
<P>
   A day after a mass demonstration last week at Jerusalem's city
hall, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined the talks with the
students, promising a ``revolutionary change'' in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   The form of that change has not been determined, but the
discussions are focusing on scholarships that would cover 50
percent of college tuition in return for community service, such as
helping disadvantaged youth, or work in hospitals and jails.
</P>
<P>
   The students' campaign has drawn support from Education Minister
Yitzhak Levy and Parliament members from across the political
spectrum, who have made pilgrimages to the strikers' vigil, along
with many ordinary Israelis. In a show of solidarity, the
Histadrut, the national umbrella group of labor unions, has
threatened a one-day general strike this week if no agreement is
reached with the students.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that they want nothing less than ``a revolution'' in
education and national budget allocations, the students have
plastered the streets with banners and handed out leaflets to
motorists. Their vigil outside the prime minister's office has
grown into a makeshift tent-camp, complete with sleeping bags,
contributions of food and medical supplies, and visiting lecturers
from the idled campuses. On a billboard, big red letters proclaim:
``The Student Revolution: 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Avi Arien, one of the strikers, said his education had suffered
from the need to work long hours to pay his way through college.
Many students, whose college education follows compulsory military
service, hold one or even two jobs to pay for their studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no time to prepare for the lectures,'' Arien said.
``The revolution we want is an understanding that studying is
actually a full-time job, and that the country's only resource is
its human capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Avi Mutsafi, another student, said: ``Israel doesn't depend on
exporting oranges anymore. If it won't invest in human capital, we
won't have economic security and people will prefer to leave for
Silicon Valley or New Zealand.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Strike leaders have accused the government of allocating state
funds to support strictly Orthodox yeshiva students at the expense
of general education, as a political payoff to Orthodox parties in
the governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israeli values have retreated in the face of the values of
groups who haven't contributed anything to the society,'' Erez
Eshel, a student leader, told the newspaper Haaretz. ``Corrupt
politicians have taken away our idealism.''
</P>
<P>
   Nir Alfasa, a student at the vigil Sunday, said that as Israel's
conflict with the Palestinians moved toward a resolution, the
country should turn to putting its own house in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been too immersed in the security syndrome,'' Alfasa
said. ``A permanent peace agreement is bound to come, and when that
happens, no government will have an excuse to avoid the issues.
After 50 years it's time for this society to grow up and start
solving the real problems: unemployment, religion and state, a
constitution. We have to get this country organized.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: FINDING DEPTH IN SOCIETY'S SHALLOW END 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan J. Pakula's career was notably overlooked by the book
``Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,'' Peter Biskind's warts-and-all look
at filmmaking in the 1970s. Pakula was one of that decade's most
eminent directors, but he wasn't part of the wild bunch. His style
was more thoughtful, efficient and adult than that of his more
flagrantly experimental colleagues, and it wound up having more
staying power than most.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 40 years, as both producer (``To Kill a
Mockingbird,'' ``Inside Daisy Clover'') and director (from ``The
Sterile Cuckoo'' in 1969 to ``The Devil's Own'' last year), he
survived devastating changes in the film industry with his dignity
and intelligence intact.
</P>
<P>
   That was no easy feat. The atmosphere that fostered his
so-called Paranoid Trilogy (``Klute,'' ``The Parallax View'' and
``All the President's Men'') allowed for quiet moments, subtle
plotting and an air of profound anxiety that have all but vanished
from today's more breathless thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Pakula died in traffic on Thursday, at 70, in just the
kind of violent incident that his filmmaking never exploited, he
was still tackling the sophisticated material that had always
appealed to him. Pakula was at work on ``No Ordinary Time,'' based
on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book about Franklin and Eleanor
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here he was, doing a project that was so personal to him, that
was a period piece, that was obviously going to be costly,'' said
Harry Clein, Pakula's longtime publicity agent and friend. ``His
heart was there. It was about politics, about American royalty in a
sense, about emotions and events that are almost Shakespearean.''
Clein added, pointing out the all too obvious, ``That's not the
marketplace today.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakula's adaptability depended on what had always been great
professional strengths: a respect for audiences, a knack for
finding depth in potentially potboiling material (like the thriller
``Klute'') and a special flair for encouraging actors to shine.
</P>
<P>
   If he was known for creative ambivalence during filmmaking (he
often suggested more than one method of envisioning a scene), he
was just as certain to find precisely the right moments to assemble
at editing time.
</P>
<P>
   Actors in his films had a way of baring their souls without
breast-beating, and he could capture them at their most intimate
and appealing. From Warren Beatty in ``The Parallax View'' to
Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford in ``All the President's Men'' to
Brad Pitt, who was at his most personable in ``The Devil's Own,''
performers flourished in the intriguing, multidimensional realm of
Pakula's work.
</P>
<P>
   His brand of knowing understatement was as much at home in
comedy as it was in more mystery-laden material. In ``Starting
Over,'' his 1979 film about a newly divorced man (written by James
L. Brooks, who was right on Pakula's wavelength), Frances
Sternhagen plays the eagerly sympathetic sister-in-law of Burt
Reynolds' central character and exclaims, ``Call if you get sad!''
as he leaves her. ``Can I call if I get happy?'' he asks ruefully,
knowing what the answer will be. ``Yeah. Sure,'' she answers, with
obvious disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he knew how to get under the skin of a lonely New York
call girl (in ``Klute'') or a haunted World War II refugee
(``Sophie's Choice''), Pakula knew that a lonely man could spoil
others' fun just by becoming less lonely.
</P>
<P>
   The very simplicity with which his best films unfolded was often
indicative of Pakula's intense attention to detail. For the
Washington Post newsroom in ``All the President's Men,'' he said in
notes for a planned book about making that film, he wanted ``that
hard, hard ruthless white and that low ceiling made up of endless
fluorescent light.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``It's a world without shadows; isn't that
terrific for a newspaper world, for a world that exposes
hypocrisies and reveals truths? Nothing can remain in the shadows
there. I want that exaggerated. I want that emphasized. I want a
world with great depth of vision, because the film has to do with
people looking and perceiving.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same spirit, he chose shadowy garages as backdrops for
the film's most secretive figures, the Watergate burglars and Deep
Throat. ``They should be elusive visually,'' he said. ``It's a
total contrast.''
</P>
<P>
   By the '90s, when adapting best-selling thrillers like
``Presumed Innocent'' and ``The Pelican Brief,'' Pakula could still
create such nuances even when his material was more matter-of-fact.
Though he had become a virtual dinosaur in the eyes of younger
studio executives, he had the professional durability and personal
charm to keep them as interested in his future as in the triumphs
of his past.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, he seems to have kept his perspective as
sharp as his hauntingly intuitive directorial gifts. Pakula never
forgot that when he took part in a press junket to promote
``Klute,'' nobody asked him anything about a film that would later
be deemed one of his very best. (``He just sat in his hotel room,''
Clein recalled.)
</P>
<P>
   He knew how easily tastes changed in Hollywood. He knew how to
tell stories and touch nerves. And he knew how to stay above the
fray.

POLICE OFFICER AS JOURNALIST: BEHIND THE PSEUDONYM

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his personal essays for The New Yorker magazine,
the author known only by the pseudonym ``Marcus Laffey'' has
written eloquently about the sorrows of potters' field and the
daily grind of a New York City police officer's beat; he has
revealed his occasional satisfaction in snapping on handcuffs;
explained the slang of police officers; and told wrenching stories
about practically murderous neglect.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, he has revealed _ in finely hewn prose that can
be lyrical and outrageously funny _ what it is really like to be a
New York City police officer.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the author, still operating from behind his pen
name, signed a book deal for a reported $995,000 to write a
personal memoir of his life as a police officer. The working title
is ``Blue Blood'' and Riverhead Books, a division of Penguin Putnam
Group, has tentatively scheduled the book for publication in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the book has drawn attention to the fact that the
author does, in fact, write from behind the protection of a false
name, which raises a flurry of questions: Why does he write under a
pseudonym? When is it appropriate? And why does The New Yorker
choose to let him?
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Laffey is actually Edward W. Conlon, a New York City
police officer and a graduate of Harvard College, class of 1987.
Conlon's great-grandfather was a police sergeant in Brooklyn, and
his father was at one time an FBI agent. Conlon first came to the
attention of the editors at The New Yorker five years ago when he
sent in a proposal for an article.
</P>
<P>
   As both a graduate of an Ivy League college and a police
officer, Conlon straddles more social worlds in New York than most
writers. In a November 1997 article for The New Yorker titled ``Cop
Diary,'' he wrote about why he became a police officer: ``My father
died before I went on the job, but I think my decision to become a
cop would strike him as an affront to how far we've come from the
hardscrabble west of Ireland and the docks of Hell's Kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kuhn, a New Yorker editor when Conlon's proposal came in
and now executive editor of Tina Brown's Talk magazine, chose to
work with Conlon and spoke to him about using a pseudonym. Although
Kuhn thought Conlon might change his mind as the publication date
approached, he chose _ and stuck with _ the pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did that because it could very well change the nature of
the way people dealt with him at work,'' Kuhn said. ``That was his
concern at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, his identity as a New Yorker writer has never been a
closely guarded secret. His real name has been known to The New
Yorker staff _ and its extended social circle _ since his first
piece in 1993. In police headquarters, Conlon's situation has been
known from the outset. The department has no problems with his
second career as a writer, said Inspector Michael Collins, a police
spokesman. He is not violating any conflict-of-interest laws,
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   But Conlon's editor at The New Yorker, Alice Truax, said she
understood why he would want to keep his identity a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to write about your work in a way that's natural,
and continue to have a natural relationship with your work
environment, you have to keep your identity a secret,'' she said.
``Everything is changed by your exposure as a writer. I immediately
understood that exposure would change this cop's relationship to
his professional world. For the worst, I would say.''
</P>
<P>
   No questions have been raised about the accuracy of Conlon's
work. But a number of professors of journalism and media observers
find the pseudonym troubling because it may cause the reader to
wonder whether Conlon's articles are even the slightest bit
fictional. Charles Eisendrath, a journalism professor at the
University of Michigan, and James Naughton, president of the
Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., said
Conlon's use of a pseudonym might cause readers to doubt the truth
of his reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read nonfiction work by a pseudonymous author, I
wonder: is this literal truth, the journalistic truth or is it
representational truth in a more fictionalized sense?'' Naughton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Konner, publisher of The Columbia Journalism Review and
dean emeritus of the Columbia University Graduate School of
Journalism, agrees but goes further, saying it is wrong to keep
Conlon's identity a secret from his co-workers because they play a
part in his articles. ``This makes me extremely uncomfortable as a
matter of personal integrity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Tom Goldstein, the dean of the Columbia
Journalism School, said he trusted the editors of The New Yorker.
``I think it is important to get firsthand accounts that a reporter
could not get without resorting to subterfuge,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, inherited
Conlon from his predecessor, Ms. Brown, he said he had no doubts
about the author's reporting and decided to let him continue to use
the pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked to meet him and be made confident that, of course, he
is who he is and does what he does,'' Remnick said. ``The fact that
he is a remarkable writer joined with this experience, which is
very hard for an outsider to replicate, maybe even impossible, is
just a glory, and we're all the richer for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Knutsen, Conlon's editor at Riverhead, said he and
the author had hardly discussed the issue and insisted that his use
of Conlon's pseudonym was not a marketing tool. It is a ``literary
persona,'' Knutsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the author's personal wish to not have his life
turned upside down,'' Knutsen said. ``The other thing to point out
is that the author is not blowing the lid on any police secrets.
That's not the point of his book.''
</P>
<P>
   Conlon did not answer requests for an interview. Now that
Conlon's name has been made public, Remnick said he could ``not
begin to speculate'' on whether he would suggest to Conlon that he
use his real name.

his father was at one time an FBI agent. Conlon first came to the
attention of the editors at The New Yorker five years ago when he
sent in a proposal for an article.
</P>
<P>
   As both a graduate of an Ivy League college and a police
officer, Conlon straddles more social worlds in New York than most
writers. In a November 1997 article for The New Yorker titled ``Cop
Diary,'' he wrote about why he became a police officer: ``My father
died before I went on the job, but I think my decision to become a
cop would strike him as an affront to how far we've come from the
hardscrabble west of Ireland and the docks of Hell's Kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kuhn, a New Yorker editor when Conlon's proposal came in
and now executive editor of Tina Brown's Talk magazine, chose to
work with Conlon and spoke to him about using a pseudonym. Although
Kuhn thought Conlon might change his mind as the publication date
approached, he chose _ and stuck with _ the pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did that because it could very well change the nature of
the way people dealt with him at work,'' Kuhn said. ``That was his
concern at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, his identity as a New Yorker writer has never been a
closely guarded secret. His real name has been known to The New
Yorker staff _ and its extended social circle _ since his first
piece in 1993. In police headquarters, Conlon's situation has been
known from the outset. The department has no problems with his
second career as a writer, said Inspector Michael Collins, a police
spokesman. He is not violating any conflict-of-interest laws,
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   But Conlon's editor at The New Yorker, Alice Truax, said she
understood why he would want to keep his identity a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to write about your work in a way that's natural,
and continue to have a natural relationship with your work
environment, you have to keep your identity a secret,'' she said.
``Everything is changed by your exposure as a writer. I immediately
understood that exposure would change this cop's relationship to
his professional world. For the worst, I would say.''
</P>
<P>
   No questions have been raised about the accuracy of Conlon's
work. But a number of professors of journalism and media observers
find the pseudonym troubling because it may cause the reader to
wonder whether Conlon's articles are even the slightest bit
fictional. Charles Eisendrath, a journalism professor at the
University of Michigan, and James Naughton, president of the
Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., said
Conlon's use of a pseudonym might cause readers to doubt the truth
of his reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read nonfiction work by a pseudonymous author, I
wonder: is this literal truth, the journalistic truth or is it
representational truth in a more fictionalized sense?'' Naughton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Konner, publisher of The Columbia Journalism Review and
dean emeritus of the Columbia University Graduate School of
Journalism, agrees but goes further, saying it is wrong to keep
Conlon's identity a secret from his co-workers because they play a
part in his articles. ``This makes me extremely uncomfortable as a
matter of personal integrity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Tom Goldstein, the dean of the Columbia
Journalism School, said he trusted the editors of The New Yorker.
``I think it is important to get firsthand accounts that a reporter
could not get without resorting to subterfuge,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, inherited
Conlon from his predecessor, Ms. Brown, he said he had no doubts
about the author's reporting and decided to let him continue to use
the pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked to meet him and be made confident that, of course, he
is who he is and does what he does,'' Remnick said. ``The fact that
he is a remarkable writer joined with this experience, which is
very hard for an outsider to replicate, maybe even impossible, is
just a glory, and we're all the richer for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Knutsen, Conlon's editor at Riverhead, said he and
the author had hardly discussed the issue and insisted that his use
of Conlon's pseudonym was not a marketing tool. It is a ``literary
persona,'' Knutsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the author's personal wish to not have his life
turned upside down,'' Knutsen said. ``The other thing to point out
is that the author is not blowing the lid on any police secrets.
That's not the point of his book.''
</P>
<P>
   Conlon did not answer requests for an interview. Now that
Conlon's name has been made public, Remnick said he could ``not
begin to speculate'' on whether he would suggest to Conlon that he
use his real name.

REACTION IS MIXED TO NEW MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEITH CHROSTOWSKI  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.,) _ Money talks. So what is our redesigned
paper money saying?
</P>
<P>
   From store clerks to art critics, people are calling it funny
money, play money, even Monopoly money.
</P>
<P>
   The new cash, some even opine, is saying that we are not as
serious about our money or its stability in this
end-of-the-century, easy-come, easy-go casino economy.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, (begin itals)it's not as pretty.(end itals)
</P>
<P>
   Others think that after 70 years it is time for something
different, that they like the new bold look that heralds newness
and openness to change.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, (begin itals)it's prettier.(end itals)
</P>
<P>
   The retooled 100s, 50s and now the workhorse 20s are filtering
into our pocketbooks, and seeing one raises eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the 20s came out, bang, it really hit the public between
the eyes,'' said Barry Robinson, spokesman for the Federal Reserve
Bank of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   That's also a good way to describe how experts in visual design
and art critics are reacting. Opinions are beginning to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love those new bills,'' said Lance Carlson, dean of faculty
and interim dean of design at the Kansas City Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Who says, he asked, ``that real money shouldn't look good, look
fun, look interesting?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe Adam Gopnik, for one. He writes in (begin itals)The
New Yorker(itals end): ``The New Money just looks _ well the New
Money just looks cheaper than the old money.''
</P>
<P>
   The redesign _ bigger, off-center portraits, updated engravings
and larger numbers on a cleaned-off, white background _ is pushing
aside a look rooted in the Civil War era and made standard in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Several federal agencies collaborated on the new look. Its
driving purpose was to make room for anti-counterfeiting devices,
including a watermark you can see when you hold the bill up to the
light. Along the way, the older neoclassical design, with its
Greco-Roman ties, was updated.
</P>
<P>
   On the old 20s, thick, curvaceous scrollwork and columns of
leaves frame the centered portrait of Andrew Jackson on the front
and the White House on the back. Art elements fill up the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The new 20 is framed on both sides with a thin, straight border.
On the front the portrait has been redone and moved to the left,
and all the numbers vary in size, so any symmetry is destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   On the back the White House has been turned around, with the
more recognizable, gracious back portico replaced by the angular,
Grecian front bound in an oval. There's almost an inch of white
space on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the back there's an aggressively modern, sans-serif 20
you can't miss. It's ``blocky,'' is about the nicest thing one
critic has to say about it.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hogan, who teaches printmaking at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City, doesn't hold back: He calls the new 20s
``lifeless...antiseptic.''
</P>
<P>
   The new bills have ``lost all their flair, their continuity of
design. They're all function, no form.''
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of Jackson, he said, ``looks like a rock
star....The White House looks like a tomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Rothstein, a critic for (begin itals here)The New York
Times(end itals here), writes that it's a ``dumbed down'' bill
``pieced together from spare parts, and there weren't quite enough
to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   He misses the old bill's reverence for images, by which the
government confers value on what is just a cheap piece of paper.
That fineness of design, he and other critics say, indicates a
country serious about its money, while its symmetry boasts of
stability, the real coin of the realm.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Krueger, who teaches printmaking at the University of
Kansas, thinks that ``this oversimplification is just a sign that
this is not going to be a valuable form of transaction anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It means cash money is disappearing, he says, to be replaced by
forms of digital, electronic credit.
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   On the back, the big 20 draws the most notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put that giant 20 on there for people who have a hard
time seeing,'' said Benjamin Hufbauer, who teaches art history at
the art institute. He understands, but ``that does look weird; that
part really does look like Monopoly money.''
</P>
<P>
   Other who criticize the new design point to foreign currencies,
which are both more vibrant-looking and changed more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Fricke, associate professor of art history at the art
institute, calls the new 20 very homely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been very disappointed in the look of our money.
For one thing, it's all one color. If you travel in Europe, they
spend a lot of time designing the look of their money, and it's
very beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do Europeans say about our money?
</P>
<P>
   ``What they say is it's boring,'' Fricke said. ``But then they
think that reflects our lack of interest in art. ... In France,
they have Emile Zola on one of their bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Other countries display scientists, natural landmarks and even
resident wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   She does like the new portrait on the 20 and the asymmetry. But
``our culture passes up opportunity after opportunity ... to make
things more beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Larry
Felix, said it was a challenge to ``maintain the traditional
American look. And we think (the designers) succeeded
wonderfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Schloss, Treasury spokesman, added that the gripers were
not taking into account the need for the anti-counterfeiting
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York art critics _ to the best that we know _ don't
counterfeit.''
</P>
<P>
   To Carlson, the bills have a ``cartoon feel.'' And that's
praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're far more contemporary than the traditional
imprint...very graphically dramatic,'' and that may be why they
look like play money.
</P>
<P>
   The old bills contain a laundry list of information and symbols,
he says, ``but it wasn't attractively done. ... This is really
about the look of the thing versus the content.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Miller, a photographer with a master's degree in design from
KU, likes the asymmetry and being able to better see the
presidents' expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the renderings of Grant and Jackson are much, much
better depictions of them,'' he said. ``The old ones are very
dated.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving the portraits will have a practical effect: When you fold
one of the old bills in half over and over, the portrait becomes
worn down the middle. On the new bills the image will last longer.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also defends the use of statesmen in a country born of
political strife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say a lot about ourselves, because Americans put statesmen
on their money.''
</P>
<P>
   And Robinson, of the Fed, who likes the new bill, defends the
slow evolution of the design:
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are really sensitive about their money. I
think it's rooted in populism, where there was a great deal of fear
about bankers in smoke-filled rooms cutting deals and making their
money less valuable. ... It goes back 90 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics are one thing, but what about people who handle money in
daily commerce?
</P>
<P>
   Store clerks, cocktail servers and others say the new design
just plain looks funny _ they mention that big 20 on the back _ and
say that at least some of their customers agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like play money to me, like Monopoly money,'' said
Rosanna L. Burt, assistant manager at Successories at Crown Center
Shops. ``That's what I say when I get one: `Thanks for the play
money.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some are having trouble telling the 20s and 50s apart.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Biersmith, doorman at the Hyatt Regency Crown Center hotel,
said that a customer mistakenly ``flipped one of the bellmen a
50,'' and then the bellman came to him mistakenly thinking the 50
was counterfeit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there's as much confusion on the tipper's end as on
the tippees,'' Biersmith said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lisa Kramer, a vice president of NationsBank in Kansas
City, says that customers are beginning to ask for them and that
tellers like the bigger numbers and portraits. The Bureau of
Engraving and Printing says studies show that people recognize
faces more easily than other images, hence the bigger portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Miller cautions that we should give the new bills some time on
all counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once something is in circulation for a while,'' he said, ``you
get used to it and it's much easier to determine if you like it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, it's a design right for its time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of in an age where people are wanting stuff to look
bolder and more contemporary looking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got my first one the other day...,'' Carlson said,
``and I noticed that I've resisted spending it, 'cause I kind of
like it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city that never sleeps is feeling drowsy in the
opening moments of ``On the Town.'' Leonard Bernstein's score for
this 1944 show begins with the musical equivalent of a yawn and a
stretch, the sense of dormant urban energies slowly surfacing.
</P>
<P>
   The lazy, purring harmonies of a group of workmen just out of
bed are set off by more dissonant, abrupt sounds from the
orchestra, and they are sounds that tingle with anticipation. New
York, New York, is about to wake up, and when New York wakes up, it
explodes. It's impossible not to be stirred by the rhythms of
expectation in this music, a preface to the entrance of three
sailors on shore leave in Manhattan, dizzy with the possibilities
of the day ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Similar feelings of anticipation are sure to be shared by the
audiences of the new incarnation of ``On the Town,'' which opened
Sunday night at the Gershwin Theater. And for those familiar with
the troubled history of this revival, the feelings are edged with
anxiety. A question hovers that, while unspoken, seems as
pronounced as the brass in the orchestra: Can the director, George
C. Wolfe, for whom this show has been an obsessive labor of
devotion, bring an admittedly dated period piece into immediate,
pulsing life? Will ``On the Town'' itself fully wake up in 1998?
</P>
<P>
   That the answer is no is perhaps the saddest part of what has
been a particularly disheartening season on Broadway. From the
moment the chorus of sailors bursts onstage belting the show's most
famous song, ``New York, New York,'' there's an aura of exertion
that is only rarely translated into the effervescence that is the
lifeblood of both cities and musicals. Indeed, most of what follows
feels strangely somnolent, despite the presence in the cast of two
rousing human alarm clocks named Lea DeLaria and Mary Testa.
</P>
<P>
   There were high hopes when it was announced that Wolfe, the
artistic director of the Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York
Shakespeare Festival, would be staging ``On the Town'' as part of
the Public's series of alfresco performances at the Delacorte
Theater in Central Park last year. The show was the product of four
impudent talents just beginning to make their names in the 1940s:
Bernstein, the choreographer Jerome Robbins and the show's
lyricists and book writers, Betty Comden and Adolph Green.
</P>
<P>
   A bouncy serenade to both a flashy, pushy city and to the
musical theater, it seemed an appropriate vehicle for the director
who had brought brilliant contemporary verve to productions ranging
from Shakespeare's ``Tempest'' to the historical dance musical
``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk.'' It was Wolfe's expressed
intention to rechannel the youthful exuberance of the original ``On
the Town'' into a bright, ethnically mixed tapestry to match the
New York of today.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the park, ``On the Town'' was far from a complete
success. The dances, by the experimental choreographer Eliot Feld,
had an oddly listless quality that hardly lived up to memories of
Robbins' dynamic production numbers. The show felt joltingly
incomplete; much of its fresh-faced cast seemed correspondingly
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The group of producers who had planned to take ``On the Town''
to Broadway changed their minds. Wolfe proceeded on his own, with
the New York Shakespeare Festival as the sole producer of the $5
million show. He hired a new choreographer, Keith Young, best known
for his work in music videos and concert tours, and recast several
of the key roles. A few weeks before the opening, rumors flared
about Wolfe's continuing dissatisfaction with the dances, and Joey
McKneely, the choreographer of ``The Life,'' was brought in as a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting production certainly looks vibrant, awash in
hard-candy colors and spangles of light. And Bernstein's eclectic
score still throbs with a purely urban intensity. Yet often the
show resembles the giant reproductions of hand-painted tourist
postcards that figure prominently in Adrianne Lobel's sets. They're
eye-catching; they're amusing; they're flat. This latest edition of
``On the Town'' is a definite improvement on what was seen in the
park, but it largely remains trapped in two picturesque dimensions,
vividly underscored by Paul Tazewell's comic-book costumes and Paul
Gallo's lighting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In telling the story of three sailors who meet and fall in love
with three very different women during a 24-hour shore leave, the
production fails to convey the urgency of romance set to a ticking
clock. Young's choreography is smooth, with lots of twirls and
perky leaps; but it is not sharply focused, and it doesn't give off
much heat. Similarly, Wolfe's staging, including a tedious Keystone
Kops-style chase sequence, can be frantic without being funny. And
the cast members often fail to find a revivifying connection with
the revue-style, period wit of the Comden and Green book. They seem
to deliver the jokes at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Laylon Ojeda and Tai Jimenez, newly cast as the ingenuous
sailor Gabey and the winner of the Miss Turnstiles pageant with
whom he falls in love, are charming presences. Ojeda has a wistful
tenor that shimmers fetchingly through the ballads ``Lonely Town''
and ``Lucky to Be Me,'' and Ms. Jimenez is a sweetly lissome
dancer. But they are also blankly passive, and you forget about
them when they aren't onstage.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said, to a lesser extent, of Jesse Tyler
Ferguson and Robert Montano as Gabey's bell-bottomed pals.
Ferguson, in particular, has a boyish likability, but you get the
feeling that all three sailors are marking time, looking for
direction, when what's demanded is a seize-the-day aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   This most un-sailorlike mildness is party built into the script.
In social terms, the most fascinating aspect of ``On the Town''
today is that its women are the active romantic partners, a mirror
of changing sexual roles in the war years. Ozzie ( Montano) is
taken in hand by Claire DeLoone (Sarah Knowlton, in an initially
shrill performance that improves greatly as the evening goes on),
an anthropologist whose primal instincts get the better of her. And
scrawny Chip ( Ferguson) is picked up, in more ways than one, by a
steamroller of a taxi driver named Hildy.
</P>
<P>
   Hildy, praises be, is played by Lea DeLaria, a large, loud
stand-up comedian who turns out to have been born for the musical
comedy stage. She was the jewel of the park production, and she is
also this one's glittering center. She is now pushing the comedy
harder than she has to in her opening scenes, but once she starts
singing, in that big brass voice of hers, she is in complete and
confident control.
</P>
<P>
   Working through the saucy double-entendres and scat
embellishments of ``I Can Cook Too,'' Hildy's mating call of a
solo, Ms. DeLaria makes an obliging captive of anyone watching her.
Indeed, this actress seems to grab the audience by the lapels,
demanding and then justifying its attention. In this sense, she
does what the show itself doesn't, and there's an electric buzz
when she's onstage that makes you pointedly aware of what you've
been missing otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   There are lively caricatures from Annie Golden, as Hildy's
snuffling roommate, and Jonathan Freeman, as Clare's starchy,
masochistic fiance. But only Ms. Testa, as an alcoholic Italian
voice teacher, is on Ms. DeLaria's top-shelf level. Looking like
Anna Magnani as drawn by Walt Disney, Ms. Testa gives a risky,
outrageously florid performance that pays off at every step.
Whether turning a simple ``good morning'' into an operatic aria or
recoiling at the sight of her own monkey-fur coat, this actress
makes a fine art of comic exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   The go-for-broke zeal she brings to her performance makes her
lines seem newly minted, just as Ms. DeLaria creates the illusion
that she is inventing the songs she sings. By contrast, there's a
self-consciousness about most of the other performances; they bring
to mind a group of kids who have put on their grandparents' clothes
and aren't quite sure how to wear them.
</P>
<P>
   This may partly come from the tensions that have beset the
opening of this revival, which has undergone considerable
last-minute revisions. You often have the sense of voices inside
the performers' heads yelling, ``Be funny!,'' something hardly
conducive to spontaneity. It's possible the actors will relax into
their roles more as the show continues its run.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, this ``On the Town'' only rarely makes 1944 feel like
the present. More often, the production seems to be looking over
its shoulder with a faint perplexity at what is definitely, to
borrow the title of the evening's most poignant song, ``some other
time.''

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is not a big difference
between Florida State (no. 1) and Tennessee (2), and the difference
between Kansas State (3) and UCLA (4) is even smaller.

REACTION IS MIXED TO NEW MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEITH CHROSTOWSKI  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.,) _ On the back, the big 20 draws themost
notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put that giant 20 on there for people who have a hard
time seeing,'' said Benjamin Hufbauer, who teaches art history at
the art institute. He understands, but ``that does look weird; that
part really does look like Monopoly money.''
</P>
<P>
   Other who criticize the new design point to foreign currencies,
which are both more vibrant-looking and changed more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Fricke, associate professor of art history at the art
institute, calls the new 20 very homely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been very disappointed in the look of our money.
For one thing, it's all one color. If you travel in Europe, they
spend a lot of time designing the look of their money, and it's
very beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do Europeans say about our money?
</P>
<P>
   ``What they say is it's boring,'' Fricke said. ``But then they
think that reflects our lack of interest in art. ... In France,
they have Emile Zola on one of their bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Other countries display scientists, natural landmarks and even
resident wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   She does like the new portrait on the 20 and the asymmetry. But
``our culture passes up opportunity after opportunity ... to make
things more beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Larry
Felix, said it was a challenge to ``maintain the traditional
American look. And we think (the designers) succeeded
wonderfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Schloss, Treasury spokesman, added that the gripers were
not taking into account the need for the anti-counterfeiting
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York art critics _ to the best that we know _ don't
counterfeit.''
</P>
<P>
   To Carlson, the bills have a ``cartoon feel.'' And that's
praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're far more contemporary than the traditional
imprint...very graphically dramatic,'' and that may be why they
look like play money.
</P>
<P>
   The old bills contain a laundry list of information and symbols,
he says, ``but it wasn't attractively done. ... This is really
about the look of the thing versus the content.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Miller, a photographer with a master's degree in design from
KU, likes the asymmetry and being able to better see the
presidents' expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the renderings of Grant and Jackson are much, much
better depictions of them,'' he said. ``The old ones are very
dated.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving the portraits will have a practical effect: When you fold
one of the old bills in half over and over, the portrait becomes
worn down the middle. On the new bills the image will last longer.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also defends the use of statesmen in a country born of
political strife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say a lot about ourselves, because Americans put statesmen
on their money.''
</P>
<P>
   And Robinson, of the Fed, who likes the new bill, defends the
slow evolution of the design:
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are really sensitive about their money. I
think it's rooted in populism, where there was a great deal of fear
about bankers in smoke-filled rooms cutting deals and making their
money less valuable. ... It goes back 90 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics are one thing, but what about people who handle money in
daily commerce?
</P>
<P>
   Store clerks, cocktail servers and others say the new design
just plain looks funny _ they mention that big 20 on the back _ and
say that at least some of their customers agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like play money to me, like Monopoly money,'' said
Rosanna L. Burt, assistant manager at Successories at Crown Center
Shops. ``That's what I say when I get one: `Thanks for the play
money.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some are having trouble telling the 20s and 50s apart.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Biersmith, doorman at the Hyatt Regency Crown Center hotel,
said that a customer mistakenly ``flipped one of the bellmen a
50,'' and then the bellman came to him mistakenly thinking the 50
was counterfeit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there's as much confusion on the tipper's end as on
the tippees,'' Biersmith said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lisa Kramer, a vice president of NationsBank in Kansas
City, says that customers are beginning to ask for them and that
tellers like the bigger numbers and portraits. The Bureau of
Engraving and Printing says studies show that people recognize
faces more easily than other images, hence the bigger portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Miller cautions that we should give the new bills some time on
all counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once something is in circulation for a while,'' he said, ``you
get used to it and it's much easier to determine if you like it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, it's a design right for its time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of in an age where people are wanting stuff to look
bolder and more contemporary looking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got my first one the other day...,'' Carlson said,
``and I noticed that I've resisted spending it, 'cause I kind of
like it.''

NOW PLAYING: TWO NEW MINUTES OF `STAR WARS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The opening title reads: ``Every generation has a
legend. ... Every journey has a first step. ... Every saga has a
beginning.'' Then the John Williams music starts, the opening
chords so unmistakable that movie audiences burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' is back. Or more precisely, a 2-minute 10-second
trailer for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' the
first ``Star Wars'' film since the release of ``Return of the
Jedi'' 15 years ago. The new film, written and directed by George
Lucas, opens on May 21, but the anticipation for it is
extraordinary, several distribution executives say.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer was screened on Tuesday in 26 states on 75 screens
selected by the movie's distributor, 20th Century Fox. Fans heard
about it four days earlier on the Lucasfilm Web site
(www.starwars.com), and it quickly turned into a film event that
had no precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Theaters showing films like ``The Waterboy,'' ``The Siege'' and
``Meet Joe Black'' were crammed with people _ mostly young men _
who paid full admission just to see the trailer and left when the
movie began. The trailer was also shown after each movie ended, so
a handful of theater owners allowed filmgoers to return with their
torn ticket stub. (Historically, trailers used to be shown after
movies ended, hence the name.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of
Exhibitor Relations Co., which monitors the box office for theater
owners. ``We've never heard of a trailer packing people into a
theater. It's a precedent-setting event.'' He said the reaction to
the gimmick made it inevitable that the new ``Star Wars'' would
have powerful audience appeal. ``It's going to reach fever pitch
with this movie, which is unquestionably going to be one of the
biggest of 1999,'' Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sherak, the chairman of Fox's Domestic Film Group, said the
idea for the early-in-the-week trailer, which was released
nationally over the weekend, came from Lucas' associates. ``They
said since they have such a big fan base, why not set something up
just for the fans first and make sure it's shown to the rest of the
public very quickly?'' he said. ``The idea was to figure out a way
to have fun with this. `Star Wars' is part of the culture, but it's
still a movie. Let's treat it like a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the box office impact of the trailer _ and the
trailer alone _ were the substantial gains made on Tuesday night
over Monday at theaters showing it. At the Mann Theater in the
Westwood section of Los Angeles, near the University of California,
``The Siege'' took in $13,000 on Tuesday night; it had taken in
only $1,000 on Monday night. At the Union Square Theater 14 in
Manhattan, ``Meet Joe Black'' grossed $6,300 on Monday night, but
$10,800 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Star Wars'' is the first of three planned prequels
that will go back in time a full generation and detail the story of
Anakin Skywalker's transformation into the mysterious and sinister
Darth Vader. In the new film, Skywalker is a 9-year-old boy and
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a brash young Jedi knight.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas himself has virtually total control over the film. Not
only has he put his personal fortune into it, he is in charge of
its promotion and distribution. No decisions are made without his
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer itself shows glimpses of some of the film's stars:
Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi; Liam Neeson as his mentor, Qui-Gon
Jinn; Natalie Portman as the young Queen and Jake Lloyd as the
young Anakin Skywalker. Samuel L. Jackson and Terence Stamp are
also in the cast.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever the mystique of ``Star Wars,'' the reaction to the
trailer seemed to burn up the Internet. It has been shown on the
``Star Wars'' Lucasfilm Web site, and was widely videotaped by fans
when it was shown on ``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Access
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The trailer felt like five seconds,'' said Harry Knowles, who
founded the Ain't-It-Cool-News Web site
(www.aint-it-cool-news.com), which is populated by movie fans
obsessed with ``Star Wars.'' Over the Internet, Knowles seemed
stricken with guilt about his early qualms about the new ``Star
Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate myself for every doubt I had,'' he said. ``What on
earth was I ever thinking? Analyzing every nugget, every whisper.
Worrying about reshoots and deadlines. George seems to be 100
percent on his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Other fans, on the Internet, talked about weeping and shaking
while watching the trailer. On Knowles' Web site, a fan named David
Chung summed up his feelings: ``What can I say! George Lucas must
be a superior form of life!''

<P>
   (PUERTO CORTES, Honduras) _ Another woman tops that story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a dead baby floating in the water,'' she says. ``When
they picked it up, it was full of mud.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, at the Costa Mar Hotel in Puerto Cortes, the
rest of the Kansas City, Mo., team of doctors and nurses mug for
group photos after breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   They wear matching white T-shirts: a rainbow circle around an
airplane and the words ``La Buena Fe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, does anybody want to hear how the Chiefs did?'' asks the
group's pharmacist, Barbara Gose of Independence. A discussion of
the team's troubles begins.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all in the group have ties to John Blumenschein, an
Independence doctor who began La Buena Fe in 1957. Blumenschein
lived only a year in Honduras before he died of cancer. But his
wife, Marian, continued to work there, establishing what has grown
into a project of medical clinics and educational programs near a
lake called Yojoa.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Risa Hayes was delivered by Blumenschein, an obstetrician.
She volunteered with her husband, doctor Larry Hayes, because each
had recently retired.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel DeBarthe grew up in a village near La Buena Fe. She
immigrated to the United States 25 years ago after attending Truman
High School as part of a student exchange program through La Buena
Fe. She is a nurse in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Others are tied to La Buena Fe through the RLDS Church, which
helped fund some of Blumenschein's work.
</P>
<P>
   The La Buena Fe workers are using Puerto Cortes, an industrial
city on the northwestern coast, as a base from which to fan out
into rural areas nearby. They were sent to the area by the Honduran
government because the area was hit especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour the group has piled into pickups and driven a
half-hour to reach Chameleconcito. The dirt roads leading to it are
narrow and steep.
</P>
<P>
   Chameleconcito is named for the Chamelecon River, which runs
through northern Honduras. It is a rural community that was spared
flooding because it is on high ground.
</P>
<P>
   But an extra 225 persons are living there now, many in the
school building where the doctors will set up their clinic. They
are from areas that flooded when the Chamelecon River spread out
and washed away the communities on its banks.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly laundered pants, shirts and socks hang drying in the
humid air, stuck into the slats of the school's windows. A line of
mothers and their children is waiting when the team arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Boese of Manhattan, Kan., straddles his long legs across
a white bench normally used by grade-school children and begins
work. Kaye DeTray of Lake Tapawingo in Jackson County, Mo.,,
assists him.
</P>
<P>
   DeTray carefully asks the patients about their condition in
halting, deliberate Spanish. A dictionary explaining medical terms
in Spanish lies on the small children's desk beside her.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning people stream into the school. They are
afflicted with parasites, diarrhea, vomiting, coughs, fevers and
rashes. Children and dogs toddle in and out of the cinder-block
room.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the babies are oddly quiet, lethargic with dehydration,
the nurses say.
</P>
<P>
   A woman begins cooking eggs and beans on a kerosene stove for
the children, sending a gassy smell into the room.
</P>
<P>
   Boese carefully pumps a few drops of a waterless soap onto his
hands between each patient.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, the rainbow colors of the T-shirts are smearing
together with sweat. The group has run out of medicine to treat
worms.
</P>
<P>
   Word spreads into the village. The people quit saying it is a
problem when asked their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   A woman holding a 2-year-old boy sits down before Boese.
</P>
<P>
   DeTray lifts the baby's T-shirt. The baby's belly is swollen, a
sign of parasites.
</P>
<P>
   She speaks with the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's boiling water now for her cooking and what they drink,''
she reports.
</P>
<P>
   The woman makes a comment in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   DeTray sighs, ``I didn't get that.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the group has treated 300 patients at two
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Each day in Honduras is largely the same. The team members go to
shelters where the Honduran government believes they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   At night they meet back at the hotel for dinner and to discuss
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to tell one woman today that if her 1-year-old daughter
didn't drink and she didn't urinate, in a day she would probably
die,'' said Frances Ellis, a home health nurse from Independence.
``I just kept thinking: How would I feel if I couldn't take care of
my kids and they were sick?''
</P>
<P>
   Gose stands surveying the remaining medicine. They had brought
94 boxes, each weighing 45 pounds. Most of the medicine had been
donated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough of anything pediatric,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Someone notes that Sierra is not at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, about 8 p.m., she walks into the restaurant. She
had walked up to the hospital to work more after returning from a
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they could use me,'' she says. ``I'm starved.''
</P>
<P>
   She is beaming. She had delivered a baby. The diarrhea and
nausea she awoke with is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thirsty to work,'' she says. ``I'm a doctor.'' (30)

<P>
   (PUERTO CORTES, Honduras) _ Furrowing her brow, Aracely Sierra
girds herself for a day among the flies and the patients in the
cramped emergency room of the Puerto Cortes Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She prepares for what will become a daily grind of helping those
who cannot help themselves _ the victims of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days the hurricane and its aftermath knocked out
three-fourths of the country's bridges and roads. More than 7,000
people have died. Almost twice as many are missing, and one in four
is still homeless. Some estimate that disease could double the
death toll. Malaria and cholera are spreading. There is little
medicine, and the water is contaminated with waste and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Walking down a dimly lighted hospital hallway, Sierra turns past
a box of broken glass vials, past an air conditioner that drips
into the wastebasket overflowing with soiled bandages, and enters
the emergency room full of wailing babies and patient mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch has brought Sierra, a native Honduran who now
lives in Blue Springs, Mo., back to her home country.
</P>
<P>
   She is part of a medical team of seven nurses, six doctors, a
dentist and a pharmacist affiliated with La Buena Fe, an
association based in Independence, Mo., that for 40 years has
provided education and medical care to the people of rural
Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency room, in which physicians treat about 50 patients
a day, is 20 feet long and 13 feet wide _ about the size of some
master bedrooms in Blue Springs. Everything metal in the room is
rusty; the scale, the desks, the stands for IV bags and the sides
of the three examining tables. The painted walls are speckled with
mold and grime. The antiseptic smell usually lingering in hospital
air is absent; antiseptic would be a luxury here.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra fans a fly away from her face. She cannot wash her hands
before she begins her examination, or between patients. There is no
functioning sink in the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra smiles warmly at her first patient of what will be a
13-hour day, 26-month-old Josue Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Josue's symptoms will be repeated in nearly all of the 20
infants and toddlers she will see this day: diarrhea, vomiting and
respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is germ-filled mud from the flooding that is now
drying, sending the mold into the air. An infant with diarrhea can
die of dehydration within two days, Sierra says.
</P>
<P>
   Josue is crying. His shirtless chest rises and falls as he
struggles for each breath. His head is a mat of brown, wet curls.
</P>
<P>
   His mother holds him steady as Sierra gently lays him on a
examining table. A splattering of dried blood is on the wall behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra places a wooden tongue depressor in his mouth. Josue
gags, and a glob of brown mucus and saliva rolls out of his mouth
and onto the floor. There are no assistants to wipe it up. It stays
there all day.
</P>
<P>
   Josue cries: ``Don't give me a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, my love,'' Sierra says.
</P>
<P>
   Another mother sits nearby holding her 15-month-old baby, who
has been lulled to sleep. She is pressing the clear mask of an
electric machine called a Nebulizer over his tiny mouth and nose.
The Nebulizer clears the bronchial tubes by pushing steamed
medicine into the lungs. The mothers take turns using it. Josue is
next in line.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours will pass before Josue's lungs are clear enough for
Sierra to decide he has a condition similar to bronchitis and will
be admitted for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Another half-dozen children and their mothers find space to
stand in the room. They shift around the room, careful to stay out
of Sierra's way. More mothers and babies are in the two small
adjoining rooms. Four metal cribs are in each room.
</P>
<P>
   In one crib, a 2-month-old girl lies motionless. An IV is in her
limp arm, held steady by a splint of folded cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   A mother uses a piece of cloth torn from a shirt to soak up the
yellow liquid running from her infant's bottom. She has no diapers.
The baby is red and bumpy with rashes.
</P>
<P>
   The women trade stories of the hurricane while they wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' one says, describing how the waters
swept away her home.
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Another woman tops that story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a dead baby floating in the water,'' she says. ``When
they picked it up, it was full of mud.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, at the Costa Mar Hotel in Puerto Cortes, the
rest of the Kansas City, Mo., team of doctors and nurses mug for
group photos after breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   They wear matching white T-shirts: a rainbow circle around an
airplane and the words ``La Buena Fe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, does anybody want to hear how the Chiefs did?'' asks the
group's pharmacist, Barbara Gose of Independence. A discussion of
the team's troubles begins.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all in the group have ties to John Blumenschein, an
Independence doctor who began La Buena Fe in 1957. Blumenschein
lived only a year in Honduras before he died of cancer. But his
wife, Marian, continued to work there, establishing what has grown
into a project of medical clinics and educational programs near a
lake called Yojoa.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Risa Hayes was delivered by Blumenschein, an obstetrician.
She volunteered with her husband, doctor Larry Hayes, because each
had recently retired.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel DeBarthe grew up in a village near La Buena Fe. She
immigrated to the United States 25 years ago after attending Truman
High School as part of a student exchange program through La Buena
Fe. She is a nurse in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Others are tied to La Buena Fe through the RLDS Church, which
helped fund some of Blumenschein's work.
</P>
<P>
   The La Buena Fe workers are using Puerto Cortes, an industrial
city on the northwestern coast, as a base from which to fan out
into rural areas nearby. They were sent to the area by the Honduran
government because the area was hit especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour the group has piled into pickups and driven a
half-hour to reach Chameleconcito. The dirt roads leading to it are
narrow and steep.
</P>
<P>
   Chameleconcito is named for the Chamelecon River, which runs
through northern Honduras. It is a rural community that was spared
flooding because it is on high ground.
</P>
<P>
   But an extra 225 persons are living there now, many in the
school building where the doctors will set up their clinic. They
are from areas that flooded when the Chamelecon River spread out
and washed away the communities on its banks.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly laundered pants, shirts and socks hang drying in the
humid air, stuck into the slats of the school's windows. A line of
mothers and their children is waiting when the team arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Boese of Manhattan, Kan., straddles his long legs across
a white bench normally used by grade-school children and begins
work. Kaye DeTray of Lake Tapawingo in Jackson County, Mo.,,
assists him.
</P>
<P>
   DeTray carefully asks the patients about their condition in
halting, deliberate Spanish. A dictionary explaining medical terms
in Spanish lies on the small children's desk beside her.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning people stream into the school. They are
afflicted with parasites, diarrhea, vomiting, coughs, fevers and
rashes. Children and dogs toddle in and out of the cinder-block
room.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the babies are oddly quiet, lethargic with dehydration,
the nurses say.
</P>
<P>
   A woman begins cooking eggs and beans on a kerosene stove for
the children, sending a gassy smell into the room.
</P>
<P>
   Boese carefully pumps a few drops of a waterless soap onto his
hands between each patient.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, the rainbow colors of the T-shirts are smearing
together with sweat. The group has run out of medicine to treat
worms.
</P>
<P>
   Word spreads into the village. The people quit saying it is a
problem when asked their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   A woman holding a 2-year-old boy sits down before Boese.
</P>
<P>
   DeTray lifts the baby's T-shirt. The baby's belly is swollen, a
sign of parasites.
</P>
<P>
   She speaks with the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's boiling water now for her cooking and what they drink,''
she reports.
</P>
<P>
   The woman makes a comment in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   DeTray sighs, ``I didn't get that.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the group has treated 300 patients at two
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Each day in Honduras is largely the same. The team members go to
shelters where the Honduran government believes they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   At night they meet back at the hotel for dinner and to discuss
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to tell one woman today that if her 1-year-old daughter
didn't drink and she didn't urinate, in a day she would probably
die,'' said Frances Ellis, a home health nurse from Independence.
``I just kept thinking: How would I feel if I couldn't take care of
my kids and they were sick?''
</P>
<P>
   Gose stands surveying the remaining medicine. They had brought
94 boxes, each weighing 45 pounds. Most of the medicine had been
donated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough of anything pediatric,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Someone notes that Sierra is not at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, about 8 p.m., she walks into the restaurant. She
had walked up to the hospital to work more after returning from a
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they could use me,'' she says. ``I'm starved.''
</P>
<P>
   She is beaming. She had delivered a baby. The diarrhea and
nausea she awoke with is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thirsty to work,'' she says. ``I'm a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ Four years ago the 28-year-old Kansas
Citian faced the possibility of 75 years in prison on charges of
burglary and armed criminal action. After the death of his adoptive
mother, who had prayed for him eight years, members of her church
prayed for Jackson, too.
</P>
<P>
   After his acquittal _ ``The Lord performed a miracle,'' he said
_ heenrolled in junior college and joined his mother's church, the
Pentecostal Church of God in Christ. He eventually became its youth
director, and now he teaches young people to stay away from bad
influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes being in a holiness church,'' Jackson said, ``and
doing some fasting and praying to change your life, because the
devil has so many tricks out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals as a whole tend to be less conservative than
Pentecostals are, but they also struggle with the implications of
some of the more popular spiritual trends. More liberal paths lead
to relativism, said the Rev. Jesse Middendorf, senior pastor of
First Church of the Nazarene in Kansas City, ``where there are no
moral absolutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical and nondenominational churches have been growing
faster in recent years than some of the more moderate mainline
Christian denominations. One reason why, observers say, is that
they often offer worship services that strongly engage the
emotions, that emphasize the personal spiritual experience more
than doctrine. Another reason is marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Donald E. Miller, for one, refers to growing
independents, such as Vineyard Christian Fellowship, as ``new
paradigm'' churches _ congregations that may be creating a new
model for Protestantism.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by The Star reflected a slight decline in
denominational loyalty and a movement toward independence: 60
percent of respondents said they were raised in a particular
Protestant denomination, but only 54 percent identified their
current religious preference that way. Conversely, 8 percent said
they had been raised as Protestants of no particular denomination,
but 14 percent identified themselves that way now.
</P>
<P>
   People's religious beliefs are often quite murky and even
contradictory, said Tim Miller, religious studies professor at the
University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, he said, although some 90 percent of people say they
are Christians, 20 to 25 percent also say they believe in
reincarnation, which is not part of Christian theology.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the poll found that while 92 percent of area
respondents identified themselves as Christian, 16 percent said
they believed in astrology and horoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Even when people disagree strongly with some of their faith's
teachings, many today manage to stay connected.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Chollet, a member of St. Peter's Catholic Church in
Kansas City, is one of many Catholic women who find themselves at
odds with the church on various issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all happy about the women ordination issue, or
about certain sexual issues,'' Chollet said. ``But... I'm deeply
committed to the church. In no way do I feel unfaithful or
heretical.''
</P>
<P>
   In the poll, 80 percent of respondents agreed with the
statement: ``I believe an individual can disagree with major
teachings of a church or religion and still be a proper member of
that church.''
</P>
<P>
   That individualism is part of what contributes to the
``messiness'' Marty referred to: people switching denominations or
joining independent congregations and spiritual seekers bringing
new ideas from their far-flung quests back to their traditions.
</P>
<P>
   While tradition and family ties hold many people to their
denominations, others change faiths or congregations for a variety
of reasons, said the Rev. Bruce Rahtjen, pastor of St. Mary's
Episcopal Church in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   A family moves into a new area and chooses a church because of
its youth program, for example, or two persons of different
religions marry and join a new denomination as a compromise. Others
leave denominations or congregations over disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of other plates out there on the line to
partake from,'' said the Rev. John A. Coil, a church consultant and
part-time vicar at the Episcopal Church of the Holy Spirit in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The founding members of Coil's tiny church got together eight
years ago, most of them disappointed with their previous churches
or pastors. They came from several denominations.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation has had its growing pains, personality clashes
and financial strain. Now it counts 45 to 50 members who meet, at
least temporarily, in a small former office building at 7130
Wornall Road.
</P>
<P>
   They practice a healing ministry, Coil said _ ``some of them
spend hours praying for sick people.'' They hold a charismatic
worship service, with contemporary music, and share a long-term
vision of creating not a church edifice but a center for
reconciliation, a retreat campus where people would work to
``restore brokenness'' of all kinds _ individual, spiritual,
community or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of outward-looking vision, based on traditional
religious values if not always traditional practices, is what many
religious leaders say helps build strong communities.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders fear that despite the evidence of a robust faith in
Kansas City, it may not be working well enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling, pornography, abortion, racism: The toleration of these
and other things tends ``to deny that we have deep religious
convictions,'' said the Rev. Wallace S. Hartsfield, Baptist pastor,
community leader and president of the Congress of National Black
Churches.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that many problems need attention, others
find hope for solving them in the evidence of strong faith in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that the infrastructure that provides the values
and trust in a society is still intact, at least in this
community,'' said Joseph Schultz, executive director of the
Danciger Judaic Studies Program at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City. ``Because where it is not intact, we're in
deep trouble.'' (30)

SPIRITUAL QUESTS TAKING NEW DIRECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By By STEVE PAUL, HELEN T. GRAY and EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ In Kansas City, it's pretty easy to find:
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics who study ancient Hindu texts.
</P>
<P>
   Huge churches that offer their members something for everyone in
the spiritual equivalent of megaretailing.
</P>
<P>
   Yards of bookstore shelves filled with all things sacred, from
archangels to Zen, from mystical Judaism to writings by the pope.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   Many people of faith are restless.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their spiritual quests are taking new directions.
Traditional places of worship no longer answer all their questions
or fill all their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Others are digging in their heels, trying to deepen their
relationship with God or stave off the secular world's harmful
influences.
</P>
<P>
   These and other aspects of Kansas City's landscape of faith are
the subject of a series that begins today. Based on interviews with
theologians, scholars and others, and using findings from a Kansas
City Star poll, the stories affirm the city's reputation as a
prominent point on the Bible Belt and show that people are
incorporating the sacred in their lives in surprisingly divergent
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Marty, a religion scholar, is among those who have
identified eclectic spirituality and the growing ranks of
evangelical Christians as major _ and often quite contradictory _
currents in religious life today.
</P>
<P>
   While reading some of the results of the poll by The Star, and
considering their relation to national numbers, Marty came to a
quick conclusion about Kansas City: ``You've got a real believing
town here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Citians tend to have stronger religious feelings than the
nation as a whole does, according to the poll. People in the area
worship and pray more often than many other Americans do.
</P>
<P>
   While 96 percent of respondents said they believed in God or a
higher power, 64 percent, or almost two of every three persons,
said it adamantly: ``I know God really exists, and I have no doubts
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Truesdale, professor of philosophy of religion and Christian
ethics at the Nazarene Theological Seminary, welcomed the spiritual
strength that the poll reflected.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the barrages unleashed against religious faith in
this century,'' Truesdale said, ``most persons continue to draw
upon their faith for understanding themselves, for establishing and
justifying values and for identifying meaning in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, how people practice their beliefs is getting increasingly
``messy and blurry,'' Marty said, as denominational boundaries
shift and as cross-cultural awareness and pluralism expand.
</P>
<P>
   A sort of ``New Spirituality'' encompasses all this change,
applying to liberal believers and conservative ones, to modernists
and fundamentalists, to people who embrace diverse and
individualistic paths and those seeking moral certitude.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wuthnow, a Princeton sociologist, traces the many nuances
of American religious change in his book After Heaven. He and
others point to many reasons for the apparent spiritual vibrancy of
recent years. Two of the key ones:
</P>
<P>
   The growth of evangelicalism. It extends the born-again movement
of the 1970s and the conservatism of the Reagan era, which saw the
rise of influential televangelists such as Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its conservative connotations, ``evangelicalism''
also refers to the aggressive attempt to convert others, aided
today by increasingly sophisticated marketing techniques. And it is
frequently used to describe worship services that are musically
upbeat and emotionally lively.
</P>
<P>
   The growing ranks of spiritual eclectics _ both within and
outside organized religion _ who create a personal path of faith by
borrowing from other cultures or picking and choosing what they
want from faith traditions. Mix-and-match religion, some call it,
or the ``divine delicatessen.''
</P>
<P>
   Many spiritual seekers of the '90s have inherited some of the
cultural impulses of the 1960s, a decade when mainline
denominations lost their grasp on more and more Americans. Often
they've been influenced by inspirational speakers and authors _
from Wayne Dyer to Iyanla Vanzant.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Tenenbaum, a respiratory therapist in Kansas City,
epitomizes the eclectic seeker.
</P>
<P>
   A Catholic most of her life, she became a Baptist and now is an
Episcopalian. But she also attends inspirational lectures at Unity
Temple on the Plaza and has investigated American Indian
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is Jewish, and the walls and tables of their south
Kansas City home reflect their mixed faith traditions _ the Ten
Commandments, a Torah, a (itals here)shofar(end itals) (ram's horn)
and angels everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Tenenbaum, 50, considers her spiritual journey to be a constant
climb with no destination. There is always something new to learn
or attain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just amazed at why some people think you can't take a look
at something else and take it for yourself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative and fundamentalist groups _ whether Christian,
Muslim or Jewish _ tend to challenge Tenenbaum's sort of spiritual
pluralism and the toleration it implies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the people who really want God in their lives are wanting
definite rules to live by,'' said the Rev. Emanuel Newton of the
Christian Tabernacle, a Pentecostal church in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Pentecostalism represents the fundamentalist wing of the growing
trend of evangelicalism. The faith's rules and strict moral
discipline helped lift Sean Jackson from a life of drugs and crime.

POSITIVE SIGNS FROM THE TAPE AND THE FED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ If you're playing your stock investment cards close
to the vest after the recent bout of bearishness, keep in mind two
bits of conventional Wall Street wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   One is, don't fight the tape. The other is, don't fight the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   The tape has been sending a strong message for more than a
month. It says it's OK to go back into the water. After the
mid-July peak, the Dow Jones industrial average came within a
smidgen of plunging far enough to qualify the setback as an
official bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The market's swoon showed signs of accelerating after Federal
Reserve officials eased monetary policy only slightly in late
September when Wall Street had been hoping for substantially more
accommodation. The Fed realized its timidity had become more a
problem than a solution and on Oct. 15 surprised financial markets
with further interest rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the tape has been on a bullish tear and all the key
indexes, save the American Stock Exchange composite, are up
substantially for the year as the market heads into what is usually
an upbeat period.
</P>
<P>
   Some market mavens have rules of thumb to follow when gauging
how actions by the Federal Reserve will affect the stock market.
They vary somewhat, but all are based on the notion that when the
Fed loosens, it's good for stocks, and vice versa. Most such rules
require a series of moves, and the Fed's third rate cut in seven
weeks Tuesday underscored its commitment to ensuring liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest concern dogging the financial markets as summer gave
way to autumn had been increasing fear of a credit crunch. Some
markets had stopped functioning as investors and lenders shied from
anything that looked the slightest bit risky. The gunslingers
involved in high-risk trading ventures had become vulnerable to
death spirals because of their inability to unload the most
dangerous components of their portfolios at any price.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's first indecisive effort to ease exacerbated the
situation because it reminded markets of similar miscalculations in
1987 and 1989. Failure to move decisively enough then was blamed
for the crash of '87 and the recession of 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed usually makes policy decisions at regular meetings of
the Federal Open Market Committee. However, when its policy panel
decided to initiate another rate cut between meetings on Oct. 15,
the financial world took it as a sign the Fed wasn't going to allow
recent history to repeat itself if it could help it.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale behind the conventional wisdom is that the promise
of easy money by the central bank can overcome a lot of negative
vibes on Wall Street. Profit growth may be slowing and the world
may abound with trouble spots, but lower interest rates can more
than make up for lots of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing this, the markets will be more in a mood to make
positive bets on the future, which means the tape probably will
remain strong as bullish momentum builds. And as long as the Fed
remains accommodative enough to buoy bullish sentiment, the tape
will reflect this, and there's no sense fighting either the Fed or
the tape.
</P>
<P>
   There may be many good arguments against stocks. They don't
count for much, however, as long as central bankers are cooperative
and investors respond to the stimulus.

   IMPEACH-RDP (Washington) _ With the House moving quickly towards
a series of critical decisions on whether to impeach President
Clinton, the White House signaled Sunday that it was open to any
``serious and reasonable'' compromise that would allow the
president to put the year-long scandal behind him. By Alison
Mitchell.

   FREEDOM-REGAINED (New Orleans) _ Hayes Williams is haunted by
closed doors. In the long, narrow house on Lopez Street every
inside door is ajar, cabinets are open, kitchen drawers are pulled
half-out. His fiance, Linda Wilson, will come home from her job at
the pharmacy and find the house this way, and she thinks about
scolding him a little. ``But I'll stop, when I think about why he
does it,'' she said. He is not messy, she said. He is just a man
who knows what the inside of a box looks like, when it closes shut.
``I don't like closing up nothin','' said Williams, who served 30
years in Angola Prison for a killing he played no part in. He was
freed last year, though he knew that being turned loose and
actually living free, free in his own mind, are not the same. He
walked into prison at 19. Now he is almost 50, living in a world he
does not remember, constantly afraid some minor blunder, some
trivial brush with the law, some bad luck, will steal his freedom
again. By Rick Bragg.

   IRAQ-U.N. (United Nations) _ A week after Iraq narrowly escaped
an American military strike, it is signaling in a series of defiant

American and British attacks with old demands for an early lifting
of sanctions. By Barbara Crossette.

to his hopes for peaceful engagement with North Korea. By James
Bennet.

UPN'S OWNERS SHRUG OFF POOR RATINGS AND LOSSES

<TEXT>
<P>
   In most industries, if a company's sales dropped 40 percent from
one year to the next, not only would the chief executive be
dismissed, but the company might very well go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily so in broadcast television today.
</P>
<P>
   For evidence, consider UPN. The network's average audience has
shrunk 40 percent this fall from last fall. One new show,
``Reunited,'' has twice scored one of the lowest Nielsen ratings in
history, an 0.9 (about 895,000 homes, of the 84 million UPN can
reach). To make up for the low ratings, UPN has had to give most
advertisers two commercials for every one purchased. And it looks
as if the network will lose close to $200 million this year, after
losing about $180 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, UPN's owners sound almost cheery. Top executives at
Viacom and Chris-Craft, whose respective subsidiaries, Paramount
Television and Broadcast Holdings Corp., jointly own UPN, insist
that they are committed to the network for the long haul and that
they are braced for substantial losses until it improves. They also
expressed faith in Dean Valentine, UPN's third chief executive in
its almost four years of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what would be called failure by most measures of
business success, the one thing UPN says it will not do is go out
of the network business. ``There is no such scenario possible,
unless the stations they own get shut down,'' said a UPN executive,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   How can that be? In today's vertically integrated entertainment
world, giant parent companies own networks, production studios _
and the shows produced _ and local stations, but the stations are
among the most dependable profit makers. And to be competitive,
stations need a national network's high-profile programs in prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   Some stations are stuck with UPN, because they are ``family'':
Viacom's Paramount Television owns 19 television stations and
Chris-Craft owns eight.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly 200 others chose to sign on with UPN, which went on
the air in January 1995, with two nights of programming a week and
a promise to grow. Most affiliates were small, low-profile
independent stations that had been buying and scheduling programs
on their own _ syndicated shows, old movies and the games of local
sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   As networks grew _ Time Warner's WB network started the same
year as UPN, both added a third night the next year, and now offer
five nights a week _ the business changed. Prime-time syndication
producers have narrowed their aim, making mostly male-oriented
action-adventure dramas, which stations buy for weekend use or to
fill programming gaps. Most local sports teams have gone to cable
networks. Cable networks compete with stations to buy movie
packages, too.
</P>
<P>
   These days, stations would be hard pressed to survive
financially by cobbling together their own lineups, as was once the
norm. They need a network's brand name, its programs and its
national promotional and advertising power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the UPN stations are getting lower ratings, and thus lower
ad revenue, in many cases than they got before affiliating with UPN
_ and they must give two-thirds of their prime-time commercial
minutes to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, they are upset. A 40 percent drop in viewers
diminishes the audience for their 10 p.m. news programs, and hurts
whatever syndicated shows they have bought to run later in the
evening. It means promotional spots for the stations' other shows
are seen by fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   But there is precious little they can do. The only recourse
would be to drop UPN when their affiliation contracts expire, in
most cases several years from now, and join another network.
</P>
<P>
   WB is the only broadcast network to show growth this year. It
forged success with a heavily marketed appeal to teen-agers and
young women, the primary audience attracted by its first two big
hits, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Seventh Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, what UPN needs desperately _ some hit shows.
And there looms another worry: Like UPN's stations, the major
Hollywood production studios are also grumbling about those paltry
Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It costs studios hundreds of thousands of dollars each episode,
and often more, to produce shows. They recoup some of that in the
license fee paid by the network, but they share no advertising
earnings. To make money, they depend on a show succeeding and
accumulating enough episodes to sell into syndication or to cable
networks.
</P>
<P>
   That does not happen if people do not watch, and this fall, few
people have been watching UPN.
</P>
<P>
   One or two major studios have begun thinking twice about
development deals with UPN for now, according to some show
producers and some studio executives, none of whom would speak for
the record. Others have asked for a contractual clause stipulating
that if UPN goes out of business in less than four years _ the
typical time needed to accumulate enough episodes for syndication _
UPN would reimburse the supplier for deficits incurred in producing
the show.
</P>
<P>
   But UPN still has an active development slate; if nothing else,
Paramount, Spelling Television and Viacom Productions are sister
Viacom companies, and would find it difficult to turn away.
</P>
<P>
   Also, UPN executives are trolling for new, off-the-beaten-path
producers, noting that the five major studios have produced few
hits recently for any network _ even NBC, ABC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   UPN has a development deal with Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson
(independent producers who created ``Homicide: Life on the
Streets'' for NBC), and with the film writers Ted Elliott and Terry
Rossio (``The Mask of Zorro''), among others.
</P>
<P>
   UPN's one modestly successful night _ Wednesday _ may suggest a
path to take, since it draws more male viewers than most network
TV, with ``Seven Days,'' a military spy drama, and ``Star Trek:
Voyager,'' the lost-in-space series. UPN's future may lie in
becoming a fraternal twin to WB _ focusing on male teen-agers and
young men.

   AMERICA ONLINE SAID TO BE IN TALKS TO BUY NETSCAPE
</P>
<P>
   America Online is on the verge of agreeing to acquire Netscape
Communications, the Internet pioneer at the center of the
government's antitrust suit against Microsoft, according to
executives involved in the negotiations. The deal, which may also
involve Sun Microsystems, would most likely value Netscape near its
market capitalization of $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies have been in talks all week and over the
weekend, and a final agreement may not be reached. But people close
to the negotiations say a deal could be announced as early as
Monday. The transaction would end the independence of Netscape but
clearly bolster America Online and Sun.
</P>
<P>
   DEUTSCHE BANK IN EXPANSION MODE
</P>
<P>
   Rolf-Ernst Breuer, the chairman of Deutsche Bank, has spent most
of the last two years trying to repair the damage from the
company's last big attempt at expansion. As he now seeks to acquire
Bankers Trust for about $9 billion, the obvious question is whether
Germany's biggest bank will have any better luck the second time
around.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE ENERGY TO BUY GAS BUSINESSES
</P>
<P>
   Duke Energy said that it would buy the U.S. natural-gas
gathering, processing and marketing business of Union Pacific
Resources for $1.35 billion, making Duke one of the largest
companies gathering and selling natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   SOFTNET SAID TO BE IN ACQUISITION
</P>
<P>
   Softnet Systems, a small company in Mountain View, Calif.,
intends to announce an agreement Monday to acquire Intelligent
Communications, a private concern in Fremont, Calif., for $10.5
million in stock, according to executives close to the companies.
Lawrence Brilliant, the chief executive of Softnet, hopes that the
deal will enable his company to offer small cable operators a
direct satellite link to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   GATES IS ISSUE, ON TAPE OR THE STAND
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft's antitrust trial, the most heated debate is about
the virtual witness _ videotapes of the company's chairman, Bill
Gates. But the real issue surrounding Gates now becomes whether the
virtual witness becomes a real one. Putting Gates on the stand
presents a real risk for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   EXECUTIVES STICKING WITH UPN
</P>
<P>
   Although the average audience has shrunk 40 percent for the
fledgling network UPN and it looks as if the network will lose
nearly $200 million this year on top of $180 million last year, top
executives insist they are committed to the network for the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTING SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT
</P>
<P>
   In the obscure world of computer systems management, the
spotlight has fallen on BMC Software and Boole &AMP; Babbage, which BMC
has agreed to acquire in a stock swap valued at more than $900
million. Analysts have praised the merger, announced earlier this
month, as bringing together two strong players with compatible
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   REPELLENT FOR MILLENNIUM BUG
</P>
<P>
   At last two people have come up with a fast, cheap and easy way
to ward off the Year 2000 bug: ``Y2K Bug Spray.'' The spray bottle,
of course, is a tongue-in-cheek solution that its inventors hope
becomes the holiday gift of choice for overstressed computer
programmers everywhere. The pine-scented liquid comes with a
guarantee _ an ironclad promise that it will still be a solution to
potential catastrophe if used by Jan. 1, 2000. One accountant in
California is already using the gag as an icebreaker at technical
meetings and as a humorous advertising tool.

   &UR; A PEEK UNDER DICAPRIO'S COVERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the introductions for  &UR; S. Clay Wilson &LR; 's new book, ``The
Collected Checkered Demon, Volume I'' (Last Gasp; $19.95) proves
that matinee idol  &UR; Leonardo DiCaprio &LR;  is more than just a pretty
face.
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio writes that he's been a big fan of underground comics
since boyhood, when his father was ``in the Commix trade.'' The
space under DiCaprio's bed was used for storage of comics, the bed
frame itself supported by cases of comic books. ``My fate sealed,
doomed to subliminal exposure to S. Clay Wilson waves, I found
myself immune to the sophomoric antics of Curious George or the coy
alliteration of Cat in the Hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily I outgrew the bed but, sadly, not before I developed
dorsal spines on my penis.''
</P>
<P>
   (In other unmentionable but nonetheless mentioned areas,
Attitude, a gay magazine published in Great Britain and cited by
 &UR; Chris Jehle &LR; , says that the average size of male genitalia in San
Francisco is comparable to that in Amsterdam, Rome and Sydney.
Lyon, France, is where county fair prize-winners are grown.)
</P>
<P>
   (And in still other related areas,  &UR; Paul Freedman &LR;  forwards a
clipping from the rather dry newsletter, CopyEditor, in which
lexicographer  &UR; Thomas Paikeday &LR;  warns that ``Vagina is frequently

NCAA RUNNING CHAMP TOOK THE LONG ROAD BACK TO RECOVERY

<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, after winning the National Collegiate Athletic
Association cross-country title, Carrie Tollefson of Villanova was
diagnosed with a rare tumor in her left heel. She was told by
doctors that she might never run again.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for an operation last February to drain the tumor to
and implant a bone from a cadaver in her foot to fill in the hole,
Tollefson was cautioned by her surgeons. ``They told me, `Just
don't get your hopes up. This is serious,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on Monday, Tollefson will defend her NCAA title in
Lawrence, Kan. In a surprise in 1997, she defeated the defending
champion and six-time NCAA track titlist Amy Skieresz of Arizona by
70 meters in 16 minutes 29 seconds for 5,000 meters. Tollefson, now
a 21-year-old senior, will also play a pivotal role in Villanova's
attempt to win its seventh women's team championship, with its
chief competition expected to come from Brigham Young, which won it
last year, and Stanford, the 1996 champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a good chance to win,'' Tollefson said. ``I'm
not going to use my ordeal as an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Tollefson has undergone two ordeals. When she returned to
training last summer, she pushed too hard, developed tendinitis in
the back of her knee and had to take three weeks off in September.
It appeared that her comeback had failed but Tollefson fought back
to place fourth in the Big East meet on Oct. 30 at Van Cortlandt
Park in the Bronx, her first race in 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrie was training very hard to catch up,'' said first-year
coach Marcus O'Sullivan, an Irish Olympian and Villanova alumnus.
O'Sullivan, who oversees both the Villanova men's and women's
teams, had originally thought he would have to redshirt Tollefson.
``She wanted to defend in November,'' he said. ``In October, it was
time to roll the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lawrence, Tollefson will again face Skieresz, also a senior
and undefeated this season. Other contenders include Amy Yoder of
Arkansas and Julia Stamps of Stanford. The women's course is 6,000
meters (about 3.75 miles), lengthened this year to conform to
international cross-country distances.
</P>
<P>
   The men's favorites in the 10,000-meter race are Adam Goucher of
Colorado and Kenya's Julius Mwangi of Butler. Mwangi defeated
Goucher on the same course on Oct. 10. The team favorites are
Stanford, the defender, eight-time winner Arkansas, and Oregon,
bidding to give its retiring coach Bill Dellinger the Ducks' first
men's crown since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Tollefson, who grew up in Dawson, Minn. (pop. 1,626), has made
coming back her life's work. She was born with an aneurysm in a
lung and almost did not survive infancy. The child grew to become a
star runner, with 108 straight track and cross-country victories,
plus 13 state titles in high school.
</P>
<P>
   She grew to 5 feet 9 inches and became a top-rated point guard
on the high school basketball team. In her spare time, Tollefson
played violin in the school orchestra, trumpet in the band and sang
in the choir.
</P>
<P>
   When the Villanova assistant women's coach, Gina Procaccio, made
a recruiting visit in 1994 to Dawson, a three-hour drive west
through farmland from Minneapolis, she was stunned by Tollefson's
local status. ``She was the town hero,'' Procaccio said.
</P>
<P>
   In her ideal world, Tollefson would run in the morning, play
basketball in the afternoon and sing at night. ``I was a member of
Villanova's gospel choir but could not juggle the rehearsals and
had to give it up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tollefson doesn't give up on much. She came back from hernia
surgery in 1997 to capture the NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the cyst in Tollefson's foot. It was found to be
benign and after the surgery in February, her leg was put in a
boot-cast and she walked with crutches for two months. She embarked
on a cross-training and a rehabilitation program that reached three
hours daily of swimming, bicycling and weight training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a beast,'' Tollefson said of her new-found muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Tollefson needed to rebuild her left leg, which had atrophied.
Her first run after surgery, on May 5, lasted a mere three minutes.
In June, she progressed to 30 miles a week, and by the start of
school in September she was running 50 to 60 miles a week.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to train at full tilt, Tollefson worked so hard that her
leg became inflamed and she had to return to the bike and pool.
``We were getting close to kissing the season goodbye,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With each setback, though, Tollefson gained resolve and an
appreciation of the fundamental joys of training. ``I tell myself
not to be a greedy, obsessed athlete,'' she said. ``I'm so happy
just to be running.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, six months after her break-the-ice three-minute
run, Tollefson won her NCAA district qualifying race at Bethlehem,
Pa. She ran 17:16 for 5,000 meters, leading Villanova to the
women's team title. In the NCAA tuneup, the Wildcats captured six
of the top eight places.
</P>
<P>
   For Tollefson, whatever happens in Lawrence on Monday will be
worth singing about. ``My career has been saved,'' she said.

<P>
   JONQUIERE, Quebec _ Both men left the confines of Quebec for
federal politics years ago. Both served in the Cabinet of Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney. Both later switched parties and both have
come home to fight for the future of Canada's French-speaking
province.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever similarities once existed between them have faded.
Lucien Bouchard, the premier of Quebec, and Jean Charest, the
leader of the province's Liberal Party, are now locked in a
do-or-die election that on Nov. 30 will decide, to a large extent,
whether Quebec's long flirtation with secession will succeed at
last.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard has promised that if his Parti Quebecois is re-elected
he will hold a third referendum on separation, probably by 2001.
The last referendum, in 1995, fell just 50,000 votes short of
authorizing Quebec to negotiate its way out of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Charest says there will be no referendum if he is premier. Many
political analysts say that could take away the separatists' last
opportunity to win, because passion for independence is waning. The
continuing exodus of English speakers is largely offset by the
declining local birth rate, and the large influx of immigrants
tends to vote against secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Quebec hasn't solved this problem'' in the next few years,
said Alain Dubuc, chief editorial writer for La Presse, a Montreal
daily newspaper, ``completely different rules will apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard, 59, is a passionate separatist. He is a sometimes
hotheaded francophone as independent as is Jonquiere, the rugged
area on the fierce Saguenay River that Quebecers proudly consider
their frontier.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place of oversized dimensions _ of huge aluminum
smelters, prodigious paper mills and uncontainable ambition for
Quebec independence _ all reflected in the fiery character of
Bouchard. He is determined to carry Quebec to what he sees as its
destiny as an independent, French-speaking nation in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Charest, 40, is a curly-haired federalist who is as comfortably
bilingual as is Sherbrooke, his home in the Eastern Townships near
the Vermont-New Hampshire border.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place where English- and French-speaking families have
long lived side by side, a place so accommodating that English
street signs include French footnotes, like Rue Wellington,
``General Britannique, 1769-1852.''
</P>
<P>
   Charest was leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party
before being drafted by supporters to take on Bouchard and vanquish
the separatist threat. He has staked his promising political career
on the crusade to keep Quebec in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   If Quebec were to vote for secession, a complicated series of
negotiations would follow to settle such questions as the
province's share of the national debt and compensation for federal
properties. There would also be a bitter fight over what to do with
areas of the province that do not want to leave Canada,
particularly northern lands that are home to Cree Indians who have
voted overwhelmingly against separation.
</P>
<P>
   So far opinion polls have the Liberals and the Parti Quebecois
running just about even, with the separatists recently pulling
slightly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Under Quebec's parliamentary system, Bouchard and Charest run in
their local districts, but as party leader either automatically
becomes premier if his party gains a majority. English-speaking
Quebecers are bunched in Montreal and the Eastern Townships.
</P>
<P>
   If current trends continue, the Liberals will not win the
majority of legislative seats that they need to form the next
government.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marc Leger, president of Leger &AMP; Leger, a Montreal polling
company, said a Charest victory would turn demographics against the
separatists. But he expects Bouchard to win, and he said the margin
of victory would affect the timetable for a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bouchard gets 45, 46 percent of the vote, I'm not sure he
would try a referendum,'' Leger said. ``But if he gets 48, 49
percent, he would hold one for sure. If he gets more than 50
percent, and it's possible, he will have a referendum within six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Charest concedes nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a campaign, period,'' he said. ``We're in a battle,
period. And in the best sense of the word, it's democracy at work,
and we are going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard, bolstered by the polls, has assumed an air of
confidence. ``The only true solution for Quebec,'' he said, ``is
Quebec sovereignty.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The disparate outlooks of these two Quebecers can best be
understood by looking at the places they call home. They came from
opposite ends of Quebec, where history has shaped destiny and
character is formed by memory.
</P>
<P>
   The Saguenay region where Bouchard was reared is in the distant
northern hills. Bouchard, who until he was 46 never saw any other
part of Canada except the next-door province of Ontario, is typical
of many people here for whom Quebec is already a nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an excess of pride in this area, and it's a mixed
blessing,'' said Rejeanne Gilbert of Jonquiere, who was having her
hair styled at the Coiffures Signature salon on Rue St. Dominique,
which is awash with small shops and countless beauty parlors.
``That pride is why we have the kind of politics we have here, and
why there are so many hairdressers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonquiere is an unassuming town of 56,000, with an average
income of $15,300 and 11.7 percent unemployment, higher than the
8.3 percent national average. Like Mrs. Gilbert, most here speak
only French. People are used to good jobs in big companies like
Alcan Aluminum, which receives subsidized electricity from Quebec's
hydroelectric plants.
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Dufour, owner of Coiffures Signature, called the Saguenay
socially and culturally cut off not just from the rest of Canada,
but also the rest of Quebec. ``If you come from the Saguenay,
people in the rest of Quebec think you are from so far away that
you still have feathers on your head,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This is often called the cradle of the separatist movement,
which emerged in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We here have to fight a little harder than those elsewhere to
succeed,'' said Marc Andre Bedard, a minister in the government of
the province's first separatist premier, Rene Levesque. ``Mr.
Bouchard is very much a son of the area, a man of strong roots,
conviction and determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard, who speaks English with a French accent and is married
to an American, is also the leader of a government that has had to
reduce a crushing deficit by cutting education and health services
that Quebecers take for granted. He has closed many hospitals, and
services at the one in Jonquiere were scheduled to be severely cut
back.
</P>
<P>
   But when he returned to Jonquiere earlier this month for his
formal nomination, doctors threatened to resign if the cuts went
through. Bouchard offered them enough money to call off the threat,
but that angered other communities that saw it as favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other embarrassing moments for Bouchard,
including the disclosure of a study showing that government cuts
had caused poor and mentally ill patients to go without medication.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the revelations do not seem to have hurt
Bouchard. He is the most popular and respected politician in
French-speaking Quebec. In 1994 he was hospitalized with a
flesh-eating infection, to which he eventually lost a leg. He came
out of the hospital to lead separatist forces in the 1995
referendum, and when the premier at the time resigned, he took
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bouchard is a man of pride and honor,'' said Mario Arcette,
21, a nurse in Jonquiere. ``And he wants Quebec to be like himself,
proud and honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pride and honor persist in the Eastern Townships as well, but it
is the pride of coexistence and the honor of accepting differences.
The area was settled by Loyalist families who fled the United
States during and after the Revolutionary War. They were encouraged
to live where they could most easily defend Canada from invasion.
Though not without some tensions, English and French have long
lived side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Sherbrooke are fluently bilingual, like Nicole
Girard. ``If you are bilingual you tend not to be as extreme,'' she
said one morning at a local cafe. ``You don't have as much
prejudice, and you can understand the other side a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherbrooke is the biggest city in the Eastern Townships, so
named because they lie east of the St. Lawrence River. It is a city
of 76,700 residents, with an average income of $14,400 and 11
percent unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Separatists do not find much support here. ``They want to be
separatist so nobody makes them do anything,'' said Lina Jacques of
nearby Lennoxville. ``But Quebec is too small to just think, `I'm
going to live in this province and nowhere else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Charest's own family is a model of coexistence, with an Irish
mother and a French-speaking father who was a local businessman and
political leader. The candidate married a local girl and is fluent
in French and English.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live here you believe the two communities can live
together with respect and humanity,'' said Paul Milliard, assistant
director of the local Charest campaign. ``And Jean Charest is proof
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Charest and Bouchard are known to dislike each other, a
disaffection that dates back to their days together in the Mulroney
Cabinet. In his campaign, Charest has accused Bouchard of
recklessly pursuing another referendum even though opinion polls
show that Quebecers overwhelmingly oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard has responded with a politically ambiguous promise to
hold another referendum _ the priority issue in his party's
platform _ only when winning conditions exist. That essentially
allows him to keep the separation option open.
</P>
<P>
   Charest has alienated some Quebecers by ruling out a referendum
entirely, thus surrendering Quebec's leverage with Ottawa. And the
Parti Quebcois continues to portray him as an outsider from Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign's only debate, on Tuesday night, Charest testily
defended his credentials as a local boy. ``A Quebecer from
Sherbrooke is no less a Quebecer than someone from Jonquiere,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of Canada considers this a crucial election, even
the staunchest Quebec separatists concede that some passion has
gone out of the secession movement. That was evident at Nephtys
Tattos on Rue Wellington in Sherbrooke, where Aline Duquette is
manager. On her forearm Ms. Duquette, 35, bears a fleur-de-lis _
the very symbol of Quebec independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few young people take the fleur-de-lis nowadays,'' Ms.
Duquette said. ``They don't like to represent themselves that way
anymore.''

DESPITE INJURIES, RANGERS HAPPY WITH CALIFORNIA ROAD TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The Rangers have completed their three-game
California trip with a 1-1-1 record and a hat trick of injuries.
Before they finish their road swing with games in Buffalo on
Wednesday and in Pittsburgh on Friday, they await the recovery of
three regular players: Ulf Samuelsson, Jeff Beukeboom and Todd
Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson, a rugged defenseman, played only six shifts in
Saturday night's 2-2 tie with the Sharks before leaving the game
with a groin pull. The Rangers said Sunday that Samuelsson will
miss about one week. He tends to be a quick healer, but groin
injuries can sometimes be stubborn.
</P>
<P>
   Beukeboom, another rugged defenseman, has not played since he
was knocked unconscious by Matt Johnson's sucker punch in Thursday
night's 5-1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings. Beukeboom is being
tested to evaluate the mental effects of his concussion. It is
unlikely that Beukeboom will play on Wednesday and the Rangers
expect to summon a replacement from their Hartford farm team on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Johnson goes to the National Hockey League offices
for a disciplinary hearing that is likely to result in a long
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, a feisty right wing, missed Saturday night's game with a
cut left elbow sustained against the Kings. He said the joint was
swollen, stiff and sore, and he did not know when he would be
healthy. The team's medical staff is hoping to avoid an infection.
Harvey said he wants to play on Wednesday at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Considering their injuries, their fatigue from three road games
in four nights and the letdown they felt after giving up a 2-0
lead, the Rangers seemed relatively satisfied with their gritty
effort in the tie with the Sharks. Goalie Dan Cloutier, starting
his second consecutive game, faced 40 shots. Aleksei Kovalev and
Marc Savard scored the goals. Sensing that the Rangers were
weakened by the loss of three of their toughest players, the Sharks
were more aggressive than they might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Graves' nose was bloodied by a elbow. Kevin Stevens' face
was cut by a high stick. Both plays resulted in penalties. Cloutier
was bumped several times, one of them for a penalty in an overtime
that saw both teams with great scoring chances but the Sharks with
a 6-0 edge in shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Successful road trip,'' said Rangers coach John Muckler.
``It's .500. We missed a game in Anaheim we should have won. But we
won one in L.A. and we tied here.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler was in a positive mood, twice calling the tie a ``win''
and stressing that, since opening the season with four consecutive
defeats, the Rangers have lost only four of their last 15 games as
they approach the quarter mark of the season. In that span, they
have 5 victories and 6 ties.
</P>
<P>
   He offered praise for his young goalie, who was both good and
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cloutier was the best player on the ice,'' Muckler said.
</P>
<P>
   Cloutier said ``it was a pretty exciting game to be in'' and
added that he tried not to lose his temper when the Sharks
attempted to rattle him. As for putting Murray Craven in a
headlock, Cloutier said: ``Part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility of playing more in place of the
first-stringer Mike Richter, Cloutier said: ``Our coach has been
around a long time. Whatever decision he makes, I'm going to
respect and go with. Obviously I'm happy by the way I've played the
last two games.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Muckler said: ``Our team battled. That's the main
thing. They battled hard. We never quit. You've got to be happy
about that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It seems to be a characteristic of this rebuilding team in a
transitional season under a veteran coach. Defenseman Mathieu
Schneider said: ``It's a great trip to build momentum off of.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloutier added: ``We're close as a team this year. We want to
win for each other.'' When Samuelsson went down with an injury,
Cloutier said, ``We could easily have sat back.'' Instead,
defenseman Geoff Smith played well in 20 minutes and Jan Mertzig
contributed 15 minutes 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two guys just stood up and took advantage of their ice
time,'' Cloutier said. ``Everybody wants to play here and, when
they get a chance, they do well.''
</P>
<P>
   The most ice time among the Ranger forwards went to John
MacLean, the veteran right wing who leads the team in goals with
seven. Although he had no points in 23:34, MacLean was effective in
every zone and seemed to epitomize the professional integrity the
team has developed. A Devil for most of his career, MacLean played
much of last season with the Sharks before coming to the Rangers as
a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came hard, but we persevered,'' said MacLean, who missed
a practice earlier in the week with back spasms. ``It is a positive
to get a big win the other night and getting a good tie here.
Tiredness is a state of mind. You feed off each other. The guys are
slowly starting to come together. You find that extra `oomph' to
get over the hump and make things happen.''

   The police say the two were attacked in the stairwell of Mrs.
Staravoitova's building by two assailants, one of them a young
woman. The attackers reportedly fled through a back entrance to a
waiting car. Two guns were found at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives say Mrs. Staravoitova, a founder of
Russia's democratic movement, had received death threats, but the
motive for the killing remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice of the target suggests a well-thought out plan,''
said Sergei Kozyrev, vice president of the Russian Association of
Scientific Societies and a Staravoitova supporter. ``To kill a
woman _ a woman in politics _ that has not happened in Russia since
Stalin's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside past feuds, local democratic groups said Sunday
that they would unite in coming elections to the St. Petersburg
city council, combining their forces against what they say are
criminals who have invaded local politics.
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering Sunday night in Moscow, Yegor Gaidar, a former
Russian prime minister and a close ally of Mrs. Staravoitova,
bitterly rejected suggestions that Russia should adopt
extraordinary security measures to stem the rise in political
crime.

CLINTON TO TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA: STAY VIGILANT

   OSAN AIR BASE, South Korea _ In a green aviator jacket and black
cap, President Clinton spent Sunday visiting American troops
stationed in South Korea. He promoted a private, sang birthday
greetings to a sergeant major and described the threats to his
hopes for peaceful engagement with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, signs of danger have intensified,'' Clinton said in an
address to airmen here, standing before a gunmetal gray F-16 and
A-10 parked nose-to-nose. ``So we must remain vigilant. And thanks
to you, we are.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his eagerness to talk about information-age economic
dangers like quicksilver currency flows, Clinton has returned again
and again during his five-day trip to Japan and South Korea to the
old-style regional military threat posed by North Korea. The
subject consumed most of his meetings with President Kim Dae-jung
of South Korea on Saturday and formed the backdrop for his visits
with the troops Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of tense around here,'' said John Kelley, a
26-year-old airman from Wisconsin, describing life on this base.
``You know you're only four minutes away from a missile.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton pointed to recent North Korean missile
tests, incursions into the south and a mysterious underground site
that may be a nuclear weapons installation as signs of the
potential threat. And he compared North Korea to Iraq, saying that
North Korea was ``also a major concern'' because of its chemical
and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Until North Korea ``fully commits itself to a constructive role
on this peninsula,'' he said, ``we must remain ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton restated his support for Kim's policy of engagement with
North Korea, though, saying that there were ``some hopeful signs''
to justify it. He pointed to talks that began over the summer
between the American military command in Korea and the North Korean
military to prevent problems along the demilitarized zone between
the south and north.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to leave South Korea early Monday and return to
Washington Monday night, after paying a visit to Guam.
</P>
<P>
   On a bright but icy afternoon, Clinton was warmly received here
by soldiers in camouflage and black boots, some of whom waited
almost three hours, shifting from foot to foot and rubbing their
hands. The official crowd estimate was only 3,500, but the turnout
seemed even smaller. The base, about 30 miles south of Seoul, is
one of two major American airfields in Korea, housing 7,500 airmen.
Others who wanted to see the president were bused in from sites
that are hours away.
</P>
<P>
   Before flying here by helicopter, Clinton attended church on an
Army base in Seoul, then visited a firing range just 12 miles from
the demilitarized zone. In a brief ceremony there, he promoted Matt
Prickett of West Liberty, Ohio, from private first class to
specialist. And he led the troops in a round of ``Happy Birthday''
for Sgt. Maj. Charles Thomas of Wilson, N.C., who turned 45 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely caught me off guard,'' Thomas said.

AUSTRIA TO RETURN SOME NAZI-SEIZED ART, BUT DISPUTES REMAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Austria, whose Parliament has just given final approval to a law
permitting restitution of hundreds of artworks seized by the Nazis,
expects to return some works to their owners by Christmas. But the
law will not resolve some of the toughest cases involving many of
the most valuable works.
</P>
<P>
   The law covers paintings, furniture and other artifacts held by
the Austrian government, Culture Minister Elisabeth Gehrer said in
an interview in New York on Saturday. After World War II, the
government returned some works confiscated by the Nazis but also
instituted an art export ban, refusing to allow people who had fled
the country to reclaim all of their property.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cases are known, Mrs. Gehrer said, because in
January Austria's 10 state museums were ordered to review the
provenance of works in their collections.
</P>
<P>
   The order followed an uproar over two Egon Schiele paintings
that were lent by an Austrian foundation to the Museum of Modern
Art in New York a year ago and then claimed by two American
families.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Gehrer said the new law did not apply to the Schiele
paintings, nor to cases like that of a Los Angeles resident, a
niece of the renowned collectors Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer,
who has claimed several important paintings by Gustav Klimt.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases have to be dealt with by a court, and I am not a
court,'' said Mrs. Gehrer, who was in New York to check the
progress of a teacher exchange program between Austria and New York
City schools.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gehrer said she expected restitution to involve perhaps 20
families and 400 to 500 items, including furniture, armor, coin
collections and some paintings. Under the law, a seven-member
advisory panel, including the finance and justice ministers, will
review claims and offer advice on specific restitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the advisory commission gives its recommendations, we
have to check the last wills and see if the claimants are indeed
the rightful heirs'' before restitution can take place, she said. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gehrer said each family would decide whether to make its
claim public. Many in the art world expect the first case to
involve the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family, many of whose
works hang or are stored in the Kunsthistoriches Museum and the
National Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the facts are clear on that case,'' said Mrs. Gehrer, who
added that the Austrian public, which in the past has been accused
of foot-dragging on restitution if not ignoring the issue
completely, now was aware of it and supported the new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attach particular importance to the fact that there will be
no discussion of the value of these paintings in our
considerations,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Bloch-Bauer case is being pressed by Maria Altmann of Los
Angeles. She is named as a beneficiary in the will of her uncle,
Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, who owned seven Klimt paintings, including
two famous portraits of Bloch-Bauer's wife, Adele, as well as a
famed porcelain collection and other paintings and property.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis seized or sold Bloch-Bauer's property, and the Klimt
paintings were claimed by the Austrian National Gallery because
Adele Bloch-Bauer, who died in 1923, had asked her husband in her
will to give them to the gallery after his death.
</P>
<P>
   But Bloch-Bauer, who died in exile in 1945, left all of his
property to his heirs, who, led by Mrs. Altmann, say his wife's
1923 will was a request and is not legally enforceable. They have
retained a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My uncle would never have donated anything to Austria after
the way he had been treated,'' Mrs. Altmann said in a recent
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gehrer said: ``That is not a political question. It is a
legal question. The political question was whether the artworks
were held in Austria by anti-export laws, and I made a political
decision on these cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case of a last will is not up to politicians to make the
decision. We have to make a distinction between those cases that
are political problems and those that are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that the museum legally owns the paintings. But
if the court disagrees, it will be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gehrer spoke of the Schiele case in the same vein.
Austrians were incensed when Manhattan District Attorney Robert M.
Morgenthau issued a subpoena preventing the return of the two
paintings to Austria in January, pending a criminal investigation
of their ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art contested the legality of Morgenthau's
move, and in May a state Supreme Court justice agreed. But the
district attorney's office appealed. The paintings continue to sit
in MOMA's storage rooms. An appellate court ruling is expected
within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for one of the claimants want to meet with the Austrian
government and possibly resolve the matter. On Saturday Mrs. Gehrer
said: ``There's nothing to discuss. It is not customary in Austria
to negotiate. According to our legal practices, the case has to be
clarified by the courts, not resolved by negotiations and deals.''

CLINTON MEETS US TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA, URGES NORTH KOREA TO
MAINTAIN NUCLEAR FREEZE

SEOUL, South Korea _ Calling on American troops to remain vigilant,
President Clinton accused North Korea Sunday of a series of
provocative moves that represent ``signs of danger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me reaffirm the view of the United States: North Korea
must maintain its freeze on and move ahead to dismantle its nuclear
weapons program, as it has agreed to do,'' Clinton told about 1,000
troops at Osan Air Base, located about 50 miles from the
demilitarized zone (DMZ) dividing North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must halt its efforts to develop and proliferate chemical
and biological weapons and ballistic missiles,'' Clinton told
military personnel and their families gathered in a hangar for U2
spy planes.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to a training center and an air base, Clinton greeted
some of the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. Earlier in
Seoul, he reaffirmed America's commitment to South Korea's security
during a meeting with President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told members of the 51st Fighter Wing, which includes
A-10 and F-16 fighter jets, that Kim's policy of diplomatic
engagement with North Korea has yielded results. He pointed to the
resumption of peace talks between the north and south and talks
between U.S. and North Korean military officials to prevent
problems along the DMZ.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, unfortunately, not all has gone well. Lately, signs of
danger have intensified,'' Clinton said, citing Pyongyang's
construction of an underground facility suspected of being a
nuclear-related facility, incursions into South Korean waters by
North Korean spy submarines and the testing of a missile over
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we must remain vigilant. And, thanks to you, we are,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea agreed in 1994 to freeze the development of its
nuclear weapons program but last week refused to allow the United
States to inspect an underground bunker suspected of being a
nuclear facility. The United States has demanded access.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent a pre-Thanksgiving lunch with U.S. and South
Korean troops stationed at the Korean Training Center about 12
miles from the DMZ. Troops there conduct live-fire exercises as
part of their training.
</P>
<P>
   The president walked around the center shaking hands and posing
for pictures. He participated in a promotion ceremony for Matt E.
Prickett, from Ohio, who rose in rank from a private first class to
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also led the troops in singing Happy Birthday to Sgt.
Major Charles Thomas, a North Carolina native who turned 45. ``I
really appreciated him doing it. It definitely caught me off
guard,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joined the troops in the mess tent for a lunch of Meals
Ready to Eat (MRE), the military rations. Clinton's MRE was a
grilled chicken breast patty with the consistency of Vienna
sausage.
</P>
<P>
   The president then flew by helicopter to the Osan Air Base, one
of two U.S. operated air bases in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to press North Korea to take these steps for
peace and security,'' Clinton said. ``But until it fully commits
itself to a constructive role on this peninsula, we must remain
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wraps up a five-day trip to Asia with a stop in Guam
today (Mon) before returning to Washington. On Saturday night,
Clinton capped a state dinner hosted by President Kim with a visit
to the Sejong Cultural Center where his brother, Roger, was
appearing in a variety show for popular singers.
</P>
<P>
   The president heard his brother sing On Shaky Ground and gave
him a bear hug when introduced during a break.

WHITE HOUSE MAY BE WILLING TO COMPROMISE ON CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Texas)  (See also IMPEACH-HYDE) 
(lb) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House moving quickly toward a series of
critical decisions on whether to impeach President Clinton, the
White House signaled on Sunday that it was open to any ``serious
and reasonable'' compromise that would allow the president to put
the year-long scandal behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Gregory Craig, a White House special counsel,
were similar to past statements opening the door to some kind of
censure or rebuke short of removing Clinton from office. But the
remarks took on added significance, because the appearance of
Kenneth Starr before the House Judiciary Committee last week
cleared the way for the House to move toward the conclusion of its
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has said _ and I want to repeat _ that we are in
favor of any serious and reasonable proposition that has the
promise of bringing this to a prompt and just conclusion,'' Craig
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig did not elaborate. And he also stuck uncompromisingly to
the White House contention _ widely derided by Republicans and
Democrats alike _ that Clinton never lied under oath about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In his own appearance on NBC, Robert Livingston, the incoming
speaker, did not close the door to a censure vote, saying such a
proposal could originate through the House Judiciary Committee and
the House Rules Committee. But the Louisiana Republican appeared to
indicate that such a course was not his first preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the House should decide to proceed with articles of
impeachment, which means all they do is to charge the president,
then the plea bargain in my mind seems to me more appropriately a
question for the Senate rather than for the House,'' Livingston
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up discussions of Clinton's fate came as the
ideologically polarized House Judiciary Committee is almost certain
to vote along party lines to approve at least one article of
impeachment against the president for perjury. That vote, according
to Capitol Hill Republicans, is now expected in the week of Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains questionable whether impeachment would be
approved by the full House in the face of the midterm election
results, in which the House Republican majority was clipped to six
seats, and overwhelming public opinion against removing Clinton
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Six Republicans thus far have said definitively that they will
oppose impeachment. Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., has said he
thinks that number could grow to 20 _ which would be enough votes
to defeat impeachment on the House floor. Senior Democratic
staffers say only a handful of House Democrats will vote for the
president to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   With even Democrats still wanting the president to face some
punishment for his affair with a White House intern and misleading
testimony about it, Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., on Sunday appealed
for Livingston to negotiate a compromise on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he said on ABC's ``This Week,'' ``Republicans will
have no one to blame but themselves if the president gets off
without anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, who has just been elevated to the
third-ranking position in the House Democratic leadership, said
this weekend that any censure agreement would likely require the
president to come to the well of the House and make a public
statement.``Clearly something should be done,'' he said on Fox
News. ``Most Democrats recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also acknowledge that censure needs to be a
bipartisan option with at least some significant Republican
support. And it is far from clear whether a coalition can be formed
around such a compromise. Some of the Republicans who oppose
impeachment have also expressed doubts about censure, saying it is
not a constitutional procedure and could set a dangerous precedent
for subjecting future presidents to the whims of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some moderate Democrats have been quietly sounding out fellow
Republicans, and White House officials have begun trying to gauge
the mood of a handful of moderate Republicans. The White House is
also looking to open some communication with Livingston, perhaps
early this week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Livingston so far has been scrupulous about letting Rep. Henry
Hyde, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, take the lead in
impeachment proceedings. Every time his predecessor as speaker,
Rep. Newt Gingrich, became involved in the process, he was accused
by Democrats of politicizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said Sunday that if the Judiciary Committee sends
articles of impeachment to the House in the next few weeks, he will
ask Gingrich, who remains speaker until the 106th Congress convenes
in January, to call the current Congress back into special session.
Gingrich's aides have said he will defer to Livingston on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't imagine that it would take a lot of debate,''
Livingston said of a vote on articles of impeachment, suggesting
that two to three hours would suffice. ``Vote on the issue up or
down and be done with it.'' He added, ``If we did not have the
votes to sustain the charge, that would be it.''
</P>
<P>
   He left the door open to an alternative to impeachment, such as
censure, if impeachment did not pass, saying that would be a matter
for the Judiciary and Rules committees in conjunction with the
current House leadership. ``I would think that that would certainly
be a possibility,'' he said, ``but I wouldn't prejudge that at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, once a prosecutor himself, noted that perjury is a
felony. ``If it is shown that the president of the United States is
guilty of perjury, we have a major problem,'' he said. ``What to do
about it is a political problem and should be weighed again by each
member when it's presented to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig on Sunday asked House members to consider, in the face of
strong public opinion against removing the president from office,
``Do you push the automatic impeachment button, or do you exercise
some discretion and use your judgment as to what should be done?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not spell out what alternative Clinton would accept or
whether the president would seek guarantees that he would not be
prosecuted for perjury after leaving office. Jim Kennedy, a White
House spokesman, said in a telephone interview after Craig's
appearance that ``the details of any solution are not for us to
dictate or decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig also said on Sunday that the president would respond this
week to 81 questions sent him by Hyde on November 5 asking him to
admit or deny findings gleaned from the independent counsel's
445-page report, which cited evidence of 11 possibly impeachable
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is planning to continue its
investigation on Monday by taking a closed-door deposition from
Daniel Gecker, a lawyer for Kathleen Willey. Ms. Willey, a former
White House volunteer, has said Clinton made a sexual advance
toward her outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans say they hope Gecker and several other
witnesses will shed light on whether the president or his allies
sought to influence her testimony.

him a little. ``But I'll stop when I think about why he does it,''
Ms. Wilson said. He is not messy, she said. He is just a man who
knows what the inside of a box looks like, when it closes shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like closing up nothing,'' said Williams, who served
30 years in Angola Prison for a killing he played no part in,
except to stand outside a filling station as an argument between
two acquaintances and the station owner escalated into a gun battle
that the courts called second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge, taking into consideration a 1997 state court
ruling in which a judge found that prosecutors withheld evidence
from the 1967 case that could have proved Williams' innocence,
freed him 18 months ago. Williams, who has a prison tattoo of a
cross on his right forearm, went straight to Rampart Street and lit
a candle at the shrine of St. Jude, the saint of lost causes. He
prayed, and wondered why, in the grip of such joy, he was so
afraid.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, as he thought about going for a walk, as his
fingers touched the doorknob, he knew.
</P>
<P>
   He knew, Williams said, that being turned loose and actually
living free, free in his own mind, were not the same. He walked
into prison at 19. Now he is almost 50, living in a world he does
not remember, constantly afraid some minor blunder, some innocent
mistake, will make people laugh at him, and even more afraid that a
trivial brush with the law, some bad luck, will steal his freedom
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside, I used to pray,'' Williams said. ``I wanted freedom. I
didn't care if I lived face-down in a sewage ditch, if I was a bum
on a railroad track. Lord, let me be on a corner, begging for food.
But let me be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first morning, you go to the door, your hand hits the
knob, and you say, `I can do this.' And you open it, a crack, but
you don't go out. You peek. Because you don't know how to act. So
you just stand there, looking out. I'll go out, you say to
yourself, eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   It is freedom, but 18 months later it still feels brittle and
paper thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're afraid someone will say, `Look at that fool,' '' he
said, if he is seen reaching for the handle of an automatic door
that has already opened, or seen walking for blocks along Canal
Street with a wadded-up sandwich wrapper in his hand, because he
did not not recognize the new garbage cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to me,'' he said, ``not to look like a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the prison, he had become a hero. A trim, thoughtful man,
his name is now synonymous with prison reform in Louisiana. The son
of a middle-class family who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder
to spare his family the embarrassment of a trial, Williams and four
other state prisoners filed landmark lawsuits in the 1970s that
forced an overhaul of the prison that the federal courts called the
most brutal and corrupt in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rape, stabbings, sickness, bodies stuffed under barracks, pieces
of rat in biscuits all swirl in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the worst moment of your life, and then think of
living that moment every minute, every hour, every day, of every
year, and that's Angola,'' said Williams, who carried a rolled-up
magazine with a six-inch blade inside to survive the first day. As
the reforms he helped force took hold, he only got older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to sleep and I dream about Angola,'' he said, sitting in
that house with the open doors, where a man can stand inside the
front door and throw a baseball all the way through it. ``I guess
I'll dream about it till the day I die.''
</P>
<P>
   But like any dream, of falling off a cliff or stepping on a
snake, he wakes to a reality, to a house where doors lock from the
inside. And freedom, he has learned, is just another dream he has
awakened from.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always feel,'' he said, ``like you're not living up to the
expectations of the free people.''
</P>
<P>
   He walks through it so, so softly, determined to do everything
right. In 18 months, his only offense has been a parking ticket. He
has a good job, on an oil rig out in the Gulf of Mexico. He has Ms.
Williams, and friends, and some family. It will take time, his
friends believe, for him to feel at home again, for that anxiety to
fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hellish transition, when you're trying to show you
can belong,'' said John Lewis, the assistant deputy director of
Project Return, a program at Tulane University to help former
inmates make the transition to the free world. ``You're lost,
completely lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis knows. He served 20 years at Angola on a narcotics
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that everything is so new,'' Ms. Wilson said of
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods that once rang with rhythm and blues now throb
with rap, and whole streets, whole sounds and sights and
sensations, just seem wrong: crack dealers working the sidewalks of
neighborhoods where he used to go to fish fries; houses, the ones
in his old neighborhoods that people worked a lifetime to buy, in
ruins; his father and mother dead, long before his freedom;
interstate highways, which he is still afraid to navigate,
crisscross the city on elevated lanes, their giant concrete columns
reaching up from where neighborhoods had stood. Some days, New
Orleans is like the dark side of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who ever heard of a carjacking?'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in the 9th and 7th wards, the Catholic-school son of
respected parents. Until that night in 1967, he had never been in
trouble; no one in his family had.
</P>
<P>
   According to trial records, he was standing outside the gas
station when Larry Hudson and John Duplessis, men he had been out
drinking with, argued inside with the station owner, Oscar Meeks,
over the price of fixing a flat tire. Duplessis and Meeks pulled
pistols and fired at each other, according to trial testimony.
Meeks was mortally wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said there was no robbery, but all three men, on the
word of one witness, who later changed his story, were charged with
robbery and murder. The three are black. Meeks was white.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer, who was later disbarred for alcoholism, told Williams
he could be free in 10 years and 6 months if he pleaded guilty, and
he warned him that if he did not, he could get the electric chair,
said Williams' new lawyer, A.F. Armond, who handled the case for
free.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he had heard that the electric chair ``made the
blood in your body boil,'' but he still refused to plead guilty
until his family, embarrassed by news accounts and afraid he would
get the chair, begged him to put a stop to the publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams' 10-year sentence stretched into life under his
sentencing guidelines. The two other men were given the death
penalty, but as it turned out, both were released from prison long
before Williams was. A state judge ruled that witnesses had lied
and prosecutors had withheld other evidence in the case. Duplessis,
the shooter, was pardoned in 1988. Hudson's conviction was
overturned in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Williams rode to Angola in chains on March 27, 1968, sitting on
the floor of what seemed to be a converted ice cream truck.
</P>
<P>
   As the new inmates lined up, a guard with tobacco juice running
down his chin started using a racial epithet as he ordered one
black inmate to tell another ``to run and look on the dash of my
truck and bring me my tobacco knife,'' said Williams, who, as one
of the lighter-skinned blacks in the New Orleans social strata, had
seldom heard the epithet in his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `Lord have mercy, Jesus. Where am I at now?'
''
</P>
<P>
   An inmate who had befriended him in the parish jail in New
Orleans, Arthur Mitchell, handed him a magazine with a sharp blade
inside. The other inmates noticed how the magazine seemed not to
bend the way a magazine should, and left him alone in those crucial
first days, when new inmates either fought for their lives, or
became someone's ``gal boy,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   An escape attempt, one year later, taught him the true brutality
of Angola. He was thrown into what some called the dungeon, a tiny
cell supposedly for one man but sometimes packed with so many
prisoners there was room only to stand, with just a hole in the
floor for a toilet and bread and water to eat. It was pitch-black,
and at night the rats and roaches swarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Marked as a troublemaker, Williams felt sure he would become one
of the inmates who just disappeared or were beaten or stabbed to
death. He felt he had nothing to lose when he began collecting
information about the abuses at Angola, information that would
become fodder in a series of successful lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, U.S. District Court Judge E. Gordon West ruled that
conditions at Angola ``shock the conscience,'' and he placed the
prison under federal control.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Williams was rejected again and again by the parole
board, still under state control, even as his lawyers piled up
evidence that he had had no direct involvement in the killing and
even after his co-defendants had been released.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two years ago, lawyers won a new trial for Williams,
and the district attorney's office in New Orleans decided not to
prosecute him anew. A judge then dismissed the murder charge. It
took another few months for a federal judge to order him released,
for time served, on charges relating to one of two escape efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He walked out in May 1997, to see a daughter, who had been 6
months old when he was locked away, and a niece, and a few other
people who had not forgotten him.
</P>
<P>
   When he was freed, The Angolite, the respected prison
publication at Angola, wrote this: ``Williams, during his
confinement, earned a place in penal history by becoming the
catalyst that turned Angola from a slaughterhouse into the safest
maximum-security prison in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams walked from the federal courthouse in New Orleans
a free man, he paused and closed his eyes. ``I didn't want them to
see the fear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It did not matter that it was unreasonable, that he would not
take a walk because he was afraid some woman would point him out at
random and yell ``rape.'' The fear was real. As a sort of shield,
he held his niece's infant in his arms when he went on walks. No
one could accuse him of a crime, he reasoned, with a baby in his
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he walked alone, then walked farther, then got a car
and drove tentatively around neighborhoods half-remembered. He
attended group therapy sessions in the Project Return program at
Tulane. He inched back into freedom, inched away from fear.
</P>
<P>
   He was terrified of women, of intimacy, he said. It had, after
all, been 30 years. He needed work, real work, to build a life.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, through a friend, he met Ms. Wilson, who
understands the bad days. He got the job on the oil rig, hard, real
work. Most people work 14 days on and 7 off, because it is
confining and lonely at the same time, men marooned by all that
blue water. Williams has worked as long as eight weeks in a row. He
is an expert at confinement. But before he goes to his cramped
bunk, he sits on the deck at night, black sky melting into black
water, 300 miles out in the Gulf. ``And all I can see are twinkling
lights of another rig, in the distance,'' he said. He thinks about
what was lost, and tries, as he tries every day, to keep his
bitterness buried deep inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my freedom,'' he said, but of being truly free, ``I
pray to God that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even free people, he knows, are prisoners of their own anxiety.
But they, he said with a smile, are not usually terrified of a
department store. ``I hate,'' he said, ``those revolving doors.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In most industries, if a company's sales dropped 40 percent from
one year to the next, not only would the chief executive be
dismissed, but the company might very well go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily so in broadcast television today.
</P>
<P>
   For evidence, consider UPN. The network's average audience has
shrunk 40 percent this fall from last fall. One new show,
``Reunited,'' has twice scored one of the lowest Nielsen ratings in
history, an 0.9 (about 895,000 homes, of the 84 million UPN can
reach). To make up for the low ratings, UPN has had to give most
advertisers two commercials for every one purchased. And it looks
as if the network will lose close to $200 million this year, after
losing about $180 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, UPN's owners sound almost cheery. Top executives at
Viacom and Chris-Craft, whose respective subsidiaries, Paramount
Television and Broadcast Holdings Corp., jointly own UPN, insist
that they are committed to the network for the long haul and that
they are braced for substantial losses until it improves. They also
expressed faith in Dean Valentine, UPN's third chief executive in
its almost four years of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what would be called failure by most measures of
business success, the one thing UPN says it will not do is go out
of the network business. ``There is no such scenario possible,
unless the stations they own get shut down,'' said a UPN executive,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   How can that be? In today's vertically integrated entertainment
world, giant parent companies own networks, production studios _
and the shows produced _ and local stations, but the stations are
among the most dependable profit makers. And to be competitive,
stations need a national network's high-profile programs in prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   Some stations are stuck with UPN, because they are ``family'':
Viacom's Paramount Television owns 19 television stations and
Chris-Craft owns eight.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly 200 others chose to sign on with UPN, which went on
the air in January 1995, with two nights of programming a week and
a promise to grow. Most affiliates were small, low-profile
independent stations that had been buying and scheduling programs
on their own _ syndicated shows, old movies and the games of local
sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   As networks grew _ Time Warner's WB network started the same
year as UPN, both added a third night the next year, and now offer
five nights a week _ the business changed. Prime-time syndication
producers have narrowed their aim, making mostly male-oriented
action-adventure dramas, which stations buy for weekend use or to
fill programming gaps. Most local sports teams have gone to cable
networks. Cable networks compete with stations to buy movie
packages, too.
</P>
<P>
   These days, stations would be hard pressed to survive
financially by cobbling together their own lineups, as was once the
norm. They need a network's brand name, its programs and its
national promotional and advertising power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the UPN stations are getting lower ratings, and thus lower
ad revenue, in many cases than they got before affiliating with UPN
_ and they must give two-thirds of their prime-time commercial
minutes to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, they are upset. A 40 percent drop in viewers
diminishes the audience for their 10 p.m. news programs, and hurts
whatever syndicated shows they have bought to run later in the
evening. It means promotional spots for the stations' other shows
are seen by fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   But there is precious little they can do. The only recourse
would be to drop UPN when their affiliation contracts expire, in
most cases several years from now, and join another network.
</P>
<P>
   WB is the only broadcast network to show growth this year. It
forged success with a heavily marketed appeal to teen-agers and
young women, the primary audience attracted by its first two big
hits, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Seventh Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, what UPN needs desperately _ some hit shows.
And there looms another worry: Like UPN's stations, the major
Hollywood production studios are also grumbling about those paltry
Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It costs studios hundreds of thousands of dollars each episode,
and often more, to produce shows. They recoup some of that in the
license fee paid by the network, but they share no advertising
earnings. To make money, they depend on a show succeeding and
accumulating enough episodes to sell into syndication or to cable
networks.
</P>
<P>
   That does not happen if people do not watch, and this fall, few
people have been watching UPN.
</P>
<P>
   One or two major studios have begun thinking twice about
development deals with UPN for now, according to some show
producers and some studio executives, none of whom would speak for
the record. Others have asked for a contractual clause stipulating
that if UPN goes out of business in less than four years _ the
typical time needed to accumulate enough episodes for syndication _
UPN would reimburse the supplier for deficits incurred in producing
the show.
</P>
<P>
   But UPN still has an active development slate; if nothing else,
Paramount, Spelling Television and Viacom Productions are sister
Viacom companies, and would find it difficult to turn away.
</P>
<P>
   Also, UPN executives are trolling for new, off-the-beaten-path
producers, noting that the five major studios have produced few
hits recently for any network _ even NBC, ABC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   UPN has a development deal with Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson
(independent producers who created ``Homicide: Life on the
Streets'' for NBC), and with the film writers Ted Elliott and Terry
Rossio (``The Mask of Zorro''), among others.
</P>
<P>
   UPN's one modestly successful night _ Wednesday _ may suggest a
path to take, since it draws more male viewers than most network
TV, with ``Seven Days,'' a military spy drama, and ``Star Trek:
Voyager,'' the lost-in-space series. UPN's future may lie in
becoming a fraternal twin to WB _ focusing on male teen-agers and
young men.

closed doors. In the long, narrow house on Lopez Street every

the pharmacy and find the house this way, and she thinks about

ANALYSIS: LIVE TESTIMONY BY GATES WOULD POSE RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the case is about digital technology, it seems apt that
the most heated debate in the Microsoft trial is about the virtual
witness _ Bill Gates on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The Billathon continued last week with the government using more
taped excerpts of its deposition of Gates, the chairman and
co-founder of Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   By now, with repetition, the Gates tapes have lost much of their
punch to shock or amuse. The subject may vary, but each excerpted
section is much the same. Hunched forward, staring down, like a
student being punished in the principal's office, Gates comes off
as forgetful, evasive and endlessly quibbling over the meaning of
the simplest business terms like ``market share.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke making the rounds in the industry is that it was the
word ``share'' that Gates found confusing.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue surrounding Gates now becomes whether the
virtual witness becomes a real one. Putting Gates on the stand
presents a real risk for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   A convincing, disciplined performance by Gates _ who, according
to opinion polls, remains an entrepreneurial hero to most Americans
_ could bolster Microsoft's defense, legal experts say. Yet
Microsoft's defense could be undermined if Gates proved a volatile
witness, arrogant and unresponsive, coming off as a man with
something to hide, legal experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   He is not on the 12-person witness list of either Microsoft or
the government, but either side could call him. Each side is
permitted to call two rebuttal witnesses. And Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, who limited the witness lists in the interest of speeding
the trial along, has indicated that his ground rules are flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Gates would be welcome on the stand in the U.S. District
Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But if he is to be a witness, it seems, it will have to be
Microsoft that calls him. The government is certainly inviting the
Microsoft legal team to take that risk.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks during the daily news conferences on the
courthouse steps last week, David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for
the Justice Department, was just short of taunting. Asked whether
he would call the Microsoft chairman as a witness, Boies said
dryly, ``We have a deposition that we're very comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates appears to be irritated at the reaction to his deposition
tapes. At the Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas, he told The
Associated Press that the prosecutors' use of the tapes was ``more
about government PR than the substance of the case,'' and he
accused Boies of trying ``to put words in my mouth'' during the
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Boies replied that Gates ``seems to be indicating
more and more that he wants to come.'' Strongly suggesting that the
Gates tapes are hurting Microsoft and that the company is losing
the case, Boies added: ``It wouldn't be unusual to change the game
plan if the present game plan isn't working. Maybe that's what
you're seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that all this is ``spin'' and that Gates'
deposition performance was a triumph of stonewalling. ``The
substance of his deposition testimony has not helped the
government's case,'' said Charles Rule, a former senior official in
the Justice Department's antitrust division who is an adviser to
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The legal advice Gates received going into his deposition was
clearly to give his adversaries little or nothing to work with. He
may have done that to a fault, because he appears to be almost
lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Gates tapes _ whether a legal one or not _
is that Gates does not come across as Bill Gates, brilliant,
passionate about the technology he has championed and thoroughly in
command of Microsoft. And that would seem to raise a credibility
issue in the case.
</P>
<P>
   That view of the Gates tapes, Microsoft says, is uninformed, the
reflex impression of people unschooled in the intricacies of the
legal process. Depositions involve a lot of jousting over words and
nit-picking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the Microsoft trial moving into its sixth week, six
government witnesses have been cross-examined by Microsoft's
lawyers. There has been plenty of pausing and parsing of words, but
none of the witnesses has displayed the kind of white-knuckle
resistance that Gates has demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, at a meeting in Jackson's chambers, John Warden,
a Microsoft lawyer, protested the repeated showing of excerpts of
the Gates tapes mainly ``for the purpose of creating news stories
day after day after day,'' according to a transcript of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The judge disagreed. ``If anything,'' he said, ``the trouble is
with your witness.'' Later, he added, ``I think it's evident that
for whatever reasons, in many respects Gates has not been
particularly responsive to his deposition interrogation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as much as the Justice Department lawyers seem to be
inviting Gates to show up, his appearance would be a risk for the
government. There has been a difference of opinion between Boies
and Stephen Houck, the lead trial lawyer for the 20 states that are
suing Microsoft with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Houck has suggested that the government call Gates, but Boies,
colleagues say, has said that is a risk for Microsoft to take.
``You don't call someone who is brilliant and totally committed to
beating you,'' Boies was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's nightmare,'' said William Kovacic, a visiting
professor at the George Washington University Law School, ``is that
he comes on like Bill Gates, a guy with a deep conviction that what
he is doing is right.'' What Gates did not do in his deposition,
Kovacic said, was play the time-honored game of politicians, which
is to ``sidestep the question and present your vision of the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has given the other witnesses plenty of leeway for
lengthy yes-but answers. ``The judge would have to let Gates give
speeches, because he has let everyone else do it,'' Kovacic said.
``If he didn't, Microsoft would clearly have a bullet to use on
appeal, unmasking the judge's bias.''
</P>
<P>
   Other antitrust experts, however, advise Microsoft to stay with
its nine lower-level Microsoft witnesses and leave Gates out of the
trial. ``I think it would be a mistake, especially with a litigator
and cross-examiner as skilled as David Boies,'' said Stephen Axinn,
a partner of Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider. ``If Microsoft calls
Gates, they're crazy.''

 &HT;    No arrests made among 7,000 protesters at Army school
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Virginia Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ga. _ Actor Martin Sheen led 2,319 protesters onto Ft.
Benning on Sunday to protest the Army's School of the Americas, and
the Army responded by taking them on a ride in military buses to a
nearby park and letting the protesters go free without arrest.
</P>
<P>
   And while both sides seemed happy with the outcome of the
protest, which drew nearly 7,000 from across the country, their
reponses afterward showed why the ongoing protest should perhaps be
named: ``The Protesters are from Venus, the Army is from Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters, which have grown from a dozen or so since 1991,
insist that the school teaches torture tactics of Latin American
indigenous poor and question why the U.S. Army is involved in
internal affairs of Latin countries. School officials insist it has
taught professional military skills and ethics to Latin armies and
claims to have helped bring democracy to a volatile region once
dominated by dictators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not willing to concede their point,'' Ft. Benning
Commanding General Cart Ernst said of the protesters in a press
briefing Sunday afternoon in an auditorium at the School of the
Americas. ``We would go through this each year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense it was a victory, and if it's not, we will simply
be back in greater numbers,'' said the Rev. Roy Bourgeois, the
organizer of nine protests at the Army base which houses the
training school for Latin soldiers at its base of 22,500 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sheen, dressed in a sports jacket, checked shirt,
trousers, baseball tie, loafers and white socks, led a mock funeral
procession to remember the six Jesuits priests, their housekeeper
and her 15-year-old daughter killed on Nov. 16, 1989, the
protesters rallied and sang for nearly two hours outside the main
gate. At least 30 military police and 30 city of Columbus police
kept close watch, and an officer read the federal law that bans
political protests on military installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here in nonviolence, to win my own freedom, to do what
is asked by a loving God,'' Sheen said in an interview in
Bourgeois' tiny apartment near the military base as thousands sang
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen also spoke at the pre-protest rally, urging the crowd ``to
embody the powerful reminder'' of John F. Kennedy that ``basic
human rights are not given by the hand of any state but flow
abundantly from the hand of a loving creator.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sheen approached a row of military police, a tall, muscular
man towered over him and read him the law. Sheen dropped to his
knees and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about if we just say an `Our Father' for all those who
have suffered in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala,''
Sheen said.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his prayer just as military police led him to a bus
where protesters were being detained. As he entered, he yelled,
``Amen!''
</P>
<P>
   The Army, which had tried to hold a public forum Saturday on the
SOA and had one person show up, briefed the news media after the
first round of buses rumbled off to Rigdon Park, about a mile from
the base.
</P>
<P>
   While their close shaves and starched uniforms sported by the
military sharply contrasted with the attire of the blue-jeaned
protesters, the sincerity in what they believe was as evident as
the sincerity of the protesters. Ernst said he thought the
protesters ``honestly believe in the righteousness of their
cause,'' yet he and School of the Americas Commandant Glenn Weidner
made it clear they believe in their work and believe that the
School of the Americas has helped Latin armies learn democracy.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they feel offended personally and for the Army's
30,000 troops who each day are deployed in countries around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have soldiers leaving for Honduras only days before
Thanksgiving, and they won't be home for Christmas,'' Ernst said of
Army troops going to Honduras to help in the aftermath of Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst, dressed in camouflage clothing and boots, said he hopes
the base's decision not to arrest the protesters Sunday moves the
dialogue about the need for the School elsewhere, perhaps to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the School of the Americas were to close, we'd have to
establish some kind of institution like it in some place. There are
fledgline democracies (in Latin America), and we believe it's
better to be engaged in them than to leave them alone.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that no dictatorships, save Cuba, remain in Latin
America after years of bloody and bitter warfare.

 &HT;    Falcons feel the thin line
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It should have been another in a series of festive
moments: Winning despite Post-Niner Syndome, winning after trailing
by 10 points. But the Falcons who trooped to their locker room
offered no whoops and few smiles. They'd been chastened. They'd
seen yet again how skinny the line between excellence and
mediocrity is, that line being the state of Chris Chandler's
health.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons caught this latest glimpse of mortality on a flukey
non-play. With seven minutes left, center Robbie Tobeck was trying
to change the line's blocking call. ``There was a hard count, and I
was talking in the middle of it,'' he said. Tobeck squeezed the
ball. Mike Wells, a Chicago tackle, lurched into the backfield.
With whistles blowing and flags cascading, Wells grabbed Chandler
and, to quote Dan Reeves, ``bent him back over.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wells: ``He kind of got his knee caught up underneath him.
It snapped or something. I was kind of trying to hold him up, and
he got pushed back. I heard him yell 'Oh!' and the like. . . . I
heard something crackle and pop in his knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobeck was penalized five yards for a false start. For long
moments, it seemed his team might be penalized its remaining five
games. Chandler limped off, cursing the fates. ``I felt a sharp
burning pain along that inside ligament,'' he would say later.
``That's the first time I'd ever felt that. It scared me.''
</P>
<P>
   It scared a lot of folks. Just like that, a shimmering season
went all cloudy. From the Dirty Bird to the Dread DeBerg?
</P>
<P>
   Not just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Steve DeBerg finished this game, but the 44-year-old won't
be required to start the next five. (The next one, maybe.)
Chandler's right knee is OK. X-rays found no unattached ligaments.
He has no reconstructive surgery scheduled, not even an MRI; just a
week of heavy therapy on what he called ``a high ankle sprain.''
</P>
<P>
   His ankle, Chandler reported, ``is kind of throbbing right
now.'' But he wore no brace or bandage, and he walked, albeit
stiffly, without crutches. Will he play next Sunday? ``I would
guess I would.'' In sum, whew.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end O.J. Santiago said: ``When Chris went down, I said to
the guys, 'Now we're going to see what we're made of.''' And for
six minutes against Chicago, the Falcons' will was enough. It would
not suffice over a five-week span. As Jamal Anderson said,
``Whoever plays quarterback has to step up and make plays.'' Among
current Falcon quarterbacks, only Chandler can.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret. Santiago again:''The other team's not going to
come out and and say it, but any time we play they'd like to see
Chris go out.'' The Bears had blitzed like crazy, sacking Chandler
four times, and the Falcons were convinced Wells' takedown was
cheap. (Wells himself said he meant no harm and hoped Chandler was
all right.) For all Reeves' fundamentals, this remains a team built
on a one-man foundation.
</P>
<P>
   As dusk fell Sunday, that man was sore but intact. Which came as
a relief to every Falcon, the center chief among them. How is it to
turn around and see your quarterback clutching his knee after such
a silly play? ``You feel like a heel,'' Tobeck said. ``You feel
like a fool.''

 &HT;    Falcons conquer the kind of game you lose
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was the kind of game you lose. You're on a high,
still saddled and riding the euphoria of winning ``the biggest game
in Falcons' history,'' a designation of questionable character in
itself. If Don King had been in town, I'd have suspected old
Electric Hair. Still, beating the San Francisco 49ers in a bout
about the division lead is something to gloat over.
</P>
<P>
   The air was crackling with confidence that bordered on
arrogance. The radio filled my car with Super Bowl talk, home-field
advantage, of a bye in the first round and a lot of ``Dirty Bird''
stuff. The sports intelligentsia shared gushing enthusiasm with an
eager audience. Dan Reeves would have blanched. These Falcons will
still have to win three more games to match the franchise's best
record of 1980, year of Leeman Bennett, and here were these guys
talking Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, Chicago Bears was a name that threw the fear
of God into any team. ``Monsters of the Midway'' they were called,
but I never knew what it meant. Probably the dullest uniforms in
the NFL, but clothes don't make the man in this league. Hard times
have fallen upon them. They have just two winning seasons in the
last six. They've been to one Super Bowl since the days of Halas.
They'd lost seven games this season. The public had been hard to
convince. Reports about another sellout were greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Little to fear here, except this is the kind of game you lose.
There had been talk that Jamal Anderson was too banged up to play.
The list of inactives took care of that. Harold Green wouldn't have
been on it if Anderson had been gimpy.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half, Anderson was only barely in it. He couldn't
find a crack of daylight to run through. The Bears line played like
Papa George was back on the sideline. The Falcons had their
chances, but sometimes shut themselves down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were moving the ball, but we would come up with some kind
of mistake'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   The most costly one came just before the half, when Todd Kinchen
fielded a pass about the five-yard line and, while waiting to be
tackled, dropped the ball. Goodbye, touchdown. The Falcons put up
yardage but had only three points to show for it. The half ended
3-3. It read like a hockey score.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the same Cajun Kinchen would make amends. The Bears had
kicked a field goal, picked up another Falcon fumble and run it
into a touchdown on the oversized legs of Shawn Lee, a 300-pound
tackle. The Falcons had come back and narrowed the gap to three
points when Chandler caught a glimpse of Kinchen crossing the end
zone and nailed him with an 11-yard pass, a touchdown and a lead
the Falcons never lost.
</P>
<P>
   A loss of another nature brought a pall over the house of
60,000. Chandler went down on a non-play, whistled dead on a
penalty. (''I don't think the guy had to pull me to the ground like
that,'' he would say. ) He was crunched like a pretzel, hurt knee,
hurt ankle, and things were not looking good in Marthasville when
they had to reach into the waxworks for Steve DeBerg, 44.
</P>
<P>
   It worked out OK. The old boy, using Kinchen again, set up a
field goal for the final score, 20-13, after which Reeves used a
line now growing more familiar with each passing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great win for us today,''the coach said. Little more
than the sports intelligentsia had ordered.

 &HT;    Falcons looking for fourth win against St. Louis
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons travel to St. Louis to play the Rams on Sunday.
Atlanta has beaten the Rams three times in a row under coach Dan
Reeves, including a 27-21 win last year in the TWA Dome. In that
game, tight end O.J. Santiago broke his leg, and his backup, Brian
Kozlowski, caught two passes for seven yards, including the
2-yarder that proved to be the game-winner. The Rams drove to
Atlanta's 18-yard line but ran out of downs there with about a
minute left in the game. The Rams lead the all-time series 39-22-2,
but the Falcons have won 12 of the last 16 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   The sprained ankle and knee suffered by QB Chris Chandler was
the worst news of the day, but he seems to think he'll be able to
play next week at St. Louis. The ankle is the worst part of the
injury. . . . FB Bob Christian, who has battled a bruised shoulder
much of the season, had to leave the game twice Sunday when he
reaggravated the injury, forcing Gary Downs into the lineup for
about a dozen plays. . . . The rest of the injury report, which
does not appear serious: DE Chuck Smith (strained calf, sprained
ankle), RG Gene Williams (back), and CB Ray Buchanan (hamstring).

 &HT;    Vikings dazzle their way to victory
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ With his team having surrendered its three-year
hold on the NFC Central and destined to defend its conference
championship as a wild card, Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf
grudgingly acknowledged Sunday night that there has been at least a
temporary changing of the guard in the division.
</P>
<P>
   And he made it clear which of the Minnesota Vikings offensive
standouts he considered responsible for the dramatic alteration to
the balance of power
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly am dazzled by Randy Moss,'' Wolf said following
the Vikings' 28-24 victory over the Packers. ''We show up and he
looks like a Hall of Fame player, doesn't he? He's really a cool
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this season the Minnesota rookie wide
receiver looked like he was performing in a sandlot game instead of
having a crucial role in one of the most storied rivalries in
league history. The former Marshall star, whose well-documented
off-field problems allowed the Vikings to steal him with the 21st
overall choice, caught eight passes for 153 yards and one
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the Vikings' first division sweep of the Packers since 1993,
Moss totaled 13 catches for 343 yards and touchdown grabs of 52, 49
and 44 yards. The 49-yarder in the fourth quarter Sunday secured
Minnesota's sixth victory over the Packers in their last seven
meetings in the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   At 10-1, the Vikings retained their one-game edge over the
Atlanta Falcons for the top spot in the NFC playoff standings. With
a three-game lead, they've all but clinched the NFC Central crown.
As if to punctuate the notion the Vikings have pillaged the
Packers' pride, Moss performed Green Bay's trademark ''Lambeau
Leap'' into the end zone seats following his touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes we go into a game trying to feature me and other
times we just see how it flows once we get out there,'' said Moss,
whose eight catches were the most by a Vikes rookie since 1976.
''Today we felt we had some edges in the matchups.''
</P>
<P>
   That was especially true when Craig Newsome, the Packers'
starting left cornerback, exited the game with a knee laceration
five minutes into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Already thin at corner, Green Bay had to use journeyman
''nickel'' back Rod Smith the remainder of the game. In many
situations, the Packers were left to cover Minnesota's
three-wideout alignment with a base defensive unit. Some inside
blitzes, designed to pressure the Vikings' Randall Cunningham, too
often placed the Green Bay secondary in man-to-man coverage.
</P>
<P>
   With that combination of scenarios, Moss and offensive
coordinator Brian Billick were like sharks who suddenly smell blood
in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Following Newsome's injury, Cunningham attempted 13 of his final
24 passes for Moss. The rookie saw precious little ''press''
coverage and, with Smith sorely overmatched in ''off-man''
techniques and leaving plenty of cushion, there was room to
operate.
</P>
<P>
   Six of Moss' catches were for first downs or touchdowns and, on
four of the grabs, he had ample time to adjust to the ball. ''He
has a natural awareness of where the thing is coming down,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings coach Dennis Green agreed Moss is football version of
The Natural.
</P>
<P>
   ''He represents a (new) generation,'' Green said. ''You just
don't see anyone else like him. You probably get this more in
basketball, where a guy comes in and says, `OK, I'm here and I can
make things happen.' That's his philosophy.''

FRONT-LOADING 2000 
CALIF.: SAME-SEX MARRIAGE TO BE ON BALLOT 
R.I.: A KENNEDY REJECTS THOUGHTS OF THE SENATE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk)

<P>
   All that talk about spreading out the presidential primaries and
caucuses in Election 2000 turns out to be just talk. If anything,
the process next time is going to be more front-loaded than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, about three dozen states plan to hold their caucuses
and primaries by the end of March or are seriously thinking about
it. So once again, both the Democratic and Republican nominees are
likely to be known before the eight-month delegate-picking season
is two months old.
</P>
<P>
   Two groups of state officials and political experts spent a good
part of last week mulling over a way to spread out balloting more
evenly so that voters would have more time to consider their
choices and the presidential wannabes would have more time to get
their messages out. But in the end, one group, made up of governors
and other officials from eight Rocky Mountain states, voted to join
the headlong rush toward front-loading, while the other group, made
up mainly of secretaries of state from all over, took a
maybe-in-2004 approach.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage Vice President Al Gore, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
and a couple of other aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be as badly squeezed as other wannabes by the
tightly compressed balloting season, assuming that they run. They
already have a leg up in name recognition and fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   The officials from the Rocky Mountain region said they decided
on early primaries because, in recent years, presidential aspirants
have tended to ignore the lightly populated region and its
spread-out balloting. They suggested setting a Rocky Mountain Super
Saturday primary for March 11, noting that states on the West Coast
and in the Northeast were talking about holding Super Tuesday
primaries four days earlier, March 7, and that states in the South
planned their own Super Tuesday on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Michael Leavitt of Utah said positioning a Super Saturday
between two Super Tuesdays could ``create a momentum that no
candidate could ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   How many state legislatures might go along with such a plan is
but a guess. The main reason that front-loading occurs is that many
states prefer to go it alone in scheduling their balloting,
figuring they can get even more attention that way.
</P>
<P>
   The secretaries of state who met last week came up with a
compromise approach: a series of regional primaries held through
the spring and summer, beginning with the 2004 election, with the
order of voting to change every four years.
</P>
<P>
   California to Vote on Gay Marriages
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to ballot initiatives, no state outdoes
California. Got something the Legislature won't pass? Start
gathering signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what happened after the California Legislature
refused to pass a bill that would have banned same-sex marriages in
the state and recognition by the state of same-sex marriages
performed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   To put the proposed prohibition to a vote in the next statewide
election, March 7, 2000, initiative proponents needed some 430,000
petition signatures. A few weeks ago, after a petition campaign
that they said cost $500,000, they turned in more than 675,000
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of same-sex marriage is one of the most emotionally
charged in the country today, pitting social conservatives,
particularly church groups, against social liberals, led by gay
organizations that increasingly are wielding power in closely
fought political contests.
</P>
<P>
   And political experts say it could spill over into other
contests on Election Day, affecting both turnout and the debate in
the Democratic primaries for president and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could find himself defending President Clinton's decision
to sign a bill that prohibits recognition of same-sex marriages by
the federal government. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., could find
herself defending her vote against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Hawaii and Alaska passed similar prohibitions in the
Nov. 3 election, joining more than 25 other states that earlier had
passed or enacted prohibitions. The Vermont Supreme Court heard
arguments on the issue last week and groups there, both pro and
con, are talking about settling the matter with a statewide
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   California poll takers say a majority of that state's voters
oppose legalizing same-sex marriage. But polls are not always good
predictors when it comes to voting on initiatives in the Golden
State, especially when both sides on a hotly contested issue start
pouring in the money _ a good bet in the run-up to the vote on
March 7, 2000, given the grass-roots strength of both conservatives
and gay men and lesbians in the state.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Kennedy Drops Thoughts of Senate
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, D-R.I., overwhelmingly re-elected to a
third term by his constituents in Rhode Island's 1st Congressional
District and just named head of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, says he has ``found a home in the House'' and
given up all thought of running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do more for Rhode Island by staying in the House,'' he
said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe more for himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   If he made it to the Senate, he would be just another lowly
freshman, albeit able to shelter a bit under the considerable
protective wing of his father, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. But as
the new head of the House Democratic Campaign Committee, he is
already on the leadership ladder.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing the campaign committee chairman does is recruit
candidates, raise money and pass out money. And if the Democrats,
with the help of strong, new candidates, take back control of the
House in 2000, well ...
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Kennedy is off and running for re-election to a
seventh term, working the phones for money and showing up all over
the Bay State with increasing frequency, somewhat earlier in the
election cycle than previously. He appears to be in no political
trouble and no serious challenger is in sight, but last time out he
picked up a serious challenger and got a bit of a scare because he
geared up slowly.
</P>
<P>
   This time, aides say, he intends to show strength early and
hopefully scare off any potential challenger.

NCAA RUNNING CHAMP TOOK THE LONG ROAD BACK TO RECOVERY

<P>
   A year ago, after winning the National Collegiate Athletic
Association cross-country title, Carrie Tollefson of Villanova was
diagnosed with a rare tumor in her left heel. She was told by
doctors that she might never run again.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for an operation last February to drain the tumor to
and implant a bone from a cadaver in her foot to fill in the hole,
Tollefson was cautioned by her surgeons. ``They told me, `Just
don't get your hopes up. This is serious,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on Monday, Tollefson will defend her NCAA title in
Lawrence, Kan. In a surprise in 1997, she defeated the defending
champion and six-time NCAA track titlist Amy Skieresz of Arizona by
70 meters in 16 minutes 29 seconds for 5,000 meters. Tollefson, now
a 21-year-old senior, will also play a pivotal role in Villanova's
attempt to win its seventh women's team championship, with its
chief competition expected to come from Brigham Young, which won it
last year, and Stanford, the 1996 champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a good chance to win,'' Tollefson said. ``I'm
not going to use my ordeal as an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Tollefson has undergone two ordeals. When she returned to
training last summer, she pushed too hard, developed tendinitis in
the back of her knee and had to take three weeks off in September.
It appeared that her comeback had failed but Tollefson fought back
to place fourth in the Big East meet on Oct. 30 at Van Cortlandt
Park in the Bronx, her first race in 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrie was training very hard to catch up,'' said first-year
coach Marcus O'Sullivan, an Irish Olympian and Villanova alumnus.
O'Sullivan, who oversees both the Villanova men's and women's
teams, had originally thought he would have to redshirt Tollefson.
``She wanted to defend in November,'' he said. ``In October, it was
time to roll the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lawrence, Tollefson will again face Skieresz, also a senior
and undefeated this season. Other contenders include Amy Yoder of
Arkansas and Julia Stamps of Stanford. The women's course is 6,000
meters (about 3.75 miles), lengthened this year to conform to
international cross-country distances.
</P>
<P>
   The men's favorites in the 10,000-meter race are Adam Goucher of
Colorado and Kenya's Julius Mwangi of Butler. Mwangi defeated
Goucher on the same course on Oct. 10. The team favorites are
Stanford, the defender, eight-time winner Arkansas, and Oregon,
bidding to give its retiring coach Bill Dellinger the Ducks' first
men's crown since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Tollefson, who grew up in Dawson, Minn. (pop. 1,626), has made
coming back her life's work. She was born with an aneurysm in a
lung and almost did not survive infancy. The child grew to become a
star runner, with 108 straight track and cross-country victories,
plus 13 state titles in high school.
</P>
<P>
   She grew to 5 feet 9 inches and became a top-rated point guard
on the high school basketball team. In her spare time, Tollefson
played violin in the school orchestra, trumpet in the band and sang
in the choir.
</P>
<P>
   When the Villanova assistant women's coach, Gina Procaccio, made
a recruiting visit in 1994 to Dawson, a three-hour drive west
through farmland from Minneapolis, she was stunned by Tollefson's
local status. ``She was the town hero,'' Procaccio said.
</P>
<P>
   In her ideal world, Tollefson would run in the morning, play
basketball in the afternoon and sing at night. ``I was a member of
Villanova's gospel choir but could not juggle the rehearsals and
had to give it up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tollefson doesn't give up on much. She came back from hernia
surgery in 1997 to capture the NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the cyst in Tollefson's foot. It was found to be
benign and after the surgery in February, her leg was put in a
boot-cast and she walked with crutches for two months. She embarked
on a cross-training and a rehabilitation program that reached three
hours daily of swimming, bicycling and weight training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a beast,'' Tollefson said of her new-found muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Tollefson needed to rebuild her left leg, which had atrophied.
Her first run after surgery, on May 5, lasted a mere three minutes.
In June, she progressed to 30 miles a week, and by the start of
school in September she was running 50 to 60 miles a week.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to train at full tilt, Tollefson worked so hard that her
leg became inflamed and she had to return to the bike and pool.
``We were getting close to kissing the season goodbye,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With each setback, though, Tollefson gained resolve and an
appreciation of the fundamental joys of training. ``I tell myself
not to be a greedy, obsessed athlete,'' she said. ``I'm so happy
just to be running.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, six months after her break-the-ice three-minute
run, Tollefson won her NCAA district qualifying race at Bethlehem,
Pa. She ran 17:16 for 5,000 meters, leading Villanova to the
women's team title. In the NCAA tuneup, the Wildcats captured six
of the top eight places.
</P>
<P>
   For Tollefson, whatever happens in Lawrence on Monday will be
worth singing about. ``My career has been saved,'' she said.

EYEING KREMLIN, MOSCOW MAYOR JUMP-STARTS BANDWAGON
</HEADLINE>
   (See also RUSSIA-ASSASSINATION)  
 (nk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ All fall, as Russia drifted from crisis to crisis, Yuri
Luzhkov, the pugnacious and energetic mayor of Moscow, kept trying
to jump-start his undeclared campaign to succeed President Boris
Yeltsin, using every opportunity to muscle his way onto the
national stage.
</P>
<P>
   As the undisputed boss of Russia's biggest city, Luzhkov already
has a political arsenal. With control over a major television
station, several key newspapers and the country's second-largest
printing press, he has considerable sway over the news media. And
with his grip on the city's large business and financial empire, he
does not lack for funds.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Luzhkov filled the one remaining gap in his political
agenda with the creation of a national centrist party. To the
surprise of some political observers, it took off with a full head
of steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, there is a hysteria of political love for
Luzhkov,'' said Mikhail Berger, editor of the daily newspaper
Sevodnya. Even Viktor Chernomyrdin, the ex-prime minister once
anointed as Yeltsin's heir apparent, announced he would support
Luzhkov for president, a sign that the Moscow mayor's fortunes have
taken a sudden lurch forward in the race to fill the space left
vacant by Yeltsin's shrinking political influence.
</P>
<P>
   The cold-blooded murder this weekend in St. Petersburg of Galina
V. Staravoitova, a leading liberal democrat, sent shock waves
through Russia's fragile body politic, raising fears that time is
running out for rational debate.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, abandoning a brief flirtation with Russia's Communist
Party, has chosen to aim squarely at the political center. At a
founding meeting on Thursday, Luzhkov said his ``Fatherland'' party
would steer clear of extremism and ``absorb everything that's
logical from the left, and everything that is logical from the
right.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, most Muscovites seem to think the new party's real
goal is to put Luzhkov in the Kremlin, even though he still says he
is only considering a run. Earlier this fall, Luzhkov, once a loyal
Yeltsin ally, took pains to distance himself from the enfeebled
president with a public suggestion that Yeltsin step down before
his term ends in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he has gathered in several former Yeltsin
aides, including former National Security Council chief Andrei
Kokoshin and former Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the Luzhkov bandwagon has collected other
names, and other forces _ including some 20 regional governors,
old-guard industrial managers, labor leaders and even some members
of Moscow's new business elite, many of them beholden to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Without a strong team of economic advisers, Luzhkov has
blundered his way through the continuing debate over how to
extricate Russia from its economic debacle, pledging support for
both a market economy and vigorous state control and blasting
Russian reformers and their Western advisers for pushing Russia to
the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after six years as Moscow's mayor, Luzhkov has his own
record to run on _ a record that can boast of ambitious public
works projects that have been finished in record time, special
benefits for the needy, and a downtown area filled with luxury
shops catering to the city's new rich.
</P>
<P>
   However, Luzhkov also has an authoritarian style that has kept a
tight control over the transfer of city property and business to
organizations closely linked to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov's political muscle is most keenly felt by the Russian
news media. For the most part, they are openly loath to tangle with
the mayor, or investigate the city's business dealings. Not only
has Luzhkov filed _ and won _ numerous libel suits against
offending publications, but he is also known to have doled out _
and withheld _ the kind of municipal favors that are often
necessary for hard-up strapped publishers to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``To criticize Yeltsin in Russia today is completely safe,''
noted Otto Latsis, a political commentator for New Izvestia, a
daily. ``But everybody is afraid of Luzhkov because the city has
real power. You may own your building, but the land beneath it
belongs to the city. If you need to find apartments for your
employees, you have to go to the city. It is all in Luzhkov's
hands.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the recent transfer of the Moskovskaya Pravda printing
plant from the federal to the municipal government, City Hall now
controls the presses used by most of Moscow's major newspapers.
``He has enormous power in his hands, and he has created a
structure that could be easily abused,'' noted Berger.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Moscow not only has a major interest in several
popular newspapers, but it finances its own television station and
a weekly newspaper that is now distributed free.
</P>
<P>
   With presidential elections scheduled for mid-2000, Luzhkov's
national effort still has plenty of time to fail. As the economic
crisis deepens, Moscow's glittery image as Russia's sole success
story stands to get tarnished, and with it, Luzhkov's reputation as
one of the few Russian politicians who can deliver. Already, money
is running short at the city-owned television station and Moscow _
like Russia _ is now struggling to keep up payments on its public
debt.
</P>
<P>
   But another likely presidential contender, Aleksandr I. Lebed,
the former general who is now governor of a region in Siberia, is
sure to have similar problems defending his record. And few
political experts expect either the Communist Party chief, Gennady
Zyuganov, or Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of a liberal party, to get
broad enough support to propel them into a presidential race's
second and final round.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, some experts say Luzhkov's strongest opponent
could be Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, whose success at calming
Russia's political waters over the last two months has lifted his
standing in public opinion polls. But unlike Luzhkov, Primakov can
not even hint at any presidential ambitions, if he has them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luzhkov understands that Primakov is a possible competitor,
which is why he is maneuvering now, and organizing his political
forces now,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov, head of Politika, a research
institute.

SALE OF NETSCAPE TO AOL SAID TO BE NEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape
Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the
government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., executives
involved in the talks said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving
AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, the leading on-line service with more than 14 million
subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World
Wide Web and its software business. But as part of the deal, AOL
would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership
with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of
selling to large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to
serve up Web pages and other Internet technologies to many
thousands of users at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase, an exchange of AOL shares for Netscape stock, is
valued at roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be announced
as soon as Monday morning. But executives involved in the talks
cautioned Sunday night that some details remained to be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three
businesses at the forefront of the modern economy _ on-line
services, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would
strengthen two of Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL and Sun
Microsystems. At the same time, however, it would subsume Netscape,
an Internet software maker once regarded as the most serious
challenger to Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer
software market.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, founded in 1994, has struggled over the last 18 months
under an assault from Microsoft. Its Navigator was the runaway
leader in the market for the browser software used to navigate the
World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding to the Internet
revolution, entered the market aggressively, quickly matching the
quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling the Microsoft
browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard Windows
operating system and giving it away free.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Netscape announced layoffs and started
distributing Navigator for free as well, as Microsoft steadily
gained in the browser market. Since then, Netscape has focused
mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction fees from
its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software to
corporations that are building their own Internet sites on which to
conduct electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   AOL believes it has the expertise to increase revenues from
Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's programmers and vast
corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's software sales as
well, executives involved in the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, is among the most popular
operating systems for the large, powerful computers that run
Netscape's server software.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal would insure that the fundamental elements of
Netscape survive within bigger companies that can drive its
technologies forward,'' said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the
Harvard business school and co-author with Michael A. Cusumano of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology of a recent book,
``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle
with Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the deal, if any, on the government's antitrust
suit against Microsoft is uncertain. It does appear to support a
key theme of Microsoft's defense _ namely, that it operates in a
fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all the time.
Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal, government officials insist, should have no direct
effect on the current case.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much the alliances shift, it doesn't affect the
central fact of Microsoft's monopoly and how it has used and abused
its market power to protect its monopoly,'' said David Boies, the
Justice Department's lead trial lawyer in the Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are
government witnesses at the Microsoft trial. And the serious merger
talks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and
AOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago, or just after the
start of the Microsoft trial, according to people close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts suggest that the companies may have been
emboldened to take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly on
the perception that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And
representatives of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a Silicon
Valley venture capital firm regarded as a power broker among
Microsoft's rivals, sit on the boards of Netscape, Sun and AOL.

IRAQ IS EXPRESSING RENEWED DEFIANCE OVER INSPECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week after it narrowly escaped an American military strike,
Iraq signaled on Sunday in a series of defiant statements that it
has little intention of cooperating with international arms
inspectors and is still on a collision course with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Baghdad, Iraq's foreign minister,
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, rebuffed a U.N. demand for more documents
on his country's arms program. He reiterated a year-old assertion
that Baghdad had already produced over 2 million pages of files and
had no more documents to give U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have handed over all, all available documents,'' Sahhaf
said, calling the request from the United Nations Special
Commission, known as UNSCOM, for more documents ``a new tactic in
order to put obstacles and create unwarranted problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In a direct challenge to the United States and Britain, which
have warned Iraq that only full cooperation would avert attack, the
Iraqis have in effect said they will step back only to Oct. 31,
when they cut off all cooperation with arms inspectors. All the
restrictions placed on monitors in the months preceding that final
break _ especially the inability to see certain crucial documents
dealing with the history of prohibited weapons _ remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   Given Iraq's uncompromising stance, inspectors are unlikely to
gain free access to previously off-limits sites when the time comes
for a new round of intrusive inspections, U.N. officials say.
Baghdad-based inspectors, who resumed routine monitoring of known
sites on Wednesday, are not expected to demand short-notice
inspections of new targets until teams of outside experts are
assembled and flown to Iraq to lead the searches.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with President Clinton in Asia, administration
officials said on Sunday that American forces remained prepared to
act. Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said the Iraqi
objection to the request for documents from UNSCOM's chairman,
Richard Butler, was not reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone back to them and asked for further information, and
we hope and expect to get that,'' Berger said. ``We would hope that
they would respond positively and quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say Iraq cannot hope to get a comprehensive
review of its relations with the United Nations, which Baghdad
hopes will lead to the lifting of sanctions, until full cooperation
resumes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, both the United States and Britain, which still
have forces on alert in the Persian Gulf, indicated that they were
prepared to give the Iraqis, and UNSCOM, a little time. Spot
inspection teams are not being rushed to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   On their side, the Iraqis, on the offensive diplomatically and
in public remarks almost since the moment they capitulated on Nov.
14 in the face of imminent attack, seem to be counting on
supporters in the Security Council to accept their definition of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp summary that turned the history of the Persian Gulf
War and its aftermath on its head, Sahhaf pressed his country's
campaign to lift sanctions, saying, ``Any fair-minded observer all
over the world knows very well that Iraq is the aggrieved party in
what's going on in the last seven and a half years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi foreign minister also said recent findings by the
United States of possible VX gas on warhead fragments were an
``imaginary monster they created in their sick minds.'' But, in a
startling admission, he did note that the overwhelming majority of
documents were handed over to UNSCOM only after a high-level Iraqi
defector _ President Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, Gen. Hussein
Kamal _ had threatened to disclose their contents.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has laid down conditions for the comprehensive review that
is to be Saddam's reward for cooperation, if and when it takes
place. The Security Council unanimously rejected those demands on
Oct. 30, provoking the Oct. 31 Iraqi refusal to cooperate with
UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with reporters on Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz accused Butler of trying to block the review, which Iraq
thinks can lead to a lifting of the oil embargo imposed after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's either creating a superficial pretext to justify the
American aggressions or he is trying to confuse and undermine the
comprehensive review,'' Aziz said, calling Butler's request for
additional documents ``quite provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke on Sunday to a regional Arab meeting in Baghdad
called to shore up Arab support for Iraq, which was badly dented
this month when eight Arab nations, including Egypt, Syria and
Saudi Arabia, warned Saddam that Iraq alone would be responsible if
it came under attack. The loss of Arab support, diplomats said,
played a part in the decision by Saddam to back down.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has repeatedly said it has provided all the material UNSCOM
needs to finish its job and declare Iraq free of prohibited
biological, chemical and missile programs. The International Atomic
Energy Agency has concluded that there are no nuclear weapons or
ready-to-assembly arms in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Iraq, particularly but not only Russia and France,
make the case that at some point UNSCOM and the Security Council
will simply have to decide that there are things that may never be
known, so files should be closed when inspectors have gone as far
as they can. Iraq is gambling that it can hold out until that
happens, inspectors and international arms control experts say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Butler argues that without the full knowledge of what Iraq once
had, there is no way to determine that all, or even the majority,
of prohibited arms have been accounted for. At issue now is one
particular document found in July that lists what substances Iraq
had loaded on warheads during the 1980-88 war with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Among the chemical agents that UNSCOM suspects may have been
loaded on warheads is VX, a lethal nerve gas that is colorless and
odorless. Tests in the United States, France and Switzerland of
warheads dug up this spring by UNSCOM had traces of a
decontaminant, suggesting they had been ``scrubbed'' to remove
prohibited agents. The American and French laboratories also found
degraded components of what could have been VX.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi answers to questions about those warheads, armed with
chemical and possibly biological agents, have varied enough over
the years to make inspectors distrustful of any more ``full, final
and complete disclosures'' from Iraq. Butler has said, in effect,
show me.
</P>
<P>
   Both Butler and his predecessor, Rolf Ekeus, who is now Sweden's
ambassador in Washington, say the Iraqis are being disingenuous
when they say that all documents have been handed over freely. The
largest cache by far was suddenly ``discovered'' in a chicken coop
in 1995 by Iraqi officials after the defection of Kamal, a top
official in the Iraqi arms program. He was later lured back to Iraq
and killed.
</P>
<P>
   In a startling admission on Sunday, Saahaf acknowledged that
most of the Iraqi documents in UNSCOM's possession _ 680,000 pages
of a total 688,020 _ had come from the chicken coop. About 1.5
million more documents were turned over to the International Atomic
Energy Agency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chicken coop documents were very damaging to Iraq, showing a
far larger biological program than the Iraqis had ever
acknowledged, and profoundly shaking the confidence of inspectors
in all Iraqi assurances not backed by evidence.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRAN BLINEBURY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ It was early in the fourth quarter, and the Cowboys were
looking to build on a lead that didn't look quite big enough. Time
for somebody to make a play.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So somebody did. It was a somebody named Jeff Ogden, who took
off on an end around that went for a nice 12-yard gain, and a
clutch, 10-play drive began in the right fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know if the kid ever got a chance to even try
that play at all this week in practice,'' said Dallas head coach
Chan Gailey. ``But he did a pretty good job on the sidelines of
selling to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Cowboys continue trying to sell themselves to the world
as legitimate contenders to go deep into the playoffs, they have
done it with an unusually large assortment of peddlers knocking on
the doors. The latest case in point was their 30-22 victory over
Seattle on Sunday that had more changes than a day with the
McCaughey septuplets.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith went down with an ankle sprain. Deion Sanders was
forced to the sidelines when his injured toe became too painful.
Clay Shiver had a sprained toe. Ernie Mills left with a bruised
abdomen. Nate Newton sprained a knee. Everett McIver might be lost
for the season with a torn knee. And barely anyone noticed.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your father's Oldsmobile. Nor are these Cowboys 8-3
because they rely strictly on the regular cast.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be Aikman-Smith-Irvin, a triple combination that is
as familiar as A-B-C, doing all the damage.
</P>
<P>
   But as Thanksgiving approaches, it is becoming increasingly
clear that with Gailey, in his first season on the job, nothing is
sacred.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier in the Arizona desert, Gailey called an offensive
plan that did not result in at least one completion to Michael
Irvin for the first time in 117 games.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey isn't one of those offensive maestros who come into each
game with a script they intend to follow to the very note. Instead,
he is like water running downhill, always shifting, moving, looking
for an opening and an easier path.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to bang our heads against the wall to try to
prove a point,'' he said. ``We'll take whatever anybody wants to
give us, and we'll do it with whoever happens to be available at
the given time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have injuries, and you hate to see them. But if you
prepare yourself the right way during the week in practice, then
the guys who play the backup spots should be ready to step in and
do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mills went down, it was an opportunity for Ogden, a rookie
wide receiver out of Eastern Washington who was signed in the
summer as a free agent. In addition to his carry on the end around,
Ogden also caught four passes for 26 yards.
</P>
<P>
   There was also Patrick Jeffers, a three-year NFL veteran who was
signed from Denver on the recommendation of receivers coach Dwain
Painter. He caught two passes for 40 yards, including a key
third-down reception for 19 yards on the Cowboys' first touchdown
drive of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Troy Aikman completed 28 of 42 passes for 296 yards and
two touchdowns by spreading the football around to 10 receivers.
Counting a pair of scrambles by Aikman, the Cowboys had five
players rush with the ball. Chris Warren, the former Seahawk,
bolted for a nifty 35-yard gain that set up Dallas' clinching
touchdown, then hammered the ball into the end zone on four tries
from the one.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Kiselak, 31, a refugee from the World League and the
Canadian Football League, started at center in place of the injured
Shiver and shifted to guard for several plays when Newton went out.
Charlie Williams got another call in the secondary when Sanders
could no longer run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go with what you've got at the time,'' Gailey said. ``And
if you're a good team, you make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks were another of those alleged good teams that were
going to test the Cowboys. But how good will any team be with
Warren Moon at quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   If Cypress Creek's Sam Adams hadn't batted an Aikman pass up in
the air, then caught it and run 25 yards for a TD for a brief 14-13
Seattle lead, the only suspense of the day might have been trying
to figure out what or whom Gailey was going to try next.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the Cowboys, on Thursday, are the Vikings with their
NFC-leading 10-1 record. A short week made more difficult by all
the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't make sense to complain, 'cause I don't think they'll
push the game or Thanksgiving back a couple of days,'' Gailey said.
``We just have to come up with something.''
</P>
<P>
   Or somebody. These days, anything goes with the Cowboys.

EDITORIAL: PAY DAYS IN ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The temptation, when considering a pay raise for New York's
state Legislature, is to ask, ``What for?'' Many legislators would
have trouble making a case that they deserve more pay for their
dronelike performance at these part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why they waited like poltroons until after the
election to announce plans to give themselves more of the
taxpayers' money. Nevertheless, if we hope to entice decent public
servants in the future, we need to start offering a better pay
package now.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan
Democrat, has been vigorously pitching for the first pay increase
in 12 years. So far, the wishes of his Republican colleagues _ the
Senate's majority leader, Joseph Bruno, and, more important, Gov.
George Pataki _ have not surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   One hint circling in Albany is that the governor would agree to
raises if the Legislature would adopt his version of charter
schools. We would prefer a different deal that touched more
directly on the Legislature's performance.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for more pay, the legislators should accelerate
opening their arcane system to greater participation by
rank-and-file legislators and broader public scrutiny, a trend that
started earlier this year with the state budget process.
</P>
<P>
   For legislators to move in lock step with the leadership may
sound efficient, but over the years, it has probably done more harm
than good. To this end, pay raises should not include the stipends
parceled out by the leadership to members for jobs ranging from
committee chairman to assistant whip. All but about 33 of the 211
members of the Legislature receive these ``leadership'' stipends, a
policy that certainly discourages dissent and independence.
</P>
<P>
   A legislator's base pay is now $57,500, with add-ons from $6,500
to $30,000. Legislators are quietly talking about a raise in base
pay to at least $78,000 a year plus the stipends. A better policy
would be to raise the salary but drop the extras.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators should also go for genuine campaign finance
reform that would stop slush funds for the political parties, limit
contributions and start allotting public funds for candidates. One
public service would be to ban the particularly slimy Albany
tradition of holding fund-raising receptions while the Legislature
is in session.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, no legislative pay package can pass without addressing
judicial salaries. The governor and legislators should make certain
they agree to increases to $136,700 for a state Supreme Court
justice and other increases as recommended by a state commission,
approved by the Court of Appeals and endorsed by Chief Judge Judith
Kaye.

DEUTSCHE BANK RISKS CULTURE SHOCK IN ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ As chairman of Deutsche Bank AG, Rolf-Ernst
Breuer has few illusions about the risks of a big expansion.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Breuer has spent most of the last two years trying to
repair the damage from the last big move. As he now seeks to
acquire Bankers Trust for about $9 billion, the obvious question is
whether Germany's largest bank will have any better luck the second
time around.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures and the challenges are enormous. Confronted with
bruising competition both at home and in global markets, Breuer
decided months ago that he could not afford to sit still. Yet if
the last few years have shown anything, it is that Deutsche Bank
has not yet learned how to cope with the culture and practices of
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over the British investment bank Morgan Grenfell in
the early '90s, Deutsche Bank spent billions recruiting
star-quality investment bankers from Wall Street and building big
new trading operations in London and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the overall results were weak. Costs soared, profits were
disappointing and several prized U.S. deal makers defected a few
months ago to Credit Suisse First Boston. Despite intense efforts,
the bank has a second-tier presence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breuer had to choose between doubling up or getting out of the
business, and clearly they are now upping the stakes,'' said Mark
Hoge, a banking-industry analyst at Credit Suisse in London. ``My
problem is in my confidence about Deutsche Bank's ability to manage
this kind of a transaction. I don't believe that they truly
understand what it means to manage an investment bank.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to the proposed acquisition argued at the weekend
that it would strengthen Deutsche Bank in several ways. Bankers
Trust would provide it with a substantial U.S. distribution
network, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust also owns Alex. Brown, a boutique investment bank
that specializes in technology companies. That would fill a void
created this summer, when Deutsche Bank's team of Silicon Valley
deal makers _ about 140 people _ defected to Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential problems are significant. Bankers Trust has
run big trading losses in foreign markets including Russia, and
analysts say it would be hard to spot other problems in advance of
a merger. There is also speculation that Alex. Brown, which has
lost executives since Bankers Trust acquired it, may push to spin
itself off as a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were still finishing the details of the deal on
Sunday night, and it is expected to be announced by Wednesday.
Executives close to the deal said Josef Ackermann, a Deutsche Bank
board member who oversees its investment banking business, will be
co-chief executive with Frank Newman, Bankers Trust's chief
executive, of a combined investment banking unit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Breuer's strategy remains unclear. Indeed, he has given
ambivalent signals about his interest in a big acquisition. An
investment banker who became chairman of Deutsche Bank in May 1997,
he soon scaled back on the sweeping ambitions of his predecessor,
Hilmar Kopper.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Breuer took control, Deutsche Bank was still
smarting from losses and bad publicity generated by a rogue
mutual-fund manager at Morgan Grenfell, Peter Young. Young poured
money into a raft of dubious start-up companies. Deutsche Bank had
to pay $300 million to settle with investors.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer was also alarmed by soaring costs at the London-based
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. By late 1997, he had begun to veto some
of the plans conceived by the company's recruits from Wall Street.
He also trimmed bonuses, causing many people to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took away much of Morgan Grenfell's independence by
merging it with the parent company's commercial bank and
eliminating the name ``Morgan Grenfell.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Breuer repeatedly denied rumors that he was
interested in acquiring institutions like Credit Suisse or J.P.
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto is `Europe first,''' he said in March, in what many
took as a retreat from Kopper's goal of establishing Deutsche Bank
as one of the top 10 investment banks on Wall Street. Though
insisting that he was still interested in U.S. acquisitions, Breuer
said, he was more in the market for companies that managed assets
than for entire investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   But competitive pressures made it hard for Deutsche Bank to
retreat entirely. Thanks to bruising competition, profits from
commercial banking in Germany have long been anemic. In an era when
all big banks compete globally for investment capital, Deutsche
Bank and most other German institutions generate a return on equity
far lower than big U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wall Street investment banks like Morgan
Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs dominate the lucrative
business of advising big European companies on mergers and
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the financial industry on both sides of the
Atlantic has been swept by merger fever. The merger of UBS and
Swiss Banking Corp. in January created a global giant far bigger
than Deutsche Bank. The combination of Citicorp and Travelers Group
as Citigroup may well have added to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In Frankfurt, executives said Sunday that they were puzzled
about the expected link between Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust.
``These rumors have been circulating for three weeks now, but I was
always doubtful about them,'' said an executive at a rival bank,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``I was thinking that
Deutsche Bank was looking for a real investment bank. BT is not a
pure investment bank; it is still partly a commercial bank. I
wonder whether it's the right choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Deutsche Bank's renewed push into investment banking and
into the United States is quite different from the strategy of
Germany's next-largest banks. Although Dresdner Bank and
Commerzbank have formed alliances in other European countries, they
have been far more restrained about carving out positions as global
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank has fashioned itself on the
model of an American super-regional bank, such as BankAmerica or
Bank One.
</P>
<P>
   But with more than $600 billion in assets and 75,000 employees,
Deutsche Bank is so big that it may have no choice except to
compete on a world stage.
</P>
<P>
   If Breuer does carry out a Bankers Trust acquisition, a big
challenge will be fitting it as a coherent unit. Before he retired,
Kopper argued that he had to give the newly acquired London
investment bankers free rein because his German bankers did not
have the same expertise in the American-British style of deal
making.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer reversed that strategy, asserting control in the home
office. With Bankers Trust, which does a large part of its business
in the United States, he faces a possible three-way struggle among
Wall Street, London and Deutsche Bank's twin towers in Frankfurt.

 &HT;    Falcons secure win after steadying fickle offense
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thanksgiving is just a few days away, but the Atlanta
Falcons took an early holiday Sunday, floudering about like cooked
birds for more than two quarters before rallying to beat the
surprisingly grizzly Chicago Bears 20-13 at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' franchise-record eighth consecutive win at home had
more scares than touchdowns, as Atlanta (9-2) nearly collapsed
under its own weight on the way to a 13-3 deficit early in the
third quarter. ``We survived'' cornerback Ray Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the Falcons took a 17-13 lead on touchdown passes
from Chris Chandler to Terance Mathis and Todd Kinchen, it looked
as if Atlanta's season might have collapsed under Chicago defensive
tackle Mike Wells, who goes 6-feet-3, and 310 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   With 6:49 left in the game, the crowd of 60,804, coach Dan
Reeves and the Falcons gasped in horror when Atlanta center Robbie
Tobeck flinched, drawing Wells offsides.
</P>
<P>
   Although whistles were blowing, Wells grabbed Chandler and bent
him backward, with the quarterback's right leg trapped underneath
535 pounds of football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard him yell, 'Oh,' `` Wells said. ``I heard something
crackle and pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's diagnosis is a sprained knee and ankle. No ligament
damage is suspected, and the ankle sprain is considered more
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of getting these things,'' said Chandler who missed
all or part of six games last year with injuries, including one
game missed with a sprained ankle. ``It's not my call to make, but
I thought (Wells) could have pulled up. My ankle hurts the most. I
guess I'll be able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said the same thing after he was knocked out of the
Saints game Oct. 18 with a strained non-throwing shoulder and
bruised ribs. However, he did not play the next week, and the Jets
thrashed the Falcons 28-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' letdown came after the team had been sky-high for
wins the previous two weeks at New England and home against the
49ers. Atlanta won it's fourth ina row behind a defense that
allowed just 90 second-half yards _ and a season-low 210 overall _
to hold onto first place in the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably wasn't one of our prettiest wins, but it counts
just as much,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``I think our football team
showed a lot of poise by not panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons won by making big plays in the second half after
hurting themselves in a poor first half when the Bears (3-8)
dominated both lines of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But Bears quarterback Steve Stenstrom did not play well in his
third pro start, completing just 7 of 18 passes for 109 yards and
two interceptions against the NFL's worst-rated pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago rushed for 75 yards in that half against the NFL's No.
2-ranked rushing defense. On one 13-play, 67-yard drive, the Bears
ran the ball 10 times between the Atlanta tackles for 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably our worst series of the season,''
defensive-line coach Bill Kollar said. ``They were just blocking
the (heck) out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, running back Jamal Anderson, the NFL's
third-leading rusher with 1,066 yards before the game, had 12 yards
on nine carries in the first half against the NFL's No. 26 run
defense. Anderson finished with 72 yards on 24 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating. (His sprained ankle and foot) wasn't a
factor'' he said. ``I could (not) care less if this was a
9-year-old Pop Warner game. I'm coming out to try to destroy them.
I was disappointed with the way we came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler completed 11-of-17 passes in the first half for 194
yards. But a 48-yard TD pass to Tony Martin (six catches, 100
yards) was called back in the first quarter because tight end O.J.
Santiago was called for interference.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Kinchen fumbled at the end of a 27-yard play, giving the
Bears the ball at their 6 with just a few seconds left in a 3-3
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Glyn Milburn returned the second-half kickoff 61 yards to
the Atlanta 38, and six plays later, Jeff Jaeger kicked a 32-yard
field goal for a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Bears defensive tackle Jim Flanigan sacked
Chandler, who fumbled, and defensive lineman Shawn Lee grabbed the
ball out of the air and rumbled 15 yards untouched to score.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Bears led 13-3 with 11:21 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the offensive line began playing better, and Anderson rushed
for 57 yards on his final 10 carries. A 13-yard scoring pass to
Mathis with 1:45 left in the third quarter drew Atlanta to within
13-10. An 11-yarder that Kinchen caught with one hand put the
Falcons in front, 17-13 with 9:32 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was consistent in the second half, forcing a
Stenstrom fumble that resulted in an Atlanta field goal to make it
20-13 with 1:58 left. ``Dime'' back Ronnie Bradford sealed the win
with his first interception of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out in the second half and guys stepped up their
play,'' defensive end Lester Archambeau said. ``We struggled at
times, but in the end, it was a huge statement about the kind of
team we've got.''

 CHARLES McCARTNEY, 97, KNOWN AS THE `GOAT MAN'  
(lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You take a fellow who looks like a goat, travels around with
goats, eats with goats, lies down among goats and smells like a
goat, and it won't be long before people will be calling him the
Goat Man.
</P>
<P>
   Which is pretty much what Charles McCartney had in mind back in
the Depression when he pulled up his Iowa stakes, put on his
goatskins, hitched up his ironed-wheeled goat wagon and hit the
road for what turned out to be a three-decade odyssey as one of the
United States' most endearing eccentrics and by far its most
pungent peripatetic roadside tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tribute to the indelible image he created that although
he had abandoned the goat life 30 years ago and settled down in a
school bus in the south Georgia town of Jeffersonville, outside
Macon, when McCartney died on Nov. 15 in a Macon nursing home, he
was still known as the Goat Man. He was 97, or a decade or so
younger than he'd taken to claiming to be.
</P>
<P>
   A man given to gross exaggeration when simple embellishment
would suffice, McCartney also claimed to have visited every state
except Hawaii: His goats couldn't swim so far, he explained, and if
they could, they'd just end up eating the grass skirts off the hula
dancers anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the scope of his travels, McCartney, who averaged seven
miles a day and had a regular route between Iowa and Georgia, spent
most of his time creating traffic jams throughout the South,
primarily along the old Dixie Highway running through Kentucky,
Tennessee, Georgia and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   As many who grew up in the South in the 1940s, '50s and '60s
could attest, when the Goat Man came to town it was an event, one
that inevitably produced a story and a photograph in the local
paper.
</P>
<P>
   When someone spotted him and his 30 or so goats coming down the
highway, his wagon piled high with interesting junk, word would get
around and pretty soon parents would be driving their children out
to meet him, those familiar with the drill taking the precaution of
staying upwind of the Goat Man.
</P>
<P>
   As McCartney, who never took a bath or washed his clothes, once
boasted, nobody but his goats could stand the smell of him.
</P>
<P>
   According to research by Darryl Patton and Jimmy Hammett, who
collaborated on a 1993 Goat Man video and a 1994 Goat Man book,
McCartney had a colorful life even before he became the Goat Man.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up on a farm outside Sigourney, Iowa, he was considered
such an odd child that the family goats were about his only true
friends, which helps explain why he took off at 14, married a
24-year-old Spanish knife thrower, served as her exhibition target
for a couple of years, and then returned to Iowa and married at
least twice more.
</P>
<P>
   The last marriage ended when he sold his goat-weary wife for
$1,000 to a farmer she'd already grown sweet on.
</P>
<P>
   By then, McCartney, who had been forced to trade a farm he'd
inherited to pay off a grocery bill, had begun his goat excursions,
initially taking his wife and young son, Albert Gene, along on
short trips and attracting so much attention that he was soon
printing postcards with his picture on them to sell to the gawkers.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the 1930s, he struck off on his own, beginning
a series of annual circuits and soon making Jeffersonville his home
base.
</P>
<P>
   Although the postcards sold so well that rumors actually spread
that he was rich, he found a new source of income early in his
travels when he stopped off in a backwoods section of north Georgia
and had what amounted to an economic epiphany. Observing that the
bearded goat man was the spitting image of a figure depicted in
religious paintings, some of the deeply religious residents became
convinced that he was Jesus Christ and began showering him with
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney saw no reason to correct them, and by the time the
locals, tumbling to the truth, tarred and feathered him and ran him
out of town on a rail, the Goat Man had an additional calling: as
an itinerant preacher.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney, who eventually built a church near his school bus in
Jeffersonville, admitted that his preaching was a gimmick but
insisted it was sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Although his preaching, his wit, his tall tales, his goats and
his seeming personification of the totally free life helped make
him a beloved figure to many, to others his very strangeness seemed
threatening and made him a target of mindless violence, most
notably in 1968 in Signal Mountain, Tenn., near Chattanooga, when
he was severely beaten by thugs who also slit the throats of eight
of his goats.
</P>
<P>
   That was the end of his life as a goat man, but he continued to
make occasional hitchhiking forays, including a trip while in his
80s that began when he became obsessed with the actress Morgan
Fairchild and ended when he was mugged in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCartney, who had lived in the nursing home for 11
years, spoke vaguely about having other children, he leaves no
known survivors. His son, Albert Gene, who lived in the school bus
in Jeffersonville, was murdered there earlier this year.

DICK SISLER, NOTED FOR PHILLIES' PENNANT-WINNING HOMER, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Pa., N.Y., Mo., Ohio, Calif.)  (jw) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Sisler, a member of a prominent baseball family who gained
his own niche in the sport's history with a pennant-winning home
run for the Philadelphia Phillies' 1950 Whiz Kids team, died Friday
in his hometown of Nashville, Tenn. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Sisler had been suffering from pneumonia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Phillies faced the Dodgers at Ebbets Field on the final
Sunday of the 1950 season, they held a one-game edge on Brooklyn in
a bid for their first pennant since 1915. The last time the Phils
had won anything, Sisler's father, George, was a rookie first
baseman for the St. Louis Browns. The elder Sisler became a Hall of
Famer and later an executive with the Dodgers. On that day in 1950,
he was sitting behind the Brooklyn dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Phils, who had squandered a large lead in the final two
weeks and faced a playoff if they lost that Sunday, were tied with
the Dodgers, 1-1, going into the ninth inning. The game stayed tied
when the Dodgers' Cal Abrams was ill-advisedly sent home from
second base on a single to short center field, and the Phils'
Richie Ashburn threw him out by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the 10th, Sisler, the Phillies' left fielder and a
left-handed batter, came to the plate against the Dodgers' best
pitcher, the right-hander Don Newcombe, with two men on and one
out. Sisler already had three singles and had scored the Phils'
only run although playing with a sprained right wrist that was
heavily taped. He was hoping he would not get an inside pitch,
because the wrist injury made it hard to connect if he was jammed.
</P>
<P>
   With the count one ball and two strikes, Newcombe threw a
fastball on the outside corner. Sisler hit a drive to the opposite
field and, as Abrams watched, the ball landed in the lower
left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Sisler had given the Phillies a 4-1 lead, and as he ran toward
second base, he jumped up and down, his arms raised in exultation.
When he touched home plate, he was mobbed by his teammates. Robin
Roberts, Philadelphia's ace starter, retired the Dodgers in order
in the bottom of the 10th, and the Phillies were pennant winners
after a 35-year drought. They were swept by the Yankees in the
World Series, but this team _ known as the Whiz Kids for its mostly
youthful cast _ would long be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Sisler, a month short of his 30th birthday when he hit his
dramatic homer, was one of the oldest Whiz Kids. A native of St.
Louis, he made his major league debut with the World Series
champion Cardinals in 1946, then was traded to the Phillies before
the 1948 season.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950 season was Sisler's best. He batted .296 with 13 homers
and 83 RBIs and made the All-Star team. But he played only one more
year with the Phillies before being traded to the Cincinnati Reds,
then finished his career back with the Cardinals in 1953. Over
eight seasons, playing the outfield and first base, he batted .276
with 55 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Sisler served as the Reds' manager for part of 1964 and all of
1965, succeeding Fred Hutchinson when he was stricken with cancer.
Sisler was later a batting instructor for the Cardinals, San Diego
Padres and Mets and a minor league manager.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Dorothy; a son, Richard; three
daughters, Kathleen Hand, Patricia Sweeney and Shari Patterson; two
brothers, Dave, who pitched in the major leagues for seven seasons,
and George Jr., a former president of the International League; a
sister, Francis Drochelman, 10 grandchildren and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Although burdened with the wrist bandage, Sisler had something
else with him for his dramatic at-bat that final Sunday in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   When the taxi he was taking to Ebbets Field with his teammates
Del Ennis, Russ Meyer and Willie (Puddin' Head) Jones stopped for a
light, a car with a priest in it pulled alongside. The priest
recognized the players and offered Sisler a rose, saying it had
been blessed.
</P>
<P>
   Sisler said, ``Father, I'm not a Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   The priest replied: ``Take it anyway. Maybe it will bring you
good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Sisler kept the rose with him during the game and, as he
remembered it: ``When I came up to bat in the 10th inning, I
thought of the rose in my pocket. I reached in my hand and touched
it. I doubt that it had anything to do with what happened
afterward, but who knows?''

   BURBANK _The second USTA tournament here will have to do without
Andre Agassi, the inaugural champion who added considerable luster
to the Challenger Series event last year.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament also lost its only big-name player, Malivai
Washington, who pulled out last week because of nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   What remains is a group of mostly young, hungry players _ none
ranked higher than No. 79 in the world _ trying to win a few
dollars and pick up some ATP Tour points in the 32-player
tournament, which starts today at the Burbank Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   The best among them might be two power-serving Canadiens known
principally for their doubles play, Daniel Nestor (No. 102, as of
last week) and Sebastien Lareau (No. 79).
</P>
<P>
   Those who followed last year's tournament will remember Nestor,
who gave a rusty Agassi all he could handle in a three-set
semifinal, losing 6-4, 5-7, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   And Nestor has played well of late. He reached the semifinals of
the recent Kremlin Cup in Moscow and, playing with Mark Knowles,
lost in the final of ATP World Doubles Championship to Jacco
Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis on Sunday in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's beaten Thomas Muster, he's beaten Patrick Rafter,'' said
Tim Stallard, the tournament director. ``He's always been there. .
. . He's just been inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lareau, the tournament's top seed, is the only player ranked
among the top 100 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Other players to watch: Alex O'Brien, the former NCAA champion
from Stanford (No. 159); Cecil Mamiit, the former NCAa champion
from USC (No. 181), and Paul Goldstein, the NCAA finalist last year
from Stanford (No. 198).
</P>
<P>
   The tournament also features the San Fernando Valley area's
rising stars, Bob and Mike Bryan, who will play singles and could
be the doubles team to beat in the 32-team doubles field.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bryan (No. 274) won the NCAA triple crown while at Stanford
last year, taking the singles, doubles (with Mike) and team
championships.
</P>
<P>
   He and his brother are working their way up the rankings as
professionals. As a doubles team, they reached the semifinals of a
tournament in Washington D.C. in July, their highest finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Camarillo residents are pleased to be home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is special,'' Mike Bryan said. ``We've been on the road
for 10 straight weeks. We finally get to stay home. Hopefully,
we'll get people out and make it feel like (the annual) Ojai
(tournament).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an advantage to get to sleep in your own bed.''

PENTAGON PROPOSES UNILATERAL REDUCTIONS IN NUCLEAR ARSENAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb.)  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Driven by budget constraints as much as diminishing
security threats, Pentagon officials are quietly recommending that
the Clinton administration consider unilateral reductions in the
nation's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Since the United States has already committed itself to drastic
cuts in its nuclear arsenal, the Pentagon believes that the
unilateral reductions would have no effect on America's ability to
deter a nuclear adversary.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations, if adopted, would reduce the American
arsenal below the 6,000 nuclear warheads allowed by the first
strategic arms reduction treaty, or START I, senior administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia have signed a second arms treaty,
START II, that would cut their arsenals even more sharply, to
between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads. But for nearly six years,
Russia's Parliament has refused to approve START II.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Russia's delay, and U.S. legislation blocking
unilateral cuts, the Pentagon faces the prospect of paying hundreds
of millions of dollars to maintain _ and soon to rebuild _ nuclear
weapons that the United States has already agreed to scrap.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has spent $95 million more over the past two years
than it would have if START II had taken effect. Next year it would
cost $100 million more, and the year after that, $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, in particular, could be forced to pay more than $5
billion between now and 2003 to refuel nuclear reactors and install
new missiles on four Trident ballistic-missile submarines that
would otherwise be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   With this budget crunch looming, the Pentagon submitted to
Congress a highly classified report last April that outlined nine
proposals for reducing the strategic arsenal unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   Neither President Clinton nor Secretary of Defense William Cohen
has made a decision on the recommendations, and a senior White
House official said they would not do so until Russia's
Communist-dominated Parliament completes its latest deliberations
on START II, which was signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia's nationalists and Communists have vehemently
opposed the treaty, the lower house has begun debate and could vote
as soon as December.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's recommendations underline the stakes: START II's
ratification would not only rid the world of thousands of nuclear
warheads, but would also save the United States billions of dollars
that the Pentagon would rather spend elsewhere or that Congress
might allocate to other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington and Russia agree that prospects for
ratification have improved as the realization sinks in that
Russia's economic problems have left the country hard pressed to
maintain a nuclear force as large as that allowed by START I.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reluctant to discuss at all Plan B,'' one White House
official said of the Pentagon's recommendations, ``when we have the
best on-course momentum here in a long, long time for Plan A.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Russian Parliament again rejects the treaty,
officials in the Pentagon plan to recommend that Clinton seek
permission from Congress to move ahead with unilateral reductions.
The officials said a decision could come as part of the budget
Clinton will submit to Congress early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Richard Mies, the new commander of the nation's strategic
arsenal, said the United States was committed to maintaining a
``robust and credible force.'' But he suggested that this effort
did not preclude unilateral cuts in warheads or the systems to
deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you will inevitably see us take some unilateral
actions that we have to take to modernize our forces and maybe
streamline our forces to some degree,'' Mies said in an interview
last week at the U.S. Strategic Command headquarters at Offutt Air
Force Base in Nebraska. ``We're driven by our own imperatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Mies did not elaborate on what steps were under consideration.
In recent weeks, however, Pentagon and administration aides have
begun discussions with congressional staff members as they draw up
next year's budget and decide whether to set aside enough money for
a larger nuclear force, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the last two years, Republicans in Congress have put
language in the Department of Defense's budget bills explicitly
prohibiting reductions below START I levels by the United States
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials and members of Congress have
argued that the legislation is necessary to press the Russians to
ratify START II.
</P>
<P>
   Others dispute the effect that such legislation has had on the
Russian Parliament's deliberation, and argue that unilateral
reductions could revive a stagnant arms control process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is, how much longer are we going to pay to stay at a
higher level to retain some leverage over the Russians to ratify
the treaty,'' a senior defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   Under START I, which was signed in 1991, the United States has
drastically reduced its arsenal of strategic nuclear warheads, from
more than 10,000 to about 7,000 today. In Helsinki, Finland, in
March 1997, Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin agreed that once
the lower house approved START II, the United States and Russia
would begin talks on still further reductions, to 2,000 to 2,500
warheads.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Political pressures for slashing the number of warheads have
begun to grow here. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations
in New York last week, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., called on the
administration to make unilateral reductions and take other steps
that would reassure Russia, including removing remaining warheads
from the highest state of alert.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said he would seek to repeal the congressional limits on
further reductions, arguing that among other things, the higher
levels of weapons sapped money from efforts to combat ``newer
threats'' like terrorism and ethnic wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our old policies of arms control and deterrence no long work
and may be increasing the danger,'' he said, ``both by making
nuclear threats worse and by diverting money and resources away
from the conventional forces that are the key to our safety in the
post-Cold War world.''
</P>
<P>
   In its budgets, the Pentagon has already anticipated reducing
the arsenal to START II levels over the next several years.
Likewise, strategists have concluded that a nuclear force as small
as that planned under START III, which has not yet been negotiated,
can adequately defend the United States, making spending on
anything more seem wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined to spell out the proposals
under consideration should the Russian Parliament fail to ratify
START II. But one senior military official said some options would
allow the Pentagon to reduce the number of warheads to 5,000 to
6,000 and reduce or eliminate some categories of strategic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Under these plans, the Navy would move ahead with its current
plan to reduce its fleet of 18 Trident submarines by retiring the
four oldest by 2003. The Air Force would be able to reduce or
eliminate the stockpile of 50 intercontinental ballistic missiles
that it is now financing in its budget year to year.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Congress has prohibited reductions in those
forces. The senior military official called the money spent on
updating those forces as ``rat hole dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't necessarily feel we should be locked into a certain
force structure,'' the official said. ``We want to have
flexibility.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is often a kernel of insight in Rep. Henry
Hyde's retorts as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and
they typically refer to his state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that five minutes?,'' Hyde, R-Ill., said plaintively at the
impeachment hearing on Thursday as panel members cajoled, bullied
or just stormed past the time limit. ``It seems forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the hours rolled on, Hyde jokingly threatened to
sequester the members for the evening, without food or water, so he
could wrap up the hearing in one day _ or the whole proceeding in
one month. And, when Democrats moaned at one point, he asked,
``Does anyone need an aspirin?''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde could probably use a few doses himself. More than two
months after the independent counsel Kenneth Starr delivered an
impeachment referral practically on his Capitol Hill doorstep,
Hyde, 74, finds himself at the helm of a messy inquiry that
Democrats denounce, most people decry and some poll-reading
Republicans would like to deflate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been given an extremely hot potato,'' said Thomas Mann,
a senior congressional analyst at the Brookings Institution. ``He
faces an extremely difficult situation, both presiding over a
highly polarized committee and facing a situation where the
American public, and probably his new Republican leadership,
doesn't want to hear or see anything more of the matter that has
been put before his committee.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not start that way, at least among his Republican
colleagues. In September, Starr's report arrived amid palpable
Republican exuberance. There was much talk of duty and gravity, but
privately many members were throwing confetti in the Capitol's
anterooms.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had to fight to keep the inquiry in his boisterous
committee when House Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested creating a
select panel of members to deal with impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Heralded as one of the most fair, even-handed chairmen in
Congress, Hyde faced the immediate challenge of having to live up
to his image and the dusted-off luster of his most famous
predecessor, Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., who presided over
the impeachment hearings dealing with President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   But developments and decisions seemed to sting Hyde, and his
leaders offered him little cover. The committee's decision to
release the Starr report, accompanying documents and Clinton's
videotaped grand jury testimony angered many people across the
country, who viewed it as gratuitous.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Hyde's chief investigative counsel, David Schippers,
expanded the number of counts that might constitute impeachable
offenses with little explanation. Hyde appeared to backpedal when
he announced subsequently that the committee would focus on three
major areas and consolidate the counts.
</P>
<P>
   He failed to recognize the weight of his words and the uproar
they could create. Off-the-cuff remarks sometimes led to
clarifications, leaving a trail of mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   At first, there was talk of extended hearings, a long witness
list and a thorough fact-finding mission. Hyde has imposed an
end-of-the-year deadline, and Starr may prove to have been the
committee's only major witness, although the witness list is still
being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's gotten a lot of help, just a lot of
pressure,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters of California, a committee
Democrat who is so persistently outspoken that she prompted Hyde to
joke with his bodyguards on Thursday, ``Can someone protect me from
Maxine Waters?''
</P>
<P>
   Hints of possible bipartisanship have vanished. The word
fairness _ which has been tossed around by Democrats and
Republicans on the committee, but mostly by Democrats, in a kind of
you-started-it refrain _ took its place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do see the fairness, though,'' Hyde said on Thursday,
after he suggested that Starr could reply to written questions once
Clinton did the same. ``That's a big word around here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't,'' replied Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``I don't
see the fairness, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming speaker, Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, has
said he wants the investigation wrapped up quickly. But no one is
quite telling Hyde how to do that, in part because impeachment is
now about as attractive to longevity-minded Republicans as carbon
monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chairman should not be given all of the burden of managing
this,'' Mann said. ``It's time for the leadership to step up and
figure out how to extricate the Republicans from the House on this
matter.'' Many Democrats share his view.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, though, Hyde feels duty bound, members and
aides say, so he is forging ahead, scouting around for ways to
bolster the case by piecing together a pattern of obstruction of
justice, but with little time left to do it. Many Republicans on
the panel want him to carry on, and they are rankled by what they
view as a cavalier attitude on the part of their Republican
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the people on the committee believe this is not
politics,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah, on the panel.
``This is historic. It is about how we govern ourselves in
America.''

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ Troy Aikman, the quarterback with the healing collarbone,
is supposedly the most fragile of the Dallas Cowboys. But all
around him, his teammates were falling Sunday afternoon.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aikman, meanwhile, withstood one of the NFL's best pass rushes
and kept stringing together first downs (a total of 29) with his
makeshift supporting cast. And that's how the Cowboys beat the
Seattle Seahawks 30-22.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle entered the game tied for the league lead in sacks, but
Aikman was dumped only once. He completed 28 of 42 passes for 296
yards and two touchdowns, with one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenge for me to get rid of the football,'' Aikman
said. ``But I think we've got as good an offensive line as any
team. Sometimes, we fail to mention them enough.''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Aikman scrambled 10 yards for a first down,
causing some nervousness in Texas Stadium. Would the tender
collarbone _ broken Sept. 13 _ hold up?
</P>
<P>
   It did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be smart about it,'' Aikman said. ``But if I need to
run to get a first down for the team, I've got to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Aikman and his army of 10 receivers, the Cowboys
(8-3) did not appear focused for this match against Seattle (5-6).
Dallas committed 15 penalties, costing 129 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had entirely too many,'' coach Chan Gailey said. ``It's my
responsibility to get those things straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   His other concern was a continuing injury epidemic. The most
costly one came when multidimensional Deion Sanders left in the
second quarter after aggravating a sprained big toe. It's
questionable if he can be rehabilitated in time for Thursday's game
against Minnesota (10-1).
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000-yard rusher, Emmitt Smith, was hobbled for most of the
second half with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 receiver, Ernie Mills, spent the second half _ and the
rest of the day _ in a hospital being checked for an internal
injury that apparently is not severe.
</P>
<P>
   The vaunted offensive line lost, for varying periods of time,
starters Nate Newton (strained quadriceps), Everett McIver (torn
knee ligament) and Mike Kiselak (bruised left hand).
</P>
<P>
   But the resourceful Gailey and the redoubtable Aikman held the
team together.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of the ballgame was guys coming in and playing well
at positions they didn't know they could play,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle coach Dennis Erickson said: ``Aikman is at his best
right now. He played as well as any quarterback can, and they
converted their third downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was 10-of-15 on third-down conversions, and many of them
were lengthy because of the plethora of penalties.
</P>
<P>
   He completed two third-and-longs on the game's opening drive,
which ended in a 47-yard field goal by Richie Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks drove to the Dallas 26 on their first possession.
But quarterback Warren Moon, 42, fumbled the ball away when Darren
Woodson smacked him on a safety blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, but we
rattled him enough to get the victory,'' said defensive end Kavika
Pittman, who recovered the fumble.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys capitalized by driving 49 yards, with Smith scoring
on an eight-yard swing pass.
</P>
<P>
   Moon came back with a second-quarter rainbow to Joey Galloway
for a 44-yard touchdown. One of the NFL's fastest receivers,
Galloway outraced Kevin Smith down the right sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, that was the only opportunity Cowboys fans had to
chastise the heavily strafed cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas defensive coordinator Dave Campo said: ``I've seen
Galloway run by a lot of guys, but the rest of the time, Kevin held
his own. He played very aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said: ``He (Smith) got an interception (his first in 23
games), a couple of breakups, a couple of penalties, a couple of
balls caught against him. That's life out there on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys led 13-7 with a 44-yard field goal by Cunningham.
The key play in that 65-yard drive came when Aikman, under a heavy
rush, completed a 19-yard pass to Michael Irvin on third-and-11.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle claimed its only lead on an unlikely interception return
with two minutes to go in the half. A pass from Aikman was
deflected and intercepted by 330-pound tackle Sam Adams, who played
high school football at Cypress Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Adams eluded Aikman and rambled into the end zone, and the extra
point put Seattle ahead 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I should have made the tackle,'' Aikman said, ``but
I haven't done tackling drills in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   He recovered from that mishap to direct a 69-yard drive just
before halftime. Cunningham made a 28-yard field goal _ barely _ to
return the advantage to Dallas, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys didn't put away the Seahawks until 2:32 remained in
the fourth quarter. Kevin Smith, of all people, made the defensive
play of the game by knocking down a pass for Galloway on fourth
down.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys played just enough defense to win. Aikman handled
the rest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Even in a sport that is covered in muck, boxing fans have
plenty to be grateful for this Thanksgiving season. The list is in
no particular order:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; U.S. Senator John McCain: McCain (R-Ariz.) is a force for
reform. He has authored and pushed effective legislation to protect
fighters _ in and out of the ring _ and he's not finished.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Holyfield-Lewis: It looks as if Evander Holyfield and
Lennox Lewis will meet in March. Imagine that: The two best
heavyweights fighting each other. It should've happened sooner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; De La Hoya-Quartey: Oscar De La Hoya has decided to take a
gamble in what was becoming an all-too-predictable career: He has
taken a fight he could actually lose, against Ike Quartey on
Feb. &UR;  &LR; 13.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; De La Hoya-Chavez: De La Hoya's performance against Julio
Cesar Chavez was inspiring: He had the guts to fight Chavez's fight
simply to make a point and gave the world a wonderful show.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Tyson, Part III: We might not like Mike Tyson, but he has a
right to fight. The Nevada State Athletic Commission did the right
thing to give him his license. Now, let the fun _ such as it is _
resume.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; The Ruelas brothers: Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas gave boxing
fans so many thrills and so much drama over their careers, and they
did it with class. They'll be missed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Genaro Hernandez: Like the Ruelases, the underappreciated
L.A. product won and lost with dignity. If his loss to Floyd
Mayweather marks the end of his career, again, it will leave a
void.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Arturo Gatti: If every fighter were as exciting as Gatti,
boxing would be the most popular sport in the world. He comes to
fight, not play like tiresome Naseem Hamed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Gatti-Robinson: The first fight between Gatti and Ivan
Robinson, in August, was as scintillating as any in recent years,
as both fighters showed the kind of heart so rare in today's
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Gatti-Robinson II: We get to see them again on Dec. &UR;  &LR; 12.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Hamed-McCullough: At last, the world saw that Hamed is more
hype than substance in his uninspiring decision over
competent-but-limited Wayne McCullough. Hamed has been fooling the
public for long enough.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Fernando Vargas: With the departure of the Ruelases, the
Oxnard resident _ who will try to take the IBF junior welterweight
title from Yory Boy Campas on the Dec. &UR;  &LR; 12 card _ becomes the San
Fernando Valley area's top attraction. He has the ability and
personality to be a star.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Appropriate behavior: Nothing terribly heinous or bizarre
has occurred in the ring in some time. Keep your fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Roy Jones Jr.: It's nice to know a fighter of Jones'
caliber is out there _ even if he has no one to fight. Maybe he
should start a bum-of-the-month club, a la Joe Louis. Nah, it'd
never happen today.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; California Athletic Commission: More than ever, the
cutting-edge commission is taking steps to protect the health of
fighters and improve the sport. It leads the nation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Shane Mosley: The immensely talented IBF lightweight champ
from Pomona is emerging as a star in the sport. The best is yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Absence of Don King: With his legal troubles, King hasn't
been around much. At his age, we should see less and less of him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Young fighters: Along with Mosley and Vargas, talented
fighters like Michael Grant, David Reid and Mayweather are the next
generation of boxing. The sport is in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   RABBIT PUNCHES:
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Dino Duva of Main Events expects the Evander
Hollyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight title unification bout to be
finalized within two weeks, no thanks to King, Holyfield's
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Duva, Lewis' promoter, King made a deal with Main
Events and then came to an agreement with HBO that would've altered
the original agreement. It was King being King, trying to sneak in
a few clauses that would have increased his profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical King,'' Duva said. ``He never lets up, he just keeps
hammering you. After four or five drafts of the contract, though,
it's finally doable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should've been done a year ago.''. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Kostya Tszyu will face Diobelys Hurtado, instead of Miguel Angel
Gonzalez, for the vacant WBC super lightweight title on Nov. &UR;  &LR; 28 in
Indio.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had to pull out because of a rib injury but will face
the winner early next year, according to America Presents.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado, a Cuban, is best known for building a lead against
Pernell Whitaker only to get knocked out in the 11th
round. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Grant is expected to return to the ring Jan. &UR;  &LR; 30 on HBO. His
opponent has yet to be determined. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Randy Shields, the former welterweight contender from North
Hollywood, is opening his own gym in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Shields has worked with fighters off and on while pursuing
careers as a screenwriter and actor but has never taken this step.
</P>
<P>
   He works with Josh Dempsey, Everton Davis and Alfred Ankama,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like helping people,'' said Shields, who's busy with his
other projects. ``And boxing is just something I can do in my
sleep. It's easy to work with these guys.''

GORE REJECTED CIA EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the CIA uncovered what its analysts considered
to be conclusive evidence of the personal corruption of Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia in 1995, they sent it to the
White House, expecting Clinton administration officials to be
impressed with their work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when the secret CIA report on Chernomyrdin arrived in
the office of Vice President Al Gore, it was rejected and sent back
to the CIA with a barnyard epithet scrawled across its cover,
according to several intelligence officials familiar with the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   At CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., the message seemed clear:
The vice president did not want to hear allegations that
Chernomyrdin was corrupt and was not interested in further
intelligence reports on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, CIA analysts say they are now censoring themselves.
When, for instance, the agency found that it cost a German business
executive $1 million just to get a meeting with Chernomyrdin to
discuss deals in Russia, it decided not to circulate the report
outside the CIA, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who held regular talks with Chernomyrdin that became an
important channel for relations with Russia, declined to comment on
the handling of the report. ``I never discuss top-secret
documents,'' Gore said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a senior aide to Gore said his office always wants more
intelligence, not less. ``The real attitude around here about
intelligence is, can't do business without it,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the lesson learned at the CIA. The incident has
fostered a perception in the agency's ranks that the administration
is dismissive of ``inconvenient'' intelligence about corruption
among the Russian leaders with whom White House and State
Department officials have developed close personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   These complaints seem unrealistic to the White House and foreign
policy officials who insist that they could not allow allegations
of corruption to deter them from working with the Russian
leadership on a range of issues, from curbing the spread of weapons
to increasing U.S. trade with Russia. Some add that making
corruption among the Russian leadership a high priority would be a
losing battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does the CIA want us to do, not deal with the prime
minister of Russia?'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   This disagreement between the CIA and the White House has flared
during Russia's economic crisis, and CIA officials argue that the
White House should be more interested in unvarnished information
about corruption in Moscow, especially as the United States and
other nations were trying to determine whether Russia deserved
billions more in Western aid money.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, these critics say the administration seems willing to
try to deal with the crisis with one eye closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never want to hear this stuff,'' complained an
intelligence official who asked not to be identified. Another said:
``They don't ignore it. But they don't want to have to act on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senior administration officials acknowledged in
interviews that they had received a number of reports from the CIA
alleging corruption by Chernomyrdin, who was ousted as prime
minister in March and made an unsuccessful bid to return to the
post this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also say the agency has submitted many other reports
alleging corruption among other senior Russian leaders, including
Anatoly Chubais, who until recently was considered by
administration officials to be one of their closest and most
important Russian allies on economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration officials contend that the CIA reports
never contained enough evidence to prompt them to distance
themselves from Chernomyrdin, Chubais or other senior Russian
officials who had become important counterparts in diplomatic and
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several administration officials were dismissive of the
CIA reports, saying they were often inconclusive and thinly
sourced. Those officials also said that they had frequently asked
the CIA for more conclusive proof, but that the agency never
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, they have never presented us with a smoking
gun,'' an administration official said. ``I would describe some of
the agency's material as being in the realm of rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials counter that the administration established
impossibly high standards of proof to make it easier for the White
House and State Department officials to dismiss their reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have expected something no one in the
intelligence community could provide _ judicial burden of proof,''
an agency official said. ``Did we have an authenticated videotape
of the person actually receiving a bribe? No. But reporting from
established, reliable sources was written off as `vague and
unsubstantiated.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Agency analysts refused to describe much of the classified
evidence they provided to the administration against Chernomyrdin
and Chubais. But they insisted that it was more detailed and
conclusive than allegations of bribery and insider dealing that
have been made in the Russian media and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Andrei Trapeznikov, a spokesman for Chubais in
Moscow, complained that if the CIA had evidence against Chubais,
the agency should make it public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have something, they should tell it officially,'' said
Trapeznikov, head of press relations for Unified Energy Systems,
the Moscow company where Chubais is now president. ``We haven't
seen these reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that administration officials had been dismissive of much
of the CIA reporting, Trapeznikov said, ``I think that shows the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was unavailable for comment, and his staff refused
to discuss the matter when reached in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The administration never even paid much attention to the many
allegations that have been made publicly against both men over the
last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais, unpopular in Russia for his management of the economic
reforms, was ousted from the Yeltsin government for a time last
year after reports that he and four other government officials had
each accepted $90,000 in advances for a proposed book on the
country's privatization efforts. The publisher was partly owned by
a bank that had made several successful bids in privatization
sales.
</P>
<P>
   The privatization program itself has also been at the center of
charges of insider dealing benefiting a handful of the new Russian
oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin, the former head of Russia's huge
natural-gas monopoly, Gazprom, has been publicly accused of using
his influence over Gazprom's privatization program to make himself
one of the country's richest men. His personal fortune has been
estimated to be as high as $5 billion, his Russian critics have
said.

FANNING FLAMES IN HEATED POLL DEBATE

<TEXT>
<P>
   To really take this Bowl Championship Series formula to the next
level, someone back at mission control should factor in the results
from the Internet's top two weekly fan polls on ESPN.com and CBS
SportsLine.
</P>
<P>
   They've got to be as legit as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   In order to preserve the integrity of its poll by using software
that eliminates duplicate votes _ thus preventing ballot-stuffing _
voting on the ESPN.com poll
(http://ESPN.SportsZone.com/interact/chat/fanpollrank.html) runs
Sunday night to Tuesday morning, and the results are posted by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Going into last Saturday's games,Kansas State had replaced
Tennessee as the new No. 1 in this cyber survey with 4,602
first-place votes
(http://ESPN.SportsZone.com/interact/polls/ncffanpoll.html). UCLA
checked in at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS SportsLine poll accepts Shockwave, Java or HTML ballots
between Saturday night and Thursday morning (http://
ww1.sportsline.com/u/football/ college/polls/fanpoll.htm), with the
results available Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's poll (http:// ww3.sportsline.com/u/contests/
entries/fanpoll.htm) closer resembled the BCA poll, as Tennessee
had a 447-point lead at No. 1 over UCLA, with Kansas State third.
</P>
<P>
   For a comparative chuckle, check out the poll at the USA Today
site (http://survey.usatoday.com/survey/fanvot.html), which permits
just one vote for No. 1 (instead of the full 25 slots) plus
requires giving up an e-mail address (no doubt for future spam)
before the ballot counts. Updated every minute, the poll had UCLA
10th as of Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, gussied-up versions of the Associated Press' writers'
poll (http://www.aptop25.com) and the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll
(http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/sfc/sfcpusa.htm) are
around for reference. Or debate.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Mike DeSimone of Clarksboro, N.J., who uses
mathematical algorithms to figure out his No. 1-to-112 poll at his
site (http://www.algorithms.com/users/desimone/top25.htm). His top
pick?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you do the math.

RANCOR RULES OUT PROGRESS AT PEACE TALKS IN MEXICO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ After exchanging angry
invective for two days, mediators from the Mexican Congress and top
leaders of the Zapatista rebels managed Sunday to salvage some
semblance of peace talks, but only barely.
</P>
<P>
   What was perhaps most striking about the disastrous meeting _
the first such face-to-face encounter in nearly two years _ was
that the Zapatistas seemed to have lost their touch for media
showmanship and public diplomacy on behalf of their Indian cause.
</P>
<P>
   Zapatista commanders had said that they had finally reached out
to the mediating legislators, federal senators and deputies who are
members of the Concord and Pacification Commission, to demonstrate
a renewed commitment to a peace dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But the 29 Zapatista delegates, led by a fierce commander who
goes by the nom de guerre of Tacho, surprised the legislators with
a flurry of last-minute logistical demands. The Zapatistas refused
to discuss the problems with the lawmakers privately and then
called them racist in front of 2,500 cheering supporters gathered
here for a parallel Zapatista meeting.
</P>
<P>
   One legislator said that Tacho had told them he did not want to
listen to their comments because they were ``pure saliva.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas, rough-hewn Indian guerrillas who have lived
hidden in harsh jungles since they staged a weeklong armed uprising
in January 1994, gave the impression that they were dissatisfied
mainly because their fax machine was not working and they were not
given mattresses for their cots.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators responded late Saturday night with a five-page
communique in which they rejected the Zapatistas' complaints in
blunt terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not your enemies _ you did not declare war on us,''
said the legislators, who are serving only as neutral go-betweens
for the rebels and the government.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers accused the Zapatistas of showing no interest in
peace. In an ultimatum, they said if they did not get more
respectful treatment from the rebels, ``We are at your disposal to
take you back to the places where you came from.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end mediators and rebels agreed to get together again
late Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas released a communique Saturday morning in which
they said, as they have before, that they would not return to
direct peace talks until the government meets five broad
conditions, including army withdrawal from Zapatista areas and
freeing of political prisoners. The government has not accepted the
conditions in the two years since the negotiations fell apart.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even some of the Zapatistas' most loyal supporters said they
were dismayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't insult someone and then say it was all right because
that is the Indian way,'' commented Carlos Monsivais, a prominent
writer and social critic, who is attending the meetings here.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommander Marcos, a non-Indian who is the Zapatistas' de
facto leader, did not come to the sessions here, but instead sent
an audio recording in which he railed against the globalization of
the world economy but offered no concrete peace proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic debacle overshadowed substantial progress the
Zapatistas made in the strategy sessions with their followers here.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that they are continuing to shape themselves into a
civilian political group in preparation for one day laying down
arms, they organized their sympathizers to mount a nationwide
mobilization sometime next year to publicize their platform for
greater Indian independence.

COMMENTARY: JUDICIARY'S JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the House Judiciary Committee, Ken Starr
succeeded in documenting the president's premeditated series of
perjuries. Even The New York Times, in favoring censure over
impeachment, referred to Bill Clinton's ``habitual mendacity'' (a
phrase nicer than, but little different from, my old ``congenital
liar'').
</P>
<P>
   Starr failed to tie the persistent presidential prevarication in
the Lewinsky affair to five years of stonewalling in Whitewater,
Travelgate and Filegate. Belatedly, he announced his inability to
find presidential involvement in what some of us still consider
White House abuses, permitting Barney Frank rightly to demand to
know why that was not made public before the recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   Starr should promptly submit, and the court release, the
suppressed reports on those investigations. Let's see who is
``exonerated,'' lest the next Republican president's staff follow
Clinton precedent to flip through the FBI files of 900 troublesome
Democrats, and to use the Justice Department to clear the decks for
patronage.
</P>
<P>
   What should Henry Hyde's Judiciary do now?
</P>
<P>
   First, forget about any help from Starr. His Whitewater
indictment of Web Hubbell is two years too late. Sam Dash's
last-minute stab in the back declared Starr an outlaw for daring to
defend the report Dash approved, but Watergate Sam was right about
this: In impeachment inquiries, Congress cannot rely exclusively on
outside investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Next, accept that impeachment cannot succeed solely for lying
under oath about sex. We had an election about that and Clinton
won. Even if Kathleen Willey could produce DNA evidence of
harassment, Clinton has established his droit du seigneur and most
voters think lying about it to a grand jury is no high crime.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, focus on what is surely a high crime: stealing an
election. For two years, Clinton Justice has ducked prosecution of
Clinton's ``Asian connection.'' That multimillion-dollar illegal
overseas fund-raising scheme financed Clinton's comeback
advertising blitz and was accompanied by a flip-flop in his China
trade policy. Starr gave immunity to John Huang, the middleman, but
wants to know only about hushing up Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, the dithering Attorney General Reno will decide
whether to ask for an independent counsel to investigate
fund-raising by Al Gore, Harold Ickes and _ for decision by Dec. 7
_ by Clinton himself.
</P>
<P>
   Will that date again live in infamy? Probably; Reno has already
refused to show Congress unedited internal memos of protest by FBI
Director Louis Freeh and prosecutor Charles La Bella. Both
professional investigators are convinced Justice bureaucrats are
hopelessly conflicted in going after their chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee should demand that the president order
his attorney general to produce those and related documents
forthwith and in full, including La Bella's addenda. If he or Reno
refuses, such contempt of Congress should be an impeachment count.
</P>
<P>
   But the impeachment inquiry must not abdicate its own
responsibility even in the unlikely event an independent counsel is
appointed to dig into the Asian connection. Getting the truth is
more important than punishing secondary culprits. Hyde &AMP; Co. should
follow the Dash constitutional doctrine: investigate by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Call Huang, Charlie Trie, Bruce Lindsey, Johnny Chung and Mark
Middleton. To save months, draft La Bella as special counsel. Plug
into the top-secret report being prepared by the House's Select
Committee on Chinagate, headed by the tight-lipped Chris Cox. If
Chinese intelligence is identified as a source of funds, then
Judiciary must know it before making impeachment judgments.
</P>
<P>
   History will hold all members, Democrats included, to account.
Where is it written that this inquiry must be finished by this
lame-duck Congress? The nation has no need more vital than to
protect its electoral process _ a job that conflicted Reno Justice
has botched and that cannot wait for the years it would take a new
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   A serious impeachment inquiry would reach beyond perjury to
inquire into the high crime that has been staring us all in the
face. That is the White House solicitation of illegal funds from
foreign sources, and the use of that dirty money to steal the 1996
presidential election. (BOX)

MOMA SHUTS ITS DOORS ON `SUNDAY MORNING'  
 NEWS HERE, FISH WRAP THERE  
 `60 MINUTES' AND THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is not an abstract dispute. But it is one that
might well bestir the spirit of William Paley.
</P>
<P>
   The late Paley, founder of CBS and a one-time chairman of the
Museum of Modern Art, might be upset to learn that when Morley
Safer, co-editor of ``60 Minutes,'' approached officials at MOMA
earlier this month about doing a segment for the network's ``Sunday
Morning'' show on the widely acclaimed Jackson Pollack
retrospective exhibit, he was turned down flat.
</P>
<P>
   MOMA's director, Glenn Lowry, explained in an interview why he
said no to Safer, one of the network's most celebrated journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get hundreds of requests from serious journalists to do
pieces on MOMA and its exhibits,'' Lowry said. ``We went with them
rather than someone who does drive-by shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Safer had once opined on ``60 Minutes'' that most
contemporary art was ``worthless junk.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he characterized his conversation with Lowry as ``strong
but civil.''
</P>
<P>
   But Safer added: ``I've never been brutalized by a museum
director like this. I think it's revenge for my earlier pieces,
none of which involved the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained fairly carefully what I wanted to do with the
broadcast,'' he continued. ``Given the fact that Pollack is a
difficult artist to understand, I said it would be useful for Kurt
Varnedoe, the show's director, to explain the artist's work. He
said that's fine, but not with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Safer, who described MOMA as a ``humorless Comintern of
contemporary art,'' was nevertheless amused at Lowry's
characterization of his take on the subject. ``Actually, the first
contemporary art piece I did, which aired on `60 Minutes' in 1993,
was more like a sniping than a drive-by shooting,'' he said.
``Still, that's a pretty good one for a museum director.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sunday Morning'' audience won't be there, but the Pollack
show, which closes Feb. 2, won't lack television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 shows have already been shown or been shot on the
exhibit, including segments on CNN, ``The News Hour With Jim
Lehrer,'' ``The Charlie Rose Show'' and the BBC, said a MOMA
spokesman, who insisted on anonymity. And discussions with two
other networks are in the detail stage, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Highs and Lows of Newspaper Readers
</P>
<P>
   Are adults living in the Wilkes-Barre-Scranton, Pa., area better
read than most other people? They are when it comes to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the finding of a recent study by the Newspaper
Association of America, an industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The study, of the 50 largest media markets, was based on data
collected by Scarborough Research Corp. It found that about 70
percent of adults in Wilkes-Barre and Scranton read a daily
newspaper, the highest rate of any area surveyed. That was followed
by 69 percent in Boston, 68 percent in Hartford and New Haven,
Conn., 67 percent in Cleveland and 66 percent in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Two areas were tied for the greatest percentage of Sunday
newspaper readers: Tampa-St. Petersburg-Sarasota, Fla., and West
Palm Beach, Fla., both with 80 percent. They were followed by
Cleveland (79 percent), Hartford and New Haven (78 percent), and
Providence (77 percent).
</P>
<P>
   New York City ranked eighth in daily readership, with 65
percent, and ninth on Sundays, with 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And where is it that the local newspaper has the greatest chance
of ending up as fish wrapper? Nashville, Tenn., and Atlanta, where
only 44 percent read a daily newspaper; Houston (46 percent); San
Antonio (47 percent) and Memphis, Tenn. (47 percent).
</P>
<P>
   John Sturm, president and chief executive of the Newspaper
Association of America, gave no grand theories to explain why some
markets were more newspaper friendly than others, but he said there
were factors that helped explain why particular areas had higher
rates of readership than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilkes-Barre is a two-paper market,'' he said. ``They are very
competitive.'' The high concentration of colleges in the Boston
area helps explain its high readership, he said, while West Palm
Beach's ranking was largely tied to its sizable community of
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   _ DYLAN LOEB MCCLAIN &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Judgment Call
</P>
<P>
   Timeout: Referee's decision needed. Has the addition of National
Football League games to CBS' Sunday schedule helped ``60
Minutes,'' the news magazine institution that follows football on
Sunday evenings? Or hurt it?
</P>
<P>
   When CBS agreed last January to pay $500 million a year to
rejoin the ranks of networks carrying NFL games, network executives
predicted that the huge football audiences would help the whole
network's Nielsen ratings, especially those of ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet ratings for ``60 Minutes'' are down 3 percent for the first
eight weeks of the television season, compared with last season.
And part of the reason, CBS News executives say, is that NFL games
have three times run long past the normal 7 p.m. starting time for
``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as CBS' sales department is quick to point
out, the ``60 Minutes'' ratings are up 8 percent among men aged 18
to 49 compared with last year, and up 11 percent among men aged 25
to 54 _ two categories for which advertisers pay a premium price.
So football has not penalized ``60 Minutes'' in terms of revenue
the program can earn. ``To people who keep score in these things,
getting those increases in male viewers is certainly a plus,'' said
Kevin Tedesco, the program's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers for ``60 Minutes'' and CBS' other news magazine,
``48 Hours,'' look better against the competition. ``48 Hours,''
which competes against NBC's hit drama ``ER'' on Thursday nights at
10, is nonetheless the only news magazine to show gains in its
Nielsen ratings this season. Its numbers are up 14 percent.
</P>

   The other news magazines _ four editions of ``Dateline'' on NBC,
and two of ``20/20'' on ABC _ are all down from last season. Friday
night's ``Dateline'' is down 26 percent in households; Tuesday's 24
percent, compared with the first eight weeks of last season. The
``20/20'' household ratings are down 10 percent on Wednesdays
(where last season it was ``Prime Time Live'') and 11 percent on
Fridays.

SIDEWAYS GLANCE: WAKE UP THE ECHOES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Revisionist history being in vogue, author Steve Delsohn has
given those who created the Notre Dame football legacy a chance to
tell it like it is.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, what they remember of it.
</P>
<P>
   In a book USC fans should take a look at to understand better
this week's enemy, ``Talking Irish: The Oral History of Notre Dame
Football'' ($24, Avon Books, 400 pages) covers the last six decades
of South Bend lore primarily through the words of those who coached
and played there.
</P>
<P>
   Delsohn, a Thousand Oaks resident who grew up in Chicago,
tracked down nearly 150 people over two years trying to extract
anecdotes and clarify stories that have been passed down through
the years by journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tidbits are classics in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Heisman Trophy-winning tailback John Lattner remembers the
importance of the Irish's trip to L.A. in 1951 _ they pulled off a
19-12 upset over Frank Gifford and the Trojans in the first game
ever televised coast-to-coast. But what Lattner remembers most is
how he and some teammates sneaked off to RKO studios to meet
Marilyn Monroe on the set of ``Clash By Night.''
</P>
<P>
   As one would expect, USC-Notre Dame clashes are vividly recalled
through the book. Ara Parseghian is still fuming about the 1964
loss at the Coliseum, where he insists his 9-0 team was jobbed. And
in the 1973 meeting in South Bend _ the year after Anthony Davis'
six-TD performance _ freshman defensive ends Willie Fry and Luther
Bradley recall how on the first play of that game, Bradley hit Lynn
Swann so hard Swann's helmet flew off after he caught a short pass
from Pat Haden.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday afternoon (before that game), Southern Cal showed
up,'' says Bradley. ``They were the only guys all season who walked
through our campus. They strolled for an hour or so with their
little red blazers on. They looked like they owned the place. That
kind of pissed us off.''
</P>
<P>
   For diehard Domers, Delsohn reveals more behind the cryptic
departure/firings of Frank Leahy and Lou Holtz that, at the time,
were both passed off as health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a pattern at the school that, whenever there is a
coaching change, whatever is printed in the papers at the time is
only a fraction of what's going on,'' Delsohn said.
</P>
<P>
   The title semantics aside _ how can you have an ORAL history if
it's all written down in a !ital!book? _ this leaves readers
thursting to actually hear these people give their stories. If
reading them is the next best thing, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: Why isn't there an oral history of USC
available?

   NEW YORK _ After a weekend of digesting each other's proposals,
internal negotiating teams from the National Basketball Association
and the players association are scheduled to meet on Monday or
Tuesday in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were encouraged after Friday's 10-hour bargaining
session, in which the players and the owners made compromises on
key economic issues. However, both sides wanted to take some time
to review their positions before continuing talks.
</P>
<P>
   The next discussions are expected to be conducted by a smaller
number of representatives, including NBA Commissioner David Stern
and Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik, the union's executive
director, Billy Hunter, and the union president, Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   While Granik said the Thanksgiving holiday would not be an
impediment to a full bargaining session, both sides were concerned
about bringing their full negotiation committees to New York before
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly five-month-old lockout was in its 145th day on
Sunday. With six weeks stricken from the schedule, the earliest the
season could start would be late December.

AMERICAN-MADE SATELLITE TO OFFER UNCENSORED TV IN RUSSIA

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ A communications satellite that will beam
the first uncensored television programs into western Russia and
Siberia began orbiting the earth on Sunday after being sent into
space atop an unmanned Delta 2 rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. launched the $150 million project after three
days of technical delays for Hughes Space and Communications Co. of
Los Angeles, which built the satellite and a ground station for a
private media group in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unusual moment,'' Vladimir Goussinsky, chairman of
Media Most, the Moscow company, said through an interpreter on
Thursday, the day the rocket was scheduled to lift off. ``I would
dare to call it quite a revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-story rocket remained on the launching pad for three days
while workers replaced a fuel-level sensor, resolved data relay
problems with the satellite and removed a safety railing mistakenly
left in place around the rocket's main engine. The rocket was
finally airborne at 6:54 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 74 minutes later, the rocket released the barrel-shaped,
26-foot-tall satellite into orbit 801 miles above the earth. The
spacecraft will remain there for six days before a motor lifts it
to its working spot about 23,000 miles above Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Named after the Media Most subsidiary responsible for its
operation, the satellite, BONUM-1, is the first Russian satellite
to be manufactured and launched in the United States. It also is
the first privately owned Russian satellite and the first not
subject to military or government control. Early next year, after
its operating systems are inspected, the satellite is expected to
begin broadcasting 50 channels of news, movies, sports and
children's shows into homes equipped with small receiving dishes.
None of the foreign or domestic programs will be reviewed by
censors for the state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The system has 200,000 potential subscribers in western Russia
and among Russian speakers in Israel, according to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The launching reflected ``the global nature of our industry,''
Darryl Van Dorn, Boeing's manager of commercial Delta flights, said
in a statement. ``Nearly half of our launches next year are for
international commercial communications companies. The vast
majority of our business is providing launch services to satisfy
the world's hunger for information services.''

DAVIES SHUNS `IDIOT'S GRIN' FOR RADIANT SMILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It was an impressive victory, and for Laura Davies
it was a relief.
</P>
<P>
   Ending a 20-month victory drought on the LPGA tour, Davies, who
led from wire to wire, captured the PageNet Tour Championship on
Sunday by four strokes over Brandie Burton, Pat Hurst and Karrie
Webb at the Desert Inn Golf Club. Shooting a 3-under-par 69, Davies
finished at 11-under 277 for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's top players for most of this decade, Davies
has been plagued by putting problems for 18 months. After
Saturday's round of 75, which included 38 putts, Davies wondered
whether she had the confidence to finish the job. But instead of
folding, Davies flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day with a 2-stroke advantage over Meg Mallon,
Davies never lost the lead. And when Hurst, who shot a 70, pulled
within one stroke, Davies answered with a key birdie at the par-5,
471-yard No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, Davies never led by fewer than two strokes. And
after ending the tournament in style, making a 6-foot putt for
birdie on the final hole, she finally smiled for one of the few
times all day.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she had not smiled earlier, Davies gave one of her
typically candid answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to walk around all day with an idiot's grin on
your face,'' said Davies, a 35-year-old native of England. ``I
didn't want to smile. I wanted to win. I've never been so nervous.
This is the hardest I've ever fought for a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's other big winner was Annika Sorenstam, who finished the
year with a scoring average of 69.99, becoming the first LPGA
player to end the year with a scoring average of less than 70.
Sorenstam needed a 72 on Sunday for the record, and that was
exactly what she shot, finishing at even-par 288 for the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Sorenstam swept the top three LPGA awards for the
year: the money title ($1,092,748), the player of the year award
and the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam also captured those honors in 1995, but she was
particularly pleased with Sunday's performance because she was
admittedly nervous on the back nine after a bogey at No. 12 left
her at 2 over par. But Sorenstam birdied No. 13 and then made a
crucial eagle on the par-5 No. 15, hitting a beautiful 7-wood shot
from 215 yards that landed 12 feet from the cup, followed by a
solid putt.
</P>
<P>
   After consecutive pars, Sorenstam reached the 18th tee knowing
that all she needed was a bogey or better for the scoring record.
She reached the green in two shots, left a 25-foot putt 5 feet
short and missed the putt for par, but tapped in for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   The record belonged to Sorenstam, who has lowered her scoring in
each of her five seasons on tour. And at age 28, with three money
titles already, the best for Sorenstam may be yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a burden on my shoulders that I really wanted to
achieve,'' Sorenstam said of the record. ``It has been a tough week
in that sense. Now that it's over, it's a dream come true. It's
going to be tougher to keep lowering my average, but my goal is
always to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   For Davies, her performance on the par-5 holes was the key to
victory. The LPGA's longest hitter, Davies shot a cumulative 12
under par on those holes for the tournament, including three
eagles, and reached most of the par-5 greens in two shots. Davies
used length off the tee and accuracy with her approach shots to
take pressure off her putter.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, Dale Eggeling and Betsy King had Sunday's best rounds,
at 67, while Webb also made a charge with a 68. But it was too late
to catch Davies, who built her lead by shooting a 66 on Thursday,
followed by a 67 on Friday. By winning the season-ending
tournament, which featured the tour's top 30 money winners, Davies
gave herself a confidence boost for 1999 and ended the year No. 11
on the money list.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``When you go months without winning and you're supposedly one
of the top players in the world, you wonder if you'll ever win
again,'' Davies said. ``That's a slump. I was almost afraid to
think about winning today. Maybe this is a springboard. Maybe now I
can stop whining about my putting and realize that if I play solid
golf, I can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies used a new putter this week, but when asked how long she
would keep it, Davies said, ``Maybe a week.''
</P>
<P>
   But the memories of victory would last a lot longer. Davies
enjoys gambling, but she will remember this trip to Las Vegas for
the golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to gamble, but I never win,'' Davies said. ``This is
the first time I've left Las Vegas a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   The tour championship ended the official LPGA season. The top
five money winners were ANNIKA SORENSTAM ($1,092,748), SE RI PAK
($872,170), DONNA ANDREWS ($715,428), KARRIE WEBB ($704,477) and
LISELOTTE NEUMANN ($665,069). ... MEG MALLON, who began the day in
second place, shot a 75 and finished 10th.

DEVILS SAVOR GOAL RUSH AGAINST HURRICANES

   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Five goals is almost a week's worth of
production for the Devils, so no one could blame the team for
celebrating in the dressing room after a 5-2 victory over the
Carolina Hurricanes on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best team effort this year by far,'' Bobby Holik
said after the Devils scored three goals in the third period in
their most productive performance of the season. ``Everyone
contributed. We went after them from the start, and we knew what we
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Holik scored the Devils' second goal, giving them the lead, and
Jay Pandolfo, Randy McKay, Denis Pederson and Scott Stevens also
had goals. The Devils have lost only once in their last six games
and improved to 11-6-1, putting them on top of the Atlantic
Division standing.
</P>
<P>
   Holik, Coach Robbie Ftorek and other players said it was
important that the Devils skated away with a victory in the first
of five straight games on the road. The team will continue on to
Dallas, Phoenix and Denver this week before concluding the trip in
Washington on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to get a `W' in the first game on the road,''
Ftorek said. ``The guys are working hard and shooting the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Holik and Stevens worked perhaps the hardest and were the most
effective players for the Devils _ Holik for banging people against
the boards all afternoon, and Stevens for his confrontations with
Keith Primeau, the captain of the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like his elbow,'' Stevens said of Primeau. ``It
bothers me when you get an elbow on the power play and it's not
called. I was upset. I don't understand why a guy 6-4 has to use
his elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Both benches must have noticed the physical and verbal
confrontations between the two captains. Stevens came out with the
final blow, scoring an empty-net goal with Primeau on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to punish a guy with an empty-netter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens earned his 300th assist for the Devils on a goal by
Holik, who gave Stevens plenty of credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott pinched in well, and I was able to outmuscle the
defenseman,'' Holik said of his third goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Holik's performance was highlighted by a hit on Ron Francis
that angered the Hurricanes. ``I felt I needed to get more
involved,'' Holik said. ``If everyone on their bench is after me,
it means I'm playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Holik's goal gave the Devils a 2-1 lead after Carolina's Ray
Sheppard had opened the scoring early in the first and Pandolfo had
tied it with his fifth goal early in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Emerson tied the score for the Hurricanes 2 minutes 22
seconds into the third, before McKay scored his fifth goal of the
season just over four minutes later by flipping a back-hander from
the slot. Pederson extended the lead with a 25-foot shot past
Arturs Irbe at 11:43. Stevens sealed the victory with six seconds
left after the Hurricanes pulled goaltender Irbe for an extra
attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Irbe faced 39 shots and could not be blamed for any of the
goals. The Devils' Martin Brodeur faced 28 shots.

LONNIE PITCHFORD, DELTA BLUES MUSICIAN, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lonnie Pitchford, a Mississippi bluesman who was dedicated to
reviving early Delta blues, died on Nov. 8 at his home in
Lexington, Miss. He was 43.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia complications, said his manager, Patty
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchford performed around the world and appeared regularly in
New York, often in concerts presented by the World Music Institute.
He played the diddley-bow, a one-stringed instrument he would
assemble onstage from a two-by-four, two nails, broom wire and a
crushed snuff can. Using a dime as a slide, he would play driving,
wailing blues lines.
</P>
<P>
   He also played guitar and occasionally piano, singing classic
Delta blues with a pensive, haunted voice.
</P>
<P>
   The diddley-bow was Pitchford's first instrument, made from
baling wire nailed to the side of his family's house in rural
Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   He sang in the church from childhood on and learned to play
piano; he was 12 when he began sharing a guitar with his four
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchford learned traditional Delta blues from Eugene Powell
(who had played with the Mississippi Sheiks in the 1930s) and from
Robert Junior Lockwood, whose stepfather was Robert Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchford's wife, Minnie, is the daughter of Elmore James'
girlfriend, and Pitchford learned some Elmore James songs that had
been left with his mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   He began performing outside Mississippi as a teen-ager,
appearing at the Smithsonian Institution's Festival of American
Folklife from 1972 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1990s he had toured in Europe and Australia as well as
the United States. When not on the road, he worked as a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in the documentaries ``The Land Where the Blues
Began'' (1980) and ``Deep Blues'' (1992), and was recorded for five
blues anthologies before he made his first solo album, ``All Around
Man,'' for Rooster Blues Records in 1994. He was working on an
album for Mississippi Crossroads Music. He also made an album with
the New Africa String Band, which included Powell and Big Jack
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchford is survived by his wife; his mother, Rosie Pitchford;
two sisters, Ersine Hodges and Brenda Jones, and four brothers,
Willie Douglas, Andrew James, Edward Charles and Roosevelt, all of
Mississippi.  &QL;

EDWIGE FEUILLERE, 91, FRENCH ACTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Edwige Feuillere, a much-loved French actress whose
60-year career took her from sensual screen beauty to grande dame
of the Paris theater, died here on Nov. 13. She was 91 and lived in
Paris. She was buried on Wednesday in a family tomb at Beaugency,
near Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feuillere first gained renown in 1935 when, shockingly for
the time, she briefly appeared naked in Abel Gance's film ``Lucrece
Borgia.'' And it was as a femme fatale that she achieved her
greatest stage triumph, playing opposite Jean-Louis Barrault in
Paul Claudel's ``Partage de Midi'' in 1947. But she was also
frequently acclaimed for her interpretation of classical roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edwige Feuillere was our Marlene Dietrich, our Irene Dunne and
our Greta Garbo, all in one,'' Le Monde wrote after her death. She
retired from the stage only six years ago after a final production
in which she read from her best-known roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people can only see me as a very old person who had a
mythical life,'' she said in a recent interview with a French
writer. ``Ah, if only you had seen her when she was.'' She
continued: ``Well, I'd like people to remember me for my best
moment. But it could be when I was 25 or 50 or 70 or in my very
last show.''
</P>
<P>
   Her death, which prompted a wave of tributes from French
political and cultural figures, came less than one week after that
of Jean Marais, the handsome, swashbuckling French actor who played
opposite Ms. Feuillere in Jean Cocteau's 1947 film ``L'Aigle a Deux
Tetes.'' Cocteau had created the role for her, and she first
created it onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Stunningly beautiful in her youth, gracefully elegant in old
age, Ms. Feuillere was remembered as much for her powerful
well-modulated voice as for her expressive eyes and magnetic
presence. Yet for all her popularity, she showed little interest in
a glamorous lifestyle. Modest and humorous in private, she was also
self-deprecating about her talent in her 1977 autobiography, ``Les
Feux de la Memoire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feuillere was born Edwige Caroline Cunati on Oct. 29, 1907,
in the town of Vesoul in eastern France. Her mother's family,
originally from Alsace, had moved back to France after Germany
occupied the region in the 1870 Franco-Prussian war. Her father was
Italian and, because he was drafted by the Italian army in World
War I, Edwige spent much of her childhood in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the family moved to Dijon in France where she
showed interest in the theater by acting in school plays. In 1928
she began attending the Paris Conservatory of Dramatic Arts, and
two years later she married a fellow student, Pierre Feuillere,
although the marriage soon floundered because of his drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feuillere's career _ she first used the stage name of Cora
Lynn before taking her husband's name _ began slowly with small
parts in several mediocre films, although she is remembered for her
lead role in the film version of Marcel Pagnol's play ``Topaze.''
She also found work in the theater and was invited to join the
Comedie Francaise, but she left after two years, complaining that
she was being overlooked for major roles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, she was cast as Marguerite Gautier in Alexandre Dumas'
play ``La Dame aux Camelias,'' and she at last won recognition as a
serious stage actor. At the time, the play's director, Jacques
Hebertot, predicted, ``You will carry this role throughout your
life, a slave to the success it will bring you.'' And he was right:
She appeared in frequent revivals _ in France and Britain _ for the
next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   During Germany's occupation of France in World War II, Ms.
Feuillere worked in the theater (she helped discover Gerard Philipe
in Jean Giraudoux's ``Sodome et Gomorrhe'') and in films (notably
in Jacques de Baroncelli's 1941 ``Duchesse de Langeais'').
</P>
<P>
   After the war, she appeared in 200 performances of ``L'Aigle a
Deux Tetes'' before taking on another major role, which she would
also perform again and again, as Yse in ``Partage de Midi.'' When
she appeared in the role in London in 1968, the British theater
critic Harold Hobson described her as the greatest actress he had
ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Although she played an old woman in Patrice Chereau's 1974 film
``La Chair de l'Orchide,'' she virtually abandoned the cinema after
1960. But she remained a pillar of the French theater, occasionally
appearing onstage with her old movie partner Jean Marais, seven
years her junior. In 1965, she created the lead role in Giraudoux's
``Madwoman of Chaillot'' and returned to the play on several
subsequent occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feuillere had no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   She first announced her retirement in 1984, but promptly changed
her mind and appeared frequently onstage throughout the 1980s.
Finally, on the eve of her 85th birthday, she did retire. ``I have
died so many times onstage,'' she said recently. ``My own will
arrive one day, probably sooner than I expect.''

 FREDERICK WILKINSON Jr. , 77, EXECUTIVE AT MACY'S  
(sw) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick D. Wilkinson Jr., one of the first black executives at
Macy's, the City of New York and, later, at the American Express
Co., died at Mount Vernon Hospital in Mount Vernon, N.Y., on Nov.
15. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lung cancer, according to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1921 in Washington, Wilkinson graduated in 1942 from
Howard University, where his father was the registrar. He served in
the Army for four years and was discharged as a captain. He
graduated with distinction from Harvard Business School in 1948
and, upon graduation, joined Macy's in the company's executive
training program.
</P>
<P>
   In a 26-year career at Macy's, Wilkinson had a series of jobs,
starting as an assistant buyer and later overseeing buying in
Europe and Asia. He negotiated merchandise purchases throughout the
world, from Israel to Italy, from Germany to Macao. In 1968, he
became the manager of the Macy's store in the borough of Queens,
and later he became the first black to serve as a vice president
for the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Mayor Abraham Beame appointed Wilkinson to be executive
officer for passenger services for the New York City Transit
Authority. He later became executive officer for surface transit
with operating responsibilities for the bus system in the five
boroughs. In these positions, Wilkinson had operating
responsibility over 13,400 employees and 4,550 buses.
</P>
<P>
   In an obituary that Wilkinson had written about himself shortly
before his death, he said he had ``eschewed the role as spokesman
for minority causes'' because he could not meet the conflicting
``bottom-line demands'' of his job and being a spokesman for his
race. He said he chose to work ``behind the scenes offering advice
and guidance to those who needed it, but never interceding with an
employer.''
</P>
<P>
   For 24 years, Wilkinson was a trustee and national treasurer of
the National Urban League, and he worked to bring information about
jobs in corporate America to students at traditionally black
colleges. For 20 years, he was a Sunday school teacher in the South
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson wrote that he ``took pride in being a pioneer who
simply wouldn't let his race stop him from moving up the corporate
ladder _ and, in the process, opening doors for others whom he
showed it could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson joined American Express in 1977 as a marketing vice
president in the travel-related services division. By the time he
retired in 1993, he had been promoted to senior vice president for
worldwide communications.
</P>
<P>
   He was also active in a variety of volunteer programs, including
serving as acting chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority
Inspector General's Advisory Board, as a life overseer at Cornell
Medical College and as a member of the board of overseers at the
Brookdale Center of Aging at Hunter College in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson is survived by his wife of 53 years, Jeane, of Mount
Vernon; two daughters, Sharon, the U.S. ambassador to Burkina Faso,
and Dayna, of Reston, Va.; and one son, Frederick D. III, of Los
Angeles.

UCLA WILL NOW CHEER USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At 3:54 p.m. Saturday, seconds after defeating USC
34-17 in the Rose Bowl, UCLA became the Trojans' biggest fan.
</P>
<P>
   Six words best describe the Bruins' national championship hopes:
</P>
<P>
   Go SC.
</P>
<P>
   Go Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Go Miami.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Bowl Championship Series chase has come to. The
Bruins (10-0, 8-0) are expected to maintain a tenuous hold on
second place when the BCS rankings are released this afternoon. But
their lead over Kansas State probably will drop from .74 (last
week) to about .35 this week.
</P>
<P>
   Idle until the Dec. 5 Hurricane Bowl at Miami, the Bruins now
must root for their opponents _ USC over Notre Dame, Arizona over
Arizona State and especially Miami over Syracuse. Each win could
bolster UCLA's strength of schedule and overall BCS rating by
fractions of a point.
</P>
<P>
   And when the final BCS poll is released Dec. 6, that just might
be the difference between being No. 2 and No. 3 _ between a date in
the national-title game and an anticlimatic matchup with Wisconsin
in the Rose Bowl. If UCLA, Kansas State and Tennessee remain
undefeated, the Bruins might be left out of the last dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to go down to the wire,'' said Southeastern
Conference assistant commissioner Charles Bloom, co-creator of the
BCS poll. ``It could be decided by a tenth or a hundredth of a
decimal point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what will happen, but the only thing I can tell
you is that Kansas State is picking up schedule strength. That's
the main reason it's third, because it's ahead of UCLA in the polls
and they're tied in the computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS rankings combine poll average, computer average, a
strength-of-schedule quotient and losses.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's schedule was ranked 12th last week and might jump a few
spots after it defeated USC. Kansas State's was ranked 68th and
should improve dramatically after the win over Missouri. Each spot
in the schedule rankings represents .4 BCS points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher you are, the harder it is to move up,'' Bloom said.
``Kansas State has a lot of room to improve (its schedule
quotient). But UCLA doesn't have much room to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom expects the Bruins to maintain a slim lead on Kansas State
today. But on Dec. 5, when UCLA plays 19th-ranked Miami, the
Wildcats play No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M, and that could boost their schedule
strength just enough to pass the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's best chance to repel Kansas State's charge is for Miami
to win at Syracuse on Saturday. That would narrow the gap between
Miami and Texas A&AMP;M and, subsequently, reduce Kansas State's
power-point advantage on Dec. 5. Victories by Arizona and USC this
week will help the Bruins, as well.
</P>
<P>
   And while it offends coach Bob Toledo's sense of sportsmanship,
the Bruins must beat Miami by the largest margin possible. If that
means throwing deep with a 15-point lead and 20 seconds left, so be
it.
</P>
<P>
   Margin of victory does not count in the Seattle Times computer
ranking, and it has a minuscule effect on the USA Today/Sagarin
ratings. But it weighs heavily in the New York Times computer
formula _ eight percent of the BCS poll _ and it has subjective
importance in the Top 25 polls, as the Bruins discovered when they
beat Stanford and Oregon State and dropped in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margin of victory matters more subjectively in the polls,''
Bloom said. ``That's the big thing hurting UCLA right now. They
need to turn that into a help. If they can (impress voters) and get
to No. 2 in one of the polls, that's a half-point in the overall
BCS standings.''
</P>
<P>
   And that might be the difference between Tempe and Pasadena. &QL;

Cumulative GPA: 3.03
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback: Cade McNown sat back and rode his teammates into
history, becoming the only QB to win four city series games. His
INTs were so-so passes that should have been caught. B-

fullbacks blocked like linemen. A

   Receivers: Not many catches against USC's stingy defense, but
the downfield blocking was superb and Danny Farmer's first-quarter
acrobatics set the tone. B

   Offensive line: No sacks, 227 yards rushing (84 in the fourth
quarter) and a dominating performance against the league's best
defense. A+
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line: Freshman Anthony Fletcher made two great tackles
and Kenyon Coleman was in the Trojans' backfield all game. Constant
pressure, plus turnovers forced, plus no gaping holes equals best
defensive line on the field. B+
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers: Ryan Nece and whirling dervish Brendon Ayanbadejo
combined for 16 tackles and five sacks. For three hours, Ayanbadejo
was as good as Chris Claiborne. A
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs: For second straight year, cornerback Marques
Anderson saved his best for USC. Bruins did not allow a pass longer
than 23 yards, and their open-field tackling was sensational. A+
</P>
<P>
   Special Teams: It's official: Chris Sailer's strength has
returned (two field goals, booming kickoffs) and so has his touch:
The third-quarter pooch punt was crucial. B
</P>
<P>
   Coaching: It took three months, but defensive coordinator Nick
Aliotti finally has meshed tactics with talent, showing why he was
so respected at Oregon. Recent game plans _ permit rushing yards,
prevent big pass plays _ just what the Bruins needed. A

<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape
Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the
government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., executives
involved in the talks said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving
AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, the leading on-line service with more than 14 million
subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World
Wide Web and its software business. AOL would also enter into a
joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems
to strengthen Netscape's other business of selling to large
corporations the heavy-duty software needed to serve up Web pages
and other Internet technologies to many thousands of users at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase, an exchange of AOL shares for Netscape stock, is
valued at roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be announced
as soon as Monday morning. But executives involved in the talks
cautioned Sunday night that some details remained to be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three
businesses at the forefront of the modern economy _ on-line
services, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would
strengthen two of Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL and Sun
Microsystems. At the same time, however, it would end the
independent existence of Netscape, an Internet software maker once
regarded as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance of
the personal computer software market.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, founded in 1994, has struggled over the last 18 months
under an assault from Microsoft. Its Navigator was the runaway
leader in the market for the browser software used to navigate the
World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding to the Internet
revolution, entered the market aggressively, quickly matching the
quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling the Microsoft
browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard Windows
operating system and giving it away free. Eventually, Microsoft's
browser technology caught up to Netscape's.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Netscape announced layoffs and started
distributing Navigator for free as well, as Microsoft steadily
gained in the browser market. Since then, Netscape has focused
mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction fees from
its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software to
corporations that are building their own Internet sites on which to
conduct electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   AOL believes it has the expertise to increase revenues from
Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's programmers and vast
corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's software sales as
well, executives involved in the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Among large corporations, Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, is
among the most popular operating systems for the powerful computers
that run Netscape's server software.
</P>
<P>
   The much smaller Netscape would be placed under the wing of AOL
and Sun Microsystems. The three companies had combined revenues of
more than $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, by comparison, had
revenues of more than $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal would insure that the fundamental elements of
Netscape survive within bigger companies that can drive its
technologies forward,'' said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the
Harvard business school and co-author with Michael A. Cusumano of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology of a recent book,
``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle
with Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the deal, if any, on the government's antitrust
suit against Microsoft is uncertain. It does appear to support a
key theme of Microsoft's defense _ namely, that it operates in a
fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all the time.
Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal, government officials insist, should have no direct
effect on the current case.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much the alliances shift, it doesn't affect the
central fact of Microsoft's monopoly and how it has used and abused
its market power to protect its monopoly,'' said David Boies, the
Justice Department's lead trial lawyer in the Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are
government witnesses at the Microsoft trial. And the serious merger
talks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and
AOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago, or just after the
start of the Microsoft trial, according to people close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts suggest that the companies may have been
emboldened to take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly on
the perception that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And
representatives of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a Silicon
Valley venture capital firm regarded as a power broker among
Microsoft's rivals, sit on the boards of Netscape, Sun and AOL.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, executives involved in the talks said that the timing of
the proposed deal was unrelated to the antitrust trial. Nor should
it, one person noted, be regarded as ``a single-minded attempt to
circle the wagons against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, AOL, according to one person close to the talks, plans
to keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser as the default choice
on its on-line service. One of the government's allegations in the
antitrust suit is that Microsoft won out over Netscape as the main
browser for AOL because Microsoft used its Windows monopoly as a
bargaining chip. To win the browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL
prime real estate on the Windows desktop, the main screen on more
than 90 percent of personal computers sold today.
</P>
<P>
   Staying with Microsoft's browser can be seen as proof that AOL
still regards placement on the Windows desktop as crucial, as well
as a careful step to avoid undermining one of the allegations in
the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   For AOL, the Netscape purchase would accelerate its evolution
toward the Internet. At present, its flagship on-line service is a
hybrid _ to its own proprietary service, it has added a gateway to
the World Wide Web. In addition, for consumers who do not subscribe
to AOL's dial-up service, it also has its own Web site, aol.com,
which attracts about 24 million visitors a month, according to
Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Its big Web site offers a wide range of information,
entertainment, Internet chat and e-mail, a leading example of the
all-in-one sites that have become known as portals. Netscape's
Netcenter traffic has slipped a bit in recent months, to under 16
million visitors a month, but it, too, is a major portal. Together,
they should be a huge player in the intensifying portal battle for
viewers and resulting advertising revenues. Yahoo is the current
leader among portal sites with more than 25 million monthly
visitors, while Microsoft's site attracts more than 20 million a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Though known as a new-media company for consumers, AOL is also
interested in boosting its electronic commerce business with the
Netscape purchase. AOL has recently done work with Eastman Kodak,
American Greetings and other companies, not only promoting their
products to on-line subscribers but also building the Internet
infrastructure of software to conduct electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   AOL notes projections like a recent one from Forrester Research
Inc., which predicted that worldwide Internet commerce could reach
as high as $3.2 trillion by 2003, or 5 percent of global sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, analysts say, could be a strong partner for
AOL in the market for Internet commerce software. Sun is a
corporate software company with a sales force of several thousand.
As it moves increasingly to Internet technology, AOL should prove
an excellent partner for Sun in terms of developing and using Sun's
Java, an Internet programming language. And while Netscape's
browser no longer generates revenue on its own, it is a
distribution channel for Java technology. Having Netscape's browser
safely in the hands of a friendly company is of strategic
importance for Sun, since Microsoft owns the alternative in the
browser market.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is expected pay little, if any, premium over Netscape's
stock price on Friday, executives close to the deal said, since
Netscape shares have more than doubled in the last month. In the
last week alone, Netscape's stock has jumped about $12, or nearly
45 percent, following reports that it was discussing a possible
partnership with AOL. The stock closed Friday at $39.1875, up
$2.625. AOL's shares gained $1.50 Friday, closing at $84.875.

HENRY HAMPTON, 58, PRODUCER OF ``EYES ON THE PRIZE''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Henry Hampton, a longtime Boston resident and a
renowned producer whose television documentary ``Eyes on the
Prize'' set the standard for accounts of the civil rights movement,
died yesterday at Brigham and Women's Hospital. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   He spent years struggling with health problems, contracting
polio as a child and in recent years battling lung cancer and the
debilitating side effects of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 20s and 30s, Mr. Hampton was a vibrant church
activist and visionary, struggling with the plague of the times:
segregation and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred civil rights stories had been told, but it was
always black people being saved by whites,'' he said in a 1993
interview, six years after the documentary aired on PBS. ``In
`Eyes' we brought our people up in history.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in St. Louis on Jan. 8, 1940, to Veva and Dr. Henry
Hampton Sr., chief of surgery at the city's black hospital, Homer
Phillips. According to Mr. Hampton, his father raised his three
children in a middle-class white suburban world, never letting them
forget the importance of self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop's way of handling race was never to let anybody control
him,'' Mr. Hampton recalled in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   After attending parochial school in Missouri, and surviving a
terrifying bout of polio at age 15, Mr. Hampton went on to study
English at Washington University in St. Louis, then continued with
classes at Boston University and at McGill University in Montreal
with an eye toward attending medical school.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.2l &LR; But he was drawn to the civil rights movement and
eventually to Boston, settling here to work for the Unitarian
Universalist Church at its headquarters on Beacon Street.
</P>
<P>
   He became deeply involved with the politics of the church,
blossoming as an executive and traveling around the world, visiting
more than six nations during a 30-day tour in 1968. After returning
home from that trip, Mr. Hampton quit the church, opening his
production company, Blackside Inc., in the South End.
</P>
<P>
   The company suffered massive financial troubles at first. But
after years of struggling, Mr. Hampton began circulating clips of
``Eyes on the Prize,'' the landmark documentary he had first
envisioned in 1965 during a civil rights march on Selma. Aided by
friends, at times traveling the city to air fragments of the show,
Mr. Hampton managed to land the six-hour, $3 million show on PBS in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   It drew instant acclaim on all academic and popular fronts, and
became a presumed Oscar winner almost immediately. When it lost in
the documentary category, historians and filmmakers alike were
outraged. Former CBS news correspondent Marvin Kalb called it ``a
case of injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   With Blackside Inc. on its way, Mr. Hampton continued making
films, even appearing in the office between chemotherapy sessions
after a diagnosis of lung cancer in 1990. His later series included
``The Great Depression'' and ``America's War on Poverty,'' both of
which were critically acclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry said he wanted to do the civil rights movement in a way
that was not about victims,'' said Judy Richardson, education
director for Blackside, who was active in the movement in the 1960s
with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and we were all tired of seeing black folks as just
benefactors of other people's actions,'' added Richardson, who
joined Blackside in 1978 and was associate producer of ``Eyes on
the Prize.'' ``He was brilliant and he was caring, and that's how
we're going to remember him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Batson, a prominent Boston educator who met Mr. Hampton in
the 1960s and worked with him on ``Eyes on the Prize,'' recalled
Mr. Hampton's ``softness of character,'' his gentle demeanor, and
kind spirit.

PACKERS FAIL TO FIND AN ANSWER TO MOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Wis., Minn.)  (jw) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ After spending all week playing down what was
obviously a huge game against Green Bay, a group of Minnesota
Vikings players dropped all pretenses and showed up Sunday morning
dressed in battle fatigues. They weren't going to war, just playing
the Packers, or was it the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   The image was appropriate, because Vikings wide receiver Randy
Moss is The Bomb. Not a bomb. The Bomb.
</P>
<P>
   And he caught a bunch of them Sunday. Over the shoulder. Across
the middle. Single coverage, double coverage, zone coverage. Jam
him at the line of scrimmage, he runs by you. Lay off, he runs by
you. The Packers tried the latter late in the fourth quarter, while
one of their linebackers blitzed; Moss was singled up and ran very
deep, very fast. His 49-yard touchdown catch sealed the game for
the Vikings and maybe rookie of the year for Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota beat the Packers, 28-14, in front of a record 64,471
at the Metrodome. The 10-1 Vikings lead the 7-4 Packers by three
games with five left. Unless Minnesota has a collapse of mammoth
proportions, it will capture the division.
</P>
<P>
   But the real story is how Moss is affecting the National
Football League. Moss is doing on offense what Lawrence Taylor did
in his early years on defense. Moss scares teams so much that they
make dramatic shifts in their game plans to compensate for his
athleticism. Even then, there is nothing anyone can do when
quarterback Randall Cunningham throws the football up for grabs and
Moss goes and gets it.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham completed 20 of 30 passes for 264 yards Sunday and
Moss had 153 of those yards and a touchdown, leaving Green Bay's
defensive coordinator, Fritz Shurmur, shaking his head in wonder.
</P>
<P>
   In two games against the Packers, a team with a solid defense,
Moss has 13 catches for 343 yards _ a 26-yard-a-catch average _ and
three touchdowns. He is probably the biggest reason Minnesota swept
the Packers in the regular season for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing football,'' Moss said. ``Moments like this feel
good. If you are not scoring touchdowns, just as long as you are
making grabs, catching key first downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings Coach Dennis Green said: ``There are some games where we
allow people to double Randy and we don't work to get him open and
we will get the ball to some other players. There are other games
where we set out to make sure he gets singled up and this is the
game. In big games you have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota did have help from its defense. To try to confuse
Minnesota, the Packers used 13 offensive formations in their first
15 plays. But quarterback Brett Favre, who had a badly injured
finger on his non-throwing hand and a slight concussion, struggled
early. A fumbled snap, which led to a field goal, and a 58-yard
interception return for a touchdown by Jimmy Hitchcock put the
Packers in a 10-0 hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't start out the game 10-0 right away against a good
team,'' Packers Coach Mike Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers were eventually able to move the ball because Favre
calmed down and played brilliantly. He completed 31 of 39 passes
for 303 yards, and nine receivers had catches.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Minnesota jumped to a 13-0 lead, then 20-7, and it
remained that way until the fourth quarter. Then Favre mounted one
of those classic Packers drives. Despite four false-start penalties
because offensive linemen could not hear the snap count over the
screaming fans, Favre led the Packers on a 10-play, 71-yard drive
that culminated in a two-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tyrone
Davis. Green Bay was in striking distance, trailing, 20-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point I thought we had a chance,'' Favre said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Moss. On a third-down play, Cunningham threw the ball
into triple coverage and Moss outmuscled and outjumped each
defender. Then Moss outran cornerback Rod Smith and glided by
safety Darren Sharper, who scrambled over to help. Too late. Moss
caught the 49-yard bomb, then did the Metrodome leap into the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Moss is getting so good he felt comfortable enough afterward to
reveal a trick that the veteran wide receiver Cris Carter taught
him. On some deep balls, while running at full speed, Moss will
glance at the huge scoreboard to see when Cunningham is throwing
the ball. Only when it is in the air does Moss turn to look for it.
Warning: Don't try that near your television set at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is doing things no rookie receiver has done in a long
time,'' Green said. ``Throw the ball up, he gets it. It's pretty
simple.''  &QL;

CSUN STUNNED BY SAN JOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ All the feel-good stuff that stemmed from a win at
Long Beach State is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Everything gained from hanging tough with Tennessee.
Arrivederci.
</P>
<P>
   In a game a program on the rise needs to win, Cal State
Northridge lost going away Sunday, thanks to a mind-numbing second
half as San Jose State outhearted the Matadors 89-77 at the Event
Center.
</P>
<P>
   That San Jose State forward Will Trawick scored a team-high 17
points after netting just three in his first two games speaks
loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were too cocky,'' senior guard Derrick Higgins said. ``You
look at the schedule and this is a game you should win. It has
nothing to do with building a program. We just (stunk). We didn't
do anything right. That guy scored (three) points all season. We
have to stop that. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but Trawick's performance doesn't capture it all. Not by a
long shot.
</P>
<P>
   How's this for a second half? CSUN (1-2) shot 29 percent and had
five field goals in the first 18 minutes. The Spartans hit 19 of 31
shots and had a 9-0 run to pull ahead and 14-2 to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   But the most obscene aspect was the 54 points San Jose State
scored in the second half. The Spartans averaged 52.5 points in
their first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just were soft,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said. ``They
were much more aggressive than we were offensively. I thought they
were more aggressive on the defensive end and they got loose ball
after loose ball. We're not very tough right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called heart (on defense). It's guys playing hard and not
trying to protect themselves from fouls. We have guys out there
trying to stay out of foul trouble instead of playing basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, some way, the Matadors thought a win was a birthright
despite failing to start a season with two wins in their first
three games since 1988-89. But it was heading that way when the
Matadors opened the second half with a 9-4 run to extend to a 46-39
lead, their biggest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   However, that's when the Spartans showed patience on offense and
the Matadors fumbled around and failed to cherish the basketball.
When Ben Sanders hit a 3-pointer with 12 minutes left, San Jose
State led 50-48.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, strong interior play keyed a 14-2 Spartans
(1-2) spurt as they went ahead 72-59 with 4:43 left before easing
to first-year coach Phil Johnson's first win.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get this program back on its feet, we have to beat low
Division I teams like that, that we should beat,'' Sanders said.
``It's the Eastern Washingtons, the Menlos. Games like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore center Brian Heinle paced CSUN with 17 points, though
eight of those came in the final two minutes while the Matadors
were playing catch-up. Higgins, listed as doubtful with a sprained
ankle, added 13 points in a team-high 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into the game thinking it was a gimmie. I'm going to
say that on behalf of my team,'' Matadors point guard Jason Crowe
said. ``Long Beach State we won, then we play Tennessee and we hang
with them, and you go to a game like this and your confidence is
kind of high. And then you get knocked down like this.''

NO. 2 ON THE COMPUTER ONLY: HINGIS OVERCOMES DAVENPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The No. 1 ranking was out of range for the moment. So
Martina Hingis, second-ranked by the computer but forever a
first-rate contender in her mind, took aim at the next best target:
the season's last title and its $500,000 paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   With a cartoon-sized smile on her face and homicide in her
heart, Hingis upset the rival she now considers her archrival, No.
1-ranked Lindsay Davenport, by 7-5, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 on Sunday to
capture the final event of the year, the invitation-only Chase
Championships at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I got you this time,'' Hingis whispered to Davenport
when they met for their netside handshake. The two combatants'
toe-to-toe history stood at 7-6 for Hingis after a weary Davenport
netted a backhand on her opponent's second match point. Besides
sending a signal about her intentions for 1999, Hingis' performance
was payback for her loss to Davenport in the U.S. Open final. That
6-3, 7-5 defeat spoiled Hingis' title defense and ignited
Davenport's successful campaign to embellish her first Grand Slam
championship with the acquisition of the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``She kicked me out of No. 1,'' noted Hingis, whose 80-week
tenure at the top ended on Oct. 12, a development that sent her to
Nick Bollettieri's Florida academy for a crash course in fitness
and fine-tuning. Though retrieving the ranking at this event became
a mathematical impossibility, Hingis convinced herself that exiting
1998 on a winning note was well worth her perseverance here,
particularly if her victory came at Davenport's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 2-hour-33-minute contest was the final that Hingis,
without a title since winning the Italian Open in May, had aspired
to: a finale between the world's top two players. That had occurred
in this event five times before, all of them victories for the
top-ranked player. Hingis put an end to that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' she said. ``I'm happy my game has raised
again; she deserves No. 1 right now, but I'm going to keep up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Helpful to the plans of Hingis, the 18-year-old Swiss star, was
the fact that Davenport had played six sets of tennis on Saturday.
No sooner had Davenport, a 22-year-old Californian, fended off
five-time champion Steffi Graf in the semifinals while sprouting
blisters on her feet than she was back on court to capture the
doubles title with her partner, Natasha Zvereva.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a little bit tired, and that made a difference,''
Davenport said. ``Everything felt a little sluggish. Martina was
much more aggressive than she's been the last couple times I've
played her. I missed a lot of easy shots today, just a little bit
awkward and a little bit slow to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis had played just seven sets heading into the final.
Besides having more desperate designs on the title than Davenport,
Hingis had a tangible edge as well: good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever is in better shape at the end of the year can make it
to the end,'' said Hingis, who found that out the hard way in 1996
when she failed to survive a five-set final here with Graf. Sunday
Hingis knew that the longer the match went, the more fatigued
Davenport would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing for my pride, that I wanted to win this
tournament,'' Hingis said. ``It feels good to finish up with not
losing to anybody.'' Hingis will begin 1999 by attempting to win a
third straight Australian Open title _ and continuing her siege on
Davenport's ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that she's going to be back to No. 1, or
definitely a threat, in the next year,'' Davenport said. Speaking
of herself, Davenport called it unbelievable that she would leave
1998 with six titles, 69 match victories, a Grand Slam championship
and the No. 1 ranking. Davenport dismissed the notion that Sunday's
loss carried larger ramifications than those on the Garden
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played a number of times this year, and when I was
ranked 2 and I beat her, I didn't think, `Oh, I'm the No. 1 player
because I beat her.' I knew she really wanted to win this
tournament; so did I. But I didn't feel like I had to win it to end
the year at No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   What Davenport would have had to do to win the match, after
dropping the first two sets, was somehow conjure up the stamina to
sweep the next three; but even though she rallied in the third, she
did not have the energy to accomplish a comeback on such a grand
scale. Too many drop shots, and too many rallies that demanded the
tireless repetition of a metronome, took their toll.
</P>
<P>
   In the final set, Hingis broke for 5-1 when Davenport, whose
concentration was running on automatic pilot, buried a swinging
forehand volley in the net mainly because she committed the
cardinal sin of failing to keep her eye on the ball. Though
Davenport snapped to attention long enough to spoil Hingis' attempt
to serve for the match, she was then broken for the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second set was really the telling factor,'' Davenport
said. ``I think almost every service game she served, I had at
least one break point, and I just wasn't able to capitalize.'' She
was 0 for 5 on break-point conversions in that set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if I'd gotten one of those breaks, the match would have
been a different story,'' Davenport said. ``She wouldn't have been
as confident as she was up two sets to love. But that's the way it
goes. I didn't play aggressive enough, and that's the way matches
turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why this one didn't.

STEINBRENNER VOWS TO STAY YANKS' BOSS IF TEAM IS SOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner continued to deny Sunday that he had reached
agreement or was close to an agreement to sell a majority share of
the Yankees to Cablevision. But he made one thing perfectly plain
and said another was possible.
</P>
<P>
   The plain: He and his family will retain control of the team if
he should sell.
</P>
<P>
   The possible: He may wind up running the Knicks and Rangers,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Steinbrenner would take charge of the
basketball and hockey teams, which are owned by Cablevision, came
up earlier this year when negotiations heated up between
Steinbrenner and Charles F. Dolan, who runs Cablevision's expanding
empire. Not much was made of it, though, because the possibility of
a sale seemed remote at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the two men are said to be close to an agreement
under which Long Island-based Cablevision would buy a majority
interest in the Yankees, including most but not all of the 60
percent that Steinbrenner and his family own. One business
associate of Steinbrenner, speaking last week on condition of
anonymity, said an announcement could be forthcoming ``very early''
next year. In an interview Sunday, Steinbrenner flatly denied other
television and newspaper reports that a deal had been concluded
already.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked about the Knicks and the Rangers, should
he complete a deal, he said, ``Don't be surprised at anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he saying that an agreement would place him in charge of the
other teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer that,'' Steinbrenner said. ``He has
organizations set up. I don't want to ruffle anyone's feelings.''
But, he added, ``Anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What Steinbrenner did not equivocate on was the subject of
control of the Yankees in the event of a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is done,'' he said by telephone from Tampa, ``the
Steinbrenners will be in control. That's what sets Cablevision
apart from others. There are those who would pay a lot of money and
take control, but that won't happen. We've been in control for too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   How long would he and his family run the Yankees? ``It would
have to be a long-term deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Business associates of the owner said that in his negotiations
with Dolan, Steinbrenner had already established that element of
the potential deal. But Steinbrenner cautioned that no one should
``get too far out'' on the idea that a sale is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not say at what stage his talks with Dolan
stood, but he added: ``There are other people who as a result of
this story have called. Two calls came today from other places.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say who had called.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is done or close, a deal now seems inevitable for the
first time in the 26-year ownership of Steinbrenner and his limited
partners. An associate of one of the partners has said that the
partners might be the only delaying factor.
</P>
<P>
   The limited partners, the associate said on condition of
anonymity, have balked at the way the revenue from the sale would
be divided. Steinbrenner said it was ``a bit too early for
conjecture'' on how that issue or any other would be resolved.

STARTUP'S SHAREHOLDERS HOLD MEETING ONLINE  
 FOR YEAR 2000 GNATS, A SCENTED `BUG' SPRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the age of the Internet, the proxies and mahogany-lined
boardrooms typical of important company meetings might give way to
quirkier variations. Such was the case with Travelzoo.com, a budget
travel company that held its first company meeting online on
Friday. No jacket was required; shareholders just logged on,
entered their passwords and cast their electronic ballots for the
board.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the start-up company's 700,000 ``owners'' _ each of
whom qualified for three shares of stock simply by showing up at
Travelzoo's site on the World Wide Web this spring _ were asked by
e-mail who among them cared to run for the seven nonpaying
directors' seats.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Bartel, the founder of Travelzoo.com, said he was
surprised at how many shareholders submitted their biographies for
consideration _ 400 in all.
</P>
<P>
   They ranged from the author of a book on Maryland wines to an
executive with McDonald's to a second-year medical student in
Ponce, Puerto Rico, named Greg Kohanski, whose biography sounded
like a campaign promise for student office: ``I am extremely
organized, very responsible and will take my position very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Jennings, a financial manager from Gaithersburg, Md.,
bolstered his candidacy by proclaiming, ``I am interested in
Travelzoo.com because I like to travel, especially to places with
tennis courts.''
</P>
<P>
   And Barbara Crane, a 28-year-old social worker who did not list
her residency, defied the notion that a board member has to be
steely and impersonal: ``My personal interests include my husband,
baby (German shepherd), family, friends, church, theater, hiking
and movies. I love to travel. I feel for mental health it is
important to vacation and explore other cultures and lifestyles.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the election will be posted on the company's site
by Tuesday, said Bartel _ who, as founder, retained 30 percent of
the company stock, no doubt ensuring his election to one of the
seats.
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to note the company's third-quarter profit of
$34,749, on revenues of $103,282, which he attributed to
advertising sales and commissions on sales of plane tickets from a
new booking feature on the site.
</P>
<P>
   His big-name competitors, he said, are not profitable, because
they pay millions of dollars ``to become exclusive travel agents or
spend millions on advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartel started the business with no capital and no corporate
alliances, hoping to rely on word of mouth and what he called a
``power of the people'' business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Naysayers laughed at his strategy at first, saying the chance of
the company's paying dividends was nil, but on the Internet,
suspension of disbelief appears to be part of the business plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ LISA NAPOLI
</P>
<P>
   For Year 2000 Gnats, a Scented `Bug' Spray
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time. With all the anxiety among those
trying to head off computer chaos when the year 2000 arrives, some
computer-savvy entrepreneur was bound to come up with a less solemn
approach. And now, sure enough, a ``Y2K Bug Spray'' has appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The spray bottle is the brainchild of Dan Dyce, a claims
adjuster and Web-page builder from El Dorado Hills, Calif., who
teamed up with a buddy, Dale Miller, to create this ``Solution for
Your Year 2000 Problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients are almost entirely (99.746 percent, to be
exact) either ``Y2KBS'' or water, depending on which part of the
label you believe. And Dyce hopes it becomes the stocking stuffer
of choice for overstressed Cobol programmers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The two got their gag into distribution via www.isgnet.com/y2k
for less than $1,000. Their local Mail Boxes Etc. store receives
the orders and handles the shipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the trademark work, found our raw materials, found a
manufacturer, all via the Internet, all during evening hours, all
without ever leaving our home,'' Dyce said.
</P>
<P>
   At $4.95 a bottle, plus shipping, Y2K Bug Spray is being used as
an icebreaker at technical meetings and as a humorous advertising
tool by Steven Schroeder, an accountant in Rancho Cordova, Calif.,
whose clients include insurance adjusters likely to run into year
2000 claims.
</P>
<P>
   What if the red and yellow spray bottle fails to stop irate
calls from chief executives or deliver the other suggested
benefits? Never fear. This pine-scented liquid comes with a
guarantee _ an ironclad promise that it will still be a
``solution'' if used by Jan. 1, 2000.

   (NYT9) LIVINGSTON, N.Y. -- Nov. 22, 1998 -- LIVINGSTON-FAMILY-2,
11-22 -- Henry Livingston, 80, a distant cousin of the Livingston
bloodline, at Oak Hill, a riverfront estate that was built in the
1790s, steeped in family history. After coasting for two centuries
on the achievements of men in big wigs with titles like ``The
Signer,'' the family has returned to prominence, thanks to Rep.
Robert Linlithgow Livingston, R-La., a 10th-generation descendant
of Robert Livingston, First Lord of the Manor, who is poised to
become the next Speaker of the House of Representatives. (Joyce

-- Before the Kennedys, before the Roosevelts, before the
Vanderbilts, there were the Livingstons. Oak Hill, a riverfront
estate in Livingston, N.Y., that was built in the 1790s, is steeped
in family history. From the late 17th century to the early 19th
century, the Livingstons were one of America's most aristocratic
families, lording over the Hudson River Valley and owning more land
than the state of Rhode Island has. (Joyce Dopkeen/New York Times

Boole &AMP; Babbage, based in San Jose, Calif., in a stock swap valued
at more than $900 million. Paul Newton, Boole's chief executive,
plans to remain with the combined company for about a year to
oversee the transition. ``Typically, we provide all of the tools
and controls to make sure these critical applications deliver data
to the end user, regardless of platform,'' says Newton. (Steve

growing them faster than they ever imagined,'' says Watson. BMC,
based in Houston, agreed to acquire Boole, based in San Jose,
Calif., in a stock swap valued at more than $900 million. Both BMC
and Boole provide information systems management staff a virtual
dashboard with which to monitor problems and optimize performance.

Tollefson was diagnosed with a rare tumor in her left heel. She was
told by doctors that she might never run again. ``I'm a beast,''

Brooks Atkinson Theater. Through a series of mimed sketches, in
which Irwin plays sweet to Shiner's sour, these fine physical
clowns produce an evening that, in its deceptively silly way, bears
the same relationship to contemporary urban dwellers that
Sophoclean tragedy did to ancient Athenians. It's catharsis that's
offered here, and not of a trivial order. (Sara Krulwich/New York

political apathy, have emerged as a powerful political force.

generous government scholarships and loans to make university

the revival of ``On the Town,'' directed by George Wolfe, at the
Gershwin Theater. The production looks vibrant, awash in hard-candy
colors and spangles of light. And Leonard Bernstein's eclectic
score still throbs with a purely urban intensity. Yet often the
show resembles the giant reproductions of hand-painted tourist
postcards. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo)

ONE GOOD HALF FOR THE JETS, AND ONE BIG VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FBN-ANDERSON-COLUMN) 
(nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ In this season of possibilities, the Jets
broke out with three impressive second-half touchdowns against the
Oilers after being frustrated in the early going Sunday, and they
went on to produce one of their best games of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets defeated Tennessee, 24-3, to bring their record to 7-4,
matching the Buffalo Bills. That will be good enough for a
three-way tie for first place in the American Football Conference
East if the Miami Dolphins lose their Monday night game with the
New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended what Coach Bill Parcells described as a
critical six-game stretch that could have left the Jets poised for
a stretch run _ or in serious trouble. The Jets won five of the
six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was anxious,'' Parcells said, reflecting on last week's
last-minute loss to the lowly Colts, ``but now I really look
forward to coming home.'' The Jets play the 2-9 Carolina Panthers
at the Meadowlands next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of characters on offense is becoming familiar, and
good, for the Jets these days. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde woke up
this morning with a stomach virus. He got here five hours before
game time, received an intravenous injection and medicine before
the game, and started. Curtis Martin saw him holding his stomach
and wondered if Testaverde would be all right.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde was, he said later, ``feeling lousy'' when the game
began. Still, he tossed two touchdown passes in his
life-begins-at-34 comeback. The Jets are 7-1 with him starting.
Sunday's numbers included 21-for-33 passing for 237 yards and no
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   With Martin adding 123 yards rushing on 27 carries _ with 96
yards after halftime _ the usually disruptive Oiler defense did not
know which way to turn or how much to pressure for the run.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense recovered from some early problems in
recognizing what the Oilers were up to. Tennessee had won five of
its last six games. And in the second quarter, the Jets could not
quite get to Eddie George on the ground, or prevent Steve McNair
from making something happen with his physical approach to
quarterbacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to settle down,'' linebacker Mo Lewis said. ``They
showed us things we hadn't seen.'' Still, the Oilers failed to
capitalize on those early Jet problems. Essentially, the Jets'
defense did exactly what the clever game plan called for: halt
George and contain McNair.
</P>
<P>
   The play that produced the first touchdown, after almost three
quarters of play, seemed to spark the Jets and dishearten the
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a Jet favorite: Testaverde to the 6-foot-3-inch
Keyshawn Johnson, who was six inches taller than the Oilers'
defender, cornerback Darryll Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like taking candy from a baby,'' the always-confident Johnson
said of the 3-yard scoring catch, which gave the Jets a 10-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time this season he had scored on the play.
Johnson caught a career-high 10 passes Sunday for 112 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Within five minutes of Johnson's score, Testaverde found Keith
Byars in the end zone for a 2-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the Oilers' defense not knowing whether to play
the run or the pass, Testaverde made a simple pitchout to Martin
that produced a 31-yard touchdown.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the game, three of the Jets' offensive linemen had been
growling. Left guard Todd Burger had complained to center Kevin
Mawae and right tackle Jason Fabini that they had failed to spring
Martin for a run longer than 17 yards. They probably did not know
that Martin had not generated a run longer than 20 yards in more
than 300 carries going back to last year at New England.
</P>
<P>
   So they blocked enough for him to produce his touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this season he has been cutting to the outside after
taking the pitchout, usually because the hole did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it developing clearly today,'' he said following
his sixth 100-yard game as a Jet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a remarkable possession time of 13 minutes 40 seconds,
the Jets failed to amass any points in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Their first drive consumed 6:12 and moved with Testaverde
connecting with a variety of receivers. But the drive stalled on
the Oilers' 21. From there, John Hall was asked to deliver a
39-yard field goal. But he mis-hit the ball, and it wobbled off to
the left.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was the Oilers' turn to wobble. George bobbled a
pitchback from McNair on their first play, and tight end Jackie
Harris dropped a McNair pass on the second. It was three-and-out,
and the Jets controlled the ball the rest of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets carried their second drive over to the second quarter
and finally generated points when Hall converted a 43-yard field
goal. It took the Jets 14 plays to go the 55 yards to position the
score.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers still could not get out of their own way until their
third drive. McNair fumbled a snap the second time they got the
ball, and they even were given two straight penalties on punt
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on their third drive, the Oilers, with George running
powerfully and McNair moving and passing well, got down to the
Jets' 9. Then Frank Wycheck fumbled on third and 3, and the Oilers
produced only a 34-yard field goal by Al Del Greco. The Oilers
dominated the second period, possessing the ball for 12:17, but had
only 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   The first major break for either side came the Jets' way in the
third quarter, when wide receiver Wayne Chrebet benefited from a
pass interference penalty on cornerback Samari Rolle. The 35-yard
penalty on a pass from Testaverde took the Jets to the Tennessee
27. From there, Martin's running helped get them to the 3.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Testaverde and Johnson converted on what has become
one of the significant strategies in the entire league: the
mismatch. Johnson leaped, and Lewis could not leap higher.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde tossed his 18th touchdown of the season (to only four
interceptions) early in the fourth quarter when the Jets took a
17-3 edge on another smart drive. At the end, Testaverde faked a
handoff at the 2 to Martin. The play-action worked and Byars was in
the end zone for the touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   There was no faked handoff on the next Jet drive, which led to
the crushing score. Instead, Testaverde collaborated on his
favorite play with Martin: the pitchout. It has worked well
throughout the season, but never so well as Sunday when it was good
for the 31-yard score. It was Martin's longest run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win our remaining games,'' Testaverde said, ``we'll win
the division. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't look so bad going to the bus.

GIANTS QUIETLY KEEP VICTORY IN PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FBN-RHODEN-COLUMN) 
(nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. &UR;  &LR; _ There was no music in the Giants'
locker room afterward. No strut, no attitude, no festivities
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   It was a quiet locker room, quiet enough to hear a huge sigh of
relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did not seem to expect anyone to be impressed with
their 20-0 victory over the feeble Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.
They knew it was the kind of game that would only be a big deal if
they had lost it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants (4-7) did not lose, and if that seemed less
achievement than survival, there was victory even in that.
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants' most seasoned spokesman, defensive end Michael
Strahan, said: ``People said our loss last week was the low point.
But that's wrong, the lowest point would have been had Philadelphia
come in here and beaten us.''
</P>
<P>
   That would explain the first sound emanating from Giants Coach
Jim Fassel in his post-game news conference: ``Whew.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I can say,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel then described the few things that went well against the
Eagles (2-9). He mildly praised his new quarterback, Kent Graham,
who led the team to 17 second-half points and retained the starting
job for at least another week.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged some of the obvious mediocrity in a game
that featured 20 penalties and 13 punts.
</P>
<P>
   And as he left, Fassel turned to once again say, ``Whew.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the best summation available. Playing host to one of the
worst teams in the National Football League, the Giants were able
to separate themselves from that lowest level of play with a
certain amount of success, if not panache. In a season that was
spiraling out of control, that meant something. The Giants will
cling to all the false hope they can muster.
</P>
<P>
   Astounding as it may seem, had the Washington Redskins not
fallen short in a 3-point loss to the Arizona Cardinals, the Giants
would have been just one game out of the chase for the final
wild-card playoff berth in the National Football Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The switch from Danny Kanell to Graham at quarterback inspired
changes in the Giants' offense. The biggest change came when they
scored a touchdown in the third quarter, ending a streak of 11
quarters without one.
</P>
<P>
   But more basic was Graham's choice of receivers. Graham, who
completed 10 of 21 passes for 153 yards with 1 touchdown pass and 1
interception, looked frequently for second-string wide receivers
Joe Jurevicius and Amani Toomer, players Graham has worked with
since July on the second-unit offense.
</P>
<P>
   As Graham said, ``I'm not as used to throwing to the
first-string receivers, though it's something I'll grow more
accustomed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Graham looked toward Jurevicius repeatedly, throwing
four passes his way. Jurevicius caught two for 65 yards and dropped
two. But most of the passes were deep downfield, something that
seemed to open up the Giants' offense in minor ways.
</P>
<P>
   Jurevicius did make one catch of 59 yards, the longest Giants
reception of the season. Toomer had two catches, including a
25-yarder that led to the Giants' final touchdown, an 8-yard pass
from Graham to Tiki Barber.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Hilliard and Chris Calloway, Kanell's favorite receivers,
combined for just two catches and 37 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Eagles were playing like a beaten team, it was hard to
determine if the Giants' efforts to stretch the field with deep
passes had any affect on their running game. After all, both teams
played miserably in the first half, which ended with the Giants
ahead by 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, and especially in the second half, the Giants'
offensive line was more precise.
</P>
<P>
   It blocked well, opening holes for running back Gary Brown, who
gained 96 yards on 27 carries. Brown scored the Giants' first
touchdown on a 4-yard run, the culmination of a nine-play drive in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bound and determined to run the football,'' Fassel
said. ``It's something we have to prove to ourselves that we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants head to San Francisco to play the 49ers next week
on ``Monday Night Football,'' a ball-control offense would seem
their only hope to avoid an ugly mismatch.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Graham played ably in spurts, but a more competent opponent
might have pounced while Graham and the Giants were shaking off the
rust.
</P>
<P>
   While Graham was the prominent newcomer on offense, strong
safety Sam Garnes returned from a foot injury to spark the Giants'
defense, which earned the team's first shutout since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Garnes, who had six tackles in the game, was a force in run
support _ his strength _ and seemed to settle the secondary as
well, which played its best game in several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also had six sacks, with linebacker Jessie Armstead
and free safety Tito Wooten each sacking Philadelphia quarterback
Bobby Hoying twice. That pressure, and perhaps the weight of an
awful season, seemed to have Hoying completely out of sorts. Two of
his passes were intercepted by Giants cornerback Phillippi Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who are averaging just 8.2 points, still have not
thrown a touchdown pass to a wide receiver this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say today's opponent has been struggling,'' Fassel
said. ``I'll say: `Who cares? The Eagles are in the NFL.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants happily, if quietly, felt good about themselves for
the first time since Oct. 18 _ when they defeated the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, with a 4-7 record, we all realize where we are,''
Strahan said. ``But today, I'm going to enjoy it. A win is a
win.'' &QL;

   (NYT4) NEW YORK -- Nov. 22, 1998 -- FOOL-THEATER-REVIEW, 11-22
-- David Shiner, left, and Bill Irwin in ``Fool Moon,'' at the
Brooks Atkinson Theater. Through a series of mimed sketches, in
which Irwin plays sweet to Shiner's sour, these fine physical
clowns produce an evening that, in its deceptively silly way, bears
the same relationship to contemporary urban dwellers that
Sophoclean tragedy did to ancient Athenians. It's catharsis that's
offered here, and not of a trivial order. (Sara Krulwich/New York

show resembles the giant reproductions of hand-painted tourist

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Dear Diary:
 &UR;  &LR;  This is a New York tale about two savvy Upper West Side cats.
They were getting fat and lethargic, and my daughter, Diane,
thought it was time to get a kitten to perk them up. She brought
home a lively 6-week-old kitten, but things didn't work out as
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The kitten bit the cats' tails, jumped on their stomachs,
scratched their ears and, worst of all, ate all their food before
they could get to it.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, as my daughter was leaving the apartment, the
two cats ran into the hall. They refused to come home, refused to
eat the food she brought out for them. They were on a hunger
strike. The only thing missing was a picket sign.
</P>
<P>
   This went on all day and all night. By the next afternoon, my
daughter gave in. She put the kitten in the carrier and brought him
back to the vet.
</P>
<P>
   When she came back, she showed the cats the empty carrier and
said, ``OK, you win.'' The cats ran inside.
</P>
<P>
   They had not been great friends, but since they went on strike
they've become inseparable. How did they know that in union there
is strength? Had they watched strikes on television? Did the
liberal tradition of the Upper West Side rub off on them?

   Alan Magill and a co-worker volunteered to do a comedy program
for residents at a city hospital. They were letting fly with old
gags and physical humor the likes of which probably hadn't seen the
light of day since vaudeville. Most of the patients were reasonably
receptive. The exception was a man sleeping in a bed in a large
room that had about 20 other beds. He turned his head to look at
the pair, and they promptly greeted him with a barrage of gags. He
responded with what they admitted was understandable disdain. ``Do
I come into your house and do this?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a crowded restaurant on the Upper West Side at
dinner time. People were waiting, but the party at one of the
tables ignored the standees and lingered long after they had
finished. Diane Feldman overheard and enjoyed the waiter who
finally came up and queried, ``Would you like to see the breakfast
menu?'' It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Jeanne Burck was walking along the Upper East side to her
job as a special education teacher when she felt her tote bag grow
noticeably heavier. It was early in the morning and she knew she
was tired but this was ridiculous, she thought. She stopped, looked
inside the bag and a golden retriever, who had obviously jumped in,
was chomping on the roast beef sandwich she had prepared for her
lunch. Both dog and sandwich were evicted _ the dog claimed by an
obviously oblivious owner.

   People sometimes park in front of my house, where there is a No
Parking Here to Corner sign, issued by the traffic department.
</P>
<P>
   I stuck a post-it note to the windshield of one car noting that
it was illegally parked. Just then a radio car stopped and a young
officer questioned what I had done. He replaced my note with a
traffic summons. ``This works better, and you never know what the
driver will do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I replied in my best teacher-trained voice, ``so what
you're saying is that my deed would engender retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me blankly for a moment and then nodded
tentatively: ``Yeah, if I used those words, that's what I'm
saying.''

   My 6-year-old daughter, Dorothy, was eating lunch with her

   The waitress came by and Dorothy said: ``That sign is rude. Why
doesn't it say No Smoking Please?''
</P>
<P>
   The waitress looked at her a moment, unamused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you smoke?'' she asked.

   The office building called the Interchurch Center is home to a
large number of church-related offices, including the National
Council of Churches. Every week, the menu for the cafeteria is
posted in the elevator. Until recently, ``roasted vegetables in a
hallowed baguette'' appeared on the menu. The most recent menu
changed hallowed to hollowed. Carol Smolenski is not happy.
Baguettes are no longer sacred. Will someone reinstate the holiness
of the bread?
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I'm probably the last New York City woman to believe that one
can eat bagels without worrying about adding pounds to one's
figure. As a devoted lover of bagels, maintaining this belief was
always difficult until the other afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   I was waiting in a long line at Tal Bagels on 53rd Street and
First Avenue, thinking about yelling my order for a salt bagel with
egg salad when the woman in front of me bellowed, ``I'd like a
light cream cheese on a scooped raisin.'' The counterman, without
looking up, executed her wish. I was perplexed. What had she
wanted, I asked, when it was my turn. He explained to me, as if I
were not too swift, how he pulls out the inside dough of the bagel
so it is ``scooped out.''
</P>
<P>
   On a subsequent visit, I was ready to ask for a cream cheese on
scooped poppy when a young, very slim woman said, ``I'll have tuna
on sesame, deep scoop.'' I understood now how New York women could
eat bagels without worrying about gaining weight. I called out my
order: ``Light cream cheese on poppy, deep scoop.''

MATADORS' PAIN WILL LINGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POCATELLO, Idaho _ The pain will sit for some time. Solid,
heavy, right in the middle of the gut. Like the time you ate the
chili right before going to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge's stomach feels that way now. And just how
long it stays embedded in the Matadors' midsection will dictate
whether it returns next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the underclassmen, and (quarterback) Marcus Brady, this
game right here has to put a taste in his mouth,'' CSUN junior
running back Jaumal Bradley said. ``This is for anyone who wears an
`N' on the side of their helmet to never forget _ moments like
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it that our seniors had to witness this and be a part
of this disappointing loss, but the underclassmen, it's a moment we
can never forget in this program's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Great example. And it reaches beyond Brady. The Matadors should
be preparing for the Division I-AA playoffs today. Instead, they're
evaluating a good season that should have been much better.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's inexplicable 32-29 loss Saturday at Idaho State will
someday represent what happens to the program. It will represent
whether the coaches and players become stronger and go on to the
lofty goals of not only a Big Sky title but a legitimate run at a
national title.
</P>
<P>
   Or this loss could symbolize the high point of a program that
could never quite get over the hump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for the seniors because some of them will never
play another game in their life,'' Brady said. ``I wish I could
have done something else for them. This is something we have to
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the Matadors are a shining example of the evil
of sport.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN was picked to finish seventh in the Big Sky Conference, yet
came within a win of the playoffs and finished tied for second. And
Brady, a redshirt freshman, proved he's not only the best young
quarterback in the league, but after throwing 26 touchdowns and 11
interceptions, perhaps the league's premier player.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN went 7-4, 5-3 in the Big Sky. It included an emotional win
against Montana and a stunning 31-point win against then-No. 13
Northern Arizona. The Matadors also climbed into the national
rankings for the first time, topping out at No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   But there is the other side. The ugly portion of the season that
is the reason CSUN is home. There was the loss to Sacramento State
in mid-October, and the horrific loss to 3-8 Idaho State when a win
would have sent the Matadors to the Division I-AA playoffs for the
first time. Those two losses, particularly the one to Idaho State,
tarnish the season. It turned what could have been a special fall
into a good but disappointing experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is it hurts right now,'' first-year coach Ron
Ponciano said. ``There's a lot of kids with tears in their eyes and
coaches have that feeling you can only get when you lose a game
like this. It's a pretty tough feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's offense should get better. With three offensive linemen
returning and a few other redshirts available, Brady should get
more time to throw to Aaron Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense needs to get better. In every area.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors' offense is of championship caliber. Yet, after the
Big Sky's worst team put up 32 points, the Matadors are out of the
playoffs. &QL; 
REPORT CARD &QL; 
Game: 11 &QL; 
Result: Idaho State 32, CSUN 29 &QL; 
Record: 7-4, 5-3 &QL; 
This week's GPA: 2.26 &QL; 
Cumulative GPA: 2.76 &QL; 
QUARTERBACK &QL; 
Marcus Brady did his job. He didn't play well early, throwing two
interceptions, but he rebounded to drive Cal State Northridge 79
yards to take the lead with 1:28 to play. &QL; 
B+ &QL; 
RUNNING BACKS &QL; 
Once again, the offensive line did a horrid job of blocking and the
running backs produced little. Jaumal Bradley and Melvin Blue
combined for 10 carries and 33 yards and weren't factors. &QL; 
C- &QL; 
RECEIVERS &QL; 
The Aaron Arnold-Brady connection should be fun next season. Arnold
became school's touchdown receiving leader after hauling in a pair
of TD passes to give him 21. His 12 this season ties a school mark.
He had 10 catches for 156 yards. &QL; 
A &QL; 
OFFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Another terrible day of run blocking and pass blocking. The running
game netted 56 yards and Brady was sacked five times and knocked
down a bunch more times. Four-year starter David San Vicente had a
tragic end to his career when he suffered a broken left leg in the
first half. &QL; 
C- &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Matadors could have used Sean Beard, Jacob Mageo or Mike Colunga _
all out with injuries. The worst offense in the league ran for 180
yards and threw for 264. Bettering this unit is a major recruiting
focus. &QL; 
C- &QL; 
LINEBACKERS &QL; 
Shayne Blakey came up with some big plays among his game-high 14
tackles, but not much else came of this position. Missed tackles
allowed Kennedy Nkeyasen and Craig Joseph to run for 148 yards. Too
many blown assignments. &QL; 
C &QL; 
DEFENSIVE BACKS &QL; 
Two memories will burn deeply during the offseason: Brian Goodell's
55-yard reception against cornerback Mel Miller and Donnell Day's
pass interference on the following play. Both came on Idaho State's
final drive. &QL; 
D+ &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL; 
Ethan Beck's missed PAT in the fourth quarter changed complexion of
the game as CSUN was forced to go for two-point conversion on next
touchdown, which failed. Three lost points in a three-point loss.
Beck did average 47.8 yards on four punts and kicked 47-yard field
goal. &QL; 
B &QL; 
COACHING &QL; 
The Matadors had a few big wins this season, but losses to
Sacramento State and Idaho State _ two of the worst teams in the
league _ will haunt the program until it makes the playoffs. Worst
team in the league knocked the first-place team out of the
playoffs. Not good. &QL;

STEVE JOBS' LATEST CAREER: MOVIE MOGUL  &HT;     BY JON SWARTZ 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - PIXAR   c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Jobs bounces giddily on a sofa in his modest office at
Pixar Animation Studios, anxious to show off his latest toys.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The fuzzy blue pill bugs, Tuck &AMP; Roll _ from the forthcoming
movie ``A Bug's Life'' _ are supposed to vibrate and spout
gibberish in childlike voices when squeezed. But it takes a few
attempts by Pixar's messianic CEO to get them buzzing. Their
batteries seem to be running low from overuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't they great?'' asks Jobs, 43, dressed in his usual garb
of black sweatshirt, jeans and running shoes. ``These are the types
of timeless, enduring characters we're trying to create at Pixar.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, _ the man who revolutionized the personal computer and is
resuscitating Apple Computer as interim CEO _ clearly relishes his
second career as movie mogul. And he is profiting from it _ his 70
percent stake in the company is worth $1.59 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Point Richmond company raises the curtain on
what is expected to be its second box-office hit, ``A Bug's Life,''
the highly anticipated encore to ``Toy Story.'' It is Pixar's
second computer-generated animated film co-produced with Walt
Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Director John Lasseter describes the movie _ the story of a
heroic, risk-taking ant named Flik who leads a revolution against
extortionist grasshoppers _ as ``an epic of miniature
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   He could also be describing the meteoric ascent of the
computer-animation studio under the charismatic Jobs. (Fittingly,
Jobs says his favorite ``Bug's Life'' character is Flik.)
</P>
<P>
   Pixar's market value is a staggering $2.27 billion. The
capitalization of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, by comparison, is $806.4
million _ and it has the largest film library &UR;  &LR; in Hollywood, with
4,000 titles. (Apple, Jobs' other employer, is valued at $4.85
billion.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Following years of fitful starts _ marked by short films,
software development and other projects _ Pixar hit the movie
mother load in 1995 with its first feature film. ``Toy Story''
became the third-highest grossing animated film of all time, with
$354 million in worldwide box-office revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Its startling performance gave Jobs the leverage he needed to
sweeten a five-picture deal with Disney last year. The companies
now share equal billing and split production costs and profits down
the middle _ a substantial improvement from the 10 to 15 percent
cut that Pixar previously had.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz on ``A Bug's Life'' is that it won't soar to the
stratospheric heights of ``Toy Story.'' Industry experts predict
the insect extravaganza _ which opens just six weeks after
DreamWorks' ``Antz,'' another insect-centric cartoon _ will rake in
a healthy $225 million worldwide. But more importantly, it should
yield a merchandising jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from McDonald's Corp. to Mattel Inc., Sony Corp., Dr
Pepper and Nestle is packaging ``A Bug's Life'' T-shirts, mugs,
books, video games, toothbrushes, 65 million Happy Meal toys, candy
bars and voice-activated dolls, such as Tuck &AMP; Roll. In all, there
are 60 marketing partners.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, Pixar could haul in $116 million
in license fees, box-office receipts, TV rights and video sales.
That would leave Pixar with a $66 million profit, after production
costs, according to analyst Curt Alexander of Media Group Research
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As a result, Pixar's bottom line should take off like a Buzz
Lightyear rocket booster. Company revenues from merchandising, TV
rights, video rentals and movie ticket sales should reach nearly
$179 million in 2000, &UR;  &LR; compared with $12.8 million this year (``A
Bug's Life'' revenues will count toward next year), according to
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   The quixotic Jobs is pursuing bigger game than blockbuster
movies, however.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to mold Pixar into the ``next Disney,'' a high-tech
studio that creates classic works in the vein of ``Snow White'' and
``Sleeping Beauty.'' The same man who changed computing for the
rest of us is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't like the PC market, which is a zero-sum game,''
Jobs said. ``When you buy a PC, that precludes buying another
machine. But if you make a good movie, the public will see it,
sometimes several times _ regardless of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened with ``Toy Story.'' Within days after its
runaway success in 1995, Pixar raised nearly $150 million in a
stock offering _ edging Netscape Communications as the biggest IPO
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pixar has the opportunity to become the first studio to build
brand name on a par with Disney,'' said Paul Noglows of Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist, one of Pixar's underwriters. ``People go to see Disney
films, not Paramount films. And soon they may go to see Pixar
films.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve helped me realize that there is a difference between
creating `A Bug's Life' and an iMac,'' says Lasseter, Pixar's vice
president-creative. ``Both are artistic endeavors, but an iMac
could be a paperweight in 10 years. We want to make timeless movies
that your grandchildren will watch.''
</P>
<P>
   An audacious goal perhaps, considering that Pixar has produced
only two features, but it is the kind of undaunted ambition you
might expect from a company headed by the high-tech wunderkind who
revolutionized the computer market with Apple.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve its status as a major moviemaker, Pixar is ramping up
production to roughly one movie a year. ``Toy Story 2'' is slated
for a late 1999 release, followed by a film code-named ``Hidden
City'' in 2000-01. The studio's fifth and sixth pictures are in
preproduction.
</P>
<P>
   To meet its ambitious timetable, Pixar has more than doubled in
size &UR;  &LR; since 1995 (from 175 employees to 450). In 2000, the company
will move into a larger facility on 16 acres of land it owns in
Emeryville.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a couple of decades make. Pixar's origins date
back to 1975, when it was the New York Institute of Technology, a
vocational school in Old Westbury, N.Y., co-founded by Ed Catmull,
Pixar's chief technologist.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, what by then was named Pixar languished as a
special-effects department at George Lucas' Industrial Light and
Magic in San Rafael. The co-founders soured after Lucas made it
clear he only wanted computer animation for special effects, not
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, who was ousted from Apple in 1985, bought Pixar from Lucas
for $10 million in 1986. He proceeded to spend another $50 million
out of his own pocket to keep the company afloat until 1991, when
Disney gave Pixar its big break _ a three-film contract that kicked
off with ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney expected a modest hit. Instead, they got ``a monster,''
Jobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no guarantee that this fairy tale will have a
happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Pixar faces several challenges. There is enormous pressure for
it to continue producing hits. If its next few movies fare poorly,
Disney could just as easily work with another computer-animation
upstart or make its own high-tech movie. (Disney's
``Dinosaurs,'' &UR;  &LR; its first in-house computer generated movie, is due
in 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both companies say the Disney-Pixar partnership
is solid.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Pixar continues to make smash hits, that
could free Jobs to start talks with other studios.
</P>
<P>
   Pixar also faces increased competition from other studios
churning out their own computer-generated movies. Fox's sci-fi
``Planet Ice'' and Industrial Light &AMP; Magic's ``Frankenstein''
remake are both due in 2000. DreamWorks' ``Antz,'' meanwhile, has
raked in $88 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many contend Pixar is years ahead of its rivals
because of technical superiority &UR;  &LR; and professional accolades.
Employees there have won 14 Academy Awards and written 50 papers on
high-tech graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent under this roof is extraordinary,'' says Lawrence
Levy, Pixar's CFO and conduit to Wall Street. ``I am humbled by the
people here. It's a pretty amazing stable of thoroughbreds.''

 CHRON - PIXARSIDE  
 PIXAR'S LASSETER _ THIS GENERATION'S WALT DISNEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY JON SWARTZ &QL;  &LR; 
Pixar Animation Studios'  &LR; other  &LR; computer legend is a lifelong
cartoon junkie and two-time Oscar winner &UR;  &LR; who cut his artistic
teeth at Walt Disney Co. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   John Lasseter evidently made a bold impression with his drawing
brush: Many claim that he is the real impetus behind Disney's
five-movie deal with the Point Richmond company.
</P>
<P>
   While company chief executive Steve Jobs graces the covers of
national magazines and is the subject of an upcoming made-for-TV
movie, Lasseter, Pixar's vice president-creative, generally is
considered the company's creative dynamo. &UR;  &LR; He directed both the
1995 hit ``Toy Story'' and ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Known for his Hawaiian T-shirts, ready laugh and infectious
playfulness, Lasseter, 41, is a favorite among Pixar's creative
troops and a self-professed ``kid at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I laugh very hard at work every day,'' Lasseter says. ``We
make sure everyone is part of the creative process, and we have a
lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the Walt Disney of our generation,'' Jobs says.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co. agrees. It thinks so much of Lasseter, it tried
to wrangle him away from Pixar three times before insisting that
Pixar sign him to a seven-year contract as part of the Disney-Pixar
agreement. Disney pays half of Lasseter's $700,000 salary, and his
Pixar stock options are worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is compensated as well as any top-flight director _ and
he's worth it,'' says analyst Paul Noglows, of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
``John and (Pixar co-founder) Ed Catmull make that place go.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasseter, a lifelong cartoon fanatic who joined Disney after
graduating from the California Institute of the Arts, is credited
with being the first to blend eye-popping graphics, technology and
meticulously crafted screenplays into full-length features.
</P>
<P>
   (Lasseter quickly became disillusioned with Disney's bureaucracy
and in 1984 joined filmmaker George Lucas' computer special-effects
group, which later became Pixar.)
</P>
<P>
   ``John was one of the first artists who wasn't afraid to embrace
the computer. He realized it enhanced, rather than compromised,
creativity,'' said Alvy Ray Smith, a former Pixar official who now
is a graphics fellow at Microsoft. ``John proved you could make
commercially and critically acclaimed movies for people of all
ages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story'' _ for which Lasseter won a special achievement
Academy Award _ is the third-highest grossing animated film of all
time. His 1988 Oscar-winning short film, ``Tin Toy,'' by contrast,
was a humorous look at what it's like for a small toy on its first
encounter with a drooling baby.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``We don't see many movies created for kids, teenagers and
adults,'' says Lasseter. ``It's extremely hard. You have to come up
with a story that is honest, clever and with a lot of subtext. You
can't resort to cheap laughs, vulgarity and double entendre.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasseter says he depends heavily on his and wife Nancy's ``own
test audience'' of five sons _ ages 16 months to 18. ``In a sense,
I'm an overgrown kid, too,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe it, just take a gander at Lasseter's Pixar
office, which could pass for an FAO Schwarz outlet. It is bursting
with ``Toy Story'' trinkets, an aquarium with moving toy fish, a
Hot Wheels collection and Three Stooges &UR;  &LR; paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is a microcosm of Pixar, &UR;  &LR; whose collegial campus
hallways are filled with kids and dogs.

 CHRON - AT&AMP;T  
 LOCAL TOLL CALLS MAY BECOME CHEAPER  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making a local toll call in the Bay Area could get cheaper if
state regulators approve a request from some telecommunications
companies and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp., MCI WorldCom and consumer groups plan to demand
today that state regulators force Pacific Bell to make it easier
for consumers to use competing carriers for local toll calls.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, if a Pac Bell customer in San Francisco picks up the
phone and dials a number in Oakland, Pac Bell collects a toll for
that call. Companies like AT&AMP;T and MCI are allowed to handle that
traffic _ known as local toll calls _ but not if consumers just
dial 1 plus the area code and number. Callers first must dial a
seven-digit special access code if they want to make a call with a
carrier other than Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications companies say that's not fair and plan to
ask the PUC to force Pac Bell to implement something known as
1-plus dialing. That would enable consumers to choose a company
they want to carry their local toll calls, the same way they choose
their long-distance provider.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups say this could drive down rates by fostering
competition between Pac Bell and rival carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But Pac Bell has balked at implementing 1-plus dialing, saying
it would give competitors an unfair advantage. Pac Bell, which
wants to offer long-distance service in California, says it should
not have to implement 1-plus dialing until it's allowed into
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be simultaneity into long-distance and local,''
said Bill Mashek, a spokesman for Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The company has good reason to want to protect the local toll
market _ it's a $1 billion business in California. About 25 percent
of all local toll calls made in the United States are made in
California.
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Telecommunications Act mandates that Baby Bells,
such as Pac Bell, share the wealth. The act requires that incumbent
carriers implement 1-plus dialing either when they get approval to
offer long-distance service or by Feb. 8, 1999, whichever comes
first. February 8 marks the three-year anniversary of the Telecom
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's unlikely that Pac Bell will gain approval to offer
long-distance by February 1, consumer groups and others say the PUC
needs to act now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not having 1-plus dialing is a very significant obstacle to
being able to fairly compete,'' said Les Kumagi, a spokesman for
MCI WorldCom. ``In most cases, people will just prefer to dial 1
plus the number and the call will default to Pac Bell. They get all
the traffic and revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Ratepayer Advocates, an independent arm of the
PUC, has filed letters in support of Pac Bell's competitors. ORA
said Pac Bell has had a lock on the local toll market for far too
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, our view is the PUC has to implement this as fast
as they can,'' said Natalie Billingsley, a telecommunications
expert at the Office of Ratepayer Advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely unlikely that Pac Bell will suffer any harm.
The purpose is to bring the benefits of competition to ratepayers,
particularly to residential ones. This would be an immediate,
direct benefit for consumers, and it's absolutely crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   ORA, AT&AMP;T and others will present their case to the PUC at a
preconference hearing this morning. A decision is unlikely today
but could be issued within a few weeks.

<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Last week, USC coach Paul Hackett said it
was ``incomprehensible'' that the Trojans could lose seven straight
games to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to come up with a stronger adjective to describe his
disbelief of eight straight losses. Officially, the Trojans took
themselves out of the game with seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   But how did a team that spent two weeks thinking about nothing
but UCLA manage to give perhaps its most uninspired performance in
the rivalry this decade?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to take because they're our cross-town rival and
we've had two weeks to prepare and it didn't mean anything,''
offensive lineman Travis Claridge said. ``We got outplayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when physically overmatched, USC has managed to stay within
seven points of the Bruins during the streak. This was UCLA's
widest margin of victory since 1986. And a far more comfortable
victory than the Bruins had against Stanford or Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   If you take away the turnovers it would have been closer, but
there were some troubling issues beneath the headline-grabbing
fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' game plan certainly seemed questionable. After
weeks of stubbornly throwing deep on most pass plays, USC tried to
nickel-and-dime UCLA's defense in the critical first half.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason was that R. Jay Soward was less than 100
percent, but there were plenty of times a 20-25 yard pass to Billy
Miller or Mike Bastianelli would have been welcomed relief from the
array of swing passes to the running backs and wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The stubborn refusal to implement a shotgun offense also proved
problematic Saturday. Although Carson Palmer made some terrific
moves, he never got enough time to throw. Ever since the Florida
State game, it's been obvious that the shotgun would help, because
this offensive line isn't going to get much better. Not even next
year.
</P>
<P>
   While the 17-point loss was troubling for USC, how embarrassing
would it be if this had been a nail-biter? USC had the ball in the
fourth quarter at UCLA's 21-yard line. It was fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Trojans, play had been stopped for several
minutes after UCLA's Kenyon Coleman was injured. That saved the
Trojans a timeout right? Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, USC vacillated on the sideline so long after
Coleman was taken off the field that it burned a timeout to avoid a
delay-of-game penalty. That's clock management, something that
always seems to arise in Trojans losses.
</P>
<P>
   There is a bright side. Palmer had three turnovers but showed
his brilliance by passing for 252 yards in his first exposure to
the rivalry. UCLA must have some incredible redshirt freshmen if
linebacker Brandon Ayanbadejo thinks Palmer is worse than Cade
McNown's backups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait till next year,'' Palmer said. ``I want to end
the streak next year.'' &QL;

<P>
   In the history of women in politics, November may go down as the
month Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, was re-elected secretary of the
Republican House leadership conference. Ms. Pryce won by a
unanimous vote, possibly nailing down the secretary job for years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   The post-election theme for women in politics is stasis. The
number of female senators is frozen at nine, and governors at
three. In the House, which added a couple of new women, Republicans
elected Ms. Pryce and Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida to the same
bottom two spots women held last term. Rep. Jennifer Dunn of
Washington took a shot at majority leader but came in third. Ms.
Fowler, a positive thinker, feels this should still be regarded as
progress: ``She's paving the way. No woman had ever run before.''
Barbara Sinclair, a professor of political science at the
University of California at Los Angeles, put the matter rather more
directly. At least a woman ran for a power post and ``people aren't
laughing at her.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people believed Ms. Dunn's quest for the majority leader's
post was doomed because she is pro-choice, at least in the
extremely narrow version that favors legal abortion but does not
worry much about who has access to it. The choice issue has been a
stumbling block for Republican women who get near the top of the
food chain, where the right-to-life lobby has considerable veto
powers. Others, including Ms. Fowler, say Ms. Dunn lost because she
got in the race late. That would fit rather tidily into the theory
that one of the reasons women have failed to reach the very top
levels of political power is that they are hesitant about running
for a job until the last detail of preparation is in place.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Dunn also had a lot of detractors who have not been
reading up on the theory of gender parity in politics. Some of them
claimed she was unsubstantial _ good at glossing over differences
and honey-coating political unpleasantness, but unwilling to make
hard choices. The downside of Ms. Dunn has to be taken in context.
This is a race in which the person who won was Dick Armey of Texas,
one of the participants in a plot to oust Speaker Newt Gingrich a
while back that failed after Armey got cold feet and ratted out his
fellow plotters. After he won a rather grueling re-election to the
No. 2 job in the House last week, Armey described the fight as a
``race of enthusiasm and energy and commitment to principles to
which we all have a good subscription.'' His powers of speech had
clearly been weakened by the strain of trying to look like a
gracious winner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn's remarks were very brief _ just a few sentences. But
she managed to fit in the word ``great'' three times, as well as a
``wonderful'' and a ``delighted.'' On the other hand, the guy who
came in second, Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma, sounded positively
sullen. Although his statement was even briefer than Ms. Dunn's,
Largent did take time to refer to his former career as a football
player. There are days when it seems as if the House of
Representatives has more jocks than the Dallas Cowboys' locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   The point here is not that the world is a darker place today
because Jennifer Dunn is not in the House leadership, but that when
a woman and a man compete for what has always been seen as a man's
job, the flaws in the woman's character seem more noticeable and
disturbing. They tend to be new flaws, and people who had gotten
used to being led by a right-wing bully who can't be relied on in a
pinch got very nervous at the idea of replacing him with a
mealy-mouthed woman who spins too much.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic minority, meanwhile, has elected an all-male
team. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut lost a fight for the
third-ranking post of conference chair to Martin Frost of Texas,
who turned out to be the first Jewish member elected to the party's
House leadership. That raised the dispiriting possibility that the
Democrats were still involved in carrying out their inclusionary
agenda for 1958. But the underlying dynamic was actually pretty
simple. A woman who is known for her speeches on bills before the
House was competing against the man who led the fund-raising effort
for Democrats running for re-election. She lost. This is not
chauvinism. This is life as we know it.

 NET FIRMS' NAMES GET STRANGER
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - NET FILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   At least $25,000 if you're one of the Bay Area consultants paid
by Internet startups to come up with a catchy name to distinguish
them in crowded cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps billions of dollars in market cap value if you're one
of the startups with a name that catches on with the public and
Wall Street. If you don't believe it, consider the value of
Amazon.com, which is unprofitable but worth an estimated $9.53
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Because style seems to rule over substance in the market's
evaluation of some Net stocks, many ventures are putting as much
thought into their names as into their business plans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Names create centrifugal force. People are drawn to them,''
says Rick Bragdon of Idiom, a naming consultant in San Francisco.
``I don't know how it happens, but it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyberspace is an entirely linguistic experience; it is filled
with innovative, condensed words,'' said Ira Bachrach, president of
NameLab Inc., the San Francisco company that helped name Compaq
Computer (formerly, believe it or not, Gateway Computers Inc.),
CompUSA and the Acura car. ``To make an impact, you have to come up
with something special that sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Fogdog Sports ( &LR; www.fogdog.com &LR; ), a San Jose
online seller of sports equipment, debuted in a splashy downtown
press conference highlighted by a Zamboni race on Battery Street
between the Stanford Tree and Oski, the Cal Bear mascot. (It was a
tie.)
</P>
<P>
   The wacky promotion garnered plenty of attention and was a goofy
photo op, but the real work went into coming up with the firm's
unusual name. (According to the Random House College dictionary, it
means ``a bright spot sometimes seen in a fog bank.'')
</P>
<P>
   Company officials spent about a month narrowing their choices
from a list of 1,000 prospective names supplied by Idiom in San
Francisco. They chose Fogdog over the likes of Hero Canyon, Game
Seven and 360 Sports because it conveys the rugged individualism of
Fogdog's customers, company chief executive Tim Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after the athletes who want to climb Mount
McKinley, the enthusiasts interested in high-quality apparel,''
said Harrington, who is trying to differentiate his company from
the roster of online sports stores (ESPN SportsZone, CBS
SportsLine, Sports Superstore Online, etc.) that hawk branded gear
from Major League Baseball, the NFL and NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-person company originally was Cedro Group (after a
Stanford dorm the three co-founders lived in) before making the
switch to SportSite.com and eventually Fogdog Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Like most companies, Fogdog still had to pay an East Coast man
an undisclosed sum for rights to the obscure word after discovering
that he owned the domain name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name is a foundation for a company's identity, but you
must build on that with effective marketing,'' said John Hudson,
principal of Luxon Carra, the San Francisco strategic brand
consultants that came up with the monikers for Marimba and
Informix.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people hear Amazon these days, many think of an online
bookstore instead of the river,'' Hudson said. ``That's because
Amazon used its name as a lever to stick in the public's
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the origins for some of the Net's most famous names
come from their founders, not high-priced consultants. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _Amazon.com. Founder Jeff Bezos originally called the online
service Cadabra, as in abracadabra. But when a trademark attorney
mistook it for Cadaver, Bezos went to Plan B. He changed the name
to Amazon, after the South American river, ``because it holds more
water than any other river,'' a company spokeswoman said.
``Amazon.com has more book titles than any other company,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   _Yahoo. Company lore alternately has it that inspiration came
from the acronym Yet Another Horrifically Officious Oracle; the
unruly ruffians from the book ``Gulliver's Travels''; or co-founder
David Filo's father, who called him a ``little yahoo'' during his
childhood in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   _Excite. It originally was called Architext, before company
officials thought better and hired a consultant. Other names
considered were Bullseye, Swoop and Ferret. The Internet guide
today would be called Bullseye if the trademark had not been taken.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think are the best and worst Internet company names?
Drop me an e-mail at  &LR; jswartz &LR; sfgate.com. &LR;  We'll post the results
in a future column.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NAME RECOGNITION: You probably remember  &LR; bigger.net, the San Jose
startup that promised unlimited, lifetime Internet access for $60
but collapsed under money problems last month.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The company's 40,000 subscribers apparently were bailed out at
the last minute when another Internet service provider,
Brigadoon.com, bought  &LR; bigger.net's assets from a U.S. Bankruptcy
Court trustee.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the saga isn't over. Brigadoon.com, of
Bellevue, Wash., itself is ensnared in Chapter 11 reorganization
proceedings, and  &LR; bigger.net customers have e-mailed and called
during the past few weeks to gripe about spotty service. They want
to know who to call because there is no technical support.
</P>
<P>
   Help is on the way, according to Brigadoon.com President Bill
Parker. As of today, the online service is switching to a national
backbone provider for quicker and more stable connections.
Information is available at  &LR; www.bigger.net &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   FINDING THE CHRONICLE: Until a few weeks ago, you couldn't
access the San Francisco Chronicle's online edition by typing
 &LR; www.sfchronicle.com &LR;  on your Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   It was  &LR; sfgate.com,  &LR; and nothing else. That decision stretched
back to late 1994, when the San Francisco Newspaper Agency _ which
publishes The Chronicle and Examiner _ decided to create an online
service for both dailies, called The Gate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Things changed a few months ago, though, after Gate officials
took note of cybersquatters who legally register Net addresses that
resemble newspaper names and then post controversial material on
those sites.
</P>
<P>
   It reached a nadir last month, when readers attempting to access
a dozen major papers _ including the San Jose Mercury News and San
Francisco Examiner _ got the ramblings of a former Ku Klux Klan
leader and ex-con instead of news, weather and sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want that to happen to us, and we wanted to offer
alternative addresses,'' said Chris Hallenbeck, the Gate's
quality-assurance manager.
</P>
<P>
   You can now read the cyberedition of The Chronicle at
 &LR; www.sfchronicle.com &LR;  and  &LR; sfgate.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &LR; STH  &LR; Site of the Week: The mother of all conspiracies turned 35
yesterday. Theories abound over who killed John F. Kennedy, but
there is little dispute on where to go for the official lowdown.
The JFK Assassination Records Collection ( &LR; www.nara.gov &LR; 
 &LR; /nara/jfk/jfk.html &LR; /) contains more than 70,000 &UR;  &LR; pages of FBI and
National Security Council records.

<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ It took a while, but this college football
season may finally have short-circuited the computers. How? After
the three undefeated teams at the top of the polls played big games
Saturday, all three _ Tennessee, UCLA and Kansas State _ remained
undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   Something was supposed to happen to make the new Bowl
Championship Series ranking shake out. Nothing did.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the calculators will recalculate some static numbers
and the Bowl Championship Series will remain pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers remain the No. 1 team in The Associated Press
news media poll; the Wildcats are No. 1 in the USA Today/ESPN poll
of coaches. And both polls agree that the Bruins are No. 3. The New
York Times computer ranking continues to put Florida State at No.
1, followed by Tennessee, Kansas State and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, when the Bowl Championship Series ranking _ which will
determine the teams for the national title game _ is released, it
will probably look the same as it did last week: Tennessee (10-0)
on top, with UCLA (10-0) second and Kansas State (11-0) third.
Kansas State should close the gap on UCLA, though, as a result of
its 31-25 victory over Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   With the season drawing to a close, and with it the
all-important data the new ranking system needs, are the Bowl
Championship Series gurus getting nervous?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' said Charles Bloom, the bowl series
spokesman. ``It has people talking _ good or bad. It's put the
focus on the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the talk sounds pretty much the same as it
did before quartiles and decimal points were turned over to Big
Brother to help decide which teams were the nation's No. 1 and No.
2. Now the sounds of late November echo the days when the news
media and the coaches selected their top teams. As last year when
Michigan and Nebraska shared the national crown.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign began as soon as each of the three teams beat their
opponents Saturday and checked the scoreboard and saw that the
others had done the same. ``We could have scored 80,'' was the
slogan Tennessee's Cedric Wilson chose after six different
Volunteers scored en route to a 59-21 thumping of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Out West, UCLA Coach Bob Toledo took a more earnest tone. His
Bruins had just won their 20th straight game _ the nation's longest
current winning streak _ and beaten its crosstown rival, Southern
Cal, 34-17, for the eighth consecutive year. ``Our team is good
enough to win 20 games in a row,'' Toledo said. ``Our team's good
enough to win the Pac-10 championship. Our team's good enough to
compete with anyone in the country. If we beat Miami, we should go
to the Fiesta Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State's victory over Missouri means the Wildcats have won
19 straight, are in the Big 12 championship game and deserve to be
mentioned alongside the Volunteers and Bruins, even if Kansas State
Coach Bill Snyder wasn't overwhelmed by a performance in which his
team gave up 440 yards and committed 105 yards in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I look at is how well you're playing,'' Snyder said.
``Are we getting better? Are we playing well? And I wasn't real
pleased with a lot of things we did. That was what was on my mind
coming off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bowl Championship Series ranking is running out of
wiggle room. Tennessee has a game against hapless Vanderbilt and
then a date in the Southeastern Conference championship game _
against either Mississippi State or Arkansas. UCLA has one game
left _ against Miami in a contest that was postponed because of
Hurricane Georges. And Kansas State faces Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Before tossing the bowl ranking into the college football
lexicon, its gurus applied its formula to the last 10 seasons. Only
once, in 1992, did three teams finish unbeaten. By the Bowl
Championship Series standard, Miami was No. 1, Alabama was No. 2
and Texas A&AMP;M was No. 5. It turned out to be a good year for poll
voters when Alabama beat Miami in the Sugar Bowl and an undisputed
champion was crowned.
</P>
<P>
   So the Bowl Championship Series organizers had a small chance of
having their inaugural ranking cause more confusion than clarity.
Their mantra all year has been: ``We're only trying to identify the
top two teams.'' Now they have three, two of them separated by
fractions.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if Tennessee, UCLA and Kansas State complete
perfect seasons? (The very thing that organizers created the
ranking to get away from.) ``The subjective polls weigh heavily and
will decide one and two,'' Bloom conceded.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, same as it ever was. And about as cruel as John
Cooper and Ohio State finally beating Michigan only to clear the
way for Wisconsin to go to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The media poll still has too much influence. The coaches' poll,
too.
</P>
<P>
   In a very possible scenario, Tennessee could face UCLA in the
Fiesta Bowl. The coaches have declared that game their championship
and will award their national title to the winner. In the Orange
Bowl, Kansas State would play Florida State (11-1). Should the
Wildcats win, the media poll would choose them the national
champion.
</P>
<P>
   No one really wants these three splendid unbeaten teams to lose,
but Bowl Championship Series organizers must be fighting the
impulse to hope that one of them goes down.
</P>
<P>
   But how is this for an upside? Isn't it fun to think that there
isn't a computer smart enough to figure out something as simple as
college football?

EDITORIAL: MARIE CURIE AND A CENTURY OF RADIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23:
</P>
<P>
   When Marie Curie died on July 4, 1934, Albert Einstein remarked
that she was, ``of all celebrated beings, the only one whom fame
has not corrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a century since Curie and her husband, Pierre, who
died in 1906, discovered polonium and radium, just a century since
she coined the word ``radioactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Their discoveries brought the Curies worldwide fame, and yet
fame, ironically, made the name Curie a byword for modesty. The
laboratory in which their most important work was done was only a
former storeroom and machine shop, and they always refused, Marie
Curie wrote, ``to draw from our discovery any material profit.''
</P>
<P>
   A small exhibition devoted to Marie Curie has been mounted at
the New York Academy of Sciences. It suggests that the history of
radioactivity during the past century divides into two parts,
before 1934, when natural radioactivity was the focus of scientific
study, and after 1934, when the first man-made radioactive elements
were created.
</P>
<P>
   Most lay people are likely to feel that the century divides a
little more neatly than that: before 1945 _ when the first atomic
bombs were detonated _ and after 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Curie died as a result of exposure to radioactivity, some
of it incurred while preparing radium for medical use. A century
has passed since she discovered that radioactivity was a property
of atoms, and we are still adding up the balance sheet, still
trying to weigh the lives saved or improved by the scientific
exploration of radioactivity against the lives lost or inalterably
worsened.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The Russian reform movement has produced few leaders with an
uncompromising dedication to democracy. Galina Starovoitova was
one, and her murder in St. Petersburg on Friday was a terrible loss
for Russia. In a bleak season of economic collapse and political
timidity, the killing can only heighten fears that Russia is
slipping into an ugly era of intolerance and political violence.
</P>
<P>
   Initial evidence suggests that the killing was a political
assassination. Ms. Starovoitova was gunned down in the lobby of her
apartment building, shot three times in the head, typical of
Russian contract killings. She was a member of the Russian
parliament and a recently declared candidate for governor of the
region around St. Petersburg. In recent weeks she had spoken out
forcefully against political extremism, denounced the anti-Semitic
statements of a Communist parliamentarian and was campaigning
aggressively against financial corruption in the St. Petersburg
municipal government.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Starovoitova's activities were fully in character with a
career built around principles of liberty, tolerance and the rule
of law. She championed democracy and human rights long before they
became politically acceptable in Moscow, and courageously stood by
Boris Yeltsin and other reformers as Russia struggled to find a new
political course when the Soviet Union disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   An ethnographer by training, Ms. Starovoitova proved to be a
skillful and effective politician. She first gained national
attention a decade ago when she set aside her academic work about
the ethnic history of Leningrad and ran successfully for a seat in
the Soviet parliament from Armenia, a startling victory for a
Russian. She later represented St. Petersburg in the Russian
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Starovoitova was a woman of irrepressible energy and
infectious enthusiasm. But her good humor and quick smile belied a
steely commitment to combat the corruption and ethnic divisions
that she correctly considered to be the enemies of Russian
democracy. The least Yeltsin can do is to hunt down her killers and
bring them to trial. That would be the exception in a nation where
political violence is rarely prosecuted. Her countrymen can honor
her memory by following her example.

`RUGRATS'   PLAYS TO TOP RUNG AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The opening of ``The Rugrats Movie'' scooted to an
impressive victory at the nation's multiplexes with $28 million at
2,782 theaters to dominate a robust weekend at the nation's box
office during Friday-Sunday, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The results gave Paramount's family comedy a record opening for
a non-Disney animated film, shattering the $20.3 million mark set
two years ago by ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head Do America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic,'' said studio distribution chief Wayne
Lewellen. ``It's well beyond what we expected. To do this level of
business, `Rugrats' had to expand well beyond kids and parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The $25 million project, centered on the arrival of a baby to
the Pickles family, will likely take in at least $100 million by
the end of its run, according to Robert Bucksbaum, president of the
Reel Source forecasting service. ``The TV series has been on the
air since the early '90s, so there were a lot of teen-agers who
went to this movie,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake &AMP; Co. said ``Rugrats''
exemplifies Hollywood's ``narrow-casting'' approach of backing
projects targeted toward a specific audience. ``The risk is
negligible and if you do it right, you get a good cross-over at the
box office,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``Enemy of the State,'' starring Will Smith as an
innocent man pursued by government agents, opened solidly in second
with $20.3 million at 2,393 theaters. Bucksbaum said Disney made a
smart move to highlight the comic aspects of the thriller in its
promotional campaign, noting, ``People are in the mood for comedy
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney also scored respectable returns for its third weekend of
``The Waterboy'' with $15.8 million at 2,689 screens. The Adam
Sandler comedy ended Sunday with $100.3 million after 17 days,
becoming the 11th film this year and the 177th in history to hit
$100 million in domestic grosses. Additionally, Disney's one-screen
opening of ``A Bug's Life'' at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood
sold out every show and took in $291,000, topping by $17,000 the
venue's weekend record set in 1995 by ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life,'' which has received excellent reviews, will go
into 2,600 theaters Wednesday and Disney marketing executive Chuck
Viane noted the studio is well-positioned with a trio of attractive
offerings to take advantage of heavy moviegoing during the
Thanksgiving holiday. ``We think the upcoming period will be a
record-setter for the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also opening Wednesday will be Universal's ``Babe: Pig in the
City'' and a pair of comedy-dramas: Warner Bros.' ``Home Fries''
with Drew Barrymore and PolyGram's ``Very Bad Things'' with Cameron
Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Strong performance by the weekend's top three films held down
results for two entries in their second weekends _ Universal's
high-priced drama ``Meet Joe Black'' and Sony's ``I Still Know What
You Did Last Summer.'' ``Joe'' lost 43 percent of its audience and
finished fourth with $8.6 million at 2,505 sites, while ``I Still
Know'' plunged 56 percent to $7.2 million at 2,443 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Industry trackers believe the lukewarm performance by ``Meet Joe
Black,'' with $27.2 million after 10 days, helped lead to last
week's resignation by Universal Studios chief Frank Biondi Jr. The
studio's hitless streak now stretches to 18 and goes back to ``The
Lost World: Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The third weekend of ``The Siege'' came in a distant sixth with
$3.5 million at 2,447 theaters as the thriller lost 57 percent of
its audience from the previous weekend. 20th Century Fox is likely
to take a major loss on the $70 million project, now with $32
million after 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's second weekend of ``I'll Be Home for Christmas''
continued to disappoint with $2.5 million at 1,776 theaters,
followed by New Line's fifth weekend of ``Pleasantville'' with $2.4
million at 1,715 screens and DreamWorks' eighth weekend of
computer-animated ``Antz'' with $2.3 million at 2,002 sites.
``Antz'' has topped $84 million overall but many analysts expect
``A Bug's Life'' to double that total.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax posted a 10th place finish for its opening of Woody
Allen's ``Celebrity,'' a comic look at life in Manhattan's fast
lane starring Kenneth Branagh, with $1.6 million at 493 theaters.
``Celebrity'' beat New Line's fourth weekend of ``Living Out Loud''
with $1.4 million at 1,087 screens and Gramercy's third weekend of
Academy Award contender ``Elizabeth'' with $1.4 million at 144
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Searchlight's Irish comedy ``Waking Ned Devine,'' another
Oscar hopeful, opened respectably with $140,000 at nine locations.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business took in $104 million, up 15 percent over the
same weekend last year. Year-to-date business has topped $5.8
billion and remains 10 percent ahead of the same period of 1997.
``The numbers continue to be incredible, and I don't see any
slowdown on the horizon,'' Rockwell said. ``The holiday season
hasn't really even started yet.''

MINORITY BALLOTS BECOME AN ISSUE IN ATTORNEY GENERAL TALLY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the final ballots are being counted in the tight
race for state attorney general, Democratic leaders are charging
that the campaign of Dennis Vacco, the Republican incumbent, has
mounted a concerted effort to invalidate paper ballots in black and
Hispanic areas, particularly in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Vacco was trailing his Democratic opponent, Eliot
Spitzer, by 19,646 votes, with fewer than 15,000 votes to be
counted. The final tally is expected early this week.
</P>
<P>
   Because the contest is so close, Vacco and Spitzer have been
scrutinizing the 200,000 absentee and other paper ballots with
unusual vigor. The two sides have challenged nearly 13,000 paper
ballots, essentially setting them aside and rendering them
uncounted, unless a judge decides otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But Vacco's efforts in traditionally Democratic minority
neighborhoods have angered many Democratic officials. In some
districts, more than two-thirds of the paper ballots have been
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the 74th Assembly District, which includes
largely Hispanic and black sections of the South Bronx, a total of
600 paper ballots were cast, but only 171 have been counted.
Vacco's campaign objected to 429, citing problems like a
fingerprint on a ballot or a ballot that was slightly bent. Of the
paper ballots that were counted, 146 were cast for Spitzer, and 25
were for Vacco. Similar challenges occurred in several Brooklyn
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a pattern that brings up the ghost of
disenfranchisement,'' said Keith Wright, an Assemblyman from Harlem
who is chairman of the Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative
Caucus. ``People have died for the right of people of color to
vote,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, chairman of the Bronx
Democratic Party organization, said, ``There is no question that
there is a focus and concentrated effort to challenge ballots in
the minority community,'' adding that the Vacco campaign had
crossed the line ``that separates having an accurate and fair
counting of ballots and an abuse of the law in order to delay the
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   State Republican officials dismissed such accusations as
partisan, saying Vacco's campaign had been no more aggressive in
the city than the Spitzer campaign had been in objecting to the
paper ballot in traditionally Republican areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are challenging ballots themselves,'' said Terry O'Brien,
a spokesman for the state Republican Party. He added, ``If you
check the traditionally strong Republican areas in the state, you
will see the same thing,'' offering Saratoga County and the suburbs
of Buffalo, in Erie County, as examples.
</P>
<P>
   But in Saratoga County, where Vacco beat Spitzer in the machine
count by a ratio of nearly 2 &UR; - &LR; to &UR; - &LR; 1, only 10 ballots were
challenged out of a total of 2,500, according to Board of Elections
officials there. And in all of Erie County, Vacco's home terrain,
only 134 of 10,334 absentee ballots were challenged.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the 56th Assembly District, which is dominated
by black voters and includes the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of
Brooklyn, the Vacco campaign challenged 434 of the 591 paper
ballots. And in the 58th Assembly District, which includes the East
New York section of Brooklyn, the Vacco campaign challenged 445 out
of 669 paper ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Spargo, a lawyer for Vacco's campaign, said he did not
consider the number of challenges to be any higher than those
lodged by the Spitzer campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel they are of the same relative quality,'' Spargo said.
``We anticipated where Dennis Vacco would be doing well, there
would be a large number of ballots set aside by the Spitzer
campaign. And as a matter of overall strategy, I wanted to make
sure that we made an equal number of objections.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vacco's lawyers have also gone to court, charging that the
number of votes reported on election night did not correspond to
the totals released by the Board of Elections a week later. As a
result, Justice Thomas Keegan of State Supreme Court in Manhattan
ruled that the campaigns could inspect the 7,000 voting machines in
New York City again and report their findings to the court on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Months before the Nov. 3 election, the focus was on the U.S.
Senate contest between Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican incumbent,
and Charles Schumer, the Democratic challenger. Expecting that the
election could well be decided by paper ballots, party officials
reached an agreement that any paper ballot that either side
contested would be set aside. The court would later determine
whether they would be considered valid.
</P>
<P>
   While Schumer won the election decisively, the contest for
attorney general proved to be the close one, with Spitzer securing
an election night lead of just 18,000 votes of more than 4 million
cast. Each side assembled teams of lawyers and campaign
representatives to scrutinize the paper ballots.
</P>
<P>
   When party representatives examine the paper ballots, they do
not see how the person voted, but they do know the makeup of the
district and how it voted in the machine ballots.
</P>
<P>
   State election laws state that paper ballots may not have any
stray markings. But campaign officials have challenged ballots for
items like having a check mark slightly outside the box and having
a signature that dips slightly below the line.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a campaign representative objected to paper ballots
because the voters, when asked their county of residence, wrote
Brooklyn rather than Kings. In another case, an absentee ballot was
challenged because the voter, when asked why she was unable go to
the polls, wrote that she would be in the ``Holy Land.'' The
campaign representative objected because she stated no specific
country.

BRACED FOR BIOTECH'S UPS, DOWNS  &HT;     BY TOM ABATE
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - QUEEN   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cary Queen knows firsthand how long it can take to turn a
scientific advance into products _ and profits.
</P>
<P>
   As the chief research scientist and co-founder of Protein Design
Labs in Fremont, Queen enjoyed 15 minutes of fame in 1988, when he
helped invent a biotech compound that could zero in on a virus and
knock it out.
</P>
<P>
   This compound, called a monoclonal antibody, was hailed in the
headlines of the day as the silver bullet that would seek out and
destroy diseases at the molecular level.
</P>
<P>
   But it took scientists at PDL and other biotech firms 10 more
years of trial and error to produce drugs like Herceptin, which
recently went on the market to fight breast cancer, and Zenapax,
which helps kidney transplant patients live with their donated
organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long lag time between discoveries in the lab and
products in the marketplace,'' said Queen, who only now is starting
to see two sources of money flow into the coffers of his publicly
traded firm.
</P>
<P>
   One source of income is from royalties on Zenapax, which PDL
designed and helped bring to market. The other, more unusual
revenue source comes from licensing Queen's patented technique for
designing monoclonal antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``PDL has significant intellectual property that is going to
bring them a tidy little revenue stream for the next few years,''
said Joff Baker, vice president for research at Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech, which used Queen's technology to make Herceptin,
recently signed a $6 million patent-royalty deal with PDL, giving
Queen's firm its first quarterly profit in years.
</P>
<P>
   For Queen, who began his scientific career as a mathematician in
the late 1970s, the success of his patent vindicates his decision
to switch fields to biotechnology in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After getting his on-the-job training as a molecular biologist
at the National Cancer Institute, Queen linked up with Stanford
biologist Laurence Korn in the late 1980s to found PDL.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, they focused on what was then the hot science of
custom-designing antibodies to fight specific diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Queen and Korn weren't the first researchers to create
monoclonal antibodies _ compounds that float through the
bloodstream with the single-minded mission of locating a disease
target and then latching on to the invader to prevent it from doing
harm.
</P>
<P>
   But Queen contributed a key refinement to this
search-and-destroy technology. When the early monoclonal antibodies
bumped into their targets, the force of this microscopic collision
actually crushed the antibody's latching mechanism. Queen figured
out how to add just enough molecular support to stiffen the
antibody at the point of impact.
</P>
<P>
   PDL patented this concept of molecular bracing. According to
Queen, Genentech and 18 other companies already have signed
agreements to pay PDL royalties entitling them to use this patented
technique.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Sendek, a biotech stock analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison
in New York, said the income from Queen's patent should total
several million dollars a year for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Most biotech firms exist in a race against time. They hope their
venture capital or initial stock sales carry them through the years
it takes to develop winning drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sendek considers the patent PDL's financial ace in the hole. He
said PDL is a good investment because it has the assured income
from patent licensing, plus the chance for larger profits from the
sales of Zenapax and other drugs still in development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fabulous company that is poised to do well,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, investors have not shared his bullishness.
PDL's shares hit a 52-week high of $47.75 last December, when the
Food and Drug Administration gave the company the green light to
sell Zenapax.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the stock has lost nearly 42 percent of its
value. It closed at $22.88 Friday, down 63 cents. The company has a
market capitalization of $424 million. In the first three quarters
of 1998, it booked a $4.3 million loss on revenues of $24.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Sendek argued that investors had expected PDL to get a sudden
rush of revenue from Zenapax, and when the first few months of
royalties proved disappointing, they punished the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market overreacted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Willian Tanner, with Vector Securities in Chicago,
has taken a wait-and-see approach to PDL until Zenapax proves
itself successful. ``There are drugs that get approved that don't
sell very well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said PDL also faces two other competing technologies for
creating monoclonal antibodies. Companies like Genentech are
evaluating these alternatives to PDL's approach and could choose to
use them in the future instead of licensing PDL's technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they'll be the only game in town forever,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Queen has learned to take Wall Street's ups and downs in stride.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company has about $145 million in the bank, annual
expenses running about $12 million, and income from his patent
worth several million a year for the next few years at very least.
</P>
<P>
   All of that gives PDL financial stability while its scientific
team hunts for what he jokingly called ``the next Viagra.''

SCOPE OF SMUGGLING RING STUNS AN ENCLAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Fla., Texas, India)  (lb) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISELIN, N.J. _ On a crisp November Sunday, Oak Tree Road was the
picture of a thriving South Asian immigrant enclave. The windows of
gold jewelers sparkled with 22-karat necklaces. Shoppers came in
and out of the markets, arms loaded with sacks of vegetables and
spices from home. Families loaded up on fresh fried samosas and
platefuls of crispy, sweet jeelebis inside the many sweet shops
along the busy suburban strip.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, just under the sunny surface was a palpable
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   By indicting 31 people worldwide last week, in an international
smuggling operation that brought thousands of illegal immigrant
workers from the Indian subcontinent, federal law-enforcement
officials struck at a ring that brought in a constant supply of
cheap, often illegal, labor. The supply from that ring, merchants
here say, helps drive this thriving ethnic enclave.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, just days after the small, unpleasant secrets of
their community had been exposed, business owners up and down Oak
Tree Road expressed fear about the prospect of immigration raids
and increased scrutiny by federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   None of the merchants along Oak Tree Road would allow their
names to be used. But they said they worried that the arrests in
connection with the smuggling ring _ which federal agents say was
headed by a man based in the Bahamas named Nitin Shettie, also
known as Nick Diaz _ would lead its members to report on other
smugglers and the business owners who rely on them to bring in
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call it jealousy,'' said a shopkeeper, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity, ``or you can call it competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of one restaurant said Sunday that the New Jersey men
who were indicted last week were known smugglers, but that their
organization was only one of many that shopkeepers could turn to if
they needed extra workers.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, the merchants pointed out, two of Iselin's most
prominent shop owners were arrested on charges of immigrant
smuggling and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Ramnik Patel, the owner of Ajay Cash and Carry and Mayur Cash
and Carry, and his son, Ajay, were among four Indians accused of
bringing Indian immigrants into the United States on temporary
entertainment visas.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. attorney's office in Newark, the
immigrants came as part of legitimate music and dance troupes and
stayed on illegally after the troupes left. Kanubhai Patel, who is
listed as a principal of Mayur and as the owner of a candy store in
Jersey City, was also arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The ring uncovered last week came to the attention of
immigration authorities several months ago when one of the deals
went awry, according to a lawyer representing two of the smuggled
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Suresh Dalal of Woodbridge, said that five illegal
immigrants were arrested by immigration authorities in Miami on
their way from the Bahamas to New Jersey. The smugglers bailed them
out at $5,000 apiece, and, once the immigrants were in New Jersey,
tacked the penalty onto their $20,000 smuggling fee.
</P>
<P>
   Dalal said the financial dispute that ensued ultimately led one
of the illegal immigrants to tip off the federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Dalal, who represents two men from the western Indian state of
Gujarat, said his clients had been flown to the Bahamas, where they
boarded a ship to Miami with more than 20 others from the
subcontinent. From there, they were brought to a house in Jersey
City, where they remained for a day or two until a friend or an
employer paid the smuggling fees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them, he said, found work at Indian shops in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials involved in the investigation said they were
approached a year ago by an immigrant in Dallas who detailed the
smuggling operation. In Dallas, Paul Coggins, the U.S. attorney
there, said in an interview Sunday that by the time immigration
agents in Dallas had found smuggled immigrants with false
documents, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was already
pursuing the case elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Several disparate investigations then appeared to coalesce,
immigration agents in Dallas said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
Russell Bergeron, declined to comment Sunday on how the smuggling
ring was uncovered by his agency.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, officials with the U.S. attorney's office in Texas
and New Jersey unsealed indictments in what federal authorities
described as the largest immigrant smuggling ring ever uncovered in
the United States. Of those indicted, 10 are still at large,
according to the U.S. attorney's office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Neither the smuggling patterns nor its routes are new.
</P>
<P>
   At least since the 1980s, illegal immigrants from India,
Bangladesh and Pakistan have flown first to Europe, which is
usually easier than going directly to the United States. Then they
have gone to Latin America or the Caribbean and either walked
across the Mexican border or sailed near Miami, sometimes swimming
to shore.
</P>
<P>
   For years, they have put themselves in the hands of smugglers
who, for a hefty fee, acted as their travel agents. And they have
been easily absorbed in the thriving enclave economy.
</P>
<P>
   What made this smuggling operation stand out, immigration
officials said, was the vast number of employers who had tapped
into it in search of workers. Bergeron said most other immigrant
smuggling rings are connected to only a small handful of employers.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey's Indian community, it was the scope of the ring
that was a surprise. In three years, federal officials said, it
smuggled into the United States as many as 12,000 illegal
immigrants, mostly from India, but also from Pakistan, Afghanistan
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen nothing like this, nothing of this magnitude,'' said
Rohit Vyas, the news director of TV Asia, a cable station catering
to the area's South Asians. ``I think the community better start
looking at itself a little more closely.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE JETS CRACK THE VAULT
</HEADLINE>
   (With FBN-JETS-OILERS, FBN-ANDERSON-COLUMN) 
(mk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ The New York Jets had won six of seven games and
four in a row and then crashed last week at Indianapolis. Lesson
learned. The Tennessee Oilers had won five of six and three in a
row and then crashed here Sunday against the Jets. Lesson learned?
</P>
<P>
   For the Oilers, maybe. It was, indeed, a painful punch.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-3 game at halftime turned into a 24-3 Jets rout here at
Vanderbilt Stadium. At times, the Oilers looked confused,
dispirited, spun in their own mess and, well, they looked like the
team that usually plays here, the college edition, the 2-8
Vanderbilt Commodores.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers ran 53 plays and averaged 4.2 yards a play and seemed
to be running while tied to a tree. They punted seven times and for
nearly the final 33 minutes of the game did not score a point. In
the first quarter, they gained seven yards and ran three plays and
had the ball for a measly 1 minute 20 seconds. That meant the Jets
had it for the other 13:40 of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Oilers righted themselves and produced a better
second quarter on offense, the bottom line was the Oilers defense
was going to tire in the second half. After all of that first-half
effort, the Oilers defense was likely going to be burned because of
overload.
</P>
<P>
   And this, too: Somewhere in the second half of a game tied 3-3
at halftime, one team is likely going to put its staple on the
affair. Its imprint. One team will likely crack the vault, pick the
lock, blow open the door. That team was the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 3-3 and we had a great shot to win it,'' said the
Oilers running back Eddie George. ``They made it happen. They
cracked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Jets crack it, they owned it. They made the
Oilers, in the end, look inept. Nothing like the team that had been
streaking so boldly in the last three weeks with two victories over
Pittsburgh and a victory at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Several Oilers talked later about how the Jets appeared to know
too much about them. They said it was as if the Jets had been in
their practices all week and in their huddles during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good game plan,'' said Jeff Fisher, the Oilers'
coach. ``Obviously, they had a good game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the Jets' plan: Tackle well, stop the run and contain
the quarterback, Steve McNair. Allow him little mobility and no
wild, running scrambles for big yards or touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets offense left the Oilers defense shaking its head, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``For six or seven games now, those guys on offense have come
out and showed something different from what they had done the
previous week,'' said the Oilers safety Marcus Robertson. ``They
kept us off balance. They seemed to attack us where we were
weakest. It was second-and-11 and they gave us a balanced set with
no back. And then that turned into four wideouts. We'd be in a
defense that didn't account for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that kind of day, especially in the second half. They
spread us out and then threw a barrage of formations at us. And, to
top it off, we just didn't play well.''
</P>
<P>
   When a game is 3-3 at halftime and the teams have felt each
other's pulse for a half, checking this, checking that, the
outcome, the second half, is likely going to swing on coaching. Who
cracks the vault first. Coaching and then, from the players, will
power and execution and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some of the best coaches to ever coach in this league,
all-time,'' said Chris Hayes, the Jets' special-teams ace.
</P>
<P>
   That is a bluster of hype. But in this season, at least, the
Jets coaches in big games have run extremely well on the fly. And
the players have responded to lift the Jets to a 7-4 record with
five regular-season games left.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers are now 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do anything to make a difference in this ballgame,''
Fisher said. ``We came into the locker room tied at halftime and
allowed them to put 21 unanswered points on the board and obviously
that was the difference. You have to make plays. You have to score
touchdowns. You have to convert third downs and get off the field
on third downs and we didn't do any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his team had a nice run. It is over. Now to make the
playoffs they need another run. Another string of victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have been there. A string. A stumble. Getting cracked.
It is the Oilers turn now, thanks to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good team and we needed a win like this,'' said the
Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn. Both teams need more to make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Something solid. No cracks.

NEW YORK AND `MODEL' CITIES ON PAR IN TRANSIT, STUDY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While London, Paris and Tokyo are often praised for
the quality of their public transportation systems, a new report
suggests that the New York region fares surprisingly well in the
efficiency of its trains, buses and subways when compared with
these cities.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on a joint three-year study by groups in the
four urban areas, concludes that these mass transit systems share
many common attributes and problems, including highly centralized
rail networks, growing business centers at their urban cores, huge
populations of commuters and severe automobile congestion.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, mass transit in the New York region compares
poorly, particularly in the paucity of service to much of its
suburban ring, which forces suburban residents to rely on cars,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But for New Yorkers who hold to a commonly held view that the
largest cities of Europe, particularly Paris and London, have model
mass transit systems, the findings of the four-city study may come
as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing it shows is that New York has made a good recovery
in the last 30 years in the efficiency of its rail and subway
systems,'' said Bill Shore, a senior associate with the Institute
of Public Transportation, a New York City research group that
carried out the New York component of the study.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the New York region's commuter trains, including
Metro-North, the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit, were
found to be more punctual than those in the other metropolitan
areas. All three New York regional commuter train systems were
found to be punctual more than 90 percent of the time, while the
regional rail network around London, long lauded as a model of
efficiency, registered only 88 percent on the punctuality scale.
</P>
<P>
   New York City subways, however, were less punctual that their
foreign counterparts, with 80 percent of the city's subways
arriving close to their scheduled arrival time. By that measure,
Tokyo's metro system came out on top, with 97 percent of its trains
on time.
</P>
<P>
   In other comparative findings, the report said that more than
500,000 people ride motorcycles into Tokyo each day, about 5
percent of its commuting population. But only about 10,000
motorcyclists brave the New York region's highways each day, so
negligible a number that the report called it zero percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released last week, was the largest study comparing
what are perhaps the world's most advanced large cities in terms of
mass transit, its authors say.
</P>
<P>
   The other groups participating in the study were the London
Research Centre, the Institut d'Amenagement et d'Urbanisme de la
Region d'Ile-de-France of Paris and the Tokyo Institute for
Municipal Research, all of which received government or
philanthropic grants in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the report, published by Her Majesty's Stationery
Office in London, are available for $110 through Bernan Associates,
4611 F Assembly Drive, Lanham, Md. 20706-4391.

USC'S SUPER FAN DIES AT 797TH CONSECUTIVE FOOTBALL GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Giles Pellerin never scored a touchdown before a huge crowd,
never struck out a batter, never dunked a basketball, but he
compiled one of the most remarkable streaks in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, Pellerin was at the Rose Bowl, attending
his 797th consecutive University of Southern California football
game, a streak dating to 1926. During the second half of the
USC-UCLA game, he felt ill and asked his brother Oliver, 87, (who
was merely attending his 600th consecutive USC game) to take him
home. But Giles Pellerin collapsed and died in the Rose Bowl's
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The man known as USC's Super Fan, and presumably America's No. 1
college football fan, was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Pellerin's first USC game was the 14-3 victory over Penn State
in the 1923 Rose Bowl game, when he was a student at Huntington
Park High School. But his streak began three years later, while he
was a sophomore at USC.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled more than 650,000 miles by plane, train and
automobile _ visiting more than 50 cities, including Tokyo _ and
spent upward of $85,000 in following the Trojans, according to the
USC athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   Going into this season, Pellerin had seen all 69 USC-Notre Dame
games and all 67 USC-UCLA games. His streak, which began a year
before USC's white mascot horse, Traveler, started appearing at
games, spanned 11 coaching regimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, Pellerin's streak almost ended well before
reaching epic proportions. On his way to a game at Notre Dame, his
car's water pump broke outside Oklahoma City, 36 hours before
kickoff. It was fixed, and he made the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was his honeymoon with his bride Jessie. He postponed
it eight months so he could celebrate at a USC game in Hawaii in
1935.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Pellerin was hospitalized for an appendectomy five days
before a home game. The day of the game, he told nurses he was
going to take a walk on hospital grounds. Instead, he went to the
Los Angeles Coliseum, saw his beloved USC rout Oregon, 40-13, then
returned to the hospital before anyone realized he had been
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The day after a 1993 game at Penn State, he suffered a ruptured
abdominal aneurysm when he was about to leave his hotel. He was
hospitalized in Harrisburg for 12 days, but USC had the following
weekend off. After signing a waiver absolving hospital officials of
responsibility for his leaving prematurely, he returned to Los
Angeles for the USC game against Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Pellerin also attended many homes games of USC's other sports
teams. When he wasn't busy doing all that, he spoke about his
streak before service organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A USC graduate, class of 1929, Pellerin did a lot more for his
alma mater's athletic program than cheer on the Trojans. A retired
telephone executive who lived in Pasadena, he donated $1.3 million
to endow three football scholarships and a swimming scholarship at
USC. He was inducted into the university's Athletic Hall of Fame in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole life has been USC football, and I've loved every
minute of it,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Pellerin was flown to New York as a finalist in the
Fisher Nut ``America's Nuttiest Sports Nuts'' contest. But that bit
of commercial hype aside, he saw nothing bizarre about his passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm a nut,'' he said. ``It's all been fun. I
could've spent a lot more money on other hobbies. A guy can spend
as much money playing golf or poker. I do more than just watch a
game when I visit these cities. I've met a lot of nice and
interesting people.''
</P>
<P>
   Pellerin and his wife, who preceded him in death, had no
children. So he essentially adopted the USC players, whom Pellerin
and his brother would meet when the athletes left the team bus at
road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players all greet me as the No. 1 Trojan,'' he had
remarked. ``I think of all the USC players as our family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God must be a Trojan,'' Pellerin once said. ``I've been
lucky.''

COMMENTARY: REJECTION OF TOM WOLFE PUTS HIM IN GOOD COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Wolfe has long aspired to be the Balzac of his
age, and up in Washington Heights it is clear that he has at least
partially succeeded. He, too, has been spurned by the Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe has been repeatedly nominated but rejected for membership
in the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which is ensconced in
a marble neoclassical palace on West 155th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The institution is modeled on the Academie Francaise, the group
traditionally known as the ``immortals,'' although today some of
those French authors are remembered chiefly for their refusal to
admit Balzac (and Moliere, among others).
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy limits membership to 250 ``pre-eminent''
writers and artists, whose chief duty, besides supervising prizes
and grants to young artists, is to elect replacements for deceased
members each year. ``The honor of election,'' the Academy says in
its brochure, ``is the highest formal recognition of artistic merit
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with Mark Twain, one of the original members a century
ago, the Academy's novelists and poets and journalists are all on
display in a portrait gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Today's members are a mixture of the famous and the
not-so-famous, among them Saul Bellow, John Hollander, James Thomas
Flexner, Jules Feiffer, Toni Morrison, Daniel Aaron, Josephine
Jacobsen, John McPhee, Kurt Vonnegut, Joyce Carol Oates, Mark
Strand, Eric Bentley, J.F. Powers and Shirley Hazzard.
</P>
<P>
   There can be awkward pauses when you point to a portrait and
confess your literary ignorance to Virginia Dajani, the executive
director of the Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh ... what did he write?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um ... I'll check his bio.''
</P>
<P>
   When you contemplate this modern pantheon, you might wonder if
Wolfe has added more phrases to the English language than the
entire Academy. Radical chic, the Me Decade, the Right Stuff,
masters of the universe, social X-rays, _ what other social
commentator, in fiction or nonfiction, has been quoted so often for
so long?
</P>
<P>
   But his style obviously did not please some Academy members.
John Updike, the chairman of the Academy's centennial committee,
recently proclaimed in The New Yorker that ``A Man in Full,''
Wolfe's new novel, is ``entertainment, not literature, even
literature in a modest aspirant form.'' Updike also revealed that
his sensibilities rendered him unable to finish ``The Bonfire of
the Vanities.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of criticism sounds familiar to Graham Robb, the
author of ``Balzac,'' a 1994 biography. ``To the French literary
establishment, Balzac had a disheveled style and was working in the
wrong genre,'' Robb said. ``The novel was considered rather
disreputable and journalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Wolfe's supporters, Murray Kempton, who belonged to the
Academy until his death last year, used to say that Wolfe was
rejected in favor of other novelists and journalists because of his
conservative ideology. That suspicion is shared by the novelist
Cynthia Ozick, another member who voted for him. ``I imagine his
politics may have influenced some votes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe has offended just about every bloc of the Academy during
his career, starting with his 1965 attack on The New Yorker,
headlined: ``Tiny Mummies! The True Story of the Ruler of 43rd
Street's Land of the Walking Dead!'' He went on to write
manifestoes eviscerating modern fiction, modern art and modern
architecture _ not the best strategy for winning votes in the
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe has managed in the past to survive the first round of
balloting, during which the 120 writers choose the nominees for the
vacancies in literature, but he has failed to get the requisite
majority in the second round, when all 250 members vote. Apparently
whatever support he gets from writers is negated by the animus from
the Academy's architects and artists.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the members will finally relent in this year's
election, which will be conducted in the coming weeks. Now that
Wolfe has yet another wildly successful novel out, the situation is
becoming a bit embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be elected this year,'' said Louis Auchincloss,
the novelist who is the president of the Academy. ``I spoke
strongly in favor of him at the annual meeting. I think he's a
great novelist.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one other member has committed to Wolfe's cause.
``Speaking as one of the immortals,'' Art Buchwald said, ``I can
promise him my vote. Poor Tom, he won't be able to make a living if
he's not a member.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVINGSTON, N.Y. _ Before the Kennedys, before the Roosevelts,
before the Vanderbilts, there were the Livingstons.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 17th century to the early 19th century, they were
one of America's most aristocratic families, lording over the
Hudson River Valley and owning an area larger than the state of
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Firm believers in noblesse oblige, the family helped mold the
republic: One Livingston administered the oath of office to George
Washington, another signed the Declaration of Independence, still
another became a Supreme Court justice.
</P>
<P>
   As the country matured, the Livingstons consolidated their
status, fiercely protecting their legacy and often marrying one
another to retain their land. But by the early 20th century, the
Livingstons had retreated from public life, preferring instead to
enjoy the view.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, after coasting for two centuries on the
achievements of men in big wigs with titles like ``The Signer'' and
``The Judge,'' the family has returned to prominence, thanks to
Rep. Robert Linlithgow Livingston, a 10th-generation descendant of
Robert Livingston, first lord of the manor.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, 55, the Louisiana Republican who is poised to become
the next speaker of the House of Representatives, may be a man of
the South. But his distinctly Yankee and upper-crust bloodline has
prompted Livingstons and non-Livingstons in upstate New York to
claim him as an honorary son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is great news, and we're all very proud of him,''
said Henry H. Livingston, a distant cousin who lives at Oak Hill, a
200-acre riverfront estate built in the 1790s. ``We're not
bragging, but this family is very interested in its history.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many blue-blooded families in the 20th century, though,
the Livingstons have sometimes been bewildered by modernity, their
fortunes watered down by income taxes, their sensibilities
entrenched in a genteel time warp. So until the congressman's
ascension to national prominence, few people talked about the
Livingstons outside of the tour guides at the area museums and
historic sites.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has had little connection with the Hudson River
Valley; he has been here only once, his sister said, for a big
family reunion at the Clermont State Historic Site in 1986. But
should he return, he would find an area steeped in Livingstonia,
still shaped by the family's influence.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, the town of Livingston in Columbia County.
There is the village of Linlithgo, which, save for a dropped ``w''
at the end, is the same as the congressman's middle name. Linlithgo
is the family's ancestral home in Scotland. Clermont, the town, is
named after Clermont, the family mansion. The village of Blue Store
is named after a tavern that was painted blue, and owned by a W.T.
Livingston. There is also Linlithgo Mills (a village), Livingston
Manor (a town in Sullivan County) and assorted local institutions,
such as Livingston Memorial Church (which is in Linlithgo,
naturally).
</P>
<P>
   According to the family's hefty genealogical register, which is
decorated with the family's coat of arms, there have been 63 Robert
Livingstons. This includes five Robert Linlithgow Livingstons, of
whom the congressman would technically be the fourth, and his
32-year-old son, the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   One family, unable to muster anything original, simply named one
son Livingston Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more of an old-money, blue-blood family in the
United States than the Livingstons,'' said Robert Engel, the
curator of collections for the Clermont State Historic Site, a
former Livingston homestead.
</P>
<P>
   The family's fortunes began in 1686, when Robert Livingston, a
32-year-old merchant from Scotland, bought 160,000 acres and called
it Livingston Manor. By the early 1800s, the family had built about
40 mansions on the Hudson's east bank and had accumulated, through
business deals and marriages to families like the Van Rensselaers
and the Beekmans, 1 million acres, including most of the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   The Livingston men entered public life. The most famous was
Robert R. Livingston, great-grandson of the first lord, who was the
first chancellor of the state of New York. He helped draft the
Declaration of Independence, negotiate the Louisiana Purchase and
provide financial muscle for Robert Fulton's steamboat, the
Clermont.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Livingston, brother of ``The Chancellor,'' was no slouch,
either. He was the mayor of New York City and the U.S. attorney
from the New York district _ simultaneously. Then, after he learned
that some aides had embezzled municipal funds, he resigned and
moved to New Orleans, where he became a U.S. senator and Andrew
Jackson's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No one else in the family with the last name Livingston has made
national news since the early 1800s, Engel said. But there have
been many notable people with Livingston blood _ so many, in fact,
that the apropos question may well be who is not a Livingston?
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Roosevelt and Hamilton Fish were Livingstons. George
Bush and his scions are Livingstons. So, too, is former Gov. Thomas
Kean of New Jersey, whose own home is in the township of _ what
else? _ Livingston, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Livingstons were like the Kennedys: They were in politics,
there were a million of them, and you can't help but liken them to
a dynasty,'' said Lucy Kuriger, the site director of Montgomery
Place, a historic estate in Annandale-on-Hudson that was last owned
by Dennis Delafield, a first cousin of the Louisiana congressman's.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike, say, the Kennedys or the Bushes, the Livingstons
have never been associated with one political party or ideology.
Instead, they were more known for their baronial life style in an
area that does not look much different now than it did generations
ago, with its rolling hills, apple farms and sweeping river views.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Livingston aura continues at Oak Hill, the home
of Henry H. Livingston, a retired financial analyst, and at Rokeby
Preserve, a 500-acre estate owned by Winthrop Aldrich, a deputy
commissioner of historic preservation for New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Livingston's rise to speaker of the House has
engendered calls for a commemorative plaque. Donald Kline,
Livingston's town supervisor, has suggested putting up a marker in
town noting the connection between the Livingstons of the past and
the Livingston of the present.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Livingston is aware _ if perhaps a bit wary _ of his
family's history, having inherited boxes of family mementos and an
oil portrait of their grandfather, said his sister, Carolyn
Teaford, in a telephone interview from her home in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Their grandfather (Robert L. Livingston) was a banker in New
York City who died of pneumonia in 1925. His widow, who also came
from a wealthy family, then took her five children to France.
</P>
<P>
   Their father (also Robert L. Livingston) returned to the United
States during World War II, attending Colorado College in Colorado
Springs, Mrs. Teaford said. He met their mother there, and the
future congressman was born in 1943. After the war, they spent a
few years in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., before the father got a job in New
Orleans as a salesman for National Distillers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad omen; he was an alcoholic, Mrs. Teaford said. In
1950, their parents divorced, and their father eventually fled to
Spain to avoid paying alimony. But their mother persevered, found
steady work and raised the two children.
</P>
<P>
   They had little contact with the Livingston side of the family.
But when they did meet, they talked incessantly about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved to talk their family history; they were big on
things like, `Now your great-great-grandfather did such and such,'
'' Mrs. Teaford recalled. ``Certainly we're proud of that, and it's
wonderful to have a heritage. But my brother and I believe it's who
you are, and what you do, and not who your ancestors are, that make
you a person.''

TROJANS' NEXT TASK: NOTRE DAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Paul Hackett was not so much worried
Sunday that the Trojans would mope after their 17-point loss to
UCLA, as that the loss would affect this week's effort against
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing that has happened is the schedule is in our
favor,'' Hackett said. ``If any guy at USC cannot get excited about
Notre Dame, with all the history of the rivalry, and the
butt-kicking we just got, you can't get ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a damn important game. The important thing is the
development of this football team. We let UCLA get away from us.
(Notre Dame) is big and physical. We're playing a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notre Dame loses Jackson: Irish quarterback Jarius Jackson
will miss the USC game after partially tearing the medial
collateral ligament in his right knee against LSU. He should be out
at least four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Either freshman Arnaz Battle or sophomore Eric Chappell will
start, and coach Bob Davie said he will not decide until game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them will play in the game,'' Davie said. ``We're
going to put together a little package for both of them. The good
thing is both of them are so much alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle has the most experience, with appearances in three games
this season. But he sprained his right shoulder against Baylor
three weeks ago and sat out two games. He is not 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: USC linebacker David Gibson said Sunday he
doesn't know if he will play because of the bruised thigh he
suffered. Defensive tackle Ennis Davis was on crutches with a sore
foot and also might miss the game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rivalry stat: So far in the 1990s, USC is 3-13-1 against UCLA
and Notre Dame.

   FREEDOM-REGAINED (New Orleans) _ Hayes Williams is haunted by
closed doors. In the long, narrow house on Lopez Street every
inside door is ajar, cabinets are open, kitchen drawers are pulled
half-out. His fiance, Linda Wilson, will come home from her job at
the pharmacy and find the house this way, and she thinks about
scolding him a little. ``But I'll stop, when I think about why he
does it,'' she said. He is not messy, she said. He is just a man
who knows what the inside of a box looks like, when it closes shut.
``I don't like closing up nothin','' said Williams, who served 30
years in Angola Prison for a killing he played no part in. He was
freed last year, though he knew that being turned loose and
actually living free, free in his own mind, are not the same. He
walked into prison at 19. Now he is almost 50, living in a world he
does not remember, constantly afraid some minor blunder, some
trivial brush with the law, some bad luck, will steal his freedom
again. By Rick Bragg.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NORMAN, Okla. _ After a four-hour closed-door meeting Sunday
evening, the University of Oklahoma board of regents publicly voted
to replace John Blake as the head football coach of the Sooners.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vote was 4-2 in favor of replacing Blake, who has two years
remaining on a five-year contract. One regent _ Robin Seigfried _
was absent from the meeting because of an illness in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked by the outcome,'' said board chairman Melvin Hall,
one of the two dissenting votes. ``But I accept the decision of the
board. This was a democratic process, and a lot of issues were
discussed. All of us had the opportunity to share our beliefs
openly and candidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal belief is we owe a debt of gratitude to John Blake
for the integrity he brought to this program. I think he deserves
much better than the decision rendered today.''
</P>
<P>
   The man believed to be the leading contender to replace Blake is
Georgia coach Jim Donnan, who was the offensive coordinator at OU
at the end of the Barry Switzer era in 1989. Donnan said last week
he was not interested, but sources say his comments were made as a
courtesy to Blake.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to oust Blake was taken individually at the Oklahoma
student union in front of the media and OU supporters. When it was
clear the vote had gone against Blake, who was not at the meeting,
about a dozen members of the OU football team stood up and walked
out of the room as a protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't show in wins and losses, but there's a lot of
improvement on this team,'' said OU senior tight end Jason Freeman.
``You can't put an amount on all the positive changes coach Blake
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, 37, ended his third season at OU on Saturday when the
Sooners upset Texas Tech 20-17. It was the third win in the past
four games for Oklahoma, but the team finished 5-6 for its third
consecutive losing season.
</P>
<P>
   It is the only time in school history that the team has finished
with a losing record for three straight seasons, making it the
worst three-year stretch ever for OU at 12-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is I've done more than was asked of me to do to
get this program back on track,'' Blake said. ``I've done the best
with what I had to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners have not had a winning season since 1993. The team
was 6-6 in its final season under coach Gary Gibbs in 1994, and the
Sooners were 5-5-1 in 1995 under Howard Schnellenberger.
</P>
<P>
   OU will owe Blake a portion of the final two years of his
contract. The total package of Blake's deal was worth $501,000 a
year, including radio and TV shows and a shoe contract.
</P>
<P>
   But OU is obligated to pay Blake only $230,000, which is two
years of a base salary of $115,000 per year. Blake recently moved
into a new home he had built near the OU campus at a cost of
$600,000.
</P>
<P>
   OU president David Boren said Blake would be welcome to stay on
with the school in another capacity if he so desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision was very difficult for everyone involved,''
Boren said. ``We all admire John as a person, and that's what made
this so difficult. He has brought in players to this program who
have high character and good values.''
</P>
<P>
   OU athletic director Joe Castiglione recommended Blake be fired
in a detailed report he gave to Boren, who presented it to the
regents.
</P>
<P>
   Castiglione was the AD at Missouri before accepting the job at
OU last May. Sources say Boren hired Castiglione under the
stipulation he complete an investigation into whether Blake was
capable of leading the Sooners back to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Boren favored Castiglione's recommendation, but two board
members _ Hall and C.S. Lewis _ were in favor of retaining Blake.
Lewis works for Hall's Oklahoma law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the process, and I respect my fellow regents,''
Lewis said. ``You wouldn't believe the amount of soul-searching
that went on in that meeting. But I respectfully disagree with the
recommendation of the board today. I don't believe this is the
right way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   One regent said two board members _ vice chairman Don
Halverstadt and Mary Jane Noble _ were in favor of firing Blake
from the beginning. The delay in the private meeting was caused by
each side trying to convince the two undecided regents _ G.T.
Blankenship and Stephen Bentley _ which way to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Once it was clear Blankenship and Bentley would vote to remove
Blake, Hall telephoned Blake to inform him of the board's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is disappointed personally,'' Hall said. ``But he also is
disappointed for his players and disappointed for the OU fans. This
is not what John hoped for, but he knows the sun will come up
tomorrow and life will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The task for Boren and Castiglione is to find the best candidate
for the job, which Boren said will be done ``as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Castiglione hired Larry Smith to take over as head coach at
Missouri, and Smith transformed a losing program into a team that
will make its second consecutive bowl appearance this year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Donnan, another name that has been mentioned as a man on
OU's list is former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz, who also coached at
Arkansas, Minnesota and the New York Jets. Other coaches who might
be considered are Tulane's Tommy Bowden and Mississippi State's
Jackie Sherrill.

   Michael Todd, publisher of Grapezine, a magazine about
winegrowing, died on Saturday at Winthrop University Hospital in
Mineola, N.Y. He was 51 and had homes in midtown Manhattan and Sag
Harbor on Long Island.
</P>

STANFORD HOLDS ON TO TOPPLE TOP-RANKED PURDUE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ For the second consecutive week, the
top-ranked team in women's basketball lost in stunning fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Regan Freuen's free throw with one second to go gave Stanford
(1-3) a 73-72 upset over top-ranked Purdue at Maples Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue (2-1), which had attained its first No. 1 ranking after
snapping Tennessee's 46-game winning streak last Sunday, had
trailed all game before tying the score on a driving layup by
sophomore guard Katie Douglas with 18 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   On the next possession, Stanford worked the clock down until
junior guard Milena Flores zipped a pass to Freuen inside. Freuen,
a senior guard who finished with 10 points, missed her first shot
but was fouled by Douglas on the rebound. After making the first
free throw, she intentionally missed the second to run out the
clock and send the crowd of 4,553 into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of our team's effort,'' said Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer, whose team entered the weekend unranked for the
first time since the beginning of the 1987-88 season. ``We hit big
shots when we needed them. It's a great win for our team,
especially with the senior hitting the free throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Yamasaki, a freshman guard, led four Stanford players in
double figures with 18 points to go along with nine rebounds. The
junior guard Christina Batastini came off the bench to contribute a
career-high 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's sophomore center Carolyn Moos, who had 16 points and
three assists, got the better of her Purdue counterpart, Camille
Cooper. Cooper, who scored a career-high 18 points in the upset of
Tennessee, was held to eight points and no rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford took control from the start, leading by 21-8 with 10
minutes 53 seconds left in the first half. Purdue shot only 34
percent from the floor in the first half, while the Cardinals used
good ball movement and a balanced offense to take a 35-28 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by 67-59 with 4:27 to play, Purdue made its run.
Douglas scored nine points in the final four minutes to help Purdue
tie the score before Freuen and the Cardinal pulled out the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just came out with a great level of intensity,'' said
Purdue Coach Carolyn Peck. ``The pivotal part of the game was the
level of intensity that Stanford came in versus what we started the
game with.''

ELTINGH CONCLUDES HIS CAREER WITH ONE MORE DOUBLES TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Not many athletes leave their sport at the top
of their game. But Jacco Eltingh, the world's top-ranked men's
doubles player, did so on Sunday. And he did it by teaming with his
longtime doubles partner and Dutch countryman, Paul Haarhuis, to
win their second world doubles championship by beating Mark Knowles
of the Bahamas and Daniel Nestor of Canada, 6-4, 6-2, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Eltingh closed out what he said was his final
professional match with a forehand volley that Nestor barely got
his racquet on.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the Phoenix-ATP Tour championship, which brings
together the world's eight leading doubles teams, was hardly a
surprise. Eltingh and the 32-year-old Haarhuis had won 38 titles,
including five Grand Slam championships, over an eight-year span.
By winning this year at the French Open and Wimbledon, they became
the first tandem in the Open era to have won all four Grand Slam
events and, with 39 titles, are tied for fifth place over all.
</P>
<P>
   Eltingh decided last February that he would retire at the end of
this year. Once a top-20 singles player, he stopped playing singles
in 1997 because of tendinitis in his knees. Eltingh's mobility
problems were hardly evident on Sunday, however, before a crowd of
7,084 at the Hartford Civic Center. He volleyed spectacularly, and
often acrobatically.
</P>
<P>
   Eltingh and Haarhuis, who finished the year with a 46-4 record,
never lost their serves and broke Knowles four times _ once in the
opening set, twice in the second set and in the 11th game of the
final set of the 1-hour-43-minute match. The last break put the
Dutchmen ahead, 6-5, and put Eltingh at the service line to try to
close out the match.
</P>
<P>
   After he went ahead by 40-0, Eltingh said, ``I told Paul that I
wanted to enjoy the moment.'' He added: ``Then when I went to the
service line I bounced the ball about 10 times, knowing it could be
my last serve. But then we lost the next 2 points before I hit the
winning volley.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed at courtside, with the gallery listening in, Eltingh
said: ``I think I'll go out and have five, six or seven beers. Who
cares? I don't have to stay in shape anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Haarhuis, whose new partner will be Patrick Galbraith of
Seattle, said: ``I feel sad. It's kind of the end of an era. It's a
shame it's got to stop, but it's nice that Jacco and I go out as
the top team.''

THE COWBOYS NEED J.J.'S FLARE FOR DRAMATIC
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, TEXAS _ Jimmy would have slapped them naked.
</P>
<P>
   And it would have been the absolute right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   No breathing a sigh of relief and counting our blessings. No
bottom-line rhetoric about a win, is a win, is a win.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of those games when old friend Jimmy Johnson would
have used the media as if we were his personal e-mail service,
carrying The Word directly to his players.
</P>
<P>
   The Word would have come complete with fire and brimstone and
maybe an asthma field reference or two.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Jimmy would have celebrated Sunday's slap-happy 30-22
Cowboys' victory against the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   He'd have had somebody's head on a platter.
</P>
<P>
   That is not how Chan Gailey, who now resides in the office that
Johnson once called his own, does things, you understand.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' first-year head coach sees a team that is 8-3 and
smiles, yes, with a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is to win the game,'' Gailey said after the
Cowboys survived a rash of key injuries, a fourth-quarter comeback
attempt by the Seahawks and 15 penalties for 129 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, ``15 penalties for 129 yards!''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Emmitt Smith and Chris Warren combined for 145
yards rushing, or that quarterback Troy Aikman completed 28 passes
for almost 300 yards. Forget that Michael Irvin caught eight passes
for 98 yards or that 10 different players caught passes.
</P>
<P>
   You think Jimmy would have found any solace in that?
</P>
<P>
   Oh no, Jimmy would have met the media after the game with his
lips pursed tightly, an eyelid twitching, his cheeks flushed. Some
poor fool, probably a radio guy, would have ventured a general
opening question and gotten his head bitten off.
</P>
<P>
   Someone else, probably a TV guy, would have eventually pressed a
little too hard and Jimmy would have snapped, ``That's it,'' and
bolted.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, would have been Jimmy's second performance, his
first having come a few minutes earlier when he lit into the
players in a brief and fiery postgame tirade. He loved that ploy,
catching them with a profanity-laced harangue just as they were
congratulating themselves on a hard-fought victory.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Gailey's team now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we perfect?'' Gailey asked. ``No, we're not perfect but
we're winning, and if we ever put all our phases together, we've
got a chance to be a pretty good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   I may gag the next time I hear somebody say that.
</P>
<P>
   We're 12 weeks into the season and the 10-1 Minnesota Vikings
will be ringing the doorbell at Texas Stadium in three days.
</P>
<P>
   Knock, knock. Anybody home?
</P>
<P>
   Guess who's here for Thanksgiving dinner?
</P>
<P>
   Twelve weeks into the season and the Cowboys are showing all the
concentration of a 3-year-old fresh off a cotton candy binge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably get 400 questions about penalties again this
week,'' Gailey said, which is only slightly more than the number of
flags that were flying at the Cowboys on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There were the usual litany of false starts, defensive holding,
personal fouls, etc., but the Cowboys mixed in some rare ones, like
Warren, who wasn't even on the field, bumping the side judge ``in
the white area'' (15 yards, unsportsmanlike conduct).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dumb penalties,'' Gailey said, ``And that's what you
can't do. You've got to avoid the dumb ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to institute penalty laps and those kinds of
things at this time of year. We've got to handle this and be mature
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are ``thisclose'' to being a very, very good
football team; the kind of team that could even surprise the
Vikings on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Only, however, if they can get some people healthy and eliminate
the mistakes that keep dragging them back toward mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could put my finger on it, I'd solve it,'' Gailey said,
``but it's a few different things here and there all the time and
that's what we have to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these guys are smart. When I talk to them about it
\RMonday\S, they'll know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, I get it. Give them 12 hours and, after they come in Monday
feeling pretty good about themselves, ``then'' slap 'em silly.
</P>
<P>
   There might be a little J.J. in our boy Chan, after all.
</P>
<P>
   I think he's about to get their attention.

HEED THE ARTHROPODS; THEY MAY HAVE THE ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By next weekend it will be evident that we are all, to quote
Woody Allen's closing lines in ``Antz,'' getting in touch with our
inner maggots. No need to go to the ant, thou sluggard. The ants
are coming to us. No sooner has colonialization been given new
meaning by the Dreamworks fall movie fantasy, than Disney and Pixar
are polishing off their creatures' mandibles for Wednesday's
release of ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this feast of cinematic myrmecology is no accident;
behind the scenes competition preceded these two meticulously
detailed computer animations. And there is a tradition of sci-fi
fantasy to draw on: giant ants surviving nuclear tests (``Them!'')
or giant ant aliens attacking humans (``Starship Troopers''). Now,
in these new films, the ants are the heroes, while humans are
evident mainly from the piles of trash within which bohemian bugs
find paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't ants have a glorious day in the cinematic sun,
after defending their way of life from a megalomaniacal warrior ant
(``Antz'') or marauding grasshoppers (``A Bug's Life'')? Maybe it's
only surprising that it has taken so long.
</P>
<P>
   Edward O. Wilson and Bert Holldobler, authors of the 1990 study
``The Ants,'' estimate that there are 19,000 trillion ants in the
world, divided into more than 9,500 species. Some queen ants, who
can live more than 20 years, give birth to 150 million worker ants,
with 2 to 3 million of them alive at any one time. The entire
earth's surface, the authors have suggested, is really a ``network
of ant colonies.'' Given that this must also include much of
Hollywood, we probably should be seeing even more ant movies.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one problem: It is difficult to create a
sympathetic ant colony by accurately portraying all worker ants as
female, all males as short-lived inseminators and all queens
earning their pride of place not through wise leadership but
through fecundity.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and Holldobler may admire the ``highly developed,
self-sacrificial colonial existence,'' of ants, but it is hard to
imagine a movie audience feeling anything but fear of what these
specialists call the ``ecological juggernaut'' of the colony, with
its ruthless drive for survival of the group and its complete
indifference to the fate of the individual.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen's character in ``Antz'' learns from his psychiatrist
that he has good reason to feel insignificant: He really is. But
the movie itself wouldn't have six legs to stand on if it accepted
that judgment, and neither would ``A Bug's Life'' (which, anyway,
reduces the number of ant legs to four).
</P>
<P>
   So maybe we really do need to get in touch with our inner
maggots to see what we are making of ants. We tend to take over any
animal life we examine and remake it into forms we find congenial.
We fill the cribs of our infants with cuddly versions of creatures
that would mangle intruders into their own mangers: we turn lions
into lambs, dinosaurs into treacly purple pals. Nature
documentaries about the mating habits of penguins or the stalking
strategies of tigers mix comedy and tragedy, awe and ridicule.
Animals become human reflections.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in a provocative new study, ``The Last Dinosaur
Book'' (University of Chicago Press), W.J.T. Mitchell, the editor
of the journal Critical Inquiry, takes on the cultural obsession
with dinosaurs. He uses Marx, Levi-Strauss and Freud to strip away
dinosaurs' cultural flesh, arguing that these extinct creatures
have become mythic representations of the forces of capitalist
production and state power, tapping into notions of racism and
social Darwinism along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many excursions into what is now called ``cultural
studies,'' round up the very same suspects no matter what aspect of
culture is examined. But there is also much insight in the midst of
Mitchell's explorations. The dinosaur really has had a mythic
force, far out of proportion to its scientific importance.
Nineteenth-century excavations were sponsored by captains of
industry like Andrew Carnegie; the brontosaurus even came to grace
cans of Sinclair Motor Oil (``mellowed 80 million years''). Thomas
Jefferson himself collected bones of an ancient skeleton of the
American ``mastodon,'' seeing them as symbols of United States
power (and used the East Room of the White House as his ``bone
room'').
</P>
<P>
   In popular culture the dinosaur has become a ``totem animal,''
associated both with our worst fears and our most innocent
affections. As Mitchell shows, in films dinosaurs have even had an
effect on modern human relationships, ranging from ``Bringing Up
Baby'' (in which Cary Grant's character is so obsessed with finding
an intercostal clavicle to complete his brontosaurus skeleton that
he may be marrying the wrong woman) to ``Jurassic Park'' (where, if
the dinosaurs do nothing else, they inspire family feeling in the
survivors).
</P>
<P>
   One wouldn't expect this much mythic weight from ants. But it is
unusual how similarly the new ant films remake the ant colony's
``ecological juggernaut.'' Both plots hinge on challenges to the
ant order. The hero ants are nebbishes, eccentrics, hapless rebels.
And in both films, they make their way to bohemian bug colonies
where cares are few, human garbage plentiful and help can be
obtained to fight off enemies, internal or external. They then try
to accomplish the impossible: both to save the colony's way of life
and to remain free individuals, to celebrate community while
undoing the rigidities of ant life.
</P>
<P>
   But how else could humans imagine a congenial ant colony? Wilson
and Holldobler look at ant colonies and write that ``It would
appear that socialism really works under some circumstances. Karl
Marx just had the wrong species.'' Maybe these films try to
envision socialism with a human face.
</P>
<P>
   The charm of these movies is that they never let this idea
become leaden or too serious. ``A Bug's Life'' is certainly
lighthearted, turning the natural world into a kind of playground
in which the laws are harsh but the possibilities of invention
unlimited. The real hope is the inventiveness of the hero ant Flik,
his creation of a mechanism, a technology, that might help save the
colony, stave off disaster, harness the ants' teamwork in new
directions and improve nature without displacing it.
</P>
<P>
   And isn't this an image of our hope for technology? That it
might help alter the established order, remake society, offer
images of things yet unimagined? It may be no accident that both
ant films are also tributes to computer animation, with its
new-found powers to create texture, character, individuality,
nuance and other un-antlike characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation was once the sign of artificiality; now it is
humanized, naturalized, and we are meant to see it at work bringing
a human touch to the inhuman realm of the ant. Nature is
transformed by artifice into seeming more natural.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, in directing ``A Bug's Life,'' John Lasseter also had
in mind how similar the ant colony of his hero's vision is to the
filmmaking universe, where individual genius and communal
enterprise must coexist, and where technology is also reshaping the
landscape. Maybe the message is: Forget maggots. Celebrate movies.
The hero is called Flik.

2 MEN WITH A PLAN: REVIVING SCHENECTADY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ The only name that used to count in
Schenectady was General Electric. Now the new names to reckon with
are Roger and Neil.
</P>
<P>
   As in: ``Not much happened until Roger and Neil got together.''
That is what George L. Robertson, president of the Schenectady
Economic Development Corp., said.
</P>
<P>
   And, ``Now Roger and Neil have stepped up to the plate, and
we're beginning to hit a lot of singles, and that's what we need _
a lot of singles, instead of the home run that many of the town
fathers were looking for.'' That comes from David Oliker, president
and chief executive of MVP Health Plan Inc., a 300,000-member
health maintenance organization with headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   Roger is Roger H. Hull, president of Union College, and Neil is
Neil M. Golub, president of Price Chopper supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The college president and the grocery magnate have emerged as a
two-man urban redevelopment team determined to revive this decaying
factory town of 65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Schenectady has been struggling since the early 1960s when
General Electric began moving 30,000 jobs to other cities. Hull
said that when he came to Schenectady, the business community
wanted to get people to shop downtown again, a short-term fix he
said did not address underlying economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and Golub have stunned Schenectady with an ambitious plan
to build an eight-screen movie theater, a 50,000-square-foot trade
show center, a new hotel and a combination bus and train station to
greet the high-speed trains that will arrive from New York City.
They even got Gov. George Pataki to promise $22 million for the
construction of a new state office building downtown for the
Department of Transportation, which will bring an estimated 5,500
new jobs to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are unalike in many ways. Golub, 61, is a blunt
businessman and a prominent Republican in upstate New York. Hull,
56, is a liberal on many issues and his sentences often lapse into
an academic indirection. Golub is a golfer and philanthropist. Hull
is devoted to tae kwon do and running.
</P>
<P>
   The two began working together from the moment they met in 1991,
when Hull arrived to head Union College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our personalities may be very different,'' Hull said, ``but at
the same time, we're both optimists, and we believe we can get
things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Golub agreed. ``Roger always has ideas,'' he said. ``He's always
able to lay out the options and ask, `Where are we going and where
do we want to be in 20 years?' Roger is in a business where you've
got to make things happen, and I'm in a business where you've got
to make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Golub's father, William, had also been concerned with the city's
future, and when he died, he left his son $1 million to use for the
betterment of the city. With the money, Golub and Hull formed
Schenectady 2000, a civic group that fosters improvement programs,
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   They hired an urban planner to conduct a survey of the city's
best features _ the riverfront, the old Stockade brownstone
district, the college, the Proctor's Theater _ and devise a way to
revitalize them. Next they looked for investment to help the city
shine again.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki helped by creating the Metroplex Development Authority,
which will receive $50 million in bonds to spend in the city and
the county.
</P>
<P>
   That the revival of downtown has been spearheaded by a college
president and a supermarket president stands in sharp contrast to
the way things used to work around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a company town _ G.E. ran the town,'' said Robertson.
``Even in the 1970s, every not-for-profit board had a GE executive
on it, and before anything was decided, everybody turned their eyes
down to the end of the table to see what GE wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   How far Schenectady has to march is apparent in how far it has
fallen. After World War II and into the 1950s, General Electric had
35,000 employees in the city and county _ one of every two working
people. Today, General Electric's downtown turbine works employs
about 6,000, and another round of departures was announced last
spring. Behind the employment vacuum, Schenectady's urban woes come
flooding in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the second highest violent crime rate in 1996 in the
state of New York,'' said Robert T. Farley, a member of the County
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But while Hull and Golub acknowledge that Schenectady has a long
way to go before it even approaches its past prosperity, Golub said
he was no longer going to worry about opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to drag them kicking and screaming into the 21st
century,'' he said.

CARDS ALMOST BLOW A 31-0 LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALJON, Md. _ The Cardinals were sitting on a 31-0 lead over the
Washington Redskins as halftime approached on Sunday. That's right
_ 31-0. Cards.
</P>
<P>
   A Cardinals official was asked, ``When was the last time you hit
60?''
</P>
<P>
   He responded, ``On the way to work Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare moment of levity for a franchise that scored its
most first-half points in 165 games _ nearly 10{ years _ and
seemingly was taking out lots of frustration on a lame foe.
</P>
<P>
   It became less of a joke as the game unfolded at a dizzying pace
in the second half, with the Redskins scoring touchdowns on six
straight possessions before the Cardinals saved a wild 45-42 win.
</P>
<P>
   It was beginning to look like the Cardinals might ``need'' to
score 60 to win before quarterback Jake Plummer plunged for a
touchdown on a fourth-down quarterback sneak with 3:49 remaining
for a 45-35 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins continued to make it interesting, scoring on a
2-yard bootleg by quarterback Trent Green with 1:46 remaining and
getting the ball back with more than a minute to play after
stopping the Cardinals on fourth-and-one at the Washington 32. The
outcome wasn't sealed until safety Kwamie Lassiter continued his
one-man turnover binge by intercepting Green with 1:02 to go, the
first time the Cardinals had stopped the Redskins since midway
through the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter also forced a fumble on a punt return, his third of the
season. The interception is his fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether people like it or not, we are a playoff-contending
team,'' said Cardinals center Aaron Graham. ``That's all you can
ask out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (6-5) got a lift in their quest for an NFC playoff
berth when Tampa Bay (4-7) was upset by Detroit. The Cardinals also
must contend with New Orleans, a 5-6 team they face at home on Dec.
20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing the type of games we have had with Washington
just in the three years I've been here. Unbelievable,'' said
Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin. ``I told the squad before the game
that strange things happen. No lead is safe, and no deficit is too
great to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Cardinals beat Washington on a field goal
with 2 seconds left. Two years ago, Boomer Esiason had to pass for
a club-record 522 yards before the Cardinals prevailed in overtime
here.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the offense has struggled early in most games.
Offensive coordinator Marc Trestman, searching for a way to speed
up the tempo, twice sprung the no-huddle offense on the Redskins.
The Cardinals scored touchdowns on each.
</P>
<P>
   But in the frenetic second half, the Cardinals were in the
unaccustomed position of looking for ways to slow down the pace.
</P>
<P>
   As the Redskins drove for their third, fourth, fifth and sixth
consecutive touchdowns, Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave
McGinnis used his entire repertoire. Still, Green completed 30 of
49 passes for 382 yards, a career-high four touchdowns and a
two-point conversion with 9:18 remaining that cut the big lead to
three points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were mixing blitzes, mixing coverages, dialing up
everything we have, and we couldn't get a stop,'' the frustrated
McGinnis said. ``We came into the game intent on stopping their run
(Washington rushed for 68 yards), but in the second half we got
into a flag-football game with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to make a play. Get a sack. Knock down a pass.
Something. Now I know how (Dallas defensive coordinator Dave) Campo
felt last week when Jake and our offense was coming back against
them. It's an unreal feeling. They were rolling downhill on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Green tortured Cardinals cornerback J.B. Brown, who repeatedly
was penalized for illegal contact while trying unsuccessfully to
cover Redskins receivers Michael Westbrook and Leslie Shephard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `This is just ridiculous,' '' said Cardinals
linebacker Jamir Miller. ``We had to get a stop. We didn't get
after them aggressively. We had a 31-point lead, but we didn't seem
to realize there were 30 minutes to play. We needed to play with a
little more sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, our offense played a phenomenal game.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, who passed for two touchdowns and ran for three, and
the Cardinals offense did their jobs early. He completed 17 of 28
for 251 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't spot a team 31 points and expect to win,'' said
Redskins Coach Norv Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the game-savers for the Cardinals were Bernard
Wilson's second-quarter block of a 33-yard field goal try by
Washington's Cary Blanchard, and their season-high 188 rushing
yards _ 92 from Adrian Murrell, 56 from Mario Bates _ which ate
just enough clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphasized all week coming out of the box early. We got
that done,'' Tobin said. ``I was disappointed we allowed 40-some
points and couldn't finish the game, but young teams assume certain
things. Prosperity is a hard thing for a young team.'' &QL;
