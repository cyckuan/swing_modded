MAN HARGED IN 1984 MURDER THAT PROSECUTOR TIES TO A SECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js)

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ An East Newark man was charged with murder Friday
in the stabbing death of a homeless man here in 1984, a killing
that the Essex County prosecutor said was carried out as ``a
sacrifice'' to honor the leader of a religious sect that considers
itself a lost black tribe of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Patricia A. Hurt, said investigators believed
that the suspect, John Armstrong, 40, who also uses the name
Yokonon Israel, was a follower of Yahweh ben Yahweh, the founder of
a Black Israelite group whose doctrine portrays white men as
devils. The man he was charged with killing was white.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt did not describe any signs of ritualism or other
evidence that would distinguish the killing from a random street
crime, but she said the stabbing occurred on July 3, 1984, just two
days before Yahweh ben Yahweh visited Newark, and within a block of
the sect's Newark temple.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday to announce the murder charge, Ms.
Hurt referred to the group as a cult and said: ``It is black
supremist and they have racist ideologies. One of their premises is
to kill white males, and the victim in this case was, in fact, a
white man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt would not say what evidence prompted Armstrong's arrest
in Newark on Wednesday, more than 14 years after the crime.
Investigators from the Newark police, the Port Authority police and
the FBI's joint terrorism task force worked on the case, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt identified the victim as Attilio Cicala, 52. Officials
said they believed that Cicala did not know Armstrong and that
Cicala was stabbed eight times in the chest and abdomen on South
Orange Avenue in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Yahweh ben Yahweh, whose name in Hebrew literally means ``God
the son of God,'' and six of his disciples were convicted of
conspiracy by a jury in U.S. District Court in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., in 1992 for ordering the murders of 14 white vagrants and
disobedient black disciples in Florida. Yahweh ben Yahweh was
sentenced to 18 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment filed in that case, Yahweh ben
Yahweh instructed members of his group to ``kill me a white devil
and bring me an ear.'' The white vagrants killed in Florida had
their ears sliced off. An investigator, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, said Cicala's ears were not cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who officials said has been a self-employed artist
recently, was arraigned Friday morning before Judge Betty J. Lester
in Essex County Superior Court. Judge Lester set bail at $250,000,
and officials said that Armstrong was being held at the Essex
County jail.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt said that the Yahweh temple in Newark had closed,
although officials did not know when. Investigators said that
Armstrong remained a follower of the Yahweh doctrine, but they did
not explain how they had linked him to the sect, one of several
Black Israelite groups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The various groups share similar ideologies about blacks being
the ``true Jews'' and members of lost Hebrew tribes and about
whites being devils. They are not accepted by mainstream Judaism,
which considers some of the groups anti-Semitic. Ms. Hurt called
the Yahwehs ``a faction of the Black Hebrew Israelites.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the better known of such groups are the Black Israelites
who proselytize in Times Square and recently reached a compromise
with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani over the use of loudspeakers. A
leader of that group could not be reached Friday night, but there
did not appear to be any connection between the New York group and
the Florida-based Yahweh group.
</P>
<P>
   Yahweh ben Yahweh was born Hulon Mitchell Jr. in Oklahoma, but
rejected that name as a ``slave name.'' He had been active as a
Black Muslim in Chicago before moving to Miami in 1979 and founding
his group, known both as the Yahwehs and as the Nation of Yahweh.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Encyclopedia of American Religions, the Nation
of Yahweh believes that black people are the true lost tribe of
Judah but have not assumed their destiny as a ruling class. They
wear white robes and believe that all people who oppose God are
devils.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt and her investigators said they believed that the
killing of Cicala was racially motivated and instigated by the
sect's antiwhite doctrine. Ms. Hurt called the stabbing ``a
sacrifice'' that was carried out ``in anticipation of the arrival
of the cult's leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that an indictment of Armstrong by a state grand
jury was expected sometime in the next few weeks and that he was
not expected to enter a plea in the case until then. Ms. Hurt would
not disclose Armstrong's home address and it was not immediately
clear whether he had retained a lawyer.

ADULTHOOD NOT GYM-DANDY  
 MOCEANU FEELS SHE'S STARTING OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 5-foot-1, soon-to-be-married Shannon Miller reached up to
hug Dominique Moceanu when they met Friday in an Arizona State
University gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better not be taller than me,'' Miller said, realizing
that her 1996 U.S. Olympic gymnastics teammate and one of the 12
bridesmaids for her June 12 wedding now has at least an inch on
her.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 inches or more Moceanu has grown since the Americans won
their first women's Olympic team gold in Atlanta _ and became
forever linked as the Magnificent Seven _ is minuscule compared
with the 17-year-old's leap into adulthood during the past four
months.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu has been transformed in the days since Oct. 17, when her
father, Dumitru, fired Dominique's coach to trigger a chain of
dramatic events. The situation culminated with Moceanu being
legally declared an adult and her father being ordered to stay away
from her for a year.
</P>
<P>
   From a fearful girl unsure of her future to a luminous young
woman, able not only to intelligently discuss the breakup of her
family but to look past it to a future she still hopes will include
the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at myself and I thought I was growing up last year, and
now I just keep learning more and more about life and everything,''
said Moceanu, who is here to sign autographs before the Reese's
Gymnastics Cup at 7 tonight at Wells Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not about the money. I have no money. I didn't get any
money out of this. I pay attorneys, I pay all these people, there's
not anything at all. I told him I'd leave all the money behind. I'd
start over fresh. But it hurts because I worked for that, and that
would have been my life that I could have just retired. I have to
start over now, and that's fine. I learned early what it's like to
fall down and pick yourself back up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not the world to me. Money I can live without.''
</P>
<P>
   The money is the estimated $2 million to $2.5 million that
Moceanu has earned in a career that took her from junior national
champion in 1994 to senior national champ in '95 to, at age 14, the
youngest U.S. gymnast ever to win an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   It went into a trust under the control of her parents, with
Dumitru spending much of the fund on a 72,000-square-foot gym in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The family tension erupted just days after the dismissal of
Luminita Miscenco, who coached Moceanu since January 1998, a year
in which she was third all-around in the U.S. Championships and won
the Goodwill Games all-around gold.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu filed a lawsuit asking for legal control of her affairs.
Then events took a darker turn. In November, Dumitru was accused of
trying to arrange for the murders of Miscenco and a friend of his
daughter's. Law enforcement authorities said he was not charged
because he had not paid for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   After spending Thanksgiving in the Valley with Olympic teammate
Amanda Borden, Moceanu was back in court in early December, when
her father was ordered to have no contact with her other than in
writing through her lawyer. Dumitru has violated that ruling once
by calling her, Moceanu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak with my mom (Camelia) and my sister (Christina),''
said Moceanu, who lives alone in a Houston apartment and spent
Christmas with her mother's relatives. ``Now it's over with, so
hopefully he (Dumitru) can deal with it, but I don't know how he
is. He keeps wanting to appeal, and it's just wasting everybody's
money and time. He just needs to put it behind him and deal with it
and accept it, because he can't do anything about it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanned and wearing a yellow shirt and white pants, accessorized
with an expensive watch, earrings, bracelets and necklaces, Moceanu
is glad to be moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   In November, she re-signed, on her own, with Gold Medal
Management and is making some appearance money. On Monday, she will
return to training at Brown's Gymnastics in Houston with a new
coach, Alexander Alexandrov, who worked with her as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   Miscenco now coaches at Nadia Comaneci's gym in Oklahoma.
Moceanu does not rule out working with the coach again.
</P>
<P>
   Although circumstances prevented her from completing high school
at Northland Christian, she soon will begin writing and
communications classes at Tomball Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Like Miller, Kerri Strug and Dominique Dawes, who parlayed a
team bronze at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics to a gold in Atlanta,
Moceanu is hopeful that a second Olympics would be her best.
</P>
<P>
   She was ninth all-around and did not win an individual medal in
'96.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominique is so talented,'' said Miller, the winner of more
Olympic/World medals than any other American gymnast. ``She is one
of the most talented gymnasts I've ever seen. She handled it (the
Olympics) so well, she was so composed and so focused on what she
was doing, but you could still see she was a little bit young in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years to go (until the Sydney Olympics), I don't think it
will be a problem for her to get back in shape, if that's what she
wants. Your body kind of retains the memory of how to do a lot of
the basic skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 1992, I grew 4 or 5 inches. People always say, she's 19,
4 inches taller, 20 pounds heavier, and you think, oh my god, 20
pounds. But 5 pounds an inch is average, so it's not really that
big of a deal. It gave me more power to do bigger skills.''
</P>
<P>
   For Moceanu, another Olympics or World Championships would be
less about a medal or monetary reward than her validation as a
decision maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time it's for me, not anyone else,'' she said. ``I'm
choosing my path.'' &QL;

PAST PEERING OVER TYSON'S BIG SHOULDERS  
 TYSON FACES TOUGHEST FOE _ HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS - A long-running rematch, Mike Tyson's biggest fight,
continues tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Call it shadow boxing.
</P>
<P>
   It's Tyson vs. Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson always seems caught in a desperate confrontation with the
ominous shadow cast by the demons lurking in his dangerous past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got so much anger in me from past things,'' he said. ``Don't
take it personal. I'm dealing with a crisis in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't Tyson have it wrong here? Didn't he mean to say dealing
with a life that is a crisis?
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's comeback bout against Frans Botha is just the latest
chapter. He is expected to win at the MGM Grand in his first fight
since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears 19 months ago. Botha is a
credible opponent. But in this psycho soap opera, he has a cameo
role.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Botha wins, the unknown heavyweight probably will be
cast as a fighter who happened to be there when Tyson beat Tyson
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   That's not fair to the friendly South African, but boxing and
fair play never have been related. The business specializes in the
strange, and the Tyson story is about as strange as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   He has walked in and out of prison, blown unimaginable wealth,
gone bonkers against Holyfield and undergone psychoanalysis on the
public stage.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder he sounds confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the last time I was happy,'' said Tyson, who
also faces a possible return to prison after a Feb. 5 sentencing
hearing on misdemeanor assault charges in Maryland. ``When things
go great, I worry the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not supposed to be here now. I'm supposed to be
Thorazined-out. Lithium, yeah. I deal with my problems in front of
the whole world. If I have a fight with my wife, the whole world is
going to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an educated person. I'm not pompous. I've been to
prison. I've done bad things. I've been as low as I can. Nobody
knows. Only the Shadow knows . . .''
</P>
<P>
   There it is again, the Shadow. Boxing's feared knockout artist
never has been able to knock out the biggest threat of all. The one
from within.
</P>
<P>
   He's wants to break habits that have shackled him to a
well-worn, self-destructive past, his new circle of management
says. He's trying, adviser Shelly Finkel says.
</P>
<P>
   The mental sparring has been evident in the sudden flash of
angry eyes and the repeated outbursts of profanity ever since he
started training at Phoenix's Madison Square Garden. But the
volatile process can't be a source of much comfort for advisor
Finkel, trainer Tommy Brooks or promoter Dan Goosen.
</P>
<P>
   They've watched Tyson go from an eerie calm to sudden storm
without an apparent reason or sign of imminent change. A tornado is
more predictable. The inescapable conclusion is that nobody can
forecast what Tyson will do tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty is part of a sales pitch for a fight that
largely has been met with public indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's advisers see his comeback as a long-term investment. The
idea is to re-introduce him tonight en route to a second Holyfield
rematch and, possibly, a long-awaited fight with 50-year-old George
Foreman. Both bouts promise to be record-setting money makers.
</P>
<P>
   All those hopes would suddenly end with an unexpected loss to
Botha or a repeat of the Bite Fight insanity. Still, the promoters
sell the uncertainty, almost as if they are pushing Tyson to the
very edge of the demise they hope to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has watched and worked with Tyson through long sessions
at the gritty downtown Phoenix gym.
</P>
<P>
   The repetition _ the punch, counter-punch _ has been an attempt
to re-instill fundamental skills so that they become intinctive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Mike created a lot of bad habits over the last
10 years,'' said Brooks, who was in Holyfield's corner when the two
last met. ``I'm trying to change that. Boxing is readjust,
readjust, readjust.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks is not a mind reader. He can remold Tyson the boxer
in the gym. But he can't re-make the mind, which, in the end, will
determine whether Tyson employs the tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's temper has repeatedly, and inexplicably, exploded
thoughout the past week in interview sessions. If it happens behind
a microphone, can't it again happen in the ring?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could answer that question,'' Brooks said. ``I'm not
a psychologist. He's a human being. I'm just a fight trainer. I'm
teaching him how to fight.'' &QL;

SLUMPING DEVILS GET BETTER AGAINST THE LOWLY LIGHTNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The timing was absolutely perfect for
the league's worst team to visit the Devils Friday night. With New
Jersey having lost its previous three games, the Tampa Bay
Lightning provided just the kind of soft touch needed by the
Devils, who posted a 3-1 victory at Continental Arena on the
strength of three goals on consecutive power plays in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   The victory averted what could have been a fourth consecutive
loss for the first time in almost four years for the Devils. Tampa
Bay has only one victory in its last 14 games and occupies last
place in the the National Hockey League with a record of 9-30-3.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rolston, Petr Sykora and Denis Pederson scored for the
Devils, who fired 33 shots at Corey Schwab in their second victory
in seven games (2-4-1) this month. The victory also ended a
four-game streak without a victory at home.
</P>
<P>
   The bad stretch has cost the Devils (23-13-5) first place in the
Atlantic Division, which is now occupied by the Philadelphia
Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're struggling, you want to get people to the net,''
said Pederson, whose goal was his first in 14 games. ``It was a big
win for us to get us over our slump, but we realize we're not
playing the hockey we need to be playing to win a majority of our
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Martin Brodeur, who lost to Ottawa twice this week,
played one of his better games in recent weeks and improved his
record to 19-11-5. His only blemish Friday night was a goal by
Darcy Tucker on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils paid tribute to Ken Daneyko before the game for
becoming the franchise leader in games played. Daneyko set the
record last month in his 935th game. He was honored by the Devils
at center ice Friday, along with his family and John McMullen, the
chairman and owner of the Devils. Then Daneyko went out and played
in his 951st game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had trouble holding the tears toward the end, that's why I
kept the speech short,'' Daneyko said. ``Dr. McMullen has been more
than a boss to me. He's more like a father to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Robbie Ftorek dressed seven defensemen and was forced to
play another one, Brad Bombardir, as a center because the team's
list of flu sufferers reached four on Friday. Jason Arnott joined
Jay Pandolfo, Patrik Elias and Chris Terreri on the list started by
Lyle Odelein four games ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning was left with only four defensemen after the first
period when Kjell Samuelsson pulled a hamstring and Ken Bannister
injured his right wrist in a collision with Sergei Brylin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tampa Bay opened the scoring 5 minutes 18 seconds into
the second period when Tucker converted Chris Gratton's pass for
his 11th goal of the season. It came during Tampa Bay's second
power play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston tied it for the Devils with his 11th goal of the season
just over two minutes later, on the Devils' second power play. Then
Sykora scored his 12th goal the next time the Devils had a one-man
advantage to give them the lead with 5:32 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was extended to 3-1 with 1:38 left, when Pederson
scored his sixth goal. The Devils had entered the game with just
two power-play goals in their previous five games.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the fifth in five games against the Devils for
COREY SCHWAB, the goaltender who was traded to Tampa Bay by the
Devils three seasons ago. &QL;

WISE FANS LOOKING GIFT TURKEY IN MOUTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The MGM Grand is offering two breakfast buffet
coupons to taxi drivers who will pick up passengers at the hotel
after tonight's fistic extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know why?'' the cabbie said.
</P>
<P>
   Our eyes met in his rear-view mirror. ``'Cause nobody wants to.
It's a ``garbage'' crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Last time Mike Tyson climbed into a boxing ring he suffered
temporary insanity and bit off Evander Holyfield's ear. Gun shots
reportedly rang out in the hotel casino, although a story put out
later said popping champagne corks caused the noise.
</P>
<P>
   Gaming tables shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In the panic, the cabbie said, more than 30 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Two $10 breakfasts?
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget it,'' the cabbie said.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed not to go near the hotel. Judging by lagging ticket
sales many others are opting to stay away, too, not out of fear for
their safety but because no matter how you promote this heavyweight
event it bears a suspicious resemblance to one of those frozen
birds Mike handed out in Phoenix during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Only this turkey isn't free.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets range from $200 to $1,200. It's not worth $45, the price
to watch it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tyson can't sell a fight against Francois Botha, the Great
White Nope.
</P>
<P>
   Those foolish enough to fall for the come-on will do so
primarily for the same reason people pay to go behind the curtain
at a carnival freak show.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months of counseling and obedience training apparently
have done wonders for the ex champ. After his exile, Tyson moved to
the Valley. He signed autographs. He gave toys and food to the
needy. His generosity and attempts to improve his image were
front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   Mike's handlers say he no longer bites. He still snaps
occasionally, but mostly at letter carriers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The only intrigue will be if oddsmakers and Steve ``Crocodile''
Finch are wrong. Tyson's paid cheerleader loudly predicts his man
``will tear Botha's head off.''
</P>
<P>
   What round?
</P>
<P>
   ``First,'' Croc said. ``Knock him out ``cold.''''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is expected to begin the fight as he usually does,
launching himself like a missile from a silo. But what if Botha
withstands the early assault? If Tyson can't put his opponent away
quickly will he become frustrated, and give in to his animal urges?
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas hopes not. The blackjack dealers want Tyson to win. So
do the dice tables and the roulette wheels and the strip hotels,
especially the MGM Grand. Dorothy and Toto (featured in the Oz wing
of the giant hotel) were spotted Friday at the sports book, betting
on Iron Mike, and giving 7-1 odds.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson wins he will get another Vegas fight, a bigger one, and
then another _ possibly, and don't laugh _ against 50-year old
George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   The high rollers would love that one. So would the casinos and
the Nevada State Athletic Commission which gave Tyson's license
back.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson is Las Vegas' prodigal son.

   He is welcome here. He belongs here. Tyson can be as crude as
the limericks of Andrew ``Dice'' Clay who is appearing at Bally's.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's history with women suggests he believes in the
spontaneity of romance. In this town that never sleeps
companionship can be found simply by picking up a telephone and
dialing a number advertised in the pulp magazines and X-rated
calling cards that litter the sidewalks along the neon strip.
</P>
<P>
   What does it say about boxing that Tyson remains the sport's
biggest draw? What does it say about society when Iron Mike strips
to his briefs at the weigh-in and poses and female admirers cheer?
</P>
<P>
   Boxing is incapable of feeling embarrassed. Tyson can't be
shamed. How does he feel about being characterized as a reclusive
rapist?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely not a recluse,'' said the former champ, as he
awaits a $10 million payday.

LAST-PLACE BLACKHAWKS TOO GOOD FOR RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Play enough last-place teams in succession and eventually one
will beat you. Friday night it was the Chicago Blackhawks, at the
bottom of the Central Division of the Western Conference, who
visited the Rangers at Madison Square Garden. Without a victory in
their previous seven games, the Blackhawks were well rested, having
spent the previous three nights at a Colorado resort.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Rangers, they resorted to the neutral-zone trap,
some opportunistic shooting and a little bit of undetected
interference at a key moment before leaving town with a 3-1
victory. The result ended the Rangers' winning streak at two games
and dropped them below .500 as they began the second half of their
82-game schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks have scored barely more than two goals a game,
and their final one Friday night was into an empty net. Brian
Leetch, the Ranger captain, seemed irked that he and his teammates
were unable to beat the Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold them to two goals and we should win that game,'' Leetch
said. ``We made a couple mistakes against a team that doesn't score
a lot.'' Despite the minislump of the Rangers' league-leading power
play, Leetch said, ``We need to score five-on-five.''
</P>
<P>
   Leetch has not scored, on the power play or at even strength, in
the last 16 games. He had three shots on goal Friday. Wayne Gretzky
had four, as did Manny Malhotra and John MacLean. But the only
Ranger to beat goalie Jocelyn Thibault was Marc Sarvard, who
gathered a rebound after a power play to tie the score at 1-1
midway through the second period. Thibault made 32 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's winning goal, by Mike Maneluk, came at 4 minutes 48
seconds of the third period. He scored off the rush, finding
himself alone on Ranger goalie Mike Richter after the Blue Shirts
were caught in a line change. Rangers Coach John Muckler said the
problem occurred because Chicago players were interfering with
Ranger defenseman Jeff Beukeboom as he tried to get to the bench.
Beukeboom agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy pinned me while I was trying to get off,'' Beukeboom
said. ``I definitely didn't have the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, it was the third of four consecutive games
against teams in last place in their divisions. After beating Tampa
on Sunday, the Rangers beat the Islanders on Wednesday and they
play the Canadiens Saturday in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers played without Todd Harvey, their aggressive right
wing, who is expected to miss at least four weeks with a
second-degree sprain of the medial collateral ligament in his left
knee. Defenseman Mathieu Schneider was back in the lineup after
missing two games with a groin pull.
</P>
<P>
   New to the lineup was forward Derek Armstrong, recalled from the
Hartford farm club, with 19 goals and 26 assists with the Wolf
Pack. He was on the right side of center Marc Savard for some
shifts and played for 3:16. MacLean, recently Savard's right wing,
moved over to Gretzky's line to replace Harvey. Also in the lineup
was defenseman Jan Mertzig, called up from Hartford this week. He
began the season with the Rangers, but was sent down in early
December.
</P>
<P>
   Following the game, the Rangers sent Armstrong back to Hartford
and recalled Scott Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Rangers' best players was Malhotra, who started the
game as the fourth-line center and finished as a third-line right
wing. A hard forechecker with good instincts, Malhotra played 9:20
and earned praise from Muckler, who reviewed his play as
``excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks came into the game with two consecutive defeats and an
0-5-2 record in the previous seven games. With an 11-25-6 record,
their .333 winning percentage was better than only Tampa's in the
27-team National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case in Wednesday's game with the Islanders, the
visiting team scored on the first shot of the game. This time it
was by Doug Gilmour, the former Devil, who stood in the slot
uncovered, took a right-to-left pass from Nelson Emerson and beat
Richter at 1:10 to give Chicago a 1-0 lead. It was the 10th of the
season for Gilmour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be sharper early,'' Richter said. ``We just have
to be more prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky was polite after the game, but he seemed to be
containing a smoldering anger. ``We just can't allow it, especially
in your own building against teams that are struggling,'' Gretzky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky finished the game at minus-2 in the plus/minus ratio.
His total for the season is minus-10, tied with Adam Graves for
worst on the team.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-game ceremony, the Rangers and the league honored
defenseman ULF SAMUELSSON, who played in his 1,000th. NHL game on
Wednesday night. &QL;

PALMER CONCEDING NOTHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He has not won a tournament on the Senior Tour in
11 years and victory might never visit him again. Arnold Palmer is
69 now, an age most measuring devices calculate as old and he is
burdened with fighting his own cancer and helping his wife, Winnie,
fight hers.
</P>
<P>
   The trophy case and bank account are full and for most this
would be a complete ledger. Palmer is rich enough, and fortunate
enough, to watch the twilight years unfold from a porch of his
choosing.
</P>
<P>
   But he still deals with life like a putt just outside the
leather, conceding nothing. So ``retirement'' becomes just another
word in the dictionary, a concept as foreign as laying up on a par
5.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good thing for anyone who is a fan of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer will continue to play in selected tournaments and the
Senior Skins Game, which he has won three times, is on the horizon.
He will also play in the ``Hope,'' where he is the only five-time
champion, when the regular tour stops in Palm Springs. And in April
he will walk the hills of Augusta National and again soak up the
cheers from an appreciative Masters gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is an exercise in diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   He played 13 events in 1997 and won $29,052. The same kind of
schedule last year yielded a return of $20,454 and placed him 111
on the elder tour's money list, a position that will do nothing to
denigrate his place in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Because wherever he goes, the gallery is sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   So now he shrugs off advancing age and disease and tries to find
the game that used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have played very poorly,'' said Palmer during a conference
call. ``I guess through the midst of radiation I underestimated how
strong the stuff really is. I was weak and my game just went bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As his strength began returning, so did his swing. Both will be
precious commodities during the Senior Skins Game to be played at
Mauna Lani Resort on the big island of Hawaii during Super Bowl
weekend. The field features Raymond Floyd, Jim Colbert and Hale
Irwin, who treats the Senior Tour like an ATM.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd is trying to win for the sixth consecutive time, which
stokes Palmer's competitive fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty phenomenal that he's done as well as he has. I can
tell you this, there will be three guys out there trying to
dismantle him this year,'' Palmer said of Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   That the Senior Tour has flourished, and given marginal players
on the regular tour a shot at cashing big checks rather those from
social security, is pretty much Palmer's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think that when I started, the total tournament purse
was $10,000 and now we're looking at some tournaments with purses
over $5 million, that is a pretty rapid progression,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This glut of money might do what money sometimes does; breed
jealously and tear a sport apart. For proof we only need to look at
the shambles in which professional basketball now finds itself.
</P>
<P>
   So Palmer, who has earned the right to be his sport's elder
statesman, cautions against a gilded view obscuring the memories of
where the game came from and what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concerns are protecting the game and keeping the game, the
tradition and the integrity that made the game so great for so long
and not getting into squabbles about how we distribute money and
how we make eligibility rules,'' he said. ``All those things should
be worked out with the PGA Tour, and that door is open.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is aware that time is now the most precious commodity he
has. And while he has graced golf's landscape for 45 years, he will
continue to grace it still. And the sporting world is richer for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball invasion: Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley will be
adding to the gallery buzz at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic next
week. Jordan, who said bye-bye to hoops this week, and Barkley have
accepted invitations to play in the pro-am that annually features a
big celebrity field.
</P>
<P>
   Other athletes competing will be tennis star Pete Sampras and Cy
Young Award winners Roger Clemens and Tom Glavine. Former president
Gerald Ford will also play _ so wear a hard hat if you plan to
follow his group.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Barkley will be paired together for four rounds
starting next Wednesday. &QL;

WHITMAN SEEKS TO RESTRICT SPENDING ON CITY'S AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Responding to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's
proposal to reclaim Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports
from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Gov. Christine
Todd Whitman has suggested that the agency withhold billions of
dollars that it has committed for improvements there over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Whitman, who has been challenged by Giuliani in recent
weeks on issues as varied as garbage hauling and the New York Jets,
said she had supported billions of dollars in improvements to the
two New York City airports. But, she said, it would be fiscally
irresponsible for the Port Authority, which is under contract to
operate and pay rent for the two airports until 2015, to make
long-term capital investments if Guiliani is serious about breaking
the lease and bringing in a private management company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the mayor's comments, it would make no sense for the
Port Authority to make any new investments in the New York airports
until their future is determined,'' Gov. Whitman said. ``If
Governor Pataki is interested, I would be happy to discuss with him
the appropriate restructuring of the agency, as long as it is in
the best interests of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Gov. Whitman and Gov. George E. Pataki share control of
the agency, she alone cannot dictate how the Port Authority spends
its money.
</P>
<P>
   But her comments made it clear that she does not intend to sit
idly by while Giuliani announces possible plans affecting its
future.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's statements, made during his State of the City speech
on Thursday, are the latest salvo in his campaign to regain control
of the two airports . Since his first campaign for mayor in 1989,
Giuliani has said that the authority favors New Jersey over New
York and diverts nearly $200 million per year from the airports'
profits to underwrite losses from the unprofitable PATH train
system and the Port Authority bus terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Coles, a senior adviser to the mayor, said that
during the last five years, the Port Authority had paid a total of
less than $100 million in rent for the two airports. Meanwhile,
Coles said, Port Authority officials have paid for dramatic
improvements at Newark International Airport, while allowing the
city's airports to become rundown and outdated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a cash cow the P.A. can continue to milk for
generations,'' Coles said. ``The city is not going to renew that
lease when it expires in 2015. So what the Port Authority should do
is return the airports to the city.''

MCDYESS TAKES HIS TIME  
 SUITORS MUST WAIT FOR DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
 AGENTS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suns free-agent forward Antonio McDyess apparently is in no
hurry to decide where he will play basketball next season, and his
agent said he won't push him for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based agent Tony Dutt insisted that none of the leading
contenders _ the Suns, the Denver Nuggets and the Houston Rockets _
has a particular edge at this point.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how long will the Suns wait? Camps were
originally supposed to open Monday, and the NBA has pushed that to
at least Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, he's holding up a lot of decisions,'' said
Dutt, who along with James Bryant, is representing McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   One decision he apparently isn't holding up is that of Chicago
free-agent center Luc Longley. Sources say Longley has agreed in
principle to join the Suns and will be in Phoenix for the start of
training camp early next week. Players cannot sign contracts until
the NBA's new collective-bargaining agreement is in writing.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that ink will be dry long before McDyess even
makes up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough problem for (the Suns), and it's a tough problem
for Antonio,'' Dutt said. ``But he's getting close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want teams to be able to do what they need to do, but we'll
know where he's going when he makes his choice. There is no hidden
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   That agenda issue is a sensitive subject for Dutt.
</P>
<P>
   He said there have been accusations that he is attempting to
direct McDyess to Houston because Dutt lives there. And the Nuggets
have his client and McDyess' friend, guard Nick Van Exel, under
contract for only this season. There also have been suggestions
Dutt might be trying to broker a new deal for Van Exel in return
for delivering McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there have been some rumors that I'm trying to get him
to go where I want him to go,'' Dutt said. ``That's not true. I've
got 12 clients and none of them are Houston Rockets. They may want
to live here in the off-season, but they don't play for the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took heat when Shawn Kemp left Seattle, and I can take the
heat now. That's my job. To be honest, I'll be happy whichever team
he picks as long as he's happy. There are no agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutt said he has been told the Suns may be ready to renounce the
rights to McDyess, which would free the club to use McDyess's $5.7
million salary cap space for other purposes. But he repeated what
Bryant said Thursday _ the Suns have not set a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Suns have been very supportive _ but firm,'' Dutt said.
``The sad part of this is that there have to be an awful lot of
assumptions under the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we would really like to do is sit down and meet with the
coaches to get a better feel for what they plan to do. Danny Ainge
has an edge there because Antonio knows him.''
</P>
<P>
   McDyess was in Houston for much of the off-season, so he's
probably gotten a good idea about Rockets Coach Rudy Tomjanovich,
if not face-to-face, then from Rockets players.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has a new coach, Mike D'Antoni, and McDyess has not met
him yet. But McDyess knows Nuggets General Manager Dan Issel well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at how competitive the team will be, too,''
Dutt said. ``Phoenix has always done well. Houston has done well.
He loved Denver. It shocked him when he was traded, but who knows
if Nick is going to be there next year?
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, he can only pick one, and he hasn't made that
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   On other fronts, the Suns are expected to offer Clifford
Robinson a new contract if McDyess doesn't return, and the club
could try to lure free agent guard Brent Barry.
</P>
<P>
   The club also would have a $1.75 million salary cap exception.
Terry Porter, a 35-year-old point guard who played last season in
Minnesota, is a possibility for that exception. The Suns need a
backup point guard and three-point shooting. Porter is a career
37.6-percent three-point shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Terry brings is high character, the ability to come in
and run a team and hit a shot when you need it and a solid role
model for younger players,'' said Porter's agent, Charles Besser,
who confirmed that the Suns have been in contact. ``If the deal is
right, I can easily see Terry playing in Phoenix.'' &QL;

RONNING ENJOYS LIFEIN NASHVILLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Former Coyotes' center &UR; Cliff Ronning faced the
unknown when the Coyotes sent him to the expansion Nashville
Predators after seven games this year to create more playing time
for rookie &UR; Daniel Briere.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, the unknown isn't all that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I wasn't sure, leaving a place like Phoenix where the
fans are great and it's an exciting place to play,'' said Ronning,
who centers the Predators' No. 1 line. ``I was going to a place
where you weren't sure fans would be in the stands. But the fans
are super-loud and they got right into it and enjoy the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronning had two goals and five assists in Phoenix, but since the
trade to Nashville he has had eight goals and 16 assists and leads
the expansion team in scoring (10-21-31).
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade hit me hard,'' Ronning said before Friday night's
meeting with the Coyotes. ``I am a human being and I was putting
everything I had into the team. Everything was the Coyotes to me.
But that's the way it goes. That's the business of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it has been great here, and the organization is
first-class. It's been fun and I'm excited to go to the rink. There
isn't a lot expected of us. The biggest thing we expect of
ourselves is to work hard every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade, Briere has scored five goals and had four
assists in much less ice time than Ronning receives. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tkachuk back? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Keith Tkachuk, who has been practicing for a week and looked
solid in Friday's morning skate, keeps making rumblings about
moving up his return from a broken rib to Sunday's game with
Chicago instead of Tuesday at home against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we'll evaluate before the Chicago game,''
General Manager &UR; Bobby Smith said, leaving the door open to an early
return. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tough defense &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Newly obtained defenseman &UR; J.J. Daigneault thinks the Coyotes
have the potential to have a great defense when &UR; Gerald Diduck
returns from the injured list in a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1993, when we won the Stanley Cup in Montreal, all of our
defensemen were very quick, mobile and good puck handlers,''
Daigneault said. ``That's what I see here with  &UR; Oleg (Tverdovsky),
 &UR; Teppo (Numminen), &UR; Jyrki (Lumme), &UR; 
 &UR; Keith (Carney) and Gerald and the good younger guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to be first on the puck, the way the game is
played today because there is a lot of dumping the puck in and
forechecking. If you have mobile defensemen who are first to the
puck, it's a lot less battling you have to do in your own defensive
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some irony in the fact that after being traded to
Phoenix on Wednesday, Daigneault's picture was on the cover of
Friday's game program _ in a Predators uniform.

JORDAN TO HAUNT VALLEY OF THE SUN?  
 EX-BULLS STAR LIKES AREA, MAY HANG OUT HERE OFTEN

<P>
   Was that Michael Jordan you saw strolling the fairways at The
Raven at South Mountain golf club?
</P>
<P>
   Could that have been his Airness sipping a cool one at Planet
Hollywood?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that Jordan's famous tongue wagging over his favorite
crispy Chinatown Chicken Spring Rolls _ smothered in spicy mandarin
orange syrup _ at Roy's of Scottsdale?
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't, it probably will be soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan for years has made Phoenix one of his favorite getaways.
He has been spotted playing many of the Valley's top golf courses,
including Phoenix Country Club, Paradise Valley CC, The Raven and
Grayhawk.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jordan has officially retired from the Chicago Bulls,
don't be surprised if he pops up even more often.
</P>
<P>
   There were rumors that Jordan is having a home built in the
area. It's not true.
</P>
<P>
   But he has had a new home constructed in the posh northeast
Valley for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan is in town to see his mom, it's a safe bet he'll
also stop by Charles Barkley's place. The former Suns forward and
current NBA free agent is one of Jordan's closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call him big brother, and he calls me big brother,'' Barkley
said. ``When we played in the (NBA) Finals in 1993, I remember
people were criticizing us because we played golf together and had
dinner every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic Johnson said we shouldn't be doing it during the Finals.
We talked about it, and we decided we're going to be friends a lot
longer than we're going to be basketball players.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even neighbors someday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Barkleys and the Jordans might soon have a nice
new place to dine.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Longley, Jordan's former teammate in Chicago and a player
the Suns are attempting to sign for the upcoming season, has a new
restaurant opening in Scottsdale this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Longley, a 7-foot-2 center from Australia, owns several
``Seasons'' eateries in other cities, which Jordan is known to have
found to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   No word on whether he's a big tipper. But we'll probably know
that soon enough, too. &QL;

WHO'LL FILL JORDAN'S SHOES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKNOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that he's officially (or at least ``99.9 percent'') retired,
there seems little argument that Michael Jordan is the best
basketball player of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Well, duh. Anyone who has seen an NBA game in the past 10 years
knew that. Anyone who has never seen an NBA game still probably
noticed the media saturation of Jordan's retirement press
conference, which drew only slightly less coverage than Neil
Armstrong walking on the moon. (Fitting _ Jordan played like he was
also in a lighter gravity. Plus, he walked a lot, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Now there seems to be consternation on everyone's part that,
without Jordan, NBA games will draw fewer viewers than ``Gilligan's
Island'' reruns. True, I don't anticipate many people rearranging
their busy schedules to squeeze in a Raptors-Clippers game. But
that episode where the castaways do a musical version of ``Hamlet''
_ you just can't see that enough.
</P>
<P>
   But the game must go on. Now, the question is: Who will be the
next Jordan? (It's important that we do this little exercise now.
The anti-Jordan backlash already has begun. You know the drill _
sure, he was a great player, but Jordan didn't do enough for the
rest of humanity at large. Soon the image Jordan's name will
conjure won't be a sculpted athlete dunking a basketball. It will
be a heartless scoundrel stealing gruel from orphans.)
</P>
<P>
   I've got my own list of candidates, which I'll share with you
shortly. But I'd also like to hear from you. (See the bottom of
this column for information on how to reach me.) Which player _ if
any _ will assume the mantle of Living Legend? Why? Why not? The
person who sends in the best response will receive for his efforts
a hearty thank-you, as well as a prominent mention in next week's
column. (Hey, sorry, but I don't have Jordan's money to throw
around.)
</P>
<P>
   My picks, pro and con, in descending order:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Allen Iverson _ Pros: incredible talent, exciting game,
unstoppable offensive machine. Remember, in Jordan's first few
years in the league, critics complained that he was a
one-dimensional ball hog, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Arrest record. Apparent unwillingness to work on team
aspect of his game. Or, according to some reports, to work on any
other aspect, either.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Scottie Pippen _ Pros: Teamed with Jordan to win those six
championships. Tremendous talent in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Seems surly. Pouts. Subject of my all-time favorite Jordan
quote. Remember when Pippen missed a playoff game because of a
migraine? During the next season's playoffs, after Pippen played a
horrible game, Jordan said two words to him: ``Headache, Scottie?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Grant Hill _ Pros: Excellent player, unselfish, hard worker.
Like Jordan, couldn't have guessed by his college game that he'd be
this good. Doesn't have as many endorsements as Jordan (who does?)
but pitches an awful lot of products.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Grant who? Seems like a nice guy. Too nice (an image he
has parodied in commercials). Only guy in the league you wish would
act a little more like a spoiled millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Shaquille O'Neal _ Pros: Hulking monster who can't be stopped
near the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Surlier than Pippen. Worst free-throw-shooting star since
Wilt. Two words: rap career.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Charles Barkley _ Pros: Great rebounder (just ask him), great
personality (just ask him), great quote (just listen to him).
Wouldn't suffer the slings and arrows Jordan has for not being a
social activist _ he's already told us he's not a role model.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Like a '76 Vega, he's old and breaking down. Fast.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kevin Garnett _ Pros: Exciting young player.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Huge contract blamed for lockout. Don't spend it all in
one place.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chris Webber _ Pros: Bald head.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Everything else.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Latrelle Sprewell - Pros: Excellent grip.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Temper, temper. &QL;

A SINGLE VOTE BOLSTERS CLOUT OF SENATE GOP  
 PATRONAGE BOSS OR BUFFER?  
 A PERPETUAL FUND RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The recent elections may have sowed tumult in
Washington, but here in the state capital, the Legislature that
began meeting this week was a virtual replica of the last one, as
seasoned _ or calcified, depending on one's view _ as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single lawmaker seeking another term lost in November,
which is not all that flabbergasting, considering that the
incumbents have so many advantages, especially in fund-raising,
that dislodging a veteran is kind of like evicting a tenant from a
rent-controlled apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to pad its ranks at the ballot box, the Republican
majority in the state Senate found another way, one that was far
cheaper than raining millions of dollars in campaign money _ most
of it collected from donors with matters before the Legislature _
on elections. It pilfered one of the opposition members. The cost,
it would seem, was the chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The defector was state Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffman of Syracuse,
who, oddly enough, had long delighted in haranguing the Republican
senators about their misguided ways. Whatever the cries of
hypocrisy from the Democrats, her reasons for switching, a month
after she was re-elected, point up the stark differences here
between Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   More so than in Congress, the minority parties in Albany are
powerless. Ms. Hoffman said in an interview that she had wearied of
that status, and wanted to give her constituents the ample benefits
of being in the majority _ a bigger staff, more state government
grants and the ability to introduce bills that actually have a
chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoffman could not resist throwing a few stones at her former
compatriots, most of whom are from New York City, saying that they
had little, if any, sensitivity to the concerns of upstate
communities, particularly rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   She is certainly able to address those issues more forcefully
with her new chairmanship. Asked whether garnering that post was
part of a deal with the Republicans, she responded tartly,
``Everything fell into place comfortably.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans now have a 36-to-25 edge in the Senate. The
beleaguered Democrats _ who have been in the Senate minority for
nearly all of this century _ sarcastically wished her good luck.
``Perhaps she got tired of arguing her convictions and standing up
for what's right,'' said state Sen. Martin Connor of Brooklyn, the
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   PATRONAGE BOSS OR BUFFER?
</P>
<P>
   When Eliot L. Spitzer was trying last fall to oust Dennis C.
Vacco as attorney general, he repeatedly characterized Vacco's
office as rife with Republican patronage. Now that Spitzer has the
job, he has gone out of his way to extol the accomplishments _ and
lack of political connections _ of his own management team.
</P>
<P>
   The officials whom Spitzer hired include two former U.S. Supreme
Court clerks, several former federal prosecutors, a former director
of the state Ethics Commission and others with similarly notable
resumes.
</P>
<P>
   But Spitzer has raised eyebrows with his choice for the deputy
attorney general overseeing regional offices _ Martin J. Mack, the
former chairman of the executive committee of the State Democratic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer contends that Mack is no patronage boss, but rather the
person who has basically been charged with telling local Democratic
chieftains who are seeking patronage jobs to forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said he had been inundated with calls and letters from
local leaders seeking favors and had politely let them know that
politics would not play a role in hiring.
</P>
<P>
   The response, he said, has ranged from ``respectful silence, to
anger, to rather acrimonious letters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a political price, but it is one that I am
obviously going to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer added that Mack was a highly respected lawyer who had
held a number of prominent government jobs, including county
attorney and mayor of Cortland, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A PERPETUAL FUND RAISER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Re-election may be a long way off, the oaths of office having
just been uttered, but state politicians are already beginning to
raise money for their next campaigns. Gov. George E. Pataki, a
Republican, has a handful of events scheduled for the next few
months, with ticket prices up to $2,000, while the state
comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, is having a party at
Tavern on the Green in late January, at $1,000 a person. If they
seek re-election, both men would next face New York voters in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, the Albany campaign machinery would typically
go into hibernation after elections. These days, the campaign, or
at least the fund raising, never ends. Incumbents in particular try
to collect money early, in an effort to demonstrate their strength
and ward off challengers, a tactic that both Pataki and McCall
adopted for the 1998 races.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's spokeswoman, said he needed adequate
resources to promote his record. ``You certainly can't rely on the
press to get your message out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also presumably intends to use his campaign to pay for
some of his trips around the nation as he seeks more influence in
the Republican Party. He is expected to begin traveling in early
February.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, who are up for re-election in 2000, are also starting
to collect contributions. Several are sponsoring fund-raisers in
Albany in January and February, while the Legislature is in
session, to attract lobbyists and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of states have banned such practices.
``These events are unethical and corrupting,'' said Blair Horner,
legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research
Group. ``In some ways, we have more of a fund-raising session than
we have a legislative session in Albany.''

SUN DEVILS SEE CHANCE TO BREAK UA STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although series records and early scores differ, two facts are
certain about Arizona State vs. Arizona in women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ASU still leads the rivalry, 29-17 by its count and 31-22 by UA
records, even though the Sun Devils are on a 10-game, five-year
losing streak that covers both the Jacquie Hullah and Charli Turner
Thorne coaching eras.
</P>
<P>
   Maura McHugh was the coach when ASU last beat the Wildcats, in
front of a home crowd of 4,110 in February 1993, and its last win
in Tucson was earlier that season.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of a streak-buster at 1 p.m. today at McKale Center are
about as even as the team records _ ASU (7-6, 1-3 Pac-10), UA (6-7,
1-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as gettable as they've been since I've been here,''
Turner Thorne said.
</P>
<P>
   But winning on the road against a team with a gritty, veteran
backcourt that can exploit ASU's penchant for turnovers will not be
easy. Felecity Willis alone can bring the ferocity needed to win a
rivalry game and will test ASU guards Natalie Tucker and Kitch
Kitchen at every chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Kitch I recruited her to play against Willis,'' Turner
Thorne said. ``I told her to take a UA tape, check out No. 23 and
get ready to play her.''
</P>
<P>
   How the ASU starting guards hold up against Willis, Lisa
Griffith and Reshea Bristol probably will determine the outcome.
The Sun Devils committed 92 turnovers (to 58 for their opponents)
in losing their first three Pac-10 games. Not coincidentally, ASU
had seven fewer turnovers than Washington State in winning, 63-54.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on our floor leadership with Natalie and
Shelly (Tom),'' Turner Thorne said. ``To get away from a few
players playing poorly so the whole team plays poorly. We've had
that in too many games.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker had 13 points, six assists and two turnovers against
Washington State compared with six points, three assists and 10
turnovers in an 86-54 loss to Washington two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had to win that game (Washington State), and I made
myself concentrate the whole morning before on what I had to do,''
said Tucker, ranked fourth nationally in free-throw percentage
(92.9). ``I'm a young point guard, and I've had a few bad games
that people have seen (on tape). I know I can deal with the
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has the Pac-10's worst three-point defense (ASU is No.
1) and was smoked for 14 treys in an 87-77 loss to Washington
State.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils will try to exploit that with Tom, the Pac-10
three-pointer percentage leader, Tucker, Georgie Lang and Kristine
Sand.
</P>
<P>
   ASU has the most experienced posts in juniors Rachel Holt (11.0
ppg, 5.8 rpg) and Sand (11.2, 4.0). But the Wildcats are getting
ample production from freshman Elizabeth Pickney (12.4, 6.2) and
junior-college transfers Tatum Brown (9.5, 5.2) and Angela Lackey
(12.4, 4.8).
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne is encouraged about about the return of 6-foot-3
freshman Theresa Jantzen from a fractured left foot and the
impending return of 6-2 freshman Leah Combs, who could be recovered
enough from stress fractures in both legs to return to practice
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to regroup a little bit with the injuries,'' Turner
Thorne said. ``My approach is to play well every game and be
competitive.'' &QL;

FOR RED HOOK, PIERSIDE BRAWL WITH CITY HALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Benny Torres was working the phone in his insurance
office on Richards Street in Red Hook. A sign in the window
declared, ``Real Estate Coming Soon.'' Torres is a loyal son of Red
Hook, down to how he was born: at home in the nearby projects, not
away at some hospital. He just got his real estate license. Now he
has plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm opening up a second office,'' he said. ``People have heard
good things. They no longer shriek when you tell them you're in Red
Hook.''
</P>
<P>
   The city also has plans for this Brooklyn peninsula, and it's
making Torres shriek. Last month, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
proposed it as the site for a transfer station, where tons of
garbage would be packed onto barges daily. This came while Red Hook
residents were savoring the promise of housing and commercial
development after enduring years of blight from drugs, crime and
official neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Even in bad times, Red Hook residents refused to be bystanders.
In the mid-1990s, a group devised a blueprint for community renewal
that would have turned it from an urban stepchild into a maritime
village that capitalized on its assets, especially its spectacular
waterfront views. The plan was hailed by neighborhood advocates and
city officials. Some improvements began. But residents wonder if
they toiled in vain, because they fear that the landscape they
envisioned will be obliterated by trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has been paving the streets in Red Hook,'' said
Torres, 35. ``They just fixed up the pier on Coffey Street.
Inspectors came by last year and were giving summonses if people
had dirty yards. That's in direct contradiction to what the city is
planning. In one sense, they say they're trying to improve the
neighborhood. On the other hand, they're trying to destroy it by
bringing in a waste transfer station.''
</P>
<P>
   The revitalization plan was the work of advocates, merchants and
residents, and a major goal was to stop the proliferation of waste
transfer stations. ``We got together to fight it out and come up
with a cohesive plan, rather than spend the rest of our lives
fighting noxious uses,'' said Sue Peebles, who was on the
committee. ``We devoted years of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was approved by the Department of City Planning in 1996,
some changes were made at the city's insistence. Ms. Peebles said
the community had sought to rezone some industrial areas to
preclude transfer stations, but city officials reviewed the issue
in light of the impending shutdown of the Fresh Kills landfill,
which is forcing the city to find new ways to dispose of its trash.
The final plan concluded that ``it would be premature to adopt new
zoning regulations for waste-related businesses at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   There is truly a need for the city to dispose of its trash. And
residents in any neighborhood chosen for a transfer station will
tend to oppose it. But in Red Hook, the idea of receiving more
garbage makes them worry that their dreams will be delayed.
Besides, is this their thanks for having spent hours away from home
and work devising a plan?
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a very sad message to communities that would like to
have a certain amount of control over their destiny,'' said Craig
Hammerman, the district manager of Community Board 6, which
includes Red Hook. ``It sours them on the notion that government is
there to work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the garbage plan still faces hearings and
reviews. Any actual proposal, they said, would be viewed in the
context of the community's planning efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barbara Longobardi, who worked on the Red Hook plan,
feels betrayed. ``It's like a shot to the heart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This neighborhood knows about shots. Bullets cut down Patrick
Daly, the principal of Public School 15, in 1992, and focused the
city's attention on Red Hook. During the American Revolution, it
was home to Fort Defiance, whose memory persists in a community
garden by that name that juts out into New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It played a role in the Battle of Brooklyn,'' said John
McGettrick, a co-chairman of the Red Hook Civic Association. ``It
should be noted that the Battle of Brooklyn was a rout for our
side. But we came back to win the war.''
</P>
<P>
   McGettrick vowed to rally his neighbors in the garbage war,
which he insisted was not over. ``People continually underestimate
the residents of this community,'' he said. ``This is one more time
when they're going to be proven wrong.''

PAC-10 RACE LOOKING AS IF IT'LL BE WACKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To update Forrest Gump, life's a lot like Pac-10 basketball. You
never know what you're going to get.
</P>
<P>
   We're not even finished with the third week of the season, and
already the needle on the wacky-o-meter is well into the red area.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: On Thursday in front of more than 13,000 fans going
bonkers at Wells Fargo Arena, Arizona beat Arizona State by one
point when  &UR; Eddie
 &UR; House's &UR; jumper bounced off the rim . . . and it wasn't even the
best game of the night.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Oregon 87, Washington State 83 in triple-overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Oregon won because it was on the road. The Ducks, who
won at California two weeks ago, returned home and dropped a pair
to Southern California and UCLA, by a total of three points.
Oregon's last three games have been decided by one point, two
points and in triple-overtime.
</P>
<P>
   And how about ASU? The Sun Devils are 2-3 in the Pac-10, the
losses coming to USC on the road by 2, to UCLA on the road by 3 in
overtime and to Arizona by 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, parity means mediocrity. But in the Pac-10, parity
means unprecedented balance and outcomes you can't predict with a
crystal basketball. Last week, Oregon State, which is supposed to
be one of the league's doormats, swept USC and UCLA at home.
Washington, picked to finish in the top three, started 0-3 before
beating Oregon State on Thursday. Of the 23 conference games played
to date, 12 have been decided by three points or less or in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The only parity-proof team is Stanford, which just might go
unbeaten in the conference. Although you shouldn't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a dogfight for second through whatever in the
league,'' Arizona Coach  &UR; Lute Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Stanford has shown they have the depth and the
experience and the ability and the size, and everything else you
need to have. If they lose, it'll be a surprise to pretty much
anybody. And I think the rest of us are going to keep banging away
and teams are going to lose, especially in road situations.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for an early coach of the year candidate, try
Oregon State's  &UR; Eddie Payne. After  &UR; Corey Benjamin left early for
the NBA draft and
 &UR; John-Blair Bickerstaff and  &UR; Ron Grady transferred, the Beavers were
presumably hard-pressed to match last year's three Pac-10
victories.
</P>
<P>
   But guard  &UR; Deaundra Tanner is an emerging star, everybody else
knows their roles, and they all listen well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many people know about Oregon State, and consequently
they're surprised we're able to win,'' Payne said. ``But what they
don't know is, they don't know these guys. I don't think I've ever
had a group of players quite like this team, in terms of approach,
attitude, character and focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best group of guys I've had in terms of working to
get better and responding to coaching.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Not chopped liver &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maryland got a commitment from an unusual player and made an
unusual commitment in return.
</P>
<P>
   The player is  &UR; Tamir Goodman, a 6-foot-3 guard who is a junior
at Baltimore's Talmudical Academy, an all-boys school for Jewish
students.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Goodman is a junior. He won't enroll at Maryland
until fall 2000. But he's been a lifelong Terrapins fan and besides
that, he can play, even though this is just his second season of
organized basketball.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``Baltimore Sun,'' Terps assistant  &UR; Billy Hahn
saw Goodman at a summer camp and recommended him to Coach  &UR; Gary
Williams. But what really sold Williams was a tape that showed
Goodman flashing an array of no-look, behind-the-back passes, dunks
and 25-foot jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one catch. As an Orthodox Jew, Goodman, who is
expected to grow to 6-6, cannot play between sunset Friday until
sunset Saturday to observe the Sabbath. But Williams has told
Goodman's coach that he will schedule around that, and ask the
Atlantic Coast Conference to do the same. &QL;  &QL; 
Declawed &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati finally lost, 62-60, at North Carolina-Charlotte on
Thursday, thanks to an inspired effort by the home team, something
less than that by the visiting Bearcats and a strange play at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   With 17.3 seconds left, and NC-Charlotte up by two, 49ers guard
 &UR; Diego
 &UR; Guevara missed the front end of a 1-and-1. His teammates thought a
two-shot foul had been called and didn't try for the rebound. But
Cincy's  &UR; Melvin
 &UR; Levett did. He grabbed the ball, dribbled downcourt and hit a
three-point basket.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the officials had blown the whistle and the shot was
waved off. Later, lead official  &UR; Tom O'Neill said it was an
``inadvertent'' whistle, meaning Levett's shot should have counted.
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats took the ball out of bounds and still had a chance,
but  &UR; Kenyon
 &UR; Martin missed a 1-and-1 with 3.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Levett took the loss like a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't cry about (the officials' mistakes),'' he told the
``Cincinnati'' ``Post.'' ``Those guys played a great game, and we
didn't meet their emotion at the beginning of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cincy Coach  &UR; Bob Huggins, ``They led the whole game. They
played better than us. . . . We had absolutely no enthusiasm. It's
like we're going to just show up and win, and that's not the
case.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Big win &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a start that earned mention on many ``most disappointing''
lists, Tennessee might have turned things around with a 47-46
victory over Kentucky, at Rupp Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first win at Kentucky in 20 years for Tennessee, a
preseason top 10 team according to many, but which hadn't seemed to
get over its season-opening loss to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols won ugly, but who cares? Tennessee shot 30.4 percent
from the floor, Kentucky 30.9 percent. Both were season lows.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, the first team to outrebound Kentucky this season,
had lost its past 11 games to the Wildcats, and had come within
single-digits just four times in the road losses.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it in perspective, Vols guard  &UR; Brandon Wharton said,
``You know what this is like? It's just like the football team
beating Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast breaks &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UCLA reserve guard  &UR; Rico Hines is expected to miss four to six
weeks after suffering a broken foot. He actually suffered the
injury several weeks ago, but kept playing. Hines was averaging 3.3
points and 2.1 rebounds in 16 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Coach  &UR; Billy Donovan and South Carolina's  &UR; Eddie
 &UR; Fogler, who are feuding because of Fogler's comments about
Donovan's recruiting, hid their feelings before the two teams
played, shaking hands and smiling. Then Florida went out and beat
the Gamecocks, 68-51.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State scored its fewest points at home in 30 years in a
54-43 loss to rival Oklahoma. It also was the Cowboys' lowest
points-total in any game since 1976. Oklahoma Coach  &UR; Kelvin Sampson
used a variety of defenses and credited his players with executing
them. Oklahoma State Coach  &UR; Eddie Sutton said, ``It was a screwy
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the game was on ESPN, Texas Christian's victory over
Southern Methodist ended after 1 a.m. That was fine with TCU
forward  &UR; Lee
 &UR; Nailon, who said, ``I'm usually getting my second wind at around
11.'' &QL;  &QL;

TWO STARS ENJOY THE POND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Wild Wing must look like a bull's eye to Mike
Modano and Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   The popular beak-faced mascot that sits upon the chest of the
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim has brought nothing but good luck to two of
the Stars' biggest stars. And last night was no exception as Modano
and Belfour led the Stars to a 3-1 victory before 17,150 quacking
fans at the Arrowhead Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Modano had three points to raise his points per game average
against the Ducks to 1.6 in his career _ his highest against any
NHL team. And Belfour stopped 27 shots to tally his 12th win in 16
career appearances against the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour now is 12-3-1 lifetime against the Ducks with a 1.42
goals against average. While he did much of that damage to Duck
pride with the Chicago Blackhawks, he fits in perfectly with the
Stars, who now are 16-3-1 in their past 20 meetings with the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The game was just the medicine the tired Stars needed as they
ended a five-game road trip, their longest of the season, with a
2-2-1 record. With Joe Nieuwendyk (knee) and Jamie Langenbrunner
(shoulder) out of the lineup and playing their third road game in
four nights, the Stars gave a gritty, hustling effort that pushed
their NHL-best record to 27-7-7 at the season's 41-game midpoint.
They are now 10 points ahead of their nearest Western Conference
competition, the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   With 61 points, the Stars are on pace for a 122-point season,
which would shatter last season's franchise record of 109 points.
Through 41 games last season, the Stars were 25-9-7, good for 57
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, one of the Stars Pacific Division rivals, fell to
16-18-8.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they had Wednesday in San Jose, the line of Modano,
Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen gave the Stars an early cushion.
Lehtinen picked up a loose puck in the nuetral zone, pushed into
the offensive zone and fired a hot slap shot from the left point.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks goalie Guy Hebert made the first stop, but then had to
slap a loose rebound away from a hard charging Hull. However,
Hebert's poke check went right to Modano, who scored from 20 feet
at the 5:27 mark for his 15th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen them made it 2-0 at the 13:11 mark of the first period
with his 15th goal of the season. Hull picked off an errant
clearing pass from the Ducks' Teemu Selanne and fed Modano, who
found Lehtinen in the slot.
</P>
<P>
   What was billed as a head-to-head battle of two of the best
lines in the NHL _ Selanne, Steve Rucchin and Paul Kariya vs. Hull,
Modano and Lehtinen _ was quickly over. Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg
started to play his role players more as the Stars had won a mental
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour then started what would become a key insurance goal in
the second period. With the Ducks short-handed and making a line
change, Belfour quickly fed a dump-in back to Sergei Zubov in the
neutral zone. Zubov pushed the puck ahead to Modano and Modano fed
Mike Keane flying into the slot behind a confused Ducks' team.
</P>
<P>
   That power play goal made it 3-0, and Belfour closed the door
the rest of the way, losing his shutout (he already has six against
the Ducks) when Fredrik Olausson scored a power play goal at the
8:50 mark of the third period.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _  &UR; Tommy Brooks has a new corner. And a very different
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   As &UR; Evander Holyfield's assistant trainer, Brooks once suggested
that no cornerman could halt the deterioration of Mike Tyson, 0-2
against Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   But, today, Brooks says Tyson would prevail in a third bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson beats Holyfield,'' Brooks said this week as he prepared
his new fighter for &UR; Frans Botha tonight at the MGM Grand. ``Mike
still has the speed and he still has the power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference this time is that he has a corner. In the past
two fights, his old corner just told him to knock Evander out. But
they didn't tell him how. They just thought Evander was a washed-up
fighter with one arm and one eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield was annoyed when Brooks' comment reached him in
Houston, where he is training for his March bout with  &UR; Lennox
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he said that, it's just because he wants to take the
money,'' Holyfield said. ``I don't know if he really believes it.
But if that fight ever comes about, he can't win. If Mike loses,
Brooks gets fired.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The schedule &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opening bell for Tyson-Botha is expected between 9 p.m. and 9:30
p.m. (Arizona time), according to Showtime, the pay-per-view
network that will telecast the card.
</P>
<P>
   The televised portion of the undercard is scheduled to begin at
7 p.m. with Brooklyn junior-welterweight &UR; Zab Judah (18-0, 13 KOs)
against Puerto Rican
 &UR; Wilfredo Negron (17-3, 14 KOs) for the International Boxing
Federation title.
</P>
<P>
   Two other title fights are scheduled. In one, Puerto Rican
junior-lightweight  &UR; Jojn John Molina (45-5, 30 KOs) challenges IBF
champ  &UR; Roberto
 &UR; Garcia (31-0, 24 KOs) of Oxnard, Calif. In the other, Mexican
lightweight &UR; 
 &UR; Goyo Vargas (38-6-1, 28 KOs) faces African &UR; Ben Tackie (18-0, 11
KOs) for a fringe Continental title sponsored by the World Boxing
Council. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Also in the ring &QL; 
 &QL; 
With  &UR; Mills Lane in retirement and presiding over a made-for-TV
courtroom, veteran &UR; Richard Steele draws the referee assignment for
Botha-Tyson.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert,
weighed in Friday on the timing of the State of the Union address,
saying President Clinton should deliver his speech as planned on
Tuesday even though the Senate is in the middle of his impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are extraordinary times,'' Hastert said. ``The president
is on trial in the Senate, facing serious charges regarding perjury
and obstruction of justice. Some have said we should simply cancel
the State of the Union speech, given the discomfort surrounding the
president's trial in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his aides have said he would stick to the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, Hastert said, should go ahead with the address, ``out
of respect for the Office of the presidency and for a desire to
hear about the state of the union.''

ASU PUTS WOOD TO SLOPPY UTAH  
 14 WALKS HELP HIT TING ATTACK

<P>
   Crack?
</P>
<P>
   The ping that has defined college baseball was replaced by the
crack of wooden bats Friday night when Arizona State and Utah
opened their seasons at Packard Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pac-10 has agreed to the use of a modified aluminum
bat for the 1999 season, unresolved indemnity issues involving bat
manufacturers, the NCAA and member schools prompted ASU to go with
wood Friday. It didn't seem to make a difference. The Sun Devils
pounded 12 hits and rolled to a 17-4 victory over the Utes in front
of 1,150 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are one of the few teams in the country that
practice with wooden bats, and it paid off. Third baseman Andrew
Beinbrink led the way, going 4 for 5 with four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Williamson (1-0), a transfer from Northwestern, replaced
Chad Pennington after 5 innings to pick up the victory. He allowed
no runs or hits and struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   The Utes struggled on the mound throughout, allowing 12 hits and
issuing 14 walks. Troy Beckman (0-1) was tagged with the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ASU jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the first on back-to-back
doubles by Jay Sitzman and Beinbrink. Utah tied it up in the second
after Mike Wood walked and came home on a single by Adam Castleton.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils asserted themselves in the third and received a
little help from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   After Dustin Delucchi reached first on a throwing error by Utes
pitcher Troy Beckman, Willie Bloomquist, ASU's walk leader last
season, drew another. Both scored on Beinbrink's hit up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Sitzman got on base when Utah left fielder Jed Chrisman bobbled
a fly ball and later scored on another error. Casey Myers'
groundout brought home Beinbrink, and ASU had a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wood made it 5-2 in the fourth after scoring on Chrisman's base
hit.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Devils didn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Duncan singled and scored on Mark Ernster's base hit.
Delucchi, who reached first on a walk, and Ernster scored on
Bloomquist's single to left. Beinbrink logged his fourth RBI of the
game with a hit to left that drove in Bloomquist, increasing ASU's
lead to 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   After the Utes added another two in the fifth, the Sun Devils
replaced Pennington with right-hander Williamson. He retired Utah
on a pop-up and a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Scott Goodman, a transfer from Cuesta College,
gave Williamson a little more cushion with a triple in the fifth
inning. He scored on Jeff Phelps' sacrifice fly to center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils added five in the sixth. Bloomquist and Sitzman
drew walks and scored on another error by Chrisman and a passed
ball, respectively. Brendan Hines came home on a double by Goodman,
who was pushed home on a walk by struggling pitcher Brandon
Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, E.J. Martinez, couldn't do much better and
walked home Phelps. ASU's lead increased to 15-4. &QL; 
Notes
</P>
<P>
   Among the fans in attendance was former ASU pitcher Ryan Mills,
who was a first-round draft pick by the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of a new scoreboard at Packard Stadium will get
under way Monday and is expected to be completed by the team's next
homestand, beginning Jan. 29. &QL;

<P>
   MALIBU _ Pepperdine coach Lorenzo Romar probably couldn't bear
to watch the closing moments of the 31-point loss at Gonzaga last
week, the worst defeat in five years for the Waves.
</P>
<P>
   But he liked what he saw against Santa Clara on Friday night, at
home and in a game that was crucial to the team's West Coast
Conference title and NCAA Tournament hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves forced 23 turnovers and forced the Broncos into 40
percent shooting from the floor in a 67-56 win in front of 2,238 at
Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with our guys' intensity,'' Romar said
after Pepperdine improved to 2-1 in the WCC and 11-7 overall. ``Our
guys fought hard. . . . It was a game that we had to win. To be
honest, we have to win the rest of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzaga loss included a stretch at the end of the first half
when the Waves were outscored 20-4. This time, Pepperdine didn't
fall into a lapse like that, even though it took the Waves 3{
minutes to score their first point of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point, Santa Clara (6-9, 2-1) was dictating the pace.
It was 11-8 when Pepperdine reserve guard Tezale Archie, a 6-foot-1
junior, came off the bench and immediately made a 3-pointer that
set the tone for the rest of his night.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 13 points and was just as valuable on defense, getting
a team-high five steals in only 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have a role and that's mine, to come off the bench and
provide a spark,'' Archie said. ``I was playing in passing lanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Romar said Archie ``played a large part toward winning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tezale Archie gave a great lift for us,'' he said. ``We expect
him to do that. He was exceptionally quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Archie broke his left pinky finger in Pepperdine's second game
of the season and was sidelined for a month.
</P>
<P>
   He's been a key player since he came back in late December.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Archie) brings a lot of energy to the team,'' said Jelani
Gardner, Pepperdine's leading scorer who had 20 points Friday
night. ``He can pressure the point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara coach Dick Davey was impressed with the Waves' team
defense. Pepperdine made 12 steals and blocked seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give Lorenzo credit,'' Davey said. ``He's gotten
his defense to the level where they can play with almost anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine hosts the University of San Francisco tonight at 5.

L.A. PANEL OKS CABLE DEAL; LEAVES ONLINE ACCESS ISSUE UNRESOLVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Under ferocious lobbying from giant companies,
the Los Angeles city commission on technology Friday approved
AT&AMP;T's takeover of east San Fernando Valley cable television
service without deciding whether consumers should have open access
to the Internet service provider of their choice on cable.
</P>
<P>
   The board's indecision leaves it to the City Council to decide
-- with national Internet, telephone and cable companies watching
closely -- whether consumers have to pay a premium for cable online
services of their choice or whether cable operators have a
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The city Information and Technology Board agreed to transfer the
Van Nuys, Calif., franchise of cable giant Tele-Communications Inc.
to joint possession of TCI and AT&AMP;T, which are in the process of
merging. They are not required to provide access to other Internet
providers until a federal state or local government adopts a
regulation demanding such open access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city in this case got the best of all possible worlds,''
said board president Alan Arkatov. ``We were excited about bringing
AT&AMP;T in as a partner while keeping the promise of the Internet,
which means nondiscriminatory access.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T plans to use the cable system to deliver not only
television programming, but high-speed Internet access 100 times
faster than telephone connections provide. That would allow
downloading of complex graphics and videos in just seconds, instead
of the minutes it now takes for most consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan said he received calls on the issue from
top executives at AT&AMP;T and America Online. While he declined to
take a position before the decision, he said through a spokesman
that he was pleased at the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor wants to make it known that he applauds the action
of the board today,'' said Assistant Deputy Mayor Juan Pittman.
``AT&AMP;T is a terrific company and we're proud to have them as part
of our franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   As AT&AMP;T completes its merger plans, it must individually request
cable franchises from each city in which it operates -- giving
local governments an unprecedented chance to shape
telecommunications law.
</P>
<P>
   However, that law remains a murky area. Neither federal nor
local laws precisely define what kind of access cable companies
must provide to other online providers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While other Internet providers say they want to plug into AT&AMP;T's
cable modem platform -- the hardware of its cable network -- AT&AMP;T
says they can only access it indirectly through the AT&AMP;T online
service.
</P>
<P>
   If consumers want cable Internet access but still want to use
America Online or another service provider, they must pay
separately for both services.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T argued that the cable lines are inextricably linked to its
Internet service, Home, making it technologically infeasible for
numerous Internet service providers to directly connect to the
cable system.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from AOL, GTE and other companies countered that it's
clearly possible for AT&AMP;T to provide direct cable access to other
Internet service providers, ensuring less expensive and more
diverse high-speed Internet access to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The board decision leaves open that disagreement -- requiring
the company to comply with all laws regarding ``nondiscriminatory
access'' -- but declining to set those laws itself.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the board resolved to complete a study within 180 days
on a citywide policy for online cable access.
</P>
<P>
   The board's decision will go to a City Council committee on Jan.
21, and then to the full council.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides declared satisfaction at the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased they recommended the approval of the transfer,''
said Lois Hedg-peth, AT&AMP;T's president of operations in the pacific
western states. ``They approved the transfer with no regulations or
rules that we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   George Mihlsten, an attorney for America Online, was jubilant
that the agreement requires compliance with future laws. He said
he's confident the FCC or the city itself will soon require AT&AMP;T to
allow other online providers to directly access its cable system.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is now required to comply with any local, state or
federal requirements on open access,'' he said. ``That is
historic.''

(SUBS 3rd graf to add info. on power outages in Md., Va. and D.C.
No other changes.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was slippery and soggy throughout the Northeast on
Friday, as New Yorkers practically skated down sidewalks that
looked in the morning as if they were coated with polyurethane, and
in the afternoon like slushy, running puddles as the sleet gave way
to rain and, finally, clearing skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen so much ice with so little cold,'' said Carlos
Santos, 38, who lives in North Babylon on Long Island and works
near the World Trade Center in Manhattan. ``Coming out of the
subways, there were four blocks of ice in every direction.'' There
were people walking in the streets. I've never seen that.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm glazed trees with ice, breaking off limbs and knocking
out power. About 349,000 customers lost power in Maryland and
Washington at the height of the storm; 280,000 were still without
power Friday night. More than 100,000 customers lost service in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Logan International Airport in Boston was closed for three hours
because of freezing rain, and more than 200 morning flights at
LaGuardia and Newark International airports were canceled, leaving
thousands of travelers in long customer service lines, where some
knitted and some debated the relative merits of the coffee at
Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Commuter trains into New York from Long Island, Connecticut and
New Jersey were delayed 20 to 40 minutes, and there were dozens of
crashes on area highways during the morning commute, including two
pileups involving 16 cars on the icy ramps linking Interstates 287
and 80 in Parsippany, N.J. There were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's Train No. 48, which was supposed to leave Chicago at
7:30 p.m. Wednesday and head to New York City, did not leave until
1:35 a.m. Thursday. Weather delays slowed its progress, so that the
crew, prohibited from working more than 12 hours in a row, had to
stop just outside Syracuse. The train sat for more than 10 hours,
and arrived in Pennsylvania Station at 6:44 a.m., 15 hours and 45
minutes behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 people in New Jersey, 22,000 people in Long Island
and about 8,500 in New York City lost electricity, and there was a
major voltage dip from Battery Park City to midtown Manhattan about
6 a.m. when four Con Edison transformers shut down because of ice.
About 200,000 people in suburban Maryland and Virginia were also
without power.
</P>
<P>
   Many New York streets and subways were strangely empty, as the
second day in a row of truly yucky weather and suburban school
cancellations led lots of people to just stay home.
</P>
<P>
   But by lunchtime, people were shopping in Chelsea without
jackets, and bicyclists were again filling the streets. It was
another installment of what meteorologist Fred Gadomski called the
``see-saw regime'' that has been this winter, a miserable morning
that turned mild by midday.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was in its final phases throughout the Northeast
corridor, Gadomski said. In Washington, it was 35 degrees and sunny
by 11:30 a.m. Most of New Jersey and Pennsylvania had dried out,
but it was still snowing in upstate New York much of Friday, and
Montpelier, Vt., was shivering with hard, freezing rain and
temperatures about 26 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The quick changes made things messier in many places. On Long
Island, temperatures as high as 50 degrees turned Thursday's snow
into pools of trapped water on many roadways. In Springfield
Gardens, a Queens neighborhood with no sewer system, residents were
trapped in their homes for fear of floods. And Lauren Serra, 12, of
Brewster in Putnam County was celebrating her surprise five-day
weekend with an afternoon of sledding on icy snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me more time to study,'' said Lauren, who was
supposed to have a math test and a social studies test in classes
that were canceled Thursday and Friday. ``Of course, I'm not
studying now.''
</P>
<P>
   The day dawned with a pretty dusting of snow on tree branches,
but freezing rain soon washed that away, leaving treacherous
streets and sidewalks as well as falling tree limbs that broke
power lines.
</P>
<P>
   It was, to put it mildly, a bad day to be a bike messenger.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Brown, a messenger in Manhattan, was head-to-toe in
yellow raingear, his rubber overalls covered by a big slicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bills got to be paid, and it beats robbing somebody,''
Brown said. ``Besides, I love riding a bike. I have no boss on my
back, and I can set my own hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Letter carriers, too, remained surprisingly chipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Massachusetts, so this is nothing,'' said James Pate,
57, as he pushed a covered cart of mail along his route on West
18th Street in Chelsea. ``This is like summer to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oradell, N.J., letter carrier Ken Juergens noted: ``It's
nicer when people shovel.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the worst place to be Friday was an airport, where
everyone wanted to be someplace else.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hutten left his home in Canada on Wednesday to visit his
girlfriend in Curitiba, Brazil. Instead, he spent three days stuck
in Boston, much of it in Logan airport.
</P>
<P>
   Hutten's flight from Nova Scotia to Newark was canceled, so he
got on a plane to Boston. It was diverted to Connecticut, where
Hutten caught a bus to Boston. Friday afternoon, he was waiting for
a flight to Kennedy International Airport, where he could connect
to Sao Paolo, but there were few planes coming into Logan. He said
he has learned one thing: He likes Starbucks more than Dunkin'
Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   One man celebrating the wet weather Friday was Joseph Pugni, 67,
of Valhalla, who walked away from what could have been a fatal
accident in the freezing rain Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pugni was driving his 1983 Lincoln on Lakeview Avenue when he
approached the Metro-North railroad crossing, with the gate down.
He lost control of the car when he tried to stop, and ended up on
the electrified third rail, watching the train's white lights
rushing toward him. Pugni got out without a scratch as the car
caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd stayed there one second more, I was finished,'' he
said. ``The strange thing is, this is actually a road that runs
through a cemetery.''

CONTRACTS OF CARDS ASSISTANTS EXTENDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis becomes head coach of
the Chicago Bears, the Cardinals' staff will come back intact.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Bill Bidwill has extended the contracts of eight assistant
coaches whose deals expire next month, ``The Republic'' has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the team said Bidwill gave two-year contracts
with ``significant raises'' to quarterbacks coach Geep Chryst,
running-backs coach Johnny Roland, wide-receivers coach Vic Rapp,
McGinnis, defensive-line coach Joe Greene, linebackers coach Glenn
Pires, secondary coach Larry Marmie and special-teams coach Alan
Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Three other assistants _ offensive coordinator Marc Trestman,
offensive-line coach George Warhop and tight-ends coach Hank
Kuhlmann _ already were under contract, having just completed their
first years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very important,'' one Cardinals assistant said.
``There are a lot of (coaching) jobs open, and we didn't want to
lose anybody. We've got a great thing going on here. Everybody's
excited, and it's only going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals recently completed their first winning season
(10-8) since moving to Arizona in 1988. They advanced to the
playoffs for the first time in a non-strike year since 1975, and
the franchise won its first playoff game in 51 years by beating
Dallas, 20-7, in an NFC wild-card game.
</P>
<P>
   The eight assistants' new contracts will expire at the same time
as head Coach Vince Tobin's, which has two years remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the assistants _ McGinnis, Rapp and Greene _ were
scheduled to leave today for the Senior Bowl college all-star game
in Mobile, Ala. The rest of the staff is expected to go to the
Senior Bowl on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Cardinals' personnel department spent the
past few days in the Bay Area scouting players at East-West Shrine
Game workouts.
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis, meanwhile, appears to be one of five finalists for the
Bears' job.
</P>
<P>
   The others are Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Pendry, Green
Bay offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis, Jacksonville defensive
coordinator Dick Jauron and Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Jim
Haslet.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists will meet with Bears President Michael McCaskey
next week. &QL;

BREAKING OUT OF A BIG CROWD  
 TYSON SECURITY CHIEF GIVES NFL SON AN EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It's probably no coincidence that Atlanta Falcons
running back Jamal Anderson knows how to follow his blockers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's dad has been leading people through some of sports'
toughest crowds all his life.
</P>
<P>
   James Anderson is chief of security for Mike Tyson. He also has
worked for Sugar Ray Leonard, Donna Summer, the Jacksons and Boyz
II Men. But his biggest job was for Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a training class with the New York Police Department
and was assigned to Ali,'' James Anderson said this week as he
diligently kept an eye on all the security details in the
ever-present storm that has surrounded Tyson for tonight's fight
with Frans Botha at the MGM Grand. ``Once I worked with Ali, doors
started to open.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, there was Jamal, who had seven relatives all
named Uncle Muhammad while growing up.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Jamal likes to call himself ``pretty.'' It's a word
Ali often used to describe himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's just Jamal adding it and then blaming it on Ali,''
said James Anderson, a 48-year-old native of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, James Anderson's interest and energies will be
divided. Tonight, he's working for Tyson. On Sunday, he'll be
watching his son as the Falcons play the Minnesota Vikings in the
NFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 1 a.m. flight from Las Vegas to Minneapolis on
Sunday,'' James Anderson said. ``It arrives in Minnesota at 6:30
a.m. I usually don't go to Jamal's away games. I'm superstitious,
and I don't want to break the streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not sure I'll make the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, Anderson expects to watch it on a big-screen
television at Tyson's Las Vegas' home, which is up for sale. Tyson
calls himself one of Jamal's biggest fans. They almost grew up
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson used to come to our house all the time,'' Anderson said.
``They would keep keep in constant contact. They feed off each
other. What Jamal has achieved makes Mike want to get his title
back. Mike's comeback makes Jamal want to go to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his son's relationship with famous fighters, he never
was tempted by the fight game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal and his brother, Jay, used to travel with me to Sugar
Ray Leonard's fights,'' James Anderson said. ``The amazing thing is
that neither of them ever picked up a glove or ever showed an
interest in fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became aware of his athletic ability when he was about 6. He
just started running over people.''
</P>
<P>
   The only boxing-related skill is Jamal's jab-like stiff arm. Dad
takes credit for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he perfected it, eventually,'' James Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   A prediction?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson only had one. The security professional said he's
expecting an excellent fight.
</P>
<P>
   But the dad picks the Falcons, 34-31. &QL;

SUN DEVILS FLOOR WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Overcoming four falls on balance beam with a dominating floor
exercise performance, sixth-ranked Arizona State beat No. 8
Washington, 193.15-192.25, in its gymnastics opener Friday night at
Wells Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The meet was much like the 1998 Midwest Regional when ASU
started with three falls on uneven parallel bars yet qualified for
the NCAA Championships, finishing sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to do it that way,'' said Elizabeth McNabb, who
for a third consecutive season scored 9.95 on floor to complete the
comeback from a .55 deficit after three events. ``That's not the
best way for the team, but luckily we have a good floor lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils lost junior all-arounder Amy Shelton to a
dislocated left elbow in warm-ups. Washington (0-2) was without its
six-time All-America, Tiffany Simpson of Tempe, who has a stress
fracture in her leg that could require surgery and may require her
to take a redshirt season.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' other former Desert Devil, Amber Erdos of
Scottsdale, had a rough meet, falling on bars, one of her vaults
and beam. But it was a fall by Sidney Field, Washington's final
beam performer, at the end of her aerial series that gave ASU
enough room to extend its home winning streak to 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils scored no lower than 9.7 on floor, capped by McNabb's
near perfect routine to the music from Evita that she used last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like a 10 sometime in my career,'' McNabb said. ``I'd
rather think team than I, but sometimes I wonder what they take off
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers Lea Carver and Rhonda Robinette as well as juniors
Michelle Hess and Elizabeth Reid, on her mount, fell on beam, more
than erasing ASU's .675 two-event lead. The Devils also had to
count a fall on bars as sophomores Becky Acker and Kim Skinner went
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that we won, but I'm most pleased with the
character our kids showed and that they stayed focused,'' ASU Coach
John Spini said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we went up on floor, I said this is the same situation
you put my blood pressure in every year. Just do your job, and what
will be, will be.'' &QL;

<P>
   Is the John Force regime over? And if so, who next will occupy
the National Hot Rod Association Funny Car throne?
</P>
<P>
   Cruz Pedregon? Tony Pedregon?
</P>
<P>
   What about Ron Capps, who almost defrocked the seemingly
invincible Force last season, holding a 31-point lead entering the
homestretch before slipping to a career-high runner-up finish?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chances, there's no getting around that,'' said
Capps, 33, who is entering his third season driving the Copenhagen
Racing Camaro owned by legendary Don ``Snake'' Prudhomme. ``(Force)
left the door open a little bit. We got through the door, but we
just couldn't get all the way through the door and shut it behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Force shut the door, collaring an unprecedented eighth
championship this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although Capps captured the Big Bud Shootout all-star show
during the same U.S. Nationals weekend, he couldn't put away Force
when they met in the second round in the national event.
</P>
<P>
   And Force made Capps pay dearly for it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Capps stretching the tenuous lead, Force left
Indianapolis in front by 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Capps and Force again found themselves
staring at each other at the starting line. And, again, Force won
the showdown, defeating Capps in the semifinals and widening a
47-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was going so well at the U.S. Nationals,'' Capps
said. ``Even during the heat of the day, I was running good and
Force was smoking his tires every run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, right when (Force) and I met in the second, there was a
cloud cover. John ran a big time, and I had a $20 part go bad that
cost me the race. I truly believe we would have beat him if I had
had a clean run.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I guess that's why he's an eight-time champion. He stepped
up to the plate, pointed to the outfield and hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   End of story.
</P>
<P>
   And end of Capps.
</P>
<P>
   But a new season is approaching _ the Winternationals opener is
in three weeks, followed by the Checker/Schuck's/Kragen Nationals
on Feb. 25-28 at Firebird International Raceway Park _ and an
invigorated Capps is minus the cruel disappointment of letting a
possible title slip away.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Capps is encouraged he can do what only one other
driver this decade has been able to do, which is wear the Funny Car
crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could make excuses all day long about what happened last
year,'' said Capps, who credits Prudhomme's guidance and crew chief
Roland Leong's mechanical expertise for much of his progress. ``If
we wouldn't have all those first-round and second-round losses, we
would have had the consistency to beat Force. But we still had a
great year. It's just that John had a better year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year really teased us. It showed us we're destined to be
a championship team. The (crew) knows they have it in them to win
this thing. We know how much of a champion Force is, but we also
know we can run with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Force also knows his days may be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Although he won three events last season, giving him 65 wins
since 1990, it was two less than Capps, and was Force's lowest win
total of the decade. Force won an incredible 13 races in 1996, the
season he was named motorsports' Driver of the Year, and was an
11-time winner in 1993 and won 10 more in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Until last season, the fewest he had won over the past nine
seasons was six. Even in 1992, when he finished second to Cruz
Pedregon, he won a season-high nine races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting tougher each year,'' Force said. ``The
competition isn't letting up. I knew that Snake was going to be
tough when he hired that kid, Ron Capps. I've got to keep an eye on
him. All he thinks is win. Those kind of guys get you on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how good he is. I tried to hire him, but Snake got him
first.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite Capps failing to protect a late-season lead,
Prudhomme is far from unhappy with his driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a terrific year,'' Prudhomme said. ``(But) now
our appetite has been whetted. We were busy during the winter.
We've developed a little sleeker Camaro body. We're always looking
for more downforce. We did a lot of development work over the
winter. We'll be running some new cylinder heads, and we're looking
forward to getting the new year started.''
</P>
<P>
   They won't have to wait long.
</P>
<P>
   Capps and several other teams will test next week in the John
Myers Winternationals Warm-ups at Southwestern International
Raceway in Tucson. The six-day event runs from Jan. 21-26.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several other pro teams will test Jan. 22-24 at the
Hot Rod magazine PRO National Time Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Capps hardly can wait to get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock for a lot the year last season,'' Capps said.
``We won the first race of the season and led the points for a long
time. Even when we fell back, we only fell back to third place.
It's not like we were ever out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that if we keep chugging along, we're going to be in
the hunt. We're just not going to take no for an answer this
year.'' &QL;

BET FARM ON 3-PEAT BY GORDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Questions, questions, questions. Now for some answers.
</P>
<P>
   Can  &UR; Jeff Gordon make it a NASCAR Winston Cup three-peat in
1999?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Put it this way. Take next month's rent, fly to Las
Vegas and put it squarely on Gordon's nose. The kid can't lose, can
he?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon's team isn't going to get any worse, so the rest of us
have to get better,'' driver  &UR; Ken Schrader said this week during
the annual media tour hosted by Charlotte Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Just how good do you have to be?  &UR; Mark Martin won a career-high
seven races and still was a speck in Gordon's rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Will there be more side-by-side racing and a lot less
Gordon-Martin runaways?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Or, at least, let's hope so.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, NASCAR officials may have corrected the lack of door
to door racing, when at the final race of the season, they inserted
rules to increase downforce.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet is unveiling a new Monte Carlo this season, most
likely at the Coca-Cola 600 in May at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
What's the early report card?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one is saying.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's anything like the 1995 Monte Carlo that replaced the
Lumina, the Chevy contingent will do cartwheels down pit road. The
'95 model was a killer machine right out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   Childress Racing and Hendrick Racing have been privately
developing the car, testing it thus far at Daytona International
Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   Top rookie?
</P>
<P>
   A:  &UR; Tony Stewart, Elliott Sadler and  &UR; Buckshot Jones are getting
all the headlines, but don't forget  &UR; Mike  &UR; Harmon and  &UR; Dan Pardus
also are rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, scratch Harmon and Par dus.
</P>
<P>
   Now scratch Jones, whose aggressiveness gets him into too much
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart may be the most talented but, like Jones, he is working
with a rookie crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   Why put a rookie driver with a rookie crew chief?
</P>
<P>
   At least, Stewart won't have to go at it alone. Unlike Jones, he
has a teammate in  &UR; Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rookie of the Year nod goes to Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler not only has respected crew chief  &UR; Mike Beam and the vast
experience of the Wood Brothers team to drawn upon, he also has
owner's provisionals.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Stewart do not.
</P>
<P>
   Next question, please.
</P>
<P>
   Will any racetracks currently on the Cup schedule receive a
coveted second date in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   A: No,  &UR; Bruton Smith. A thousand times, no.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose profitable Speedway Motorsports Inc. owns several
racetracks, include Texas Motor Speedway and Las Vegas Motor
Speedway, believes NASCAR would do itself a huge favor by granting
second races to Texas and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Texas and Las Vegas draw huge crowds. But so do California
Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway, which, by the way,
aren't going to receive second race dates, either.
</P>
<P>
   It's just not going to happen, no matter how many facilities
Smith puts in SMI's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The next racetrack to get a date will be Kansas City, and it
isn't even built.
</P>
<P>
   Barring splitting the circuit into an American and National
League, which Smith has been promoting and NASCAR has been shooting
down, Smith believes there is room for four more additions to the
current 34-race schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith believes two divisions is the answer to ``curing the
saturation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Smith's utopia, one circuit would be in the eastern United
States and one in the western. Two races would be held on the same
day in a doubleheader format.
</P>
<P>
   One question: What happens when one section of the country gets
Gordon and one doesn't? Or one gets Earnhardt and the other
doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   And, finally: NASCAR celebrated its 50th anniversary last
season. Where will the sport be 50 years from now?
</P>
<P>
   A: In Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be there in 2020,'' Charlotte Motor Speedway
President
 &UR; Humpy Wheeler said. ``It's going to become an international sport.
I think Mercedes and BMW are going to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have 20 races in this country and 10 races overseas in
Europe, the Far East and Australia. I just don't think you can keep
this sport in this country. Too popular.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly ... &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next November,  &UR; Dale Earnhardt Jr., will make his inaugural
appearance at Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   In a NASCAR Busch Grand National race, not Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt will appear in five Winston Cup races this season, but
none is scheduled at PIR. Earnhardt's debut will be in the May 30
Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Other Cup starts will be at New Hampshire (July 11), Michigan
Speedway (Aug. 22), Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway (Oct. 17) and
the season finale at Atlanta Motor Speedway (Nov. 21).
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt will drive the No. 8 Budweiser Chevrolet, which is the
same number his father and late grandfather drove in late models
and sportsman racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special number in our family,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``I
feel honored to be the next one to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Robby Gordon has formed his own team to compete in the
Championship Auto Racing Teams circuit, driving a Toyota-Swift.
Gordon also will enter the Indianapolis 500 in a car owned by  &UR; John
Menard, a minority owner in Gordon's CART team.
</P>
<P>
   CART and Indy Racing League teams have been sharing PIR lately
in test sessions. Unconfirmed reports are the IRL cars have posted
better speeds. At one test, IRL's  &UR; Scott Goodyear was four-tenths
of a second quicker than  &UR; Michael Andretti. Andretti, however, was
equipped with the smaller, lower-downforce rear wings that curb
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   In a unique sponsorship arrangement, Sara Lee will sponsor
 &UR; Derrike  &UR; Cope this season.
</P>
<P>
   Four brands of meat products will rotate primary sponsorship
throughout the 34-race season. Derrike Cope will drive the State
Fair Corn Dogs No. 30 Pontiac at PIR.
</P>
<P>
   The first ontrack confrontation between  &UR; Jeff Gordon and
Earnhardt Jr. is a Busch race scheduled March 28 at Texas Motor
Speedway. A spokesman for Dale Earnhardt Inc., however, said it
will happen earlier, but wouldn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you've rented a blimp, Indianapolis 500 and Brickyard 400
spectators at Indianapolis Motor Speedway are prevented from having
an unobstructed view of the gargantuan oval. In fact, some road
courses provide better fan viewing. IMS President  &UR; Tony George,
however, finally is doing something he should have done long ago. A
tentative agreement recently was reached with a South Dakota
company to install seven large television screens around the
2.5-mile oval. Just don't turn the channel.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Feb. 1, Phoenix-based Action Performance Inc. will
introduce SpeedMall, a virtual shopping mall featuring motorsports
and other automotive-related products and services on the Internet.
The site's address is www.goracing.com.
</P>
<P>
   Former Indy 500 chief steward  &UR; Tom Binford died Thursday. He was
74.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Greg Moore is the cyberspace choice to win the Championship
Auto Racing Teams title. A total of 43,232 visitors to the CART Web
site cast ballots, and 36.8 percent picked Moore.  &UR; Jimmy Vasser
(23.9 percent) was next, followed by  &UR; Paul Tracy (7.9),  &UR; Dario
Franchitti (7.6) and  &UR; Michael
 &UR; Andretti (6.5).
</P>
<P>
   The American Motorcyclist Association Cruise America Superbike
Challenge is March 20-21 at PIR. But the festivities continue
throughout the next week with several special events encompassing
the Arizona Motorcycle Rally, including the All Harley Drag Racing
Association Pure Steel Nationals at Speedworld Motorplex. Call
970-3757 for more information. &QL;

MONEY MAKES DIFFERENCE  
 FULL SPONSORSHIP HAS GILLILAND RARING TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
 WEST-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watch out for Butch Gilliland.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with more financial ammunition than ever before, Gilliland
is looking to bag a second NASCAR Winston West championship in
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a full sponsorship program with Ralph's Food For
Less,'' said Gilliland, who despite three wins last season finished
No. 6 in the final standings behind champion Kevin Harvick. ``It's
the first time I've ever started a season with the proper funding
to really do the proper job that I've always wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an experienced crew, our equipment is top-notch and
I think we'll be a contender at every racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland, 40, shouldn't have any problems in Sunday's season
opener at Tucson Raceway Park. Gilliland is the defending champion
and also holds the one-lap qualifying mark at 88.328 mph. In a
seven-race span between 1993 and 1996, Gilliland captured five of
the seven pole positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fast ever since the first time I raced (at
Tucson),'' said Gilliland, who won the '97 title with the aid of
four wins and 10 top-five finishes in 14 starts. ``It was like a
natural thing for us to run good.''
</P>
<P>
   And, naturally, Gilliland hopes to add to that record against
the likes of Lance Hooper, the 1996 champion, and 1994 titlist Mike
Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Other former champions entered include Bill Sedgwick (1991-92)
and Rick Carelli (1993), who's expected to start in the RE/MAX
International Chevrolet owned by balloonist David Leniger.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, who lives in North Carolina, hasn't been a series regular
since winning the '94 crown, but he plans a full-time effort in
1999. He made three starts last season and none in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   Harvich recently signed a contract to drive on the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series and won't defend his title.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Burns of Phoenix will return. Burns finished 12th in
last year's standings.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, appears to be looking forward to the season
more than Gilliland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to run one more year of Winston West, then try and
get a Winston Cup program going,'' said Gilliland, who lives in
Anaheim. ``But a lot depends on how well we do this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building four brand-new cars and we already have three
in our inventory. Two or three of the cars we'll use for five
Winston Cup races that we plan to enter.''
</P>
<P>
   The five scheduled Cup races are at Phoenix International
Raceway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Las Vegas Motor Speedway,
Sears Point, Calif., and Fontana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   David Gilliland, 22, Gilliland's son, will drive the team's
second Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to run him the whole season because he's a pretty good
driver,'' the elder Gilliland said. ``It just depends on whether we
can get some more sponsorship. &QL;

LEAKY DEFENSE SINKS NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOZEMAN, Mont. _ The despair is in their eyes, in the way their
mouths hang open and the way they gaze aimlessly around the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Defense is supposed to be the chore. It's work and not fun, and
right now the Matadors don't like to work very hard. And it's why
the Matadors had that look.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge came close, which it usually does, but the
inability to get key stops on defense resulted in an 87-82 loss to
Montana State in front of 5,011 Friday night at Worthington Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Matadors' third straight loss. Montana State is 8-0
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's defense,'' CSUN forward Rico Harris said. ``It's
frustrating me, but I keep a level head. This is a new experience
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also the usual offensive stagnation that burdens the
defense even more, and CSUN hit it again.
</P>
<P>
   When that time arrived, it was Montana State which was able to
work the shot clock down and hit open shots. They made 12 of 24
from 3-point range and shot 54 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore forward John Lazosky was the biggest benefactor. He
scored 21 points, breaking his career-high of 15 by halftime. And
though the Matadors, and foul trouble, kept the Big Sky's leading
scorer in Nate Holmstadt to 12 points, guard Danny Sprinkle had 22
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to play hard, but it's another thing to play
smart,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said. ``Our guys were well aware
of who their shooters were and where we needed to have our bodies,
but as coaches you can't go out and play the game for them. And
that's the frustrating part.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (9-8, 1-4 Big Sky) was able to claw much of the way back
from a 13-point deficit with 15 minutes to play with pressure, but
never pulled even.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the half-court offense would either evaporate into
forced shots or end with a turnover. By contrast, Montana State
(8-7, 2-2) countered any CSUN challenge with crisp ball movement
and uncontested shots.
</P>
<P>
   It happened a few times, but none more crushing than in the
final minute. A 3-pointer by Greg Minor and a chippie from Derrick
Higgins brought CSUN within 78-75 with 1:30 left, the closest it
had been since the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Bobcats work the 35-second clock and get an
open 3-point attempt afterward, but Lazosky hit the shot to give
Montana State an 81-75 lead with 49 second remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep game fast-paced and not let the wide-open
dudes shoot like that,'' said Minor, who scored 16 points. ``That's
what hurt our chances. We're making a run and they just hit big
threes.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's offensive lapse customarily begins with the second half,
but against the Bobcats it came a few minutes earlier. It allowed
the Bobcats to turn a two-point game into a 48-39 lead at the half
with a 9-2 run in the final 2:04.
</P>
<P>
   Most distressing was that Montana State built its lead without
the aid of the conference's leading scorer. Holmstadt played 10
minutes because of foul trouble, and in his absence Lazosky had the
half of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that same thing again,'' Braswell said. ``We come out
flat. We don't come out really getting after it. We get ourselves
out of a hole, and then we fight out of it. But every game we run
out of energy.''

DUCKS LOSE TO DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The Mighty Ducks needed more than an improved work
ethic against the Dallas Stars -- they needed a another miracle.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, 1998 Anaheim scored twice in the final 38 seconds to
tie the Stars, but it was back to reality on Friday night against
the NHL's best team. Dallas dominated the Ducks in a 3-1 victory
before 17,150 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a better team in the league I would hate to see
it,'' said Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg. ``They are machine-like,
they don't make mistakes and if you make mistakes they make you
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who lead the league with 61 points, took full
advantage of three Ducks mistakes to take a 3-0 lead 70 seconds
into the in the second period and put Anaheim out of its misery
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make them earn their chances,'' said Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks beat the Stars the first three times the two teams
played back in the 1993-94, but the series has provided Anaheim
nothing but heartache since. Dallas is 16-3-1 in the last 20 games,
outscoring the Ducks 74-35 in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya, who along with Teemu Selanne, was contained by the
defensive duo of Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk, admitted
Anaheim might be intimidated by the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when you play at home, you have to come out and
play your game, not worry about what they are doing,'' said Kariya,
who was the recepitant of several hard checks during the evening.
``I think we were watching and waiting too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg shuffled three of his four lines and dropped Travis
Green and Marty McInnis from the second line to the fourth, but the
changes became a moot point early on.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' energy level was up from Wednesday's loss to Calgary
-- ``that's not saying much,'' said Kariya. But Anaheim fell behind
when Guy Hebert couldn't control a rebound and then put an
ill-advised clearing pass on the stick of Mike Modano. The Dallas
center easily scored his 15th goal of the season into an empty net
at 5:27.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of three points on the night for Modano, who
has scored 31 points against the Ducks, the most by any oppossing
player.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas made it 2-0 at 13:11 when Ruslan Salei's attempted
clearing pass bounced off Brett Hull to Modano, who quickly fed
Jere Lethinen in the slot. Lehitnen scored his 15th goal by beating
Hebert high over the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always seem to start fast,'' said Anaheim defenseman
Fredrik Olausson. ``But that's no excuse for way we started. We
can't give them a 2-0 lead. They are too hard to comeback on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Ducks weren't done gift giving. With the Stars on the
power play, Dallas goalie Ed Belfour caught Anaheim on a line
change. Two quick passes later and Mike Keane had the puck alone
between the circles. The checking forward had plenty of time to tee
it up and beat Hebert at 1:10 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who improved to 12-3-2 with 1.42 goals against average
against the Ducks, nearly shutout Anaheim for the seventh time in
his career. But the Ducks, as has become the norm recently, were
able to manufacture some offense on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis centered a pass to Olausson cutting in front of Belfour
and the Ducks defenseman tucked in a backhander in for his ninth
goal of the season at 8:50 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   But five-on-five the Ducks could generate nothing, even though
they were outshot only 29-28.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg said he'd love to see his team use Dallas an an
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have four lines that play the same way,'' he said.
``That's the kind of team we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Olausson agreed with his coach that you might as well pattern
yourself after the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to aim for perfection and Dallas is very close,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks also know they have a long way to go before they
are in the same class as the Stars, especially when it comes to
putting out a consistent effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the effort (Friday night), but not enough to beat a
team like that,'' said Hartsburg.

<P>
   Vodafone Group PLC, Britain's largest mobile phone company, has
agreed to buy Airtouch Communications Inc. for more than $60
billion, edging out Bell Atlantic Corp. in a bidding war for the
nation's largest wireless company, the companies confirmed Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The combined entity, to be known as Vodafone Airtouch PLC, will
be the largest wireless telecommunications company in the world and
is being formed in one of the largest cross-border deals ever.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone sweetened its original cash- and-stock offer to $97 a
share, which includes giving Airtouch stockholders the equivalent
of half a Vodafone American depository receipt, plus $9 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, an on-again, off-again suitor of Airtouch, proposed to
buy the company after it was reported two weeks ago that Bell
Atlantic, the largest local phone company in the United States, had
been in talks to acquire Airtouch in a $45 billion stock swap.
</P>
<P>
   Airtouch's board of directors met Friday to review the two
offers. Bell Atlantic's board of directors met Friday and, said a
person close to those talks, agreed to submit a higher offer than
the $45 billion originally offered, but that offer was rejected.
The higher offer was not disclosed. Bell Atlantic released a
statement Friday night saying it had ended its discussions with
Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone and Airtouch will have an equal number of seats on the
board in the combined entity and senior management positions will
be equally shared. The chairman of Airtouch, Sam Ginn, is expected
to be named nonexecutive chairman of the combined entity. Chris
Gent, chief executive of Vodafone, will remain in that post.The
company will be based in Newbury, England, with U.S. operations in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vodafone Airtouch will have the size and financial resources
to take advantage of future opportunities,'' Ginn said.
</P>
<P>
   An Airtouch-Vodafone combination will create an international
powerhouse. The combined company will dominate throughout Europe.
Vodafone's customers outside Britain are largely in Northern
Europe, including Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Airtouch's European operations are mainly in the southern part
of the Continent, including Italy, Spain and Portugal. In all,
international wireless services make up 57 percent of Airtouch's
operating income, according to Deutsche Bank Research. The two
companies compete in Germany and are partners in ventures in both
Sweden and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Vodafone had shunned the U.S. market. In fact, the
company had been in talks earlier this year with Airtouch about
acquiring its European assets. Since splitting from Racal
Electronics, a maker of telecommunications gear and military
electronics, in 1988, Vodafone has grown into Britain's largest
wireless carrier, with almost 5 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers are attracted to its prices. In the last quarter
of 1998 alone, for instance, the company added more than 930,000
customers, mostly on the attraction of a plan that allows users to
pay as they call, rather than sign a long contract.
</P>
<P>
   A merger with Bell Atlantic, which had been in talks with
Airtouch for some time and already has 5.7 million cellular
customers blanketing the East Coast, would have aided the local
phone company's desire to be a national presence. Bell Atlantic's
bid for Airtouch had the blessing of GTE Corp., which Bell Atlantic
plans to buy this summer in a $52.9 billion stock swap.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's offer for Airtouch came two weeks ago when the
company delivered a preliminary proposal to Airtouch over the
weekend of Jan. 3. Vodafone said it would consider buying the
company for stock worth about $90 a share plus $5 to $6 in cash.
The price was higher than Bell Atlantic's offer, which at the time
was valued at $45 billion. But Ginn had earlier said he liked the
Bell Atlantic currency.
</P>
<P>
   One of the holdups in the Bell Atlantic and Airtouch talks was
whether the companies could combine under favorable accounting
rules. If allowed, Bell Atlantic would have avoided hefty charges
on future reported earnings. These issues were resolved this week
when the two companies received word from the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it would approve a favorable accounting
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies expressed interest in Airtouch, including MCI
Worldcom, which talked to the company but did not make a formal
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Airtouch was advised by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Vodafone was
advised by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-COMPENSATE (Washington) _ The United States and Germany
Friday announced a tentative agreement for the German government to
compensate an estimated 240 Americans who were imprisoned in Nazi
concentration camps. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   PERSIAN-GULF-OIL (Kuwait City) _ For a quarter century, oil has
allowed the gulf states a self-sufficiency and political leverage
far in excess of what comparably sized countries could hope to
achieve, and has formed a dependable pillar of legitimacy for the
region's six monarchies. But now revenues have plunged by 30
percent in a year, a loss of $25 billion. And there is no rebound
in sight. By Douglas Jehl. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-IRAQ (United Nations) _ Russia, which is opposing any
revival of the present arms inspection system in Iraq, Friday gave
the Security Council a detailed blueprint for a new monitoring
apparatus having much less independence. It was the fourth proposal
this week as nations lay out their positions and try to influence
others. The bargaining could turn into a long debate if the
Security Council is to reach a common position. By Barbara
Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PROTESTS (Beijing) _ Thousands of farmers demonstrating
against local officials clashed with hundreds of police officers in
a small town in southern China last week, the latest and perhaps
largest in a series of farmer and worker protests that have sprung
up around China in the last year. By Elisabeth Rosenthal. With
graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-FEUD (Johannesburg) _ President Nelson Mandela and
former President F.W. de Klerk negotiated this country's peaceful
transition from white supremacist rule to democracy, then ruled for
two years as president and deputy president. In 1993, they shared
the Nobel Peace Prize. But after years of silence about the
relationship, de Klerk has unleashed his anger at Mandela. His
autobiography, which is to be published in London on Tuesday, reels
with it. By Suzanne Daly.

   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STORM-BUFFALO (Buffalo) _ Even in a place that is proud to be
called the snow capital of America, enough is enough. Piles of snow
are so high in most places that houses and storefronts are barely
visible from the street. On Friday, Buffalo contended with its 14th
consecutive day of snow _ with levels approaching 60 inches and the
flakes still falling. ``Even people in Buffalo are getting pretty
sick of this snow,'' said Stacie Simmons, 31. By Ginger Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-WILSON (Los Angeles) _ For eight years in Sacramento, Pete
Wilson had to look no farther than the big portrait of Ronald
Reagan in his office to dream of what the future might hold for a
Republican governor of California. Now, in his second week as a
private citizen, Wilson has begun sharing an office suite here with
the former president himself, but the dream remains uncertain. By
Todd S. Purdham. With photo.

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ASSESS (Washington) _ No matter how much senators say
they want to avoid it, the partisan split over witnesses appears to
be hardening each day that the House managers present their case
against President Clinton, with a near party-line vote in favor of
taking more testimony looking ever more likely. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SENATE (Washington) _ In an opinion poll conducted last
month in 21 congressional districts around the country that tend to
swing between Republicans and Democrats, three-quarters of those
questioned said they agreed with the proposition that ``instead of
spending time on a lengthy impeachment trial, Congress and the
president should focus on issues and legislation important to
average families.'' So it is not surprising that as the trial of
Clinton began in earnest this week, Republican senators bent over
backward to make the point that they were also tending to the
people's business. By David E. Rosenbaum. With photos.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CLINTON (New York) _ Likened to Martin Luther King and
doused with praise for his economic leadership, Clinton was
celebrated on Wall Street on Friday at a conference of mostly
minority businessmen as House prosecutors assailed him for a second
day before the Senate. By James Bennet. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-STRATEGY (Washington) _ The House prosecutors appeared
close to asking the Senate to formally invite Clinton to testify in
his impeachment trial. By Eric Schmitt. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REPUBS (Palm Beach, Fla.) _ Many of the Republican
Party's most influential financial backers have castigated the
party's chairman and congressional leadership at closed-door
meetings here in the past few days, warning that they were
sacrificing voters by failing to articulate a clear message while
focusing on scandal and impeachment. By Richard L. Berke. With
photo.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SCENE (Washington) _ The scene at the trial remained one
of great patience more then fresh sensation until an unexpected
moment late in the day when a senator dared to utter the very first
objection of the proceeding from the floor. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-HARKIN (Washington) _ Sen. Tom Harkin interrupted the
GOP manager, Rep. Barr, and objected to being called a juror.
Rehnquist ruled in Harkin's favor. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   JAMA-SEXSURVEY (Undated) _ The American Medical Association
dismissed the editor of its leading journal, charging that he had
rushed through a paper on whether college students think oral sex
is ``having sex'' in order to influence President Clinton's
impeachment trial. The article, which will appear next week in the
Journal of the American Medical Association, describes an
eight-year-old study, which found that 59 percent of those surveyed
did not believe the act counted as sex. By Gina Kolata. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-RDP (Washington) _ The Supreme Court agreed to judge the
validity of a federal law the Clinton administration says is needed
to protect compulsive gamblers from the lure of casinos and games
of chance. The justices said they would decide whether free-speech
rights are violated by the government's ban on television and radio
ads that promote casinos not owned by Indian tribes. By Linda
Greenhouse.

<P>
   BRAZIL-PRIMER (Undated) _ A Brazil crisis primer, written for

</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-IMF (Washington) _ Brazil got a muted but clear warning
from the International Monetary Fund and the United States Friday
that failure to act quickly on pledges to bolster its financial
condition through spending cuts and tax increases would lead to a
downward economic spiral. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-LATAM (Buenos Aires, Argentina) _ Stock markets
throughout Latin America rebounded strongly Friday on hopes that
Brazil's currency would not tumble out of control. But analysts
warned that several countries in the region faced a period of
extreme economic volatility, with the likelihood of devaluations,
rising interest rates and growing unemployment through the rest of
the year. By Clifford Krauss. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETWATCH.COM (Undated) _ In an indication that investors

   RICH-COLUMN (Undated) _ We didn't need Larry Flynt to tell us
that Bob Barr is a hypocrite. But we may need Larry Flynt anyway _
not to expose any impeachment manager's sex life but simply because
his very presence exposes the disingenuousness of everybody else,
conservative and liberal, Republican and Democrat, press and
public, who inhabits the epic Bosch canvas that is Monicagate. In
the land of the pious hypocrite, the honest pornographer is king.

   COLONIAL-LEGACY (Undated) In the closing years of this century,
historians, political scientists and other students of African
affairs have begun a searching re-examination of the continent's
recent past. Increasingly they have concluded that many of its most
persistent curses _ from the plague of ethnic hatred widely known
as tribalism to endemic official corruption _ have powerful roots
that are at least partly traceable to European subjugation and
rule. By Howard W. French. With map.
</P>
<P>
   ACADEMIC-JOBS (Undated) _ No one questions that Ph.D.s and
graduate students are in rough straits: Even the Modern Language
Association predicts that fewer than half of the 8,000 graduate
students finishing between 1996 and 2000 will land full-time,
tenure-track jobs within a year of getting their Ph.D.s. The fight

Parcells' resume _ perhaps in no professional coaching resume _

COMMENTARY: SOFT-PORN NATION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the time we got to Bob Barr, I had become a
desperate woman. I felt trapped, panicky, short of breath.
</P>
<P>
   I could only imagine how the senators felt about having to sit
silently through these excruciating recitations of the obvious and
the irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is an undeniable appeal to the notion of
enforced silence on the usually prolix senators _ the equivalent of
a national mute button _ the Trial of the Century is proving less
than scintillating.
</P>
<P>
   It suddenly seems essential that we figure out a way never, ever
to have to go through such a ludicrous, stupefying display again.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican House managers were acting like ugly Americans
abroad who think that if they talk loudly and slowly, foreigners
will understand them.
</P>
<P>
   We expected the GOP congressmen to explain themselves. But they
just kept repeating themselves, waving expanding pointer pens,
brandishing charts and helpfully pointing out to 100 of the top
elected officials in our land that the list on the first two pages
of the House impeachment report was called ``The Table of
Contents.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did we learn after these two ``historic'' days?
President Clinton lied. He was alone with Monica Lewinsky and
played with her sexually. He coached Betty Currie and enlisted
Vernon Jordan in a job search for his playmate. He has a
complicated understanding of the word ``is.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Republicans have not pointed out that the earth is
round, but the proceedings are young.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr and the rabid Republicans keep trying to present
the president's behavior as a deep, dark plot. But the more you
hear them tell it, the more it sounds like what it was: a powerful
but weak-willed guy scrambling not to get caught in a deeply
humiliating mess.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a conspiracy. It's a cliche.
</P>
<P>
   They have made the case that Bill Clinton is selfish and
promiscuous. They have not made the case that two elections should
be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The senators have been sworn in as jurors, but the country has
already nullified the jury. Americans think Starr's investigation
was ugly and the House Republicans' impeachment was mean.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have been prattling about how no man should
be above the law, as they try to cloak politics in the sanctity of
a judicial proceeding. McCollum even aimed his pointer at a chart
of federal sentencing guidelines for bribery, witness tampering,
obstruction of justice and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   But any pretense of judiciousness was lost when Republican
senators acting as jurors and Republican House members acting as
prosecutors met privately to plot trial strategy. (Too bad this is
a jury with no alternates.)
</P>
<P>
   Listening to McCollum say ``genitalia'' three times, ``oral
sex'' three times and ``breasts'' four times in the well of the
Senate, seeing the cascading confessions of Republicans about
illegitimate children and affairs, actually made me nostalgic for
what the good old boys keep telling me were the good old days, when
journalists looked the other way as politicians frolicked.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, those journalists were delinquent. But we're no better off
now that we get all the gory details, and no real perspective. Our
sexual auto-da-fe, in which every revelation about a politician's
private life becomes ammunition in the sulfurous partisan wars, is
enough to make the benign neglect of yesteryear look like a
democratic kind of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a soft-porn nation, where New York hotels feature an
adult movie spoof of the Clinton White House called ``White House
Interns'' that competes with the somewhat less racy ``White House
Interns'' show on C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   The surfeit of sex comes with a surfeit of sanctimonious
pseudo-oratory, as when McCollum rhapsodized about ``a beautiful
panorama'' he saw on his drive to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before I got to the 14th Street Bridge,'' he told the
senators at the trial, ``I saw this incredible number of geese, I
guess in the hundreds, that were lined up ... They looked like they
were an invading army. And I thought of the awe of this, the beauty
of it, the awe of Mother Nature, the awe of God. And I thought also
of the awe of the responsibility to our children and our
grandchildren about what we are commencing today. This is an
awesome undertaking for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had better beware: What's good for the goose is
good for the gander, and besides, those geese might come home to
roost.

SPORTS COLUMN: WILT OR KAREEM? CHRIS OR MARTINA?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sports fans, a compulsive lot, love their lists. The other day I
found myself standing in front of the rather forlorn-looking NBA
store on Fifth Avenue evaluating a montage of the alleged 50
greatest players in National Basketball Association history and
saying out loud, ``Jerry Lucas???''
</P>
<P>
   But that's all right. Most people in New York talk to
themselves, so nobody noticed.
</P>
<P>
   This is the ultimate year for lists _ the 100 greatest pastry
chefs of the 20th century, the 100 greatest math teachers of the
20th century, the 1,000 greatest people of the millennium. What,
they left off Jerry Garcia? You see what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a sports list that will keep people talking for the
entire year _ the ESPN rating of the 100 greatest North American
athletes of the century. Talk is cheap, lists are facile, but ESPN
did its homework, consulting a panel of experts who have lived a
good bit of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but ESPN has also hidden its Gen-X persona and
put on its journalistic hat (a fedora, in this case), producing a
documentary series called ``SportsCentury,'' including weekly
portraits of the top 50 individuals, as well as longer features.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to love a list that includes at least three
four-legged athletes, Citation at No. 97 and Man o' War at No. 84,
to say nothing of Secretariat, who I can only assume is somewhere
in the top 50. The big red beast had better be pretty high, too,
after the way he aced the 1973 Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at ESPN craftily released the list of Nos. 51 through
100 last week to generate publicity for the first show, on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   In the first segment, Chris Evert (No. 50) tells how she and
Martina Navratilova (who, Evert huffily suggests, is placed
somewhat higher in the ranking) get together near their homes in
Aspen, Colo., for the occasional friendly hit that soon escalates
into points, contested as if the Duchess of Kent were beaming down
at them from the Royal Box.
</P>
<P>
   There will be insights like this throughout the year because a
bright young producer, Mark Shapiro, and his crew sought out the
top athletes as well as the people who coached them and reported on
them. The ESPN people copiously interviewed the fabled columnists
Shirley Povich and Jim Murray, on tape, before their deaths in the
past year, as well as Weeb Ewbank, Florence Griffith-Joyner, Jack
Brickhouse and Don Dunphy before their passing.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but also Rod Laver, the Australian tennis star _
not eligible to be rated in this North American series, but surely
a part of it _ suffered a stroke while being interviewed, and has
since resumed his daily life.
</P>
<P>
   The operative theory from Steve Bornstein, now the ESPN
chairman, and John Walsh, the executive editor, was that the
ranking had to be based on athletic ability rather than historic
significance.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Patrick, who narrates the top 50 segments, admitted,
``You can't overlook it,'' referring to the impact of Jackie
Robinson, the great three-sport athlete from UCLA who broke the
color barrier in major league baseball in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also led the Brooklyn Dodgers to the World Series in 6
of his 10 seasons. He wound up somewhere in the top 50, which is
where he belongs, according to those of us who saw him dance off
third base, unnerving a pitcher, or diving to catch a line drive to
save a season.
</P>
<P>
   Deserving pioneers and activists and just plain characters were
not overlooked by ESPN, if only because they had to be great
athletes to make their impact. Jack Johnson (No. 100) infuriated
white America by daring to knock down white boxers and date white
women. Joe Namath (No. 88) quarterbacked the biggest upset in Super
Bowl history and seemed to personify the liberated 1960s in sports.
Josh Gibson (No. 73) hit home runs longer than Babe Ruth's, but
lived and died in the era of the Negro leagues. Althea Gibson (No.
65) was the first great black American tennis player. Satchel Paige
(No. 63) kept pitching until baseball opened up for him. Billie
Jean King (No. 59) won major tennis titles while advancing women's
sports. And Pete Rose (No. 56) hit and hustled his way onto this
list long before his gambling and tax problems caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   The top 50 will evolve over this year _ starting with Evert,
then moving to a running back named Simpson, oh, just by
coincidence, No. 49, in time for the pre-Super Bowl show. After
that, there will surely be people like Howe, Spitz, Brown,
Navratilova, Lewis, Louis, Gretzky, DiMaggio, Robinson, Koufax,
Didrikson, Thorpe, in undisclosed order, leading up to Ali and
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it Jordan second and Ali first? ESPN is giving no clues,
but that's how I would have it. I know, I know, the ground rules
were that social implications didn't count, but this ESPN series
seems legitimately rooted in history, by adults, for adults. Ali
told us he was the Greatest, and I take him at his word. At the end
of the next century, more people will remember Muhammad Ali than
Michael Jordan. I'm saying Ali should be first. Want to argue?
We've got all year.

SPORTS COLUMN: A HIGH SCHOOL COACH HAS HIS DAY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twelve years. That is how long Bill Piner has waited to watch a
game like Sunday's, and right in his own living room.
</P>
<P>
   How many times, when Vinny Testaverde was throwing pro passes
for Tampa Bay, for Cleveland, for Baltimore, did he have to go
searching for a sports bar or a friend's house with a satellite
dish? How many lost Sundays, meaningless games, wasted seasons? How
many conversations with his former honorable mention high school
all-America player that sounded like pep talks and ended with the
promise that, sooner or later, Testaverde's time would come?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, sooner or later is right now, Sunday at Mile High
Stadium in Denver, the Jets and the Broncos, Testaverde trying to
answer the question asked of every quarterback who is handed a
competitive team: can you take it to the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   This is no attempt to reduce the American Football Conference
championship game to a tale of dueling quarterbacks. History, which
records but seldom recalls which part of the offensive line broke
down, will do that, anyway. Testaverde's team will defeat John
Elway's team, or it won't. Testaverde will come out of this with
the benefit of the doubt for all the frustration that came before,
or he won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three things that must be in place for a quarterback to be
successful are organization, supporting cast and coaching,'' said
Piner, who was Testaverde's coach at Sewanhaka High School in
Floral Park, N.Y. ``Vinny's never had all three of those things in
the past. His talent hasn't changed. But the ghosts are there. He
understands that. The realities of pro football are that you've got
to get to the game. Until you do, you're going to be thrown in with
the rest of the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   And that would be a shame, Piner said, a crying shame, and not
because Testaverde was blessed with a Super Bowl body. ``For the
way he has handled all he's been through, and the kind of person he
is, and has always been,'' Piner said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, now 54 and the athletic director at Cold Spring
Harbor (N.Y.) High School, is plenty partial, and why not? This
game, not only to be watched from home, hits home in a way that few
others could. Testaverde is much more than a former star pupil. He
is Piner's own son's boyhood hero, the big man on the University of
Miami's campus who received a letter one day from the Sewanhaka
High ball boy back on Long Island, asking that Testaverde come home
and be his sponsor on the day he would be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Piner is 25 now, but his father can close his eyes and
conjure up the most pleasing image in less time than Testaverde can
take the snap. He can still see his son walking into St. Barnabas
Church, hand in hand with Jimmy Johnson's starting quarterback. He
can remember a football in Testaverde's hand, and a copy of Sports
Illustrated magazine, with Alonzo Highsmith on the cover, following
a 1-point Miami victory over Nebraska in the 1984 Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``See this football?'' Testaverde asked the boy, who obediently
nodded. ``That's this ball right here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Vinny signed it and handed it to Michael,'' Bill Piner
said. ``He still has it.''
</P>
<P>
   Father and son have been riveted to their television screens, in
the storybook homecoming season of Vinny from Elmont. As the stakes
have risen, Sundays have been savored like a glass of fine wine
from a bottle unopened for 12 long years.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rang in the Piner home late last Sunday afternoon,
the son calling from the road on business, out in western Canada,
but not out of Testaverde range. ``You see that game?'' he asked,
knowing there was no chance his father had not seen every play of
Jacksonville at Jets. They toasted the notion of Testaverde in
Denver, one step away.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Piners, nor anyone else, could have known what good
fortune Testaverde was returning to, though Bill Piner suspected
early on that, for Testaverde, this would no season on the brink,
or the bench. He and his wife, Patty, were chatting with Testaverde
at the Jets' Hofstra training camp last summer, when Piner noticed
Bill Parcells eyeing them from a distance. When Testaverde walked
away, the Tuna strolled over to introduce himself.
</P>
<P>
   They made small talk, and Parcells, one coach to a
coach-turned-administrator, teased Piner about making sure his
team's buses were on time. ``But right as he was walking away, he
looked back and said, `Vinny is doing a heck of a job,''' Piner
said. ``He said, `Don't worry about him; I know what I'm doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Piner went home happy that his guy was in Parcells' hands. He
always hoped Testaverde would follow the path of other failed Tampa
Bay quarterbacks. Doug Williams won a Super Bowl in Washington.
Steve Young in San Francisco. Testaverde still has a mile high
climb just to get to Miami. One last, towering hurdle, but this
time, with the organization, supporting cast and coaching lined up
with Testaverde against the Broncos, and the ghosts of seasons
past.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: A VERY DIFFERENT SHADE OF GREEN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, what a time it was. The Jets' coach called his underdog team
``green and growing,'' and clearly wished he were still coaching
the opposition, which had dumped him. The National Football League
commissioner grudgingly gave the news media permission to use the
nickname ``Super Bowl,'' although that was not the official title.
The third annual AFL-NFL World Championship Game's lightning rod,
the long-haired quarterback, was generally considered controversial
because of his prediction of victory, not to mention his reputation
for drinking and sex, sometimes the night before a game.
</P>
<P>
   In their most recent Super Bowl appearance, 30 years ago in
Miami, the Jets adjusted the course of Jock Pop history and
accelerated the ultimate crossover of sports into entertainment.
You can thank or spank those Jets for such recent phenomena as the
$3 million home run ball, the promotion of a heavyweight fight
between Mike Tyson's ``inner demons'' and an ``outer demon'' named
Botha, and the orgy of hagiography around Michael Jordan's
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a team that went from green and growing to ``gang
green'' and worse need only step over the Broncos to go back to
Miami. But even if these Jets win the Super Bowl (we can officially
call it that now) two weeks from now, it is unlikely that they will
become icons for the next 30 years. There are no connections other
than costume to those Jets. Times changed.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, in the turbulent gut of the Vietnam War, the
NFL, in an official news release, modestly referred to itself as
``vicarious warfare nurtured by the technology that is this land's
hallmark.'' In 1969, the year he quit linebacking for the St. Louis
Cardinals, Dave Meggysey, now an NFL players union official, said,
``Politics and pro football are the most grotesque extremes in the
theatric of a dying empire.'' No wonder everyone wanted to watch
big guys beat up on each other.
</P>
<P>
   The world's best-known athlete then was Muhammad Ali, banned
from competition because he had stood up for his religious
principles. No athlete since has challenged the establishment so
frontally. The commissioner of the National Basketball Association,
Walter Kennedy, flipped a coin and one Lew Alcindor went to
Milwaukee to begin the modern hoops era. In its centennial year,
that agrarian pastime, baseball, was declared passe (Cal Ripken
turned 9 in 1969, Mark McGwire 6).
</P>
<P>
   Saint Vince Lombardi was still alive, and although he had called
Joe Namath ``the perfect quarterback,'' he expressed revulsion at
``some of the things he stands for.'' This probably included
Broadway Joe's price tag, the now amusing figure of $400,000. Sonny
Werblin, the entertainment mogul who was a major Jets owner, used
the fat contract to promote Namath's celebrity and glamour, the
quarterback as rock star, a new concept.
</P>
<P>
   Namath, a working-class role model whose loyalty to team and
family seemed every bit as traditional as those of the Baltimore
Colts' quarterbacks, Johnny Unitas and Earl Morrall, was
nevertheless portrayed as a rebel to hype the image of the upstart
American Football League, which had muscled its way into a merger
with the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   While Michael Jordan's impact on his game, on sports marketing,
television and mass culture, is incomparable, without Namath there
might not have been as well-developed a television-fueled industry
for him to air out. As dull as the games often are, the Super Bowl
still generates the most expensive commercial minutes on TV. It is
a national secular holy day.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, it was only a game and the Jets' coach was a stumpy
guy with a limp (a fan had pulled on his leg as the Jets carried
Weeb Ewbank off the field after winning the American Football
League title). In Miami, when someone said, ``There's the mike,
Weeb,'' and he said, ``Mike who?'' only Weeb guffawed. Can you
imagine the news media not laughing at everything remotely funny
that Bill Parcells might say? Weeb spent most of that week being
nostalgic about his old Colts, and the great Unitas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Namath was lounging around the hotel pool,
chit-chatting amiably with anyone who came up, reporter or
vacationing nonfan. Such access these days is a fantasy. Reporters
are not even allowed to talk with Parcells' assistants, lest they
become well-known enough to steal his Cadillac ads.
</P>
<P>
   Several nights before the game, double scotch in hand, Namath
guaranteed victory, major headlines even in post-Ali time. When he
delivered, he was no longer a celebrity, he was a hero.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Jordan (or even O.J. Simpson, a rookie later in
1969), Namath was never bankable. He was too real. Michael is cool,
discreet, dependable in ways that make the suits comfortable.
Namath cried on television when Commissioner Pete Rozelle demanded
he give up his interest in a bar because some of its customers were
organized crime suspects. You could never be sure that Namath's
version of truth and beauty would not damage the campaign for a
cereal or soft drink. Only panty hose seemed safe enough.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King, Ali and Bill Bradley were the athletes who
brought nonfans into the tent in that era, but each was too
idiosyncratic in style, personality and politics to keep people
there for other athletes and games. But the Super Bowl would come
back every year, often with another sexy and promotable quarterback
like Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana or John Elway. Corporations woke
to the currency of sports and invested so heavily that sports will
never vanish. In a celebrity culture, athletes are gold because
they do something real, in live time. And they are usually
replaceable before they become a corporate problem, as
embarrassment or major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan may become a problem to companies who have overinvested
in him. Despite the sometimes sickening elegies of the last few
days, it is not likely that he will be Air Jordan forever. There
will be new players to quicken our pulses, better-looking male
clothing and scent models, more interesting product endorsers.
Michael's biggest attraction off the court was his incredible
talent on it _ how could such a great player also be so smooth, so
handsome, so smart? There are plenty of nonplayers who are so
smooth, so handsome and so smart.
</P>
<P>
   Namath seemed to have less of a stomach for business than Jordan
does, and while he was a better movie and stage actor he pretty
much limped out of sight. His workouts with booze and babes became
more passe than baseball, even to him.
</P>
<P>
   One could wish more of Namath around these days. Genuinely
genial and funny, he always took his work more seriously than he
took himself. Keyshawn Johnson is the closest to a Jets superstar,
but he seems not to have yet developed an ingratiating cool or an
interesting edge. Maybe, with drink in hand, he will guarantee
victory. And hang out at the pool. Right. Coach Parcells would be
amused by that.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there is no connection other than the old green between
today's team and the winners of Super Bowl III, there are wondrous
omens for New York fans. A few months after the Jets won, the Mets
began a glorious season that ended in their first World Series
victory. And soon after that, the Knicks were on their way to an
NBA championship.

SPORTS COLUMN: THREE POINTS, NOT STYLE POINTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ For Sunday's American Football Conference championship
game, the marquee is crowded: Bill Parcells' opportunity to lead
the Jets to the Super Bowl, John Elway's likely last game in Mile
High Stadium, Vinny Testaverde's new life, Terrell Davis'
galloping, Curtis Martin's workhorse burden, Shannon Sharpe's trash
talk, Keyshawn Johnson's versatility, Mike Shanahan's reputation as
the Broncos' ``genius'' coach.
</P>
<P>
   But if this game comes to a boil in the final minutes, a
field-goal kicker might well make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kicking a game-winning field goal,'' John Hall, the Jets'
kicker, likes to say, ``that's all I ever think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall did just that during the season in Kansas City, booting a
32-yarder in a driving rain as time expired for the Jets' 20-17
victory. His two field goals against the Seahawks made the
difference in that 32-31 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Elam, the Broncos' kicker, hasn't had to make a crucial
field goal since the 27-21 victory over the Patriots in the season
opener, but his 63-yarder at Mile High Stadium on Oct. 25 tied the
long-distance record set by Tom Dempsey in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to calm down,'' Elam said after that kick. ``I know
how to react in certain situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam or Hall, if not both, may need to react. In two of the
previous seven AFC title games, a field goal made the difference:
24-21 for Denver over Pittsburgh a year ago, and 10-7 for Buffalo
over Denver in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And when Parcells' 1990 Giants upset the 49ers in San Francisco
in the National Conference championship game, Matt Bahr kicked five
field goals for the 15-13 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Hall is doing very well now,'' Parcells said. ``He's a
much improved kicker from what he was. My confidence in him is
growing. He's a more well-rounded kicker. He can do a lot of things
with the ball now.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a field-goal kicker, style points don't count. Only 3
points do. Hall has been more efficient since the Jets signed the
37-year-old John Kidd as their punter and Hall's holder.
</P>
<P>
   Back when Brian Hansen, the Jets' previous punter, was his
holder during the first eight games, Hall made only 11 of 17
field-goal opportunities, a shaky 65 percent. But with Kidd holding
throughout the second half of the season, Hall made 14 of 18
(including one blocked kick), 78 percent. That lifted his season
average to 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In last Sunday's 34-24 playoff triumph over Jacksonville, Hall
added two clutch field goals: a 52-yarder for an early 10-0 lead
and a 30-yard clincher in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's got a really strong leg,'' Kidd said. ``He's athletic.
He's played other sports, so he's more of an athlete than just a
kicker who is off in another world.''
</P>
<P>
   At a sturdy 6 feet 3 inches and 223 pounds, Hall is much bigger
than most kickers, one reason his kickoffs are much longer than
those of most kickers. His 24 touchbacks ranked second in the
entire National Football League during the recent season; as a
rookie, his 29 touchbacks led the league.
</P>
<P>
   But as a field-goal kicker, Hall's improvement has coincided
with Kidd's arrival as his holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``John might be the best holder I've ever had,'' Hall said.
``He's the same in practice as in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first day together in practice back in early November,
Hall made 20 of 21 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been on a roll ever since,'' Kidd said. ``He trusts me to
get the ball in the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd has been a holder for the Bills' Scott Norwood (but not
when Norwood missed the 47-yarder against the Giants in Super Bowl
XXV), for the Chargers' John Carney and the Dolphins' Pete
Stoyanovich, among others. But as a rookie with the Bills in 1984,
he held for Joe Danelo, once the Giants' kicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was the most meticulous kicker I've ever worked with; he
could tell if the ball was half an inch off the spot where he
wanted it,'' Kidd said. ``All the kickers want the laces facing the
goal post and leaning a little toward the holder. When it's leaning
toward the holder, it takes the hook off the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall has kicked in this mile-high altitude before, as a
Wisconsin freshman against Colorado in nearby Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was on artificial turf, Mile High has grass,'' he said.
``But your ball travels a lot farther here in the thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam knows. At a chunky 5-11 and 200 pounds, he had an excellent
85 percent average in his sixth season, hitting 23 of 27, with one
blocked. In the 38-3 playoff rout of the Dolphins a week ago, he
was 4 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   Elam's holder is Tom Rouen, the Broncos' sometimes excitable
punter. When Rouen realized that Elam was about to try that
63-yarder, everybody on the field heard Rouen yell: ``Whooo-ee!
We're going for the record!''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday Jason Elam and Tom Rouen, as well as John Hall and
John Kidd, will be going for the Super Bowl.

FREE-AGENT WEEK, FULL SPEED AHEAD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What you will not see when the National Basketball Association's
free-agent madhouse begins: anyone signing a contract for $126
million. What you will see: a number of deals worth $80 million to
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett's big score in 1997 may be an anomaly, but already
the Nets' Jayson Williams, a role-playing forward, has commanded
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   When the lockout is lifted and training camps open on Tuesday,
signings are expected to come spilling out of the NBA's offices
like candy out of a pinata. With more than 200 free agents suddenly
able to sign contracts, a flurry of activity is expected to
significantly alter the league's power structure.
</P>
<P>
   The players' concession on salary limits was supposed to help
the league's fractured economic system. Well, even an aging,
injury-prone center like Rik Smits is expected to sign for more
than $10 million a year with Indiana, while Luc Longley, who helped
the Bulls to three straight NBA titles, may sign with Phoenix for
about $4 million a year, less than half of what Smits may receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a great disparity among players with
similar talents,'' the agent Marc Fleisher said. ``One will sign
for $5 million a year, the other will sign for $12 million. They're
two almost identical players, but it doesn't matter. It's really
which teams have the money and whether they like you. A lot of guys
will be able to push the envelope if they have one other suitor.
But I think you'll see a lot of guys take bad deals under this
agreement, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The dismantling of the Bulls is about to begin in earnest when
Scottie Pippen leaves for either Houston or another playoff
contender. But it is unclear how many premier free agents will
actually change addresses _ especially because their own teams can
pay them more than any other franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess of Phoenix, Damon Stoudamire of Portland, Tom
Gugliotta of Minnesota and Rod Strickland of Washington _ some of
the bigger names available _ may end up staying put. McDyess, for
example, could receive no more than $67.5 million over six years
from a new team under the new labor agreement. But the Suns could
offer him a contract of $86.6 million over seven years because he
is their free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason several franchises may not go after that
special someone this week: a more attractive special someone could
be available this summer. Stephon Marbury, Antoine Walker, Marcus
Camby, Ray Allen and Allen Iverson, who all will be free agents
after this season, represent a younger, more potent future for many
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams might be saving their money when a better class of
free agents becomes available,'' said Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks'
president and general manager. ``You might not see the movement
everyone expects.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bracing for a Chilling Effect &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the players association's decertification of
Steve Woods, an Atlanta-based agent who blasted the union during
its negotiations with the NBA, several other agents were concerned
about their involvement in the labor dispute and how it would
affect their relationship with the union.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who said, among other things, that he would not trust
Patrick Ewing, the union president, to organize a company picnic,
was notified of the decertification on Thursday in a letter. It
said Woods' ``inaccurate statements indicate that you are not
qualified to represent members of this union in individual contract
negotiations with NBA teams.'' The union's action prevents Woods
from negotiating contracts for NBA players. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Woods has since filed an unfair labor practice charge with the
National Labor Relations Board against the union. The charge will
be investigated next week.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has only two clients, Kevin Willis and Willie Burton.
Willis is under contract with Toronto, but Woods has written the
union a letter requesting that he be allowed to negotiate a deal
for Burton.
</P>
<P>
   The union declined comment, but the action taken against Woods
could signal disciplinary action for agents like Harold MacDonald
and Norman Blass, who also openly criticized the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all he did was express his opinion, I'm concerned about
taking this type of a measure without due process,'' said Marc
Fleisher, who represents Vlade Divac, among other players.
</P>
<P>
   The agent Leonard Armato, even though he did not publicly
criticize the union, was seen as a nettlesome presence during the
labor negotiations, and not many agents engendered as much ill will
among their peers. But the union probably will not scold Armato,
because of the stature of his only client, Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as a liaison for Billy Hunter, the union's executive
director, and NBA Commissioner David Stern, Armato arranged a
secret meeting between the two at his Los Angeles office on Dec.
23.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming his friendship with Stern made him privy to how the
commissioner thought, Armato tried to soften the union's hard-line
stance toward the league during a conference call with other
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Arn Tellem, the agent for Kobe Bryant and several other stars,
took to calling Armato ``Tessio,'' after the character in ``The
Godfather'' who betrays the Corleone family.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the agreement was signed, Armato, frustrated with
the lack of progress, was poised to lead a group of agents in a
minirevolt against the union.
</P>
<P>
   But he disagrees with the notion that he was going behind
Hunter's back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a facilitator of communication at first and then I
became sort of a mediator at the end,'' Armato said. ``I pulled the
parties together. I would not have been willing to let the league
blow up. If I could be helpful in any way in fashioning a
compromise, I've done my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all his peers agreed, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, let's see, Shaq's his only client and he gets about 4
percent of Shaq's $15 million, which is zero if you don't have a
season,'' the agent Keith Glass said. ``Sure, Leonard was concerned
about the integrity of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final week of negotiations, Armato faxed to Hunter a
draft of a proposal that he thought might keep Stern talking. It
included a limit on maximum salaries with three exceptions: a
player could be paid any amount if he was an All-Star for the last
seven seasons, had made the all-NBA first team in two of the last
three seasons, or qualified for the Jordan exception, meaning he
had either won a championship or been named most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were 7 foot tall, went to LSU, wore a purple-and-gold
No. 34 for the Lakers, those exceptions were for you,'' a union
lawyer said on condition of anonymity. ``Leonard was trying to find
out 50 different ways to grandfather his client.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   Roomie There for Jordan
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson was not there. Neither was Scottie Pippen or Ron
Harper. But Buzz Peterson did show up for Michael Jordan's
retirement announcement on Wednesday, and Jordan's former North
Carolina roommate promptly dusted off the stories.
</P>
<P>
   Now the coach at Appalachian State, Peterson roomed with Jordan
their freshman and junior years. He said he could be blamed for
Jordan's obsession with golf.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels had been eliminated from the 1984 NCAA tournament
by Indiana and had time to kill in their hotel rooms when Davis
Love 3d asked Peterson to go out to the driving range. Peterson
asked a depressed Jordan to tag along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of bummed how the season ended, because we were
28-3 and had been No. 1 the whole year,'' Peterson said. ``We went
out and hit golf balls. The next day, we played nine holes. The day
after, nine holes. Then after that, it was all over with. We were
golf fanatics. He got hooked. I got hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, back then, I could beat him a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson showed up in Chicago last week unannounced. When Jordan
saw him on Wednesday, he immediately gave him a hug and said, ``I
can't believe you're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said, ``You knew I'd be here for you.''

EARPLUGS READY? COTTON IN HAND? FALCONS IN THE METRODOME  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Minutes before the Minnesota Vikings began to
demolish Arizona in their divisional playoff game last Sunday,
Cardinals guard Lomas Brown was talking to a teammate just half a
foot away. Soon enough, Brown realized something: he was screaming
at the top of his lungs and his friend could barely hear him.
</P>
<P>
   And this was before the game started.
</P>
<P>
   That is what you call dome-field advantage. So is this:
Arizona's Jake Plummer, like all quarterbacks, has a headset in his
helmet with which he can listen to plays called in from the
sideline. With almost 70,000 Vikings fans screaming at the top of
their lungs, he could not hear the plays. The noise was a big
reason the Cardinals had three turnovers that led to 17 Viking
points.
</P>
<P>
   There is not only dome-field advantage, but also Metrodome
advantage. The former can be annoying, while the latter can be
destroying. The Metrodome advantage is a big reason the Vikings
went 8-0 at home in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the noisiest stadium in the NFL,'' said the Vikings'
owner, Red McCombs.
</P>
<P>
   When the Vikings play the Atlanta Falcons here in the National
Football Conference title game on Sunday, with the winner going to
Super Bowl XXXIII against the Jets or the Denver Broncos, Minnesota
will have one more weapon besides Randall Cunningham, Randy Moss
and Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Don't underestimate how significant an advantage it is for
Minnesota to have such a loud stadium. The Vikings have built their
team around a fast artificial turf and raucous fans. They like to
jump ahead by using their explosive offense; then, with the other
team trailing, their defense and their fans take over. The two feed
off each other.
</P>
<P>
   When the fans are at their loudest, it is hard to hear the
person next to you talking. The sonic vibrations sometimes cause
the dust to stir atop the press box roof. To add to the din, the
Vikings pump heavy metal music and canned noise through a speaker
system behind the visiting bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers complained to the National Football League office
about the speaker system during the regular season, as did the
Falcons this week in an attempted pre-emptive strike. Minnesota
insists it stays within the rules, shutting off the artificial
noise when the opposing team breaks the huddle. But with or without
the canned noise, the Metrodome is extremely loud.
</P>
<P>
   The noise has caused numerous false starts by offensive linemen
because they cannot hear the quarterback barking the signals. Many
teams try a silent snap count, but the noise causes even the
calmest of players to get nervous and throws off the rhythm of the
silent count.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd gave Arizona a lot of problems early in the game''
Atlanta Coach Dan Reeves said. ``These are the type of things we've
got to be ready to deal with. You can't change them. They're going
to be there. We've got to deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the Falcons this week, Reeves, who is 3-1 in
conference title games, has done what he did as coach of the Giants
before they played in a loud stadium: practice to the accompaniment
of taped crowd noise. It helps, but it is not the same _ sort of
like turning up a loud rap piece on the stereo as opposed to
hearing the group in concert.
</P>
<P>
   The only sure way to quiet the Minnesota fans is to stay ahead
of, or close to, the Vikings. Move the ball downfield, and the
Metrodome becomes deathly quiet. ``If we can get first downs and
eat up yards and have long drives, then we can shut down the crowd
a little bit,'' Atlanta running back Jamal Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons may not be quite as susceptible to crowd noise as
other teams because they play in a dome themselves. ``That's some
advantage,'' Reeves admitted, ``but when we are at home, and on
offense, our crowd is quiet. That won't be the case against
Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Vikings, home-field advantage used to mean bitter cold
and blowing snow. Now, it is heavy metal music and high-decibel
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares if it's fair or not?'' Vikings fullback Leroy Hoard
said. ``We earned it. Everybody has the same opportunity that we
had to get home-field advantage. We got it. It's got to be good for
something, that noise.''

THE PERFECT COMPLIMENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. _ Their kangaroo court remains in session,
though they lost two of their founding justices. They still sit in
their own corner of the Denver Broncos' locker room, though they
have relaxed their rules against talking to teammates and the news
media. But the Broncos' offensive line is still undersized, still
downright ornery and still very good.
</P>
<P>
   How good? Behind the linemen, Terrell Davis ran for 2,008 yards
to post the third-highest single-season rushing total _ after Eric
Dickerson and Barry Sanders _ in National Football League history.
Behind them, John Elway directed the Broncos to 380.8 yards of
total offense _ the third-most productive attack in the league
</P>
<P>
   How ornery? Left tackle Tony Jones has not answered the phone
all week. His best friend is the Jets defensive end Anthony
Pleasant. He played six years with him with the Browns, one with
the Ravens, and works out with him nearly every day in the off
season in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   They will line up against each other in Sunday's American
Football Conference championship game. One of them is going to have
more to talk about than the other for the next eight months. Jones
believes it will be him, and so does his wife, Kamilla. Early this
week, Renita Pleasant called Kamilla and let slip that the
Pleasants were making Super Bowl travel reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she said something back to her,'' Jones said, smiling.
``I don't want talk to him until after the game, and then we'll hug
and make up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the season, and despite last year's title, there was
talk about whether the line might hinder the Broncos' chances of
repeating. The unit lost tackle Gary Zimmerman to retirement and
the free-agent guard Brian Habib to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The two veterans were credited for developing the line's
``us-against-the-world'' mentality by creating the court that fined
fellow linemen for offenses ranging from mental mistakes in
practice ($5), talking to the news media ($10), and up to $3,000
for a ``prima donna'' transgression. At the beginning of the
season, the Broncos still had Jones, guard Mark Schlereth and the
Pro Bowl center Tom Nalen, but had to replace more than 22 years of
NFL experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people were right to say you don't replace guys like
that, but they didn't realize we have a system and standard of hard
work around here and those guys who stepped in understand that,''
said Jones, who was voted to the Pro Bowl this season for the first
time in his 11-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, guard Dan Neil and tackle Harry Swayne played 10
games for Denver last season, mostly on special teams. Their
addition did not make the Broncos any bigger _ they average 287.6
pounds, the lowest of any playoff team _ and barely got younger.
Only the second-year men Neil and Nalen are under 30. In fact,
Swayne began his 12-year career as a defensive end for Tampa Bay
before being converted to the offensive line in 1990 at San Diego,
where he started in Super Bowl XXIX for the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't missed a beat; they are tough guys,'' Elway said
of Neil and Swayne. ``It's a group of guys who fight and claw and
never give up. They play together and take a lot of pride in what
they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Their quickness is what is most apparent on the field _
Schlereth and Neil always manage to get wide on those 8-yard deep
pitches to Davis. The linemen cleared the way for the Broncos to
gain 250 yards on the ground last week against Miami and allowed
Elway to be sacked only once.
</P>
<P>
   But it is their toughness that has made admirers out of their
teammates. Schlereth, for example, had arthroscopic surgery on his
left knee _ for the 12th time and the 21st surgery of his career _
and did not miss a start all season. Jones has played through a
groin strain and a sprained left ankle. He also sprained his knee
against Miami, but will play against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Nalen, who was chosen for his second consecutive Pro Bowl, said
it was easy to limp onto the field when you have a back like
Terrell Davis driving for 2,000 yards. He said he knows it kept
Jones and Schlereth going this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really cool to know that we were part of the reason that
he became one of four guys to get that many yards,'' Nalen said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Neil and Swayne filled Habib's and Zimmerman's positions
on the field, Schlereth has filled in for them off the field. He is
now the kangaroo court's chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our leader,'' Jones said. ``When you look at all he's
been through and how hard he plays, you got to follow his
example.''
</P>
<P>
   In the corner, Schlereth wraps tape around both his knees and
fires a dirty look in Jones' direction. The 10-year veteran remains
the most reluctant member of the line to answer questions about the
unit. He has overhead Jones and threatened a fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the difference between last year is?'' Schlereth
asks, looking at Jones. ``We don't like each other this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it. &QL;

FOR THE JETS, A LANDMARK SEASON GETS TOUGHER AT MILE HIGH STADIUM  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Jets seem to get it, finally. They face the Broncos
on Sunday in the franchise's first trip to a championship game in
16 years. In between, they became a symbol for finding ways to lose
and excuses for losing.
</P>
<P>
   This season, though, the dangers of the road, the pressure of
big games, the weight of their own failed history all but
disappeared down the stretch. The Jets are, for the first time in
30 years, a division champion. They are winners of 13 games,
including a playoff victory last week, and they are having fun.
</P>
<P>
   But now they play a team that is attempting to defend its Super
Bowl title and that scored 501 points in the regular season. And
they face a quarterback, in John Elway, who may be playing his
final home game before heading to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The American Football Conference title game is something that 38
Broncos appeared in a year ago. The last time the Jets got this
far, it was the 1982 season, when their future seemed bright and
they were going to unleash the league's best rushing attack against
the Dolphins in Miami. But the rain, the mud _ the very forces of
nature, it seemed _ conspired against the Jets to produce a shutout
loss that day.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken all this time for them to get back.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jets are back by any measure. They stand among the
highest-scoring teams in the National Football League, with
quarterback Vinny Testaverde and running back Curtis Martin teaming
up as one of the NFL's more dangerous passing-running duos, and
interesting offensive alignments that can include Keyshawn Johnson
going in motion or blocking for the run, or tight end Kyle Brady
playing fullback.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jets' defense constantly shifts, or blitzes, or gets
into combinations of zone and man-to-man coverage to fool offenses.
Opposing quarterbacks completed barely 52 percent of their passes
and averaged slightly more than 6 yards an attempt. In a
bottom-line business, the Jets allowed fewer points than any team
in the NFL except the Dolphins, who allowed only 1 fewer point.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 60 minutes away from a trip to Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami,
all the Jets have to do is put it all together against the
powerful, confident, we-know-how-to-win Broncos. For all the
cleverness of the Jets' offense and the cerebration of their
defense, they have to concern themselves with simply being
outmanned.
</P>
<P>
   It will start with this: the Jets have to stay even early,
perhaps by coming out with newfangled attacking schemes. When teams
don't, the Broncos are merciless: in the regular season, Denver
outscored opponents by 47-9 on its opening drives, by 144-54 in the
first quarter and by 300-141 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, no other team has had a 90-point differential in
the opening quarter. No wonder Denver is favored in Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   But here is something that has been lost in all the wonderment
over the Broncos' quick starts: the Jets, including their playoff
victory over Jacksonville, have a 44-7 advantage after their
opening drives.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, it has been the Broncos' opponents who have
abandoned their game plans against Denver and its sustained attack.
They start to throw the ball. When Dan Marino tried to do that last
Saturday in the divisional playoff here, his Dolphins teammates
could not hear him barking out signals. More than 75,000 fans at
Mile High Stadium _ which has been sold out for Broncos games since
the 1970s _ tried to help their team with so much noise that
audibles were impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins beat the Broncos just last month. But that was in
Miami, and the Dolphins did not commit a penalty. They committed 10
last Saturday, including six false starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems so elementary to say you'll run the ball,'' said a
scout who, in the tradition of his brotherhood, requested
anonymity. ``But this team gets up on opponents so fast, and
continues to score. A lot of teams abandon the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   If both clubs keep to their game plans, these are likely to be
the keys to their success:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BRONCO OFFENSIVE LINE &LR;  _ Denver's line, which must protect
Elway and block for Davis, is efficient, and is helped by receivers
who are not afraid to block, too. With a mobile quarterback such as
Elway, and an all-round running back such as Davis, who rushed for
2,008 yards this season, the line has learned that it can be
successful merely by nudging the defense. Just getting defenders
turned slightly is all that either Elway or Davis needs. And Elway
can still run for a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe,'' Denver Coach Mike Shanahan said, ``in attacking
a defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis says the Jets' defense reminds him of the Broncos': ``Not
a lot of big names, but blue-collar workers. They may not have big
names, but they play like they have big names.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense has not permitted a runner to gain 100 yards
in 11 straight games. Davis got 199 last weekend against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE JET OFFENSIVE LINE &LR;  _ The line has improved to the point
where it is allowing the Jets to churn out the third-and-short
yardage they had failed to gain much of the season. It will have to
be alert against a mobile defense that enjoys taking chances when
it feels it has the opposition in a hole. There will be all sorts
of unusual ``games'' played by the Broncos linebackers John Mobley
and Bill Romanowski, who may line up in different spots and run
stunts to disguise from where they are rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team will do that when it has the lead,'' Jets Coach Bill
Parcells said. But his style has been to insist that the Jets play
solid offense and continue to run the ball, even when behind. The
Jets have been fortunate this year: they have rarely trailed and
are 11-0 when scoring first.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE EXPERIENCE FACTOR &LR;  _ Jet fans should be concerned by the
team's breakdowns last Sunday against the Jaguars. Jerome Henderson
failed to come over in time to help Otis Smith on Jimmy Smith's
52-yard touchdown catch as the half ended. Curtis Martin lost a
fumble; it was only his second of the season in more than 400
carries, but it came at a potentially critical point in the game.
Wayne Chrebet fumbled in the fourth quarter. And Testaverde threw
an interception in the end zone (a bad play call, Parcells said).
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the Jets, whose errors could be considered physical
miscues, the Jaguars made some truly bad plays.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, on the other hand, was unstoppable in clobbering Miami.
On the surface, it appeared that the Broncos rebounded from a
troubling end of the regular season while the Jets, who went into
the playoffs with a six-game winning streak and playing virtually
error free, reverted to some of their poorer performances earlier
in the season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE QUARTERBACKS &LR;  _ Elway is the greatest at fourth-quarter
comebacks in NFL history. His coach believes this will be Elway's
final game at Mile High Stadium, and who can put a figure on what
that might mean?
</P>
<P>
   He may not have faced a defense as unsettling as the Jets' this
season, though anything they do to him will matter only if they
have already contained Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, meanwhile, has not had a bad game in his 13-1
stretch as a starter. He hints that he knew from the beginning,
when he was named Glenn Foley's backup, that he would be able to
help bring the Jets to this point. He is not surprised, though,
that few others thought that way.

COMMENTARY: GIULIANI'S STADIUM FEVER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Something must have happened while we weren't
looking. Apparently it is no longer essential that New York City
build a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan for the Yankees. Now,
if Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is to be believed, we need to build one
for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Has George Steinbrenner suddenly fallen in love with the Bronx?
Is he refusing to leave? Has the mayor suddenly realized what
nearly everyone else knew from the very beginning _ that the plan
to move the Yankees to the West Side was insane? Or does the mayor
just like to run with the most recent winner? The Yankees are off
the front pages now and the Jets have the hot hand. So they get the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   However it shakes out, this is policymaking that is, to be kind,
odd.
</P>
<P>
   Back in April 1996 the mayor was saying, ``Purely from a
financial analysis point of view, the place where the city could
build a new stadium [for the Yankees) at virtually no cost to the
taxpayer or very little cost to the taxpayer would be in
Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   That caused chuckles up in Albany. The state owns the West Side
property on which the mayor has staked his stadium dream. The idea
that Giuliani could get the stadium built and a team moved in
without consuming enormous amounts of taxes was ridiculous. Said
one state official: ``Somebody has got to tell him to stop saying
that because, you know, it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the mayor acknowledged he would have to use tax
revenues. But he never backed off his insistence that a new stadium
for the Yankees on the West Side _ a stadium that would cost more
than $1 billion _ would be a wonderful thing, a boon for the Yanks
and the city.
</P>
<P>
   That is, he never backed off until Thursday, when he suddenly
announced that he now favors a stadium for the Jets, not the Yanks
_ a domed stadium that would be part of an elaborate complex that
would include a new Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say how much this would cost or how it would be
financed. Experts are suggesting the total project, including rail
improvements, could cost as much as _ hold onto your helmets _ $3
billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would become the most famous sports facility in the
world,'' said Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Not the best. Not the most cost-efficient. Not the most
appropriate for the city's needs. The most famous.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is in close touch with prevailing values.
</P>
<P>
   Last week The Times ran a series of articles on the pathetic
state of high school sports in New York. The essence of the series
was captured in a passage in the first article that quoted Rob
Schimenz, a baseball coach at Queens Vocational High School. It
read as follows:
</P>
<P>
   `` `This is the hand you're dealt, you try and keep a positive
attitude, you try to work with it and the kids,' Schimenz said of
his school's sports program, which has no gymnasium, no athletic
fields of its own, no money at all for uniforms, and not much more
for equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   The article went on to say, ``Today, despite modest spending
increases in the last few years, the city's public high school
system offers only a handful of teams for freshmen, provides
schools with no money for uniforms, asks varsity football and other
coaches to run their programs on budgets of $100, and does not give
any school _ from elementary through high school _ a dime for gym
equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Funding for school sports was drastically curtailed in the
1970s, long before Rudolph Giuliani became mayor. But even as the
schools continue to suffer (not just in sports, but in virtually
every way), Giuliani comes up with ever more elaborate ways to
shower billions of the city's dollars on sports franchises that are
thriving and that are owned by fabulously wealthy men.
</P>
<P>
   It is beginning to look as if Giuliani wants the stadium on the
West Side not to keep the Yankees in New York, or to lure the Jets
back to New York, but simply as a monument to himself. Perhaps it
doesn't matter to him who inhabits the stadium. The important thing
is that the stadium exist, a giant reminder on the West Side of
Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Rockefeller gave us the World Trade Center. David
Dinkins, more modestly, was largely responsible for the expanded
National Tennis Center and the 23,000-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium in
Flushing Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   There is no monument yet to Rudolph Giuliani. But he's trying.

<P>
   _ ``The Girl From Ipanema''
</P>
<P>
   Like the sensual strains of that old bossa nova tune, Brazil
enchants. And it has been attracting treasure hunters of all
stripes for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   From the Portuguese who colonized Brazil between 1500 and 1822
to the Wall Street money managers who made the country a darling of
emerging-market investors during the last several years, Brazil's
economic promise is a perennial lure. But, as Brazilians like to
joke, theirs is the country of the future _ and always will be.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's most recent bid for economic stardom ended in
disappointment last week. Wednesday, the country devalued its
currency, the real, and announced the resignation of its central
bank president, as it continues to struggle with excessive debt,
sky-high interest rates and fiscal austerity measures mandated by
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Brazil became the latest victim of the global
financial contagion that broke out in Southeast Asia about 18
months ago and spread to Russia last summer. As was the case when
those economies went into a tailspin, Brazil's travails touched off
international concern about whether its problems will spread to
Argentina and Mexico and ultimately damage the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, Brazil's stock market, showing the
effervescence of a bottle of champagne, had bubbled back up again.
Even so, this huge, resource-rich country, which shares a border
with every South American country except Chile and Ecuador, never
quite seems to realize the gilded dreams imposed upon it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quest for El Dorado has been a feature of Brazilian life
ever since it was controlled as a colony by Portugal,'' said Larry
Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a research
group in Washington. ``Every generation there are miraculous
expectations for the Brazilian economy. Brazil's financial barons
have shared these dreams, but they haven't been based on economic
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil is home to the world's eighth-largest economy,
it is hobbled by widespread poverty and unequal distribution of
wealth. And Brazilians, long accustomed to government corruption,
typically expect little from the grand economic schemes launched
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s, when the Nixon administration trumpeted
Brazil as the next great superpower, huge state projects sponsored
by the World Bank and others were seen as one way for Brazil to tap
its hidden riches. For example, the Trans-Amazonian Highway,
stretching from coast to jungle, was built to exploit the wealth of
the interior. But it was rammed through without regard for its
impact on the rain forest or the indigenous population. And those
Brazilians who migrated to the interior on the highway found
largely useless tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such huge miscues, Brazil enjoyed relatively robust
economic growth from about 1965 to 1980, when oil price shocks and
the Latin America debt crisis helped bring an end to Brazil's
flirtation with superpower status. Foreign investment shriveled and
the Brazilian government continued to run up huge debts as
inflation spiraled out of control, soaring as high as 2,400 percent
in 1993, according to Jeffrey Schott, a specialist in international
trade at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With inflation strangling the economy, the newest method for
realizing Brazil's economic promise was unveiled in 1994, when the
government effectively pegged the real to the dollar. The idea was
to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on the money supply.
Tight money, government cutbacks and open markets, of course,
constitute the miracle cure being peddled all over the world by
American politicians and financiers. But while inflation has been
brought under control in Brazil, some economists see another ill
that has been overlooked time and again _ wealth inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Despite decades of economic experimentation, much of Brazil
remains desperately poor. The wealthiest 10 percent of Brazilians
receive about 48 percent of the country's income, according to the
World Bank, while the poorest 10 percent receive less than 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And Brazil has tied its weak domestic economy to exports and
fickle overseas investors _ a dangerous dependence in a world in
which financial crises are quick to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil has changed a great deal superficially, but for the
poor, who represent the bulk of the population, life has changed
very little,'' said Gillette Hall, an economist at the University
of Oregon in Eugene. ``Economic liberalization for Brazil, as for
many other developing countries, has meant an increasing dependence
on world export markets and international capital flows. That in
turn has left it prey to the vagaries of the global economy, which
are now coming home to roost.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil found itself in a corner last fall after the Russian
economy collapsed. Investors fled Brazil and speculators took aim
at the real. Brazil raised interest rates to defend its currency,
choking domestic growth and causing its foreign exchange reserves
to dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil hopes that letting the real fall against the dollar will
boost exports and bring interest rates down. The flip side of this
strategy is that Brazilian borrowers owing dollar-denominated loans
will find it more expensive to pay off debts, raising the specter
of messy defaults.
</P>
<P>
   So, for now, Brazil's vaunted economic promise is as it has
always been. Elusive.

IMPEACHMENT SQUEEZE FOR SEVERAL GOP SENATORS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a strange sight. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
was offering a compromise plan that would have abbreviated
President Clinton's impeachment trial and avoided witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was only trying to please the many moderates in his state
who support Clinton and want the trial over with. But his proposed
compromise was shot down by his fellow Republicans in the Senate,
and it infuriated conservatives in his state, who have vowed to
field a candidate against him.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton is part of a small but conspicuous class of 13 Republican
senators whose political futures may hang in the balance along with
Clinton's. They have the distinction of being up for re-election in
2000 and representing states that voted for Clinton in 1996. And
these are states where voters now strongly oppose Clinton's
impeachment. (There are six other Republicans facing re-election,
but they are from states that did not support Clinton in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   This potential vulnerability makes these senators the prime
audience for White House lawyers, who are to begin Clinton's
defense on Tuesday. Assuming all 45 Democrats hold together in
support of the president, the White House needs to win over only 6
Republicans to end the trial. The pressure will be especially
intense on Senate Republicans from the Northeast and the West
Coast, where support for the President is the strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Their future viability is not far from their daily calculations
as they navigate the thickets of impeachment, each according to his
or her own political needs back home. Uniting them is the hard
reality that approval ratings for Clinton have soared during the
impeachment process while those of the Republican Party have
plunged.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a concern, increasingly raised by Republican
strategists, that a drawn-out impeachment trial could drag them
down in 2000 just as it dragged down House Republicans last
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment debate has become the Republicans' Vietnam,''
said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta. ``It's a
war fought for all the right reasons. But we've lost the support of
the American people _ we never had it _ and in a democracy, you
can't continue to prosecute a war without the support of the
people. What we need is peace with honor.''
</P>
<P>
   This view is not universal. Some Republicans believe that 2000
is so far away that impeachment will have little effect on the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will have zero impact, either positive or negative, on
the election of U.S. senators in a presidential year 22 months from
now,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who heads the committee
that oversees the election of Republicans to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, McConnell pointed to the early support by some
moderates for calling witnesses, a stance that had mostly been
advocated by conservatives but now seems the prevailing sentiment
among Republicans. ``That's a clear indication that the Republican
conference, from the left to the right, is viewing this as a
constitutional duty and a serious responsibility,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Still, even before the Senate has taken a single significant
vote _ that is to start the week of Jan. 25 _ impeachment is
complicating the landscape for several Republicans up for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, who has been elected and unelected from a state that
swings back and forth between Republicans and Democrats, has
prompted the conservative American Heritage Party to threaten to
run a challenger against him. The conservatives were upset that he
proposed a compromise that would have short-circuited the process
and, in their view, not have punished Clinton sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heritage Party drew enough support last year to
cause Rep. Rick White, a Republican, to lose his seat, and it poses
the same threat to Senator Gorton. ``The Heritage Party will
remember the proposed compromise, regardless of how he votes,''
said David Olson, a political science professor at the University
of Washington. ``They have put a sword into the ground on this one.
I don't know what he could do to erase that threat from the
right.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island, a Democratic stronghold that gave Clinton 60
percent of the vote in 1996, Sen. John Chafee, a Republican, has
almost the opposite problem. He faces little threat from the right
but could draw a serious Democratic challenge from the secretary of
state, James Langevin.
</P>
<P>
   While Chafee is a reliably moderate voice in the Senate, he
surprised many with his early call for witnesses. Darryl West,
chairman of the political science department at Brown University,
suggested that Chafee was simply shoring up his standing with
Republicans in Washington, who already view the senator with
suspicion. But West said Chafee would face more pressure when the
time came to vote on whether to end the trial and then whether to
convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chafee's problem is not the Republican right wing in the
election as much as it is a strong Democratic challenger,'' West
said. ``But he worries about the right wing in terms of his
position in Washington. The witness issue is a procedural issue he
needs to finesse so that he doesn't offend the right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other moderate Republicans face similar quandaries. Sen. James
Jeffords of Vermont, another pro-Clinton state, is more likely to
draw a challenge from the Democrats _ chiefly from Gov. Howard Dean
_ than from his own party. Jeffords' support for witnesses, like
Chafee's, is a setback for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who represents a state where voters
have been receptive to independents and even elected one as
governor, could also draw a challenge in 2000. While she says she
remains undecided on witnesses, her Republican colleague, Sen.
Susan Collins, who is not up for re-election until 2002, surprised
many by calling early for witnesses, even though she too is
perceived as a moderate.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, another state that Clinton carried, Sen. John
Ashcroft, a Republican, is already in a race with the Democratic
governor, Mel Carnahan. Ashcroft was an early proponent of
Clinton's resignation but has softened his stance lately.
Regardless of how Ashcroft votes on Clinton's fate, the Carnahan
campaign is ready to pounce. If Ashcroft votes to convict Clinton,
they will say he is out of touch. If he votes to support Clinton,
they will say he has flip-flopped from his earlier calls for
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rod Grams of Minnesota, like Ashcroft, is more conservative
than his constituents, and there is no shortage of Democrats and
independents in Minnesota who want to run against him. They include
Ted Mondale, a former state senator who is the son of former Vice
President Walter Mondale, and former Rep. Timothy Penny.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., is in the same category and could
draw a Democratic challenge from former Rep. Marjorie
Margolies-Mezvinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the 13 Republicans who are from states that
supported Clinton in 1996 are Sens. Spencer Abraham of Michigan,
Mike DeWine of Ohio, Bill Frist of Tennessee, Jon Kyl of Arizona,
Connie Mack of Florida and William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Most have avoided the spotlight on impeachment. Mack, for
example, while enormously popular in Florida, has stayed in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kane, a Fort Lauderdale pollster who publishes an
independent monthly political journal called Florida Voter, said,
``I think that tells me this is not a winning issue for a candidate
that's up in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick for all Republicans will be to hold those
conservatives who supported impeachment in the House and at the
same time bring back the independent voters who have been turned
off by it.
</P>
<P>
   Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster, told the Senate Republicans
in a briefing last week that the party was now defined by
impeachment and that it needed to move on to other issues, like tax
cuts and Social Security. One of her polls showed that voters
ranked the Republicans' handling of impeachment as their chief
reservation about whether Republicans should keep control of
Congress. However, she said, short-circuiting the process now would
be worse than playing it out. Republicans need to show they are
being fair and thorough.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, analysts said, Republicans cannot afford to
alienate their conservative base.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a tough re-election fight, you have to go in with
your base secure,'' said Bill Pascoe, political director of the
American Conservative Union. ``It makes more sense for Rod Grams,
say, to vote to convict, even though the majority of his state may
be saying in polls that they oppose conviction. If he abandons his
base, it's not like the left-wing Democratic-Farm-Labor guys are
going to embrace him.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick for all Republicans will be to hold those
conservatives who supported impeachment in the House and at the
same time bring back the independent voters who have been turned
off by it.

FOLLOWING EARLY FAILURES, BRONCOS NOW RIDE A LONG TRAIL OF
SUCCESSES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Denver Broncos are the defending Super Bowl
champions and one of the National Football League's most successful
franchises over the past two decades. But the Broncos who will face
the New York Jets on Sunday in the American Football Conference
championship game first had to undergo a stunning makeover to
evolve from crude league doormat to sophisticated champions.
</P>
<P>
   Their quarterback, John Elway, is a star. Their coach, Mike
Shanahan, is one of the brightest in the game. The Broncos dress in
striking blue, orange and white uniforms. Their logo is of a
fierce-looking horse with an orange mane.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Denver and the Broncos will begin building a
76,000-seat open-air stadium scheduled to be in use for the 2001
NFL season. With that new stadium and new lease, the Broncos are
assured of remaining in Denver for another 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   They have traveled a long way since becoming a charter member of
the American Football League in 1960 and then joining the National
Football League when the leagues merged in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In their earliest days, the Broncos dressed in vertically
striped socks and wore dull mustard-colored shirts, brown pants and
brown helmets with numbers on the sides. The team's management was
so cheap that during games employees would race into the stands to
retrieve balls that had been kicked there, literally swiping them
back from fans.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing worse than the uniforms was their record. For
their first 13 years, the Broncos produced one horrible team after
another.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' first winning season didn't arrive until 1973, when
they compiled a 7-5-2 record. They didn't make it to the playoffs
until their 18th season, in 1977, when they went straight to the
Super Bowl under Coach Red Miller. They lost that game to the
Dallas Cowboys, 27-10, but the Broncos were just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves, who is coaching the Atlanta Falcons in Sunday's
National Football Conference championship game with the Minnesota
Vikings, arrived in Denver as head coach in 1981, and the Broncos
began to blossom. Elway arrived in 1983. Pat Bowlen purchased the
team in 1984. Along the way, the Broncos returned to the Super Bowl
after the 1986, 1987 and 1989 seasons, only to lose each time.
Their final breakthrough came last January, when they defeated the
heavily favored Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII and brought
the NFL championship home to their long-faithful fans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Broncos' early failures, their home at Mile High
Stadium has been sold out for every game since 1970, with the
exception of two games played with replacement players during the
NFL strike in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is really very little like the relationship between this
city and this team in the NFL,'' Bowlen said. ``There is a bond
here and it works this way, even back when the Broncos were awful.
It's sort of like if somebody called your sister ugly. You go to
kick their tail. It doesn't matter if your sister really is ugly or
not. It's that kind of an attachment that goes beyond
expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Bowlen's ownership, expectation has only increased. Denver
has won seven divisional titles, made nine playoff appearances and
put together a 96-25 record at home. The Broncos have won the last
18 games they have played at Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I purchased the team in 1984, I could see that it was a
franchise that had rounded the corner from its problematic early
history but was in the middle of the pack in the NFL,'' Bowlen
said. ``Dan Reeves had a lot to do with elevating the franchise
further. He brought his winning experience as a player and a coach
from the Dallas Cowboys here and showed this organization how to
win. The standard was set then by Dan that anything less than
making the playoffs each season was a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan arrived with Bowlen in 1984. He was an assistant coach
from 1984 through 1987 and again from 1989 through 1991. He then
spent three years as the offensive coordinator for the San
Francisco 49ers and was part of the 49ers' staff that coached the
team to a Super Bowl victory after the 1994 season. Bowlen brought
him back to Denver in 1995 as head coach and the man in charge of
football operations.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Shanahan turned out to be the move that elevated
the Broncos to their current status, to a level of achievement that
is now envied in pro football. The Denver standard now is Super
Bowl or bust.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan is not only a noted offensive strategist and teacher;
his leadership and personnel decisions have helped Denver develop
from an 8-8 team in 1995 to 13-3 in 1996, 12-4 and Super Bowl
champions the following year, and this season's 14-2 regular-season
record _ which included winning its first 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mike Shanahan had been here longer and especially with
Elway, you would have seen more Super Bowl championships for
Denver,'' said Broncos defensive end Neil Smith, who joined the
team last season as a free agent after playing nine seasons for the
Kansas City Chiefs. ``There is a spirit here inside the
organization and with the fans that makes things happen. Good
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Williams, another Broncos defensive end, played college
football at the University of Colorado beginning in 1987 and played
for two other NFL teams before returning here as a Bronco in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Denver Broncos have been invigorating the city of Denver
for a long time,'' Williams said. ``There would probably not be a
Colorado Avalanche pro hockey team here if it wasn't for the
Broncos. There would probably not be a Colorado Rockies baseball
team here if it wasn't for the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans here loved this team but were frustrated over a
championship for the team, and one for John Elway, for so long
after so many close tries. But last year we got it and the
appreciation and outpouring of affection was tremendous. We got to
ride on the big red fire truck through downtown Denver, around all
of the fans, in the big parade. We want to get on that fire truck
again. And ride.''
</P>
<P>
   What Sunday's game against the Jets here has anticipated is not
simply the chance to advance to the team's second consecutive Super
Bowl. It is also the notion that Elway, the pride of the Broncos, a
player in his 16th season with the team, might be playing his last
game in Mile High Stadium. Maybe even his last game as a Bronco.
Elway has indicated he will retire after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let that enter my mind, what I'm doing next
year,'' Elway said. ``We were in the same situation last year, but
I think you have to savor each one. You've got to focus in on each
one, because you never know how many opportunities you're going to
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Elway almost retired after winning the last Super Bowl, he
appears gone if he wins this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what's going to happen,'' Bowlen said, ``but we
expect that John will retire. And if that is the case, come to that
stadium on Sunday and you will see something that has rarely
happened in sports before. The Broncos playing to get to a Super
Bowl and Elway and the fans saying goodbye? That is something that
would be very emotional for Denver and for Colorado. It would
transcend beyond the football game.''

 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An old metaphysical question asks what happens if a tree falls
in a forest with no one around. Does it make a sound?
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 version of the question is: If a tree falls in a
forest, is it news? Does it become news only if Geraldo Rivera,
Larry King, Sam Donaldson, Matt Drudge, eight talk radio shows,
five World Wide Web sites, four newspapers, three cable channels,
two wire services and a late-night talk-show host take notice?
</P>
<P>
   Or, to be less metaphorical, can Larry Flynt, the publisher of
Hustler magazine, get the press to give him a platform for his
campaign of offering cash to anyone who can expose the sexual
transgressions of a politician seeking to remove President Clinton
from office?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's coverage of Flynt's latest revelations showed that
yes, he can get attention. But it also showed that, unless the
target of his attacks responds, making news himself, self-appointed
newsmakers like Flynt can't necessarily keep the press' attention
very long. His accusations against one of the managers of the
impeachment trial, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., flowed through the cable
news programs leaving barely a trace.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Flynt appeared on the CNBC program ``Rivera Live''
to report that Barr had refused to answer questions during a
divorce proceeding a dozen years ago about his relationship with
the woman who would become his third wife. Copies of the divorce
papers were given to the host, Rivera, who displayed them on
camera. Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz denounced Flynt's campaign
and those who would use public figures' sexual transgressions
against them. The Rev. Jerry Falwell of the Moral Majority
denounced sin and urged Dershowitz to stop hating people. About 1.3
million households tuned in, about 80 percent more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Then C-Span, which had planned to carry Flynt's subsequent press
conference live, backed off, fearing the Hustler publisher might
make charges that could get C-Span sued.
</P>
<P>
   And while dozens of reporters crowded into Flynt's office _ the
pornographer had, after all, forced the resignation of the House
speaker-elect, Bob Livingston, in December _ the leading American
wire service, the Associated Press, made only a glancing reference
to Flynt's accusations, at the end of its daily wrap-up of
impeachment news.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a dozen or more newspapers ran a more detailed
account distributed by the Reuters news service. The Washington
Post was the only major newspaper to use a stand-alone article by a
staff writer.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with, say, the news of Michael Jordan's retirement
from basketball, the Flynt news was hardly prominent. The publisher
repeated his charges on the ABC program ``Good Morning America''
and on ``CBS This Morning''; CNN spent part of the day discussing
it, but, aside from Barr's terse refusal to comment on his private
life, Flynt got little reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were filtering through the public consciousness and
made little noise. By Tuesday night, Flynt was complaining on CNN's
``Larry King Live,'' ``I think Barr's going to get away with it
when he doesn't deserve to.'' On Wednesday, Flynt was on the ABC
News program ``20/20''; its audience size was unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the filters that once kept such news from the American
public are easy to bypass. It is now conventional wisdom that the
Internet, talk radio and late-night comics provide a conduit
through which half-baked news, gossip and innuendo flow to the
public. Now new kinds of grass-roots editing seems to be evolving.
When people hear purportedly scandalous news that doesn't meet
their criteria of newsworthiness, they don't react. Since the whole
rationale for putting out scandalous news is the potential for
public and political reaction, no reaction means no story.
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way, the generation that is learning to invest
its own retirement money is now doing more editing of its own news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much more is expected of the public and the viewers,'' Frank
Sesno, CNN's Washington bureau chief said in an interview. ``They
get more information _ they are inundated with information. There
is much more responsibility on their shoulders to figure out real
from fabricated information, or talk-show hype from journalistic
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Larry Flynt, Sesno said: ``Whether anybody likes
it or not, he has injected himself into this very ugly public
discussion. Ignoring him is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and much of the
public respectfully disagreed. Alan L. Murray, the Journal's
Washington bureau chief, said he was content to be in ``a race to
be last'' with sexual revelations about public figures. The Journal
published a brief item Friday describing the revelations and saying
they had little impact on Barr's constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor of The New York Times,
sent no reporter to the Flynt press conference. ``This is the only
area of news where I can't imagine wanting to be first,'' he said.
When it comes to covering the sex lives of public figures, he
added, ``I need not just an excuse to do it. I need to be deprived
of my last excuse not to do it.'' The Times made a passing
reference to allegations about Barr's ``past'' in its impeachment
coverage Thursday.

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question, however, of articles like the one you
are reading at this moment, which provide a convenient framework to
inform readers and viewers about how information is passing through
the body politic. They also, inevitably, pass on information deemed
unworthy of publication in its own right, and so are widely derided
as back-door ways to give the respectable press a cover for passing
on disreputable information.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of forswearing all mention of rumor may be leaving
the rumor unchecked, or forgoing the chance to help readers
evaluate the information that comes their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a Catch-22,'' said Doyle McManus, Washington bureau
chief of The Los Angeles Times, which printed Flynt's accusations
at the end of a long article about impeachment developments. ``By
reporting the rumor you give it greater currency. By not reporting
it, we have a feeling that we may not be serving our readers fully.
Part of the function of the mainstream media is to sort out,
verify, test and grade the flood of data we are all subjected to,
and to give some order to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ignore that large category of data that is called `the
buzz,' '' he added, ``then arguably we're not performing the
service we promised to.'' The solution for his publication, he
said, ``is to investigate the buzz or the accusation or the rumor,
and to find a way to put them in context. Which often means that
there will be a two or three or longer day delay between The
National Star and The Los Angeles Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Star, a supermarket tabloid, was the midwife of a more
salacious, false rumor the week before Flynt's news conference. For
a week, thanks to its report _ given front-page play by The New
York Post _ late-night comics like NBC's Jay Leno were making jokes
about a tale that the president had an illegitimate child. Three of
the four newspapers that gave the rumor any ink _ The New York
Post, The Boston Herald and The Washington Times _ are no fans of
Clinton. The Daily News of New York debunked it in a science
article.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Leno, with his audience of 6 million homes, who gave
the bogus report its greatest reach by using it in his monologue
two weeks ago. Leno says, ``I don't consider myself a news source
at all.'' And if he makes a mistake, he said, ``I don't mind
apologizing.'' Which is what he did during last week's monologues,
three times over.

<P>
   It's enough to get someone struggling to lose those
all-important 20 pounds lathered up into a frenzy, but come to
think of it, a frenzy may be just what the doctor ordered.
Old-fashioned fidgeting _ tapping your pencil against a conference
table in a make-or-break meeting, jiggling your leg while gabbing
on the telephone, pacing back and forth until you wear a hole in
the carpet behind your desk _ may emerge as a new weight-control
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be a major implication of a Mayo Clinic study,
which fed 16 people 1,000 extra calories a day for eight weeks and
then told them to simply lounge around, have a good time _ and,
most of all, refrain from strenuous exercise. The researchers
wanted an answer to a question that has been voiced with equal
parts anger and green-eyed envy by anyone who has discovered that
last year's suits do not fit this year's dimensions: Why can some
people eat anything and everything and not gain an ounce, while
others bulk up with every swallow?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were surprised to find that some people _ the
fortunate ones, they said _ work off the extra calories by
fidgeting (``nonexercise activity thermogenesis,'' nutritionists
call it).
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the notion that something as painless as ordinary
movements _ a tensing of a muscle here, a run to the lavatory there
_ can lead to weight loss (or at least weight control) will open
new horizons for the billion-dollar diet industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York and spokesperson for Weight
Watchers, may face competition if Roadrunner (the hero of the Wile
E. Coyote cartoons) starts doing endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores, too, can profit by clearing away some of those
no-pain, no-gain books for the blockbuster literature of fidgeting.
``There's an opportunity here for me to become a fidget guru,''
said Lewis Grossberger, author of ``The Non-Runner's Book''
(Collier, 1978). ``I'm going to write a best-selling health book
called `Fidget Your Way to Health' and tell you how to lose weight,
improve muscle tone and your sex life by fidgeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The realization that fidgeting is good may also force a
fundamental change in family dynamics _ after all, parents will no
longer have to tell their children to stop fidgeting at the dinner
table.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, too, can stop worrying about acting like worrywarts
because of the health benefits. (Here things get confusing, though.
If they stop worrying, they might gain weight.) How many calories
does a shifty-eyed person use glowering at everybody in sight? Is
that how Richard M. Nixon kept fit during the dark days of
Watergate? Perhaps indoorsy types can skip the gym in favor of a
couple of practice golf swings during everyday conversations _ who
knew Johnny Carson had figured out the secret to a flat stomach?
</P>
<P>
   But isn't fidgeting just another name for nervous energy?
Apparently so. ``Let's be real,'' said Annette Hastings, director
of nutrition at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. ``If you are the
kind of person who moves around a lot, you're going to have higher
calorie needs. This is plain old common sense. Surprise,
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some researchers say there is food for serious thought in
the fidgeting findings. Karen Miller-Kovach, the lead scientist for
Weight Watchers International, said fidgeting ``seems to be a
personal characteristic that may have some hereditary links, but it
doesn't seem to be a habit that you can form.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, like charisma or sex appeal, you either have it
or you don't. ``It's pretty much unconscious or subconscious
movements, even down to the people with nervous tics,'' she said.
``That all takes energy to make those muscles contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller-Kovach described studies where researchers computed
calories consumed by subjects in controlled environments. ``The
people who are genetically or biologically predisposed to be couch
potatoes sit on the bed and read a book or whatever they do,'' she
said. ``The nervous-energy types are touching their toes, cracking
their knuckles, not sitting in one place for more than a minute or
two.'' (She is one of them. ``I had my pencil going against my
leg'' while describing the study, she said in a telephone
interview.)
</P>
<P>
   Other experts warn against expecting large, quick losses from
adopting a daily regimen of fidgeting. Annette Hastings, director
of the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, calculated that fidgeting
could add 5 to 10 percent to a man's basic metabolic rate (the
number of calories burned by doing nothing).
</P>
<P>
   That works out to only 200 calories a day. Jogging or playing
tennis would burn that many in an hour. Still, she said, ``over 365
days in a year, that's a lot of calories.''
</P>
<P>
   Not willing to wait a year? Try a short-term calculation. ``In
17 days you lose a pound,'' she said, ``if you're not eating to
support the fidgeting.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   An old metaphysical question asks what happens if a tree falls
in a forest with no one around. Does it make a sound?
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 version of the question is: If a tree falls in a
forest, is it news? Does it become news only if Geraldo Rivera,
Larry King, Sam Donaldson, Matt Drudge, eight talk radio shows,
five World Wide Web sites, four newspapers, three cable channels,
two wire services and a late-night talk-show host take notice?
</P>
<P>
   Or, to be less metaphorical, can Larry Flynt, the publisher of
Hustler magazine, get the press to give him a platform for his
campaign of offering cash to anyone who can expose the sexual
transgressions of a politician seeking to remove President Clinton
from office?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's coverage of Flynt's latest revelations showed that
yes, he can get attention. But it also showed that, unless the
target of his attacks responds, making news himself, self-appointed
newsmakers like Flynt can't necessarily keep the press' attention
very long. His accusations against one of the managers of the
impeachment trial, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., flowed through the cable
news programs leaving barely a trace.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Flynt appeared on the CNBC program ``Rivera Live''
to report that Barr had refused to answer questions during a
divorce proceeding a dozen years ago about his relationship with
the woman who would become his third wife. Copies of the divorce
papers were given to the host, Rivera, who displayed them on
camera. Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz denounced Flynt's campaign
and those who would use public figures' sexual transgressions
against them. The Rev. Jerry Falwell of the Moral Majority
denounced sin and urged Dershowitz to stop hating people. About 1.3
million households tuned in, about 80 percent more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Then C-Span, which had planned to carry Flynt's subsequent press
conference live, backed off, fearing the Hustler publisher might
make charges that could get C-Span sued.
</P>
<P>
   And while dozens of reporters crowded into Flynt's office _ the
pornographer had, after all, forced the resignation of the House
speaker-elect, Bob Livingston, in December _ the leading American
wire service, the Associated Press, made only a glancing reference
to Flynt's accusations, at the end of its daily wrap-up of
impeachment news.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a dozen or more newspapers ran a more detailed
account distributed by the Reuters news service. The Washington
Post was the only major newspaper to use a stand-alone article by a
staff writer.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with, say, the news of Michael Jordan's retirement
from basketball, the Flynt news was hardly prominent. The publisher
repeated his charges on the ABC program ``Good Morning America''
and on ``CBS This Morning''; CNN spent part of the day discussing
it, but, aside from Barr's terse refusal to comment on his private
life, Flynt got little reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were filtering through the public consciousness and
made little noise. By Tuesday night, Flynt was complaining on CNN's
``Larry King Live,'' ``I think Barr's going to get away with it
when he doesn't deserve to.'' On Wednesday, Flynt was on the ABC
News program ``20/20''; its audience size was unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the filters that once kept such news from the American
public are easy to bypass. It is now conventional wisdom that the
Internet, talk radio and late-night comics provide a conduit
through which half-baked news, gossip and innuendo flow to the
public. Now new kinds of grass-roots editing seems to be evolving.
When people hear purportedly scandalous news that doesn't meet
their criteria of newsworthiness, they don't react. Since the whole
rationale for putting out scandalous news is the potential for
public and political reaction, no reaction means no story.
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way, the generation that is learning to invest
its own retirement money is now doing more editing of its own news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much more is expected of the public and the viewers,'' Frank
Sesno, CNN's Washington bureau chief said in an interview. ``They
get more information _ they are inundated with information. There
is much more responsibility on their shoulders to figure out real
from fabricated information, or talk-show hype from journalistic
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Larry Flynt, Sesno said: ``Whether anybody likes
it or not, he has injected himself into this very ugly public
discussion. Ignoring him is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and much of the
public respectfully disagreed. Alan L. Murray, the Journal's
Washington bureau chief, said he was content to be in ``a race to
be last'' with sexual revelations about public figures. The Journal
published a brief item Friday describing the revelations and saying
they had little impact on Barr's constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor of The New York Times,
sent no reporter to the Flynt press conference. ``This is the only
area of news where I can't imagine wanting to be first,'' he said.
When it comes to covering the sex lives of public figures, he
added, ``I need not just an excuse to do it. I need to be deprived
of my last excuse not to do it.'' The Times made a passing
reference to allegations about Barr's ``past'' in its impeachment
coverage Thursday.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question, however, of articles like the one you
are reading at this moment, which provide a convenient framework to
inform readers and viewers about how information is passing through
the body politic. They also, inevitably, pass on information deemed
unworthy of publication in its own right, and so are widely derided
as back-door ways to give the respectable press a cover for passing
on disreputable information.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of forswearing all mention of rumor may be leaving
the rumor unchecked, or forgoing the chance to help readers
evaluate the information that comes their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a Catch-22,'' said Doyle McManus, Washington bureau
chief of The Los Angeles Times, which printed Flynt's accusations
at the end of a long article about impeachment developments. ``By
reporting the rumor you give it greater currency. By not reporting
it, we have a feeling that we may not be serving our readers fully.
Part of the function of the mainstream media is to sort out,
verify, test and grade the flood of data we are all subjected to,
and to give some order to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ignore that large category of data that is called `the
buzz,' '' he added, ``then arguably we're not performing the
service we promised to.'' The solution for his publication, he
said, ``is to investigate the buzz or the accusation or the rumor,
and to find a way to put them in context. Which often means that
there will be a two or three or longer day delay between The
National Star and The Los Angeles Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Star, a supermarket tabloid, was the midwife of a more
salacious, false rumor the week before Flynt's news conference. For
a week, thanks to its report _ given front-page play by The New
York Post _ late-night comics like NBC's Jay Leno were making jokes
about a tale that the president had an illegitimate child. Three of
the four newspapers that gave the rumor any ink _ The New York
Post, The Boston Herald and The Washington Times _ are no fans of
Clinton. The Daily News of New York debunked it in a science
article.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Leno, with his audience of 6 million homes, who gave
the bogus report its greatest reach by using it in his monologue
two weeks ago. Leno says, ``I don't consider myself a news source
at all.'' And if he makes a mistake, he said, ``I don't mind
apologizing.'' Which is what he did during last week's monologues,
three times over.

DECISION TO TESTIFY HAUNTED BOY WHO WAS LATER KILLED  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ At the Boys and Girls Club of Bridgeport,
B.J. Brown was one of the most reliable and joyful leaders, always
jumping up to take attendance or pass out crafts. He was only 7,
but had the poise to ask a girl in his class if they could go on a
date when he turned 10.
</P>
<P>
   Then one summer evening, a Chevrolet Lumina pulled up beside the
car in which B.J. was riding with his mother's fiance, whom he
called Dad. From a foot away, according to the police, a man in the
Lumina fired three rounds from a Smith &AMP; Wesson pistol, wounding
the fiance in the forehead, piercing his car door and shattering a
passenger side window.
</P>
<P>
   The bullets missed B.J., but they cost him his childhood. He got
a good look at the gunman, and when the police asked him who he
thought had done it, the boy did something that few adults would
have dared to do: he told.
</P>
<P>
   The decision haunted the rambunctious jokester, said his
teachers and counselors, making him brooding and paranoid. He had
flashbacks, and feared the consequences of helping the law. On
B.J.'s first day back at the club after the drive-by shooting in
September 1997, Gladys Marquez, a Boys Club counselor, knew she was
dealing with an entirely different boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``His head was down and he was crying,'' she recalled. She told
him to be good and to hold his head up, and he told her that he
believed that God would help him.
</P>
<P>
   But as the weeks passed, B.J. grew more glum. ``It was still
vivid in his mind,'' Ms. Marquez said. ``He felt it wasn't going
away.''
</P>
<P>
   His sense of foreboding was well founded. Largely because of
B.J.'s help, the police charged a local man, Russell Peeler, 27,
with attempted murder. While free on bond, according to court
papers, Peeler began taunting B.J.'s mother's fiance, Rudolph Snead
Jr., 28, on the street, saying he was going ``to get'' him.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months later, Snead was shot seven times as he watched
television in a barbershop. As he fell to the floor, he screamed,
``It was Russell, yo!'' according to police documents.
</P>
<P>
   One witness to the earlier shooting was gone, leaving B.J. to
tell the tale. His mother, Karen Clarke, was in tears the next time
she took him to the Boys Club, and begged B.J. not to go outside.
He did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was distraught,'' Ms. Marquez said. ``He was paranoid,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Fridays ago, B.J. was found shot to death at the top of the
stairs inside the duplex his mother had bought in July in a safe,
working-class neighborhood _ her first home of her own. She had
been shot in the back, in her bedroom. They had just come back from
grocery shopping. The police believe that the intruder or intruders
confronted them after they closed the front door, and chased them
upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Clarke was 29. B.J. Brown was two months shy of his ninth
birthday. He was in the third grade at the Read School here. Mother
and son are to be buried in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where she has
family.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, the boy's death can be cast as frighteningly
foreseeable. On a judge's order, prosecutors had turned B.J.'s name
and address over to Peeler's lawyer, and further, detectives have
reports that Peeler had been seen outside the duplex where B.J.
lived.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, B.J.'s statement implicating Peeler _ signed in
careful, manly cursive script, with boyish practice signatures in
the margins _ was in a public court file for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that B.J. was killed because of what he had seen
has produced anguish and outrage in a city that has never quite
recovered from the crack epidemic of the 1980s, which turned whole
sections of the city into war zones. Bridgeport, Connecticut's
largest city with 140,000 residents, has undergone a broad makeover
since emerging from the brink of bankruptcy in 1992, but it has
long been a pocket of blight in wealthy Fairfield County.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Garcia, a single mother of three who lives opposite an
elementary school in Bridgeport, says she hears gunshots three or
four nights a week. Her daughters' bedroom is in the front of the
house, so they sleep with her and their room is used to store toys
and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garcia, 22, says she believes that the police and the courts
let the city down by not protecting B.J. ``All they're interested
in is getting the bad guys _ they don't think about the good
guys,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials agree that the system failed the young mother and
her son, and some fear the potential consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people think someone was killed because they were a
witness,'' Mayor Joseph Ganim said, ``whether it turns out to be
true or false, what does that do to your ability to get other
individuals to testify? It really strikes at the heart of the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a political scramble, with lawmakers in
Hartford proposing measures to beef up Connecticut's protection for
witnesses. The state's witness-assistance budget is $30,000 a year.
John Bailey, the chief state's attorney, said he believed that the
police and prosecutors did everything they could, but he supports
the plans to expand witness assistance. ``That's the only good
thing that can come out of this tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The case has also raised questions about the pace of the court
system. Peeler was arrested in September 1997, giving B.J. more
than a year to fret about his testimony and his mother just as long
to worry about their safety. Other lawmakers say they wonder
whether the state should check the origins of bail money: according
to officials, Peeler was released after friends showed up with
$50,000 wrapped in a towel.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the disclosure of B.J.'s name to the man
against whom he was to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a death warrant,'' said Loretta Williams, a member of
Survivors of Homicide, a Bridgeport mothers' group. Her son was
killed in 1997, and she said the police were so careful with their
witnesses that they would not tell even her where they were.

<P>
   It's enough to get someone struggling to lose those
all-important 20 pounds lathered up into a frenzy, but come to
think of it, a frenzy may be just what the doctor ordered.
Old-fashioned fidgeting _ tapping your pencil against a conference
table in a make-or-break meeting, jiggling your leg while gabbing
on the telephone, pacing back and forth until you wear a hole in
the carpet behind your desk _ may emerge as a new weight-control
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be a major implication of a Mayo Clinic study,
which fed 16 people 1,000 extra calories a day for eight weeks and
then told them to simply lounge around, have a good time _ and,
most of all, refrain from strenuous exercise. The researchers
wanted an answer to a question that has been voiced with equal
parts anger and green-eyed envy by anyone who has discovered that
last year's suits do not fit this year's dimensions: Why can some
people eat anything and everything and not gain an ounce, while
others bulk up with every swallow?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were surprised to find that some people _ the
fortunate ones, they said _ work off the extra calories by
fidgeting (``nonexercise activity thermogenesis,'' nutritionists
call it).
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the notion that something as painless as ordinary
movements _ a tensing of a muscle here, a run to the lavatory there
_ can lead to weight loss (or at least weight control) will open
new horizons for the billion-dollar diet industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York and spokesperson for Weight
Watchers, may face competition if Roadrunner (the hero of the Wile
E. Coyote cartoons) starts doing endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores, too, can profit by clearing away some of those
no-pain, no-gain books for the blockbuster literature of fidgeting.
``There's an opportunity here for me to become a fidget guru,''
said Lewis Grossberger, author of ``The Non-Runner's Book''
(Collier, 1978). ``I'm going to write a best-selling health book
called `Fidget Your Way to Health' and tell you how to lose weight,
improve muscle tone and your sex life by fidgeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The realization that fidgeting is good may also force a
fundamental change in family dynamics _ after all, parents will no
longer have to tell their children to stop fidgeting at the dinner
table.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, too, can stop worrying about acting like worrywarts
because of the health benefits. (Here things get confusing, though.
If they stop worrying, they might gain weight.) How many calories
does a shifty-eyed person use glowering at everybody in sight? Is
that how Richard M. Nixon kept fit during the dark days of
Watergate? Perhaps indoorsy types can skip the gym in favor of a
couple of practice golf swings during everyday conversations _ who
knew Johnny Carson had figured out the secret to a flat stomach?
</P>
<P>
   But isn't fidgeting just another name for nervous energy?
Apparently so. ``Let's be real,'' said Annette Hastings, director
of nutrition at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. ``If you are the
kind of person who moves around a lot, you're going to have higher
calorie needs. This is plain old common sense. Surprise,
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some researchers say there is food for serious thought in
the fidgeting findings. Karen Miller-Kovach, the lead scientist for
Weight Watchers International, said fidgeting ``seems to be a
personal characteristic that may have some hereditary links, but it
doesn't seem to be a habit that you can form.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, like charisma or sex appeal, you either have it
or you don't. ``It's pretty much unconscious or subconscious
movements, even down to the people with nervous tics,'' she said.
``That all takes energy to make those muscles contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller-Kovach described studies where researchers computed
calories consumed by subjects in controlled environments. ``The
people who are genetically or biologically predisposed to be couch
potatoes sit on the bed and read a book or whatever they do,'' she
said. ``The nervous-energy types are touching their toes, cracking
their knuckles, not sitting in one place for more than a minute or
two.'' (She is one of them. ``I had my pencil going against my
leg'' while describing the study, she said in a telephone
interview.)
</P>
<P>
   Other experts warn against expecting large, quick losses from
adopting a daily regimen of fidgeting. Annette Hastings, director
of the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, calculated that fidgeting
could add 5 to 10 percent to a man's basic metabolic rate (the
number of calories burned by doing nothing).
</P>
<P>
   That works out to only 200 calories a day. Jogging or playing
tennis would burn that many in an hour. Still, she said, ``over 365
days in a year, that's a lot of calories.''
</P>
<P>
   Not willing to wait a year? Try a short-term calculation. ``In
17 days you lose a pound,'' she said, ``if you're not eating to
support the fidgeting.''

 BRIDGEPORT, Conn.: they were.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one has been charged with the deaths of B.J. and Ms. Clarke.
Peeler may have an alibi: by court order, he was wearing an
electronic bracelet that tracked his movements. But he was arrested
this week on a charge of possessing a stolen shotgun, and his bail,
which had been $900,000 on the charges of attempted murder and the
later murder of Snead, was raised to $1.65 million. He remains in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   As he was led into the Bridgeport courthouse to be arraigned on
Thursday, he was asked if he had had anything to do with the death
of B.J. Brown. Peeler kept his head down and did not answer.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport was the third stop for B.J., who was born in Brooklyn
as Leroy George Brown Jr. but quickly became known by the initials
for ``Brown, Junior.'' For his first two years, he lived with his
grandparents in Fort Lauderdale, then joined his mother in
Bridgeport in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clarke was an energetic, hands-on mother who personally
delivered B.J. to school and after-school activities, and could
always be counted on to help chaperone a field trip or to bring
cupcakes to school for Valentine's Day, relatives said. She was
born in Jamaica, where she was a Girl Scout, then immigrated to the
United States, settling in Fort Lauderdale just before high school,
where she ran track.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, she briefly studied to become a medical
administrative assistant, then moved to New York to live with a
cousin, Janet Gordon. A year after Ms. Clarke gave birth to B.J.,
she joined Ms. Gordon in Bridgeport, and took classes at a
community college before going to work at the counter of the U-Haul
moving center in Bridgeport. She was promoted to the state
headquarters in nearby Orange, where at the time of her death she
worked as a coordinator of equipment traffic.
</P>
<P>
   B.J.'s father, Leroy Brown Sr., had not been around much, but he
attended the double funeral on Thursday night at the Refuge Temple
Church of God here. He said that in a recent chat with Ms. Clarke,
she had told him about buying the $76,000 house on Earl Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she finally felt like she was getting somewhere in
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their son had been thriving, too. Sandra Gonzalez, 9, a
classmate in second grade at B.J.'s former school, Webster
Elementary, remembers him giving her a ring and quarters to buy
cotton candy at a nearby deli.
</P>
<P>
   He spent afternoons at the Boys Club, where he wrestled, swam
and played the jokester. The director, Steven S. Jones, said he was
always one of the most neatly dressed children.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Torres, his intended when he turned 10, remembered him
telling her appreciatively, `` `You're blazing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd touch my butt and then run, so I'd chase him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The exuberance was snuffed out by the drive-by shooting on Sept.
2, 1997. Snead and Peeler had apparently had a long feud that had
begun over $90.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how Snead and Ms. Clarke came to associate with
Peeler. But in doing so, they were drawing B.J. into Bridgeport's
wilder side. Peeler had been charged with having drug
paraphernalia. And after the drive-by shooting, according to court
documents, his girlfriend told Ms. Clarke that Snead ``should not
have been driving with kids in the car when he had a beef with
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bridgeport Police Chief, Thomas J. Sweeney, said B.J. was
very open with detectives and gave a very helpful statement. ``He
had an impressive ability to recall and reconstruct events _ better
than some older people,'' Chief Sweeney said. He said that over the
months they had spent talking to him, investigators had become fond
of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and his mother, though, knew they were in danger. Ms.
Marquez, the Boys Club counselor, said Ms. Clarke told her that
they moved last summer partly ``to get away from all that mess.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first week or so after the move, an officer in a marked
car was stationed outside whenever the family was home, and the
officer followed Ms. Clarke when she went out of town, sometimes as
far as the state line. But then she asked the police to end the
protection, feeling it made them even more conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 8, Ms. Clarke's body was discovered by a co-worker about
11 a.m. after she did not show up for work. Investigators believe
that she had been killed about 6 the night before, when a neighbor
heard a noise that could have been gunshots or a car backfiring.
</P>
<P>
   On her bed was her Bible, open to Psalm 20. ``May the Lord
answer you in the day of trouble,'' it begins.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clarke had been a parishioner at the Refuge Temple Church of
God, a Pentecostal congregation. At the end of Sunday services,
which sometimes last three hours, she often answered the altar
call, which people more commonly respond to just once, when they
accept Christ. The pastor, the Rev. Courtney Williams Jr., said
regular appearances at the altar indicate either a special response
to the sermon or ``a deep need for spiritual counsel or prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is the children of Bridgeport who are seeking strength.
They thronged to the funeral, many standing on tiptoe to sign the
guest book, and a dozen wearing their Boys Club basketball jerseys
under heavy winter coats.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the youngsters at the club said they had heard a name
on the street in connection with the killings. Their buddies have
advised them to shut up about it.

   WASHINGTON _ Screeners at airport security checkpoints miss
weapons that undercover testers hide under their clothes, or they
notice them but do nothing. Ticket agents forget to ask if
passengers are carrying packages from strangers, or fail to react

passengers who buy tickets with cash at the last minute or

Concerned about the airport failure rate, the Transportation
Department's inspector general is testing security arrangements and
its report is expected to go to Congress in February.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts wonder why the system works at all, especially at
the level of screeners, most of whom are hired at minimal wages by
security companies trying to maximize the chance of getting the
contract from the airlines, which are responsible for the security
at their check-in desks, gates and terminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the same money, or more money, you can go over to Pizza
Hut or McDonald's in the same airport, and maybe get better
benefits, and get a free lunch out of it,'' said a federal official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. And a job in fast food has few
worrisome responsibilities, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy job turnover _ often well over 100 percent in a year _
also has its effects. At the Dallas/Fort Worth airport in 1995, an
FAA agent with a weapon strapped to the small of his back set off a
metal detector. The screener used a hand wand.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation showed that the screener, who was on only his
third shift, had not completed training; he didn't realize that
when the agent spread his arms, his jacket stood away from his
back, shielding the gun from detection.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, a screener at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport failed to detect a weapon smuggled in by
another agent in 1995, and USAir asked for leniency because the
screener had been on the job four years. That, said the airline in
a letter to the FAA, constituted ``extensive experience (in terms
of screener turnover).'' In this context, four years is a lengthy
career.
</P>
<P>
   At the checkpoint, ``the ability of people to find things on the
X-ray screen is shockingly low,'' said Dr. Michael Cantor, a
psychologist formerly employed at Argenbright, one of the nation's
largest airport security contractors. Some people are
detail-oriented and are very good at spotting guns or bombs. Others
have other useful traits, he said, being ``highly extroverted'' and
willing to challenge people who are often of higher social status.
</P>
<P>
   ``But supervisors are not savvy,'' Dr. Cantor said. ``They don't
do a division of labor.'' Workers rotate between viewing the X-ray
screen and the other checkpoint jobs. Cantor developed a quick test
to find detail-oriented people but could not persuade the FAA to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   People are, in fact, the weak spot in the system. Airlines and
the FAA are installing more and more high-tech machines to scan
bags, but the airlines do not always send the bags through.
Mechanics, baggage handlers and others often fail to wear required
identification, or fail to challenge persons not wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, experts say, to stay vigilant about a threat that is
intermittent at best. It's like looking through a haystack that
might have a needle in it. The FAA is even considering a checkpoint
system that would periodically show an X-ray image of a bag with a
gun in it, just to keep screeners on their toes.

<P>
   Public opinion surveys show that most Americans want to know, in
a systematic way, how well their children and their children's
teachers are doing in school. So many states have been scrambling
to impose new layers of standardized tests on students, as well as
on prospective teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond giving politicians a chance to wave the new test
booklets as trophies in front of their constituents, it isn't
always clear what these tests really tell us.
</P>
<P>
   In New York last week, more than 200,000 fourth-graders spent
about an hour a day for three days sitting for what experts
consider to be one of the most exhaustive reading exams ever given
to 9-year-olds. They answered multiple-choice questions, as their
predecessors did, but also took notes to analyze an African folk
tale about kindness and then wrote several essays. The test was
based on passages they read or their teachers read to them.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the jitters it set off, the state's new reading test
and tests elsewhere raise questions about the difficulties of
placing a yardstick against the wide range of development of
students so young _ and about whether their ability to deconstruct
a fable, for example, is an appropriate benchmark and predictor of
future success.
</P>
<P>
   How much the state will learn was cast into further doubt when
an apparent oversight was discovered: the test contained reading
material that tens of thousands of students probably studied in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the measure of teachers has proven to be equally
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, 3 out of 10 teaching applicants in Massachusetts
failed a new four-hour reading and writing exam _ a test devised
after a decade of mounting political pressure. But some of the
skills the applicants were required to demonstrate had little to do
with teaching, including taking extended dictation _ with spelling,
punctuation and capitalization fair game _ from a writing sample
read to them from the Federalist Papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitfalls in the Massachusetts teacher test, other teacher
tests and many student testing programs is that policy makers are
loading more weight onto these tests than any human contrivance can
bear,'' said Professor Walter Haney, a senior research associate at
the Center for the Study of Testing at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``For young children, trying to hold students to a common test
standard ignores much that has been learned about the variability
of human development,'' Haney said. ``For teachers, trying to test
teachers' basic skills as a way of improving teaching in the
classroom ignores considerable research that suggests that
incompetence among teachers derives not from lack of knowledge or
skill but from lack of care and effort. That's very hard to test.''
</P>
<P>
   Every state except Iowa and Nebraska administers statewide exams
to students, with 46 states testing those in fourth grade and
lower, according to a recent survey by Education Week and the Pew
Charitable Trusts. And 42 states give some standardized form of
basic skills test to incoming teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the student tests help states identify failing schools,
New York City is among a number of districts and states considering
whether to go a step further and use standardized test scores, even
among students as young as 9, as at least one factor in promoting
them to the next grade and judging teacher performance.
</P>
<P>
   The states that have installed new tests in recent years,
including New York, Florida and Louisiana, are often following up
their issuance of statewide performance and achievement standards.
At the behest of parents wanting to know what the states think
children should know, 40 states have adopted such standards in
English, math, science and social studies. But the annual survey by
Education Week, closely read in academic circles, criticizes many
of these standards as vague.
</P>
<P>
   New York _ which asks fourth graders to ``correctly use and
spell words learned in all their areas of study'' _ received some
of the highest marks from Education Week for its standards, and for
the direction for the new fourth grade test.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Ryan, who teaches fourth grade in Brooklyn, said she
thought the state, working with the national test publisher, CTB
McGraw Hill, had come closer than any strictly multiple-choice exam
to approximating what she does in class. The test asks students to
craft paragraphs in response to such questions as ``Which lesson
does the folk tale teach best?''
</P>
<P>
   But with spelling, grammar, capitalization and punctuation all
counting, Roz Sacharoff, who teaches fourth grade in Queens, said
she worried whether her students were ``proficient enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity underscores the range in student abilities, said
Dr. James Comer, a professor of child psychiatry at the Yale
University Child Study Center and a longtime education reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great variation among children of that age _ 8, 9, 10
_ in their performance,'' Comer said. ``There is literature that
shows that many kids catch up by the time they are in sixth,
seventh and eighth grades and score as well as others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing them early can affect their sense of personal adequacy
and efficacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said for prospective teachers.
</P>
<P>
   John Silber, the chairman of the Massachusetts Board of
Education, has praised the Massachusetts test, which he helped
write, as fair. The Federalist Papers excerpt, he said, was read
aloud three times, and slowly. But Haney said the test was hastily
assembled with no clearly demonstrated link to classroom
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is among those states trying to find a different way to
size up teaching applicants beyond the basic skills test that it
gives. It believes it has found it; the state now asks
teachers-in-training to design a short course for their students
and then write a test to assess their students' growth.
</P>
<P>
   A state panel determined that a standardized test to measure the
students in each teacher's class would be impossible, since each
class would be at a different stage. The panel decided, after much
gnashing of teeth, that the teachers-in-training were in the best
position to find a way to evaluate their students. And that was a
refreshing throwback, said Del Schalock, a professor in the
teaching research division at Western Oregon University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as far as from a standardized achievement test that you
can get,'' he said.

at their check-in desks, gates and terminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the same money, or more money, you can go over to Pizza
Hut or McDonald's in the same airport, and maybe get better
benefits, and get a free lunch out of it,'' said a federal official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. And a job in fast food has few
worrisome responsibilities, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy job turnover _ often well over 100 percent in a year _
also has its effects. At the Dallas/Fort Worth airport in 1995, an
FAA agent with a weapon strapped to the small of his back set off a
metal detector. The screener used a hand wand.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation showed that the screener, who was on only his
third shift, had not completed training; he didn't realize that
when the agent spread his arms, his jacket stood away from his
back, shielding the gun from detection.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, a screener at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport failed to detect a weapon smuggled in by
another agent in 1995, and USAir asked for leniency because the
screener had been on the job four years. That, said the airline in
a letter to the FAA, constituted ``extensive experience (in terms
of screener turnover).'' In this context, four years is a lengthy
career.
</P>
<P>
   At the checkpoint, ``the ability of people to find things on the
X-ray screen is shockingly low,'' said Dr. Michael Cantor, a
psychologist formerly employed at Argenbright, one of the nation's
largest airport security contractors. Some people are
detail-oriented and are very good at spotting guns or bombs. Others
have other useful traits, he said, being ``highly extroverted'' and
willing to challenge people who are often of higher social status.
</P>
<P>
   ``But supervisors are not savvy,'' Dr. Cantor said. ``They don't
do a division of labor.'' Workers rotate between viewing the X-ray
screen and the other checkpoint jobs. Cantor developed a quick test
to find detail-oriented people but could not persuade the FAA to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   People are, in fact, the weak spot in the system. Airlines and
the FAA are installing more and more high-tech machines to scan
bags, but the airlines do not always send the bags through.
Mechanics, baggage handlers and others often fail to wear required
identification, or fail to challenge persons not wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, experts say, to stay vigilant about a threat that is
intermittent at best. It's like looking through a haystack that
might have a needle in it. The FAA is even considering a checkpoint
system that would periodically show an X-ray image of a bag with a
gun in it, just to keep screeners on their toes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Public opinion surveys show that most Americans want to know, in
a systematic way, how well their children and their children's
teachers are doing in school. So many states have been scrambling
to impose new layers of standardized tests on students, as well as
on prospective teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond giving politicians a chance to wave the new test
booklets as trophies in front of their constituents, it isn't
always clear what these tests really tell us.
</P>
<P>
   In New York last week, more than 200,000 fourth-graders spent
about an hour a day for three days sitting for what experts
consider to be one of the most exhaustive reading exams ever given
to 9-year-olds. They answered multiple-choice questions, as their
predecessors did, but also took notes to analyze an African folk
tale about kindness and then wrote several essays. The test was
based on passages they read or their teachers read to them.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the jitters it set off, the state's new reading test
and tests elsewhere raise questions about the difficulties of
placing a yardstick against the wide range of development of
students so young _ and about whether their ability to deconstruct
a fable, for example, is an appropriate benchmark and predictor of
future success.
</P>
<P>
   How much the state will learn was cast into further doubt when
an apparent oversight was discovered: the test contained reading
material that tens of thousands of students probably studied in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the measure of teachers has proven to be equally
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, 3 out of 10 teaching applicants in Massachusetts
failed a new four-hour reading and writing exam _ a test devised
after a decade of mounting political pressure. But some of the
skills the applicants were required to demonstrate had little to do
with teaching, including taking extended dictation _ with spelling,
punctuation and capitalization fair game _ from a writing sample
read to them from the Federalist Papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitfalls in the Massachusetts teacher test, other teacher
tests and many student testing programs is that policy makers are
loading more weight onto these tests than any human contrivance can
bear,'' said Professor Walter Haney, a senior research associate at
the Center for the Study of Testing at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``For young children, trying to hold students to a common test
standard ignores much that has been learned about the variability
of human development,'' Haney said. ``For teachers, trying to test
teachers' basic skills as a way of improving teaching in the
classroom ignores considerable research that suggests that
incompetence among teachers derives not from lack of knowledge or
skill but from lack of care and effort. That's very hard to test.''
</P>
<P>
   Every state except Iowa and Nebraska administers statewide exams
to students, with 46 states testing those in fourth grade and
lower, according to a recent survey by Education Week and the Pew
Charitable Trusts. And 42 states give some standardized form of
basic skills test to incoming teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the student tests help states identify failing schools,
New York City is among a number of districts and states considering
whether to go a step further and use standardized test scores, even
among students as young as 9, as at least one factor in promoting
them to the next grade and judging teacher performance.
</P>
<P>
   The states that have installed new tests in recent years,
including New York, Florida and Louisiana, are often following up
their issuance of statewide performance and achievement standards.
At the behest of parents wanting to know what the states think
children should know, 40 states have adopted such standards in
English, math, science and social studies. But the annual survey by
Education Week, closely read in academic circles, criticizes many
of these standards as vague.
</P>
<P>
   New York _ which asks fourth graders to ``correctly use and
spell words learned in all their areas of study'' _ received some
of the highest marks from Education Week for its standards, and for
the direction for the new fourth grade test.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Ryan, who teaches fourth grade in Brooklyn, said she
thought the state, working with the national test publisher, CTB
McGraw Hill, had come closer than any strictly multiple-choice exam
to approximating what she does in class. The test asks students to
craft paragraphs in response to such questions as ``Which lesson
does the folk tale teach best?''
</P>
<P>
   But with spelling, grammar, capitalization and punctuation all
counting, Roz Sacharoff, who teaches fourth grade in Queens, said
she worried whether her students were ``proficient enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity underscores the range in student abilities, said
Dr. James Comer, a professor of child psychiatry at the Yale
University Child Study Center and a longtime education reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great variation among children of that age _ 8, 9, 10
_ in their performance,'' Comer said. ``There is literature that
shows that many kids catch up by the time they are in sixth,
seventh and eighth grades and score as well as others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing them early can affect their sense of personal adequacy
and efficacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said for prospective teachers.
</P>
<P>
   John Silber, the chairman of the Massachusetts Board of
Education, has praised the Massachusetts test, which he helped
write, as fair. The Federalist Papers excerpt, he said, was read
aloud three times, and slowly. But Haney said the test was hastily
assembled with no clearly demonstrated link to classroom
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is among those states trying to find a different way to
size up teaching applicants beyond the basic skills test that it
gives. It believes it has found it; the state now asks
teachers-in-training to design a short course for their students
and then write a test to assess their students' growth.
</P>
<P>
   A state panel determined that a standardized test to measure the
students in each teacher's class would be impossible, since each
class would be at a different stage. The panel decided, after much
gnashing of teeth, that the teachers-in-training were in the best
position to find a way to evaluate their students. And that was a
refreshing throwback, said Del Schalock, a professor in the
teaching research division at Western Oregon University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as far as from a standardized achievement test that you
can get,'' he said.

   For some people, life without Michael Jordan is unthinkable. But
although Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls and the game of
basketball last week, there's still a Michael Jordan of
snowboarding. And a Michael Jordan of bull riding. Even a Michael
Jordan of real-life bulls.
</P>
<P>
   No sport is too obscure to have its legions of coaches, fans,
opponents, writers and publicists ready to crown a king. In sports,
there's only one king: Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Terje Haakenson, a Norwegian, executes moves on a snowboard that
nobody had ever seen before, so he's dubbed the Michael Jordan of
snowboarding _ in every interview and article on him. The
Australian batsman Steve Waugh wins championships everywhere he
plays. That makes him the Michael Jordan of cricket. Doubt it?
Check out his news clippings. Jorge Campos isn't necessarily the
world's best soccer player, but he can't go anywhere in his country
without being recognized. To his publicist, that makes him the
Michael Jordan of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't work with every sports. Olympic gold gave the
freestyle skier Jonny Moseley so much cachet that he doesn't need
anybody else's famous name.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jordan isn't always Jordan. The last time he retired, to
play baseball, the Chicago Bulls' owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, called
him the Babe Ruth of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a guide to the Jordans still at work. Meet the Michael
Jordan of . . .
</P>
<P>
   THREE-CUSHION BILLIARDS:
</P>
<P>
   Sang Chun Lee
</P>
<P>
   Anointed by: Bob Graswich, a columnist for The Sacramento Bee,
who said Lee was like Jordan, only better, after watching the
Korean win last year's U.S. Billiards Association championship. Lee
has been unable to shake the moniker since, although Graswich
freely admits, ``I bet he doesn't know who Michael Jordan is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ephemeral Jordanesque quality: Lee, who plays in a tuxedo, is
the master of swank on the billiard circuit, which might be
sartorially an even tougher crowd than the world of hoops. They say
he's got ice water in his veins, too.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: With nine consecutive national championships
under his belt, Lee has consistency down pat; his specialty is
executing impossible carom shots, which involve mathematical
formulas and precision to a millimeter.
</P>
<P>
   RODEO BULLS:
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious
</P>
<P>
   Anointed by: The Terry Bradshaw of football, Terry Bradshaw, in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: Bo's utter dominance on the rodeo circuit
amounted to being ridden for the full 8 seconds just 7 times in 135
attempts. (``Those were his off days,'' said his owner, Carolyn
Andrews.)
</P>
<P>
   M.J. move: Just as Jordan specialized in long-range,
fourth-quarter daggers to the heart, Bodacious performs an
acrobatic maneuver with his horns known as ``checking the oil,''
best described as near-disembowelment and guarded against by
would-be busters wearing bulletproof vests and catcher's masks.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors: Even M.J. might learn a lesson in active retirement
from Bodacious, who lumbered from his arena over three years ago
but now can be found on belt buckles, videos and engraved silver
lids for snuff boxes. He's also around _ in essence _ in about
1,000 vials of semen that are sold each year at $300 each. And he
makes appearances (behind a double fence) at about 25 rodeos a
year. He's to appear on Feb. 9 on the Fox television network's
``Guinness World Records: Primetime'' as the ``meanest, baddest
bull in rodeo.''
</P>
<P>
   RODEO RIDING:
</P>
<P>
   Ty Murray
</P>
<P>
   Inherited title from: Tuff Hedeman, a bull-riding hall-of-famer
who was almost destroyed by _ you guessed it _ Bodacious. Hedeman
had been dubbed Jordan by an admiring public, due to his dominance.
When he retired, he gave Murray, as heir to his crown, the moniker
as well. Murray had previously been known as ``Puddin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: More money and titles than any bull rider in
history, a feat Murray attributes to two Jordanesque traits, ``guts
and endurance.'' Murray also holds seven world titles for best
all-around cowboy, another record, and a testament to his
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   SPELLING BEES:
</P>
<P>
   Jody-Anne Maxwell
</P>
<P>
   Anointed by: Jamaica's Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   M.J. move: Spelled chiaroscurist; defeated 248 competitors at
last May's Scripps-Howard national spelling bee.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: What was Chicago before Jordan? The home of
Al Capone? O'Neil Hamilton, the embassy's director of information,
is hailing Maxwell, 12, as the ``first chance the country has had
to put itself on the map in something academic or intellectual.''
He hopes Maxwell might replace, say, Bob Marley in peoples' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she get a parade when she went home, but in the
United States, where she competed as a candidate sponsored by a
Jamaican stationery company, Maxwell's booked all summer as an
inspirational speaker at youth clubs, the YMCA and the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   SHOW DOGS:
</P>
<P>
   Champion Toledobe's Serenghetti
</P>
<P>
   Jordan with paws: Playing to the crowd and pouring it on when
the stakes are high have earned her the nickname from competitors
and spectators alike, says the Doberman pinscher's handler and
spokesman, Andy Linton. She's considered one to beat at next
month's huge Westminster show. Linton also guarantees a better
vertical leap than anyone wearing No. 23 (Jordan's number with the
Chicago Bulls).
</P>
<P>
   M.J. move: Freebaiting, in which the dog stands stockstill on
her own while a judge inspects her physique, is a specialty. So is
an uncanny ability to put on her game face just as the cameras zoom
in.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSIONAL LACROSSE:
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gait, of the National Lacrosse League's Baltimore Thunder
</P>
<P>
   Anointed by: John Tucker, Thunder head coach, during the
National Lacrosse League finals last year, which Baltimore lost to
the Philadelphia Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to the name: Work ethic, moves and resiliency. With 474
points in 75 career games, Gait (also called Gator) has been his
league's most valuable player four years running and is widely
credited with revolutionizing the sport. Tucker makes the
comparison because Gait ``does things no one else can do, and he's
big when the game's on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   M.J. move: The ``Air Gait,'' created at Syracuse University,
involves leaping from the 18-foot crease around the net and
reaching from behind and over the net and goalie to slam in the
ball for a point.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning in action: Gait's identical twin, Paul, plays forward
the Syracuse Smash and is statistically second banana by a hair's
breadth. The two will meet Feb. 5 in Syracuse, N.Y.

   HOLLYWOOD _ Let's face it. It's hard to live on $10 million or
$20 million a year here.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at all those poor movie stars. Underpaid and
overworked, stars like Bruce and Julia and Harrison and the two
Toms barely earn enough to stay afloat. So who can blame them when
they demand that studios pay their nanny bills while they're making
a movie or hire, in some cases, full-time masseuses,
acupuncturists, nutritionists and yoga instructors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell the latest fad,'' one studio publicist said.
``Whatever the latest fad, that becomes the latest `ask.' Now we're
all holistic. They've got to have candles in the dressing room,
special smells.''
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes are also the latest fad. Life is tough enough for them
without asking them to sit with other first-class passengers in
United's Red Carpet Lounge waiting for their flight to be called.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Sean Penn.
</P>
<P>
   The actor recently insisted on flying on a private jet to
Houston for a screening by director Terrence Malick of his newest
film, ``The Thin Red Line,'' in which Penn is one of the stars.
Executives at 20th Century Fox said the actor had hardly promoted
the film _ ``He gave us two hours after two weeks of negotiation,''
one Fox executive said. Why give him a private plane?
</P>
<P>
   But Penn fought back. After all, he prides himself on being a
working-class kind of actor. He was depicted in a recent article in
The New York Times Magazine as driving around the country in an
Oldsmobile 88, stopping off in small-town motels.
</P>
<P>
   It would be appropriate, then, if Penn flew cabin class, but the
actor has such a hectic schedule, with all that driving, that
there's only one answer. A private jet.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's rejection so upset Penn that he wrote the following
letter, portions of which appeared in Variety last week. He sent it
to an array of Fox and Phoenix Pictures executives as well as his
manager and ``God Almighty,'' who has not been seen in Hollywood
for a long time.

   In my continuing effort to support our shared entity, ``The Thin
Red Line,'' I have yet again run into another of the endless
bureaucratic hurdles that your company relentlessly plants in my
path. As a result of Terry Malick's invitation, I made plans to
join Terry in supporting the film's screening, and ultimately its
profile in Houston. As I have two movies, two children and (as each
woman is at least two people) two wives presently in distribution,
my schedule is rather hectic. I therefore requested that Mr.
Murdoch's gigantic corporation might be so generous (with the money
they've earned exploiting the pain and suffering of myself and my
peers in their tabloids) as to supply me with a private jet to
travel to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The response was a clear NO.
</P>
<P>
   Two things were cited: 1) The $40,000 cost. 2) Policy. As to
number 1, we at my tiny little San Francisco office went ahead and
priced the cost of such a jet ourselves. In fact, it came to
$16,000, which we had offered would be divided by two, as Fine Line
Pictures had already committed to pay half (I would do an interview
on behalf of ``Hurlyburly'' while I was there). Next we priced the
commercial fare somewhere in the area of $2,000. The final cost
differential to Mr. Murdoch's pool-heating expenses A WHOPPING
$6,000 which, against the price cut I offered in my deal to act in
this movie, seemed equivalent to the fair market price of ((a
vulgar reference to Murdoch)). Next comes policy, the number 2
reason cited us in denial of our request. Evidently this is a word
prized by Murdoch's company as I ran into it before when Malick
requested that I be given an opportunity to view a videotape of the
movie prior to his locking the print. I think we all know what a
shameful little dance went on there, with wasted time, wasted money
in the name of a policy. Has anyone at 20th Century Fox considered
that it might not be my policy to do 7-figure favors for
multi-national corporate interests as I did when I took the salary
you paid me on ``The Thin Red Line''?
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line is . . . our policies collide. Good luck with the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. I know you guys don't remember what the inside of a
commercial airline terminal looks like, but if you send me a
picture of your jets, I'll send you a picture of the door at the
Red Carpet Room. Wish I could've been in Houston. It's a beautiful
movie and I'd like to have helped spread the word.

someone with a career.

<P>
   As the global economy spawns more mergers of American and
foreign companies, inequities in the pay of top executives quickly
become apparent. In the spirit of compromise that marks a new
marriage, the lower-paid officers see their pay rise to the levels
of their better-paid colleagues _ almost always the Americans _ and
American-style capitalism claims a little more foreign turf.
</P>
<P>
   The American way of compensating top executives _ with
opportunity for tremendous riches from bonuses and incentives tied
to a rising stock price _ certainly pays better. Some experts view
American-style pay as a vitamin that can jump-start the performance
of sluggish economies abroad. But others see it as a virus that
spreads greed and excess.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of companies are joining the experiment. When
Daimler-Benz announced in May that it would acquire Chrysler Corp.,
Daimler chairman Juergen Schrempp was earning much less than Robert
Eaton, his counterpart at Chrysler, a substantially smaller
company. Last week, Daimler-Benz announced a new system for paying
its top 250 executives: About 25 percent to 30 percent of their
compensation would be fixed and the rest would be in performance
bonuses and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are grappling with the issue. Last year,
Bertelsmann, the German publisher, acquired Random House; Amoco
agreed to a takeover by British Petroleum; Deutsche Bank made a
deal to buy Bankers Trust, and Scottish Power agreed to buy
Pacificorp.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign buyers generally have little choice but to adopt
American ways of compensating all their top executives. Key
executives from each of the merging companies expect to get roughly
the same pay. Chrysler executives, for example, would quickly start
job-hunting around Detroit if they were forced to take a cut.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the richer executive payroll for foreign companies
is the price of entry for joining the U.S. economy, where
Daimler-Benz and others presumably expect to get better returns
than if they had invested elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   These simple economic explanations certainly help foreign
executives deflect suggestions that they may be motivated to merge
with an American partner to help boost their own pay. But many
consultants who advise companies on compensation matters say that
many foreign executives are uneasy about the shift, even though
they may benefit personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is movement, but there is resistance as well,'' said
Robert Freedman, a compensation expert at Towers Perrin, a
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of American-style pay packages for top executives say
they are a big reason the U.S. economy and the stock market have
been so vibrant this decade. Executive pay is high, they typically
concede. But chief executives in the United States, like
professional athletes, generally have short careers. And talented
executives, they argue, can often add so much value to a company
that their outlandish pay, in the grand scheme of things, amounts
to a small tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pay your management with stock-based incentives, they
will be very motivated to do everything they can to get it right,''
said Ira Kay, the head of the global compensation practice at
Watson Wyatt, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   An implicit message in this model, however, is that an honest
day's pay for an honest day's work is not enough to get executives
to do their best; they have to have a gold carrot dangling in front
of them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many companies, in their filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, justify high compensation for top officers
with that argument. For example, McDonald's Corp.'s executive
compensation program, according to a recent filing, ``has been
designed to attract, energize, reward and retain superior talent.''
If the pay packages were any smaller, this language suggests, the
executives would somehow be less energized, and more willing to
bolt for a higher-paying competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Some public companies have tried a different way. Ben &AMP; Jerry's,
the ice cream company, and Herman Miller, a maker of office
furniture, used to say that there should be a limit to the gap
between the highest- and lowest-paid workers (at the ice cream
company, it was 7 times higher back in 1994; at Herman Miller, it
was 20 times higher in 1996). But they have since tossed out these
rules and joined the bidding war for executive talent.
</P>
<P>
   The cult of the American business superstar, which has delivered
hundreds of millions of dollars to professional managers (who, in
some cases, send the tab for personal financial planning advice
back to their company), has historically offended the sensibilities
of people in many foreign countries, where the best and the
brightest pursued careers in fields other than business.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, executive pay has moved further toward
the American system than most other countries. A study of the 20
largest companies in the United States and Britain by William M.
Mercer, a consulting firm, found, among other things, that the base
salaries of the top American executives were 38 percent higher,
bonuses were more than five times higher and the value of their
stock options was incomparably higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of widespread public unease about the levels of
pay in the U.K.,'' said Tony Groom, a principal in Mercer's
executive compensation practice. Business, after all, has not
historically been considered a particularly high calling there.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University, for example, only recently built a business
school, over objections from many quarters that the quest for an
M.B.A. was not a legitimate scholarly pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why executive pay is lower in other
countries. Careers and performance, for example, tend to be
measured over a much longer term than at American companies. Stock
options that last 10 years are called long-term incentives in the
United States; many foreign companies use a decade to measure
short-term goals.
</P>
<P>
   There is also less jockeying for pay raises outside the United
States. James Hatch, a partner at Arthur Andersen, recounts the
story of a U.S. office of a Japanese company, where the American
secretaries and support staff found that their Japanese bosses were
soft touches for tales of personal financial hardship. Pretty soon,
Hatch said, many of the workers were getting salaries two and three
times those of workers in other offices.
</P>
<P>
   On a global scale, the marketplace for executives remains quite
skewed. But even with pay rising for foreign executives, it seems
unlikely that it will catch up to American levels, which are
setting new records every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of closing the gap is laughable,'' said Graef
Crystal, editor of the Crystal Report, a newsletter on executive
compensation. ``When you're 200 laps behind and driving a
supercharged Audi, how do you catch up with an American car with
5,000 horsepower?''

story of a U.S. office of a Japanese company, where the American
secretaries and support staff found that their Japanese bosses were
soft touches for tales of personal financial hardship. Pretty soon,
Hatch said, many of the workers were getting salaries two and three
times those of workers in other offices.
</P>
<P>
   On a global scale, the marketplace for executives remains quite
skewed. But even with pay rising for foreign executives, it seems
unlikely that it will catch up to American levels, which are
setting new records every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of closing the gap is laughable,'' said Graef
Crystal, editor of the Crystal Report, a newsletter on executive
compensation. ``When you're 200 laps behind and driving a
supercharged Audi, how do you catch up with an American car with
5,000 horsepower?''

<P>
   MIAMI _ As he traveled from one end of Cuba to another a year
ago, often with Fidel Castro at his side or sitting attentively in
the audience, Pope John Paul II had one overriding message. In its
most succinct form it was that Cuba ``needs to open herself to the
world, and the world needs to draw closer to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the world has heeded the pontiff's directive, often
using his words as justification; even the United States took a few
modest steps in that direction on Jan. 5, making it somewhat easier
for Americans to send money and food to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Castro and the Cuban Communist Party, on the other hand, have
largely ignored the first half of the papal exhortation.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Castro marked the 40th anniversary of his
seizure of power with a speech in which he defiantly maintained
that ``the revolution has just begun.'' Under him, Cuba's
human-rights record remains dismal. Economic reforms like those
carried out by China are stalled too; this promises only additional
austerity for the average Cuban, and it has made the country less
attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   After the pope's visit, Castro freed more than 300 people held
in Cuban jails, and at the time optimists suggested that the move
might be the start of a relaxation. But as is so often the case
when Castro is involved, there was less to the action than met the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those released were common criminals, not political
prisoners. And many, human rights groups say, were freed on
condition they leave Cuba, a procedure the authorities often apply
against dissidents after a spell in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, 18 months after they were arrested on charges of
sedition, Cuba's most prominent political prisoners remain in jail,
still awaiting trial and refused habeas corpus. Felix Bonne, Rene
Gomez Manzano, Vladimiro Roca and Marta Beatriz Roque, leaders of
the Internal Dissidence Working Group, were jailed after publishing
a document titled ``The Homeland Belongs to Us All,'' in which they
urged Castro and the Communist Party to allow ``an independent and
impartial legal system that would protect the liberties and rights
of the individual and the practice of political pluralism.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, who were released after having been held on trumped-up
charges, could face jail again, since Cuba's legal system continues
to lack even the most elemental guarantees of due process and no
effort is being made to provide such protections. Hector Palacios
Ruiz, for instance, had been imprisoned for possessing ``enemy
propaganda.'' His crime was to attempt to distribute copies of a
declaration Castro signed at a Latin American summit meeting,
promising steps toward full representative democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see any will, sign or political gesture showing that
the Cuban authorities are willing to move forward to make some
serious progress,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of
Human Rights Watch in the Americas. ``The harassment against
dissidents, human rights activists or anyone else attempting to
exercise the most basic rights of association and expression
continues exactly the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the area of religious freedom, where some progress has
taken place, significant restrictions remain. Castro's decision to
allow the celebration of Christmas was treated by the
state-controlled press as an act of revolutionary generosity. But
such gains for religion result from case-by-case negotiations, not
a blanket recognition of a right to worship freely. Parish priests
find many local authorities still unwilling to allow processions on
the feast days of saints.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the government offered much latitude for the incipient
private sector that the Clinton administration said its new
measures are intended to help. In 1996, more than 200,000 people
were officially listed as ``self-employed,'' and government
officials were suggesting that hundreds of thousands more would be
encouraged to take that course.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, though, the number of people working for themselves
with the official approval of the government has declined
substantially, perhaps by nearly a quarter, and some occupations
that were formerly approved for free enterprise have now been
proscribed. Confiscatory tax policies have been used to drive out
of business many of those who were beginning to compete with the
state, like owners of small private restaurants called paladares.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've let everything play out, but they have not added any
new openings,'' said Philip Peters, author of ``Islands of
Enterprise,'' a study of the Cuban private sector. ``Certainly,
there is no interest in letting it expand, at least not
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The obsession with control helps explain the strongly negative
reaction to the Clinton administration's limited initiative. Jose
Luis Rodriguez, the minister of the economy, initially dismissed
the moves as ``crumbs,'' as if to deny their significance.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricardo Alarcon, head of the rubber-stamp parliament and
Castro's favorite mouthpiece on relations with the United States,
later described the measures as a ``subversive and
counterrevolutionary'' attempt to destabilize the Cuban government
by going around it _ ``a way of manufacturing traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the oration Castro delivered in Santiago on Jan. 1 to
mark his 40 years in power, Cubans have no choice but to look
forward to more of the same. Of Cuba's 11 million people, 7 million
have been born since 1959, Castro proudly pointed out in the
speech. But they are led, as he also noted, by someone ``who
dresses the same, who thinks the same, who dreams the same'' today
as he did when he came down from the Sierra Maestra.''

SPORTS COLUMN: SO WHAT'S A RETIRED ROLE MODEL TO DO?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At his news conference Wednesday announcing his retirement from
basketball, Michael Jordan was asked if he might now try to help
``solve some of the world's problems.'' Quite a question with which
to confront a basketball player, but then Michael Jordan's persona,
like few others, transcends the hemispheres.
</P>
<P>
   He had said that he still has television commercials to perform
in, golf to play and three children to help bring up. Besides, he
added, ``I can't solve the world's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but he might be able to make a contribution, of the kind
he has consistently avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has been exceedingly cautious as to where he places his
name. As a player, this might have been enough for him to retain
the image he so assiduously constructed for himself. While the
phrase, ``role model,'' has been overworked and distorted sometimes
beyond recognition and credulity, Jordan was exemplary in a variety
of ways: he was the best of employees, a good teammate, a dream to
coach, courteous to fans.
</P>
<P>
   He was conscious about looking neat off the court, and, except
for a few times playing poker with questionable characters and
inadvisably going to the gaming tables in Atlantic City the night
before a playoff game in New York, Jordan's image remained squeaky
clean. He has aligned himself to some charities, and he has made
some significant financial contributions _ he gave $1 million, for
example, to his alma mater, North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is said to be worth $500 million. He has built this
fortune through salaries, but more from endorsing commercial
products and business interests. If Jordan would simply get 5
percent bank interest on his $500 million he would have to live on
$25 million a year. So it may be safe to say that he doesn't need
to do another Tweety Bird commercial the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   What he can do is take stands, when the situation requires. If
he isn't playing basketball, he should have enough time to read up
on issues. And there are few people in the world who might have the
influence Jordan does.
</P>
<P>
   The Nike debacle tarnished his image. When it was learned that
the shoe company he hyped mistreated employees in Southeast Asia,
Jordan said in effect that it wasn't any of his business. When that
didn't go over too well, he made overtures about visiting the
factories, but never found the time.
</P>
<P>
   After his father was shot to death in an act of random violence,
he might have said something publicly about the use of handguns in
the wrong hands. He chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   Always, he was fearful of tainting his image. Maybe now, that he
has terminated playing a game that little boys play, perhaps he
will put away childish things.
</P>
<P>
   It may be unfair to expect Jordan to be someone like Muhammad
Ali, who is not only on a religious crusade but who has also given
himself to being an international man of good will. As it happens,
though, Jordan does have the global stature of Ali.
</P>
<P>
   And it may be unfair to ask Jordan to be Jackie Robinson, who,
after his retirement from baseball, remained a powerful force in
politics and business in seeking fairer treatment for blacks. Nor
does Jordan have to be Jim Brown, who in the last several decades
has devoted much of his life to inner-city youth.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he have to be Arthur Ashe, who was a national and
global presence for equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think that every black athlete or entertainer has an
obligation to thrust himself or herself into positions of
leadership,'' Ashe wrote in ``Days of Grace,'' his posthumously
published autobiography. ``However, our situation is increasingly
desperate, and I admire those athletes, and entertainers who
consciously try to give something back to people, if only by
exemplary behavior. I admire former stars such as Julius Erving in
basketball, or Lynn Swann in football, for what they have made of
themselves. I am less happy with the demureness of someone like
Michael Jordan, who is as popular as he is rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I defend Jordan's right to stay out of politics in
general, I think he made a mistake in declining to give any open
support to Harvey Gantt, the respected black politician who ran for
the U.S. Senate in 1990 from Jordan's home state of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the main point is not that Gantt and Jordan are both
black; rather, it is that Gantt's opponent, Jesse Helms, has a long
history of supporting segregation, and the contest was close. For
blacks across the America, that Senate contest was the most
important in decades. Instead, Jordan stuck to his apolitical
position. `I don't really know Gantt,' he said, in response to
criticism of his silence. `Well, Michael,' I would have told him,
`pick up the telephone and call him!'
</P>
<P>
   ``A few appearances with Gantt might well have made the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing more faint-hearted than not taking a stand on an
issue you believe in is not believing in anything beyond the purely
personal.
</P>
<P>
   It would be terrible to contemplate that beneath Michael
Jordan's magnificent basketball exterior is, by choice, nothing but
a basketball interior.

THE POWER OF GOD, THE BEAUTY OF HUMILITY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. _ Randall Cunningham is talking about the
power of God in his life, about the peacefulness he feels and about
the beauty of humility. The setting could be a pulpit instead of
the Minnesota Vikings' weight room. He is speaking so softly that
20 reporters lean closer to hear him. It is obviously worth
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cunningham expounded on conquering the Atlanta Falcons in
the National Football Conference championship game on Sunday, and
before he raved about how exhilarating it is to throw bombs to
Randy Moss, he talked about the excitement he feels to simply be
playing football while feeling so righteous about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of peace inside of me now because of what God
is doing for me and the power and grace that he has brought down on
me,'' Cunningham said. ``I'm happy that I'm standing here. I'm not
thinking that I've got to hurry up and get this interview done. I
appreciate each moment.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been so much for Cunningham to appreciate in a season
when he began as a backup for the second year and elevated himself
to the best quarterback in the National Football League. How did
Cunningham get here? Where had he been? Why is he successful again?
It is a story of resentment and retirement, retribution and
rejuvenation, and Cunningham is soaking up each second like a
35-year-old who has seen the light. That is because Cunningham has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate every grace that God has given me,'' he said.
``To be able to do this with this group of guys and this team means
a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And Cunningham's ascension means everything to the Vikings
(16-1), a team that feels empowered with its empowered quarterback
in charge of a dazzling offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Randall about this,'' said Dennis Green,
Minnesota's head coach. ``Randall Cunningham is a winner. He wants
to be a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Brad Johnson fractured his right leg in the second game of
the season, Cunningham figured he would be a backup again. But
after Johnson went down against St. Louis, Cunningham came in to
throw the game-winning touchdown pass in a 38-31 victory and never
gave the job back. Instead, he developed into the leader on an
offense that set a league record with 556 points. Cunningham threw
for 34 touchdowns, was intercepted just 10 times and had a
quarterback rating of 106, a Viking record and the best in the
league. ``What Randall has done,'' said Vikings receiver Cris
Carter, ``is phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Billick, the savvy offensive coordinator who had to
truncate the Minnesota offense when Cunningham replaced the injured
Johnson for five games last season, now watches the rangy
quarterback with the powerful arm thrive in the system in series
after splendid series. There were doubts about whether Cunningham,
too selfish and immature when he was with the Philadelphia Eagles,
could succeed in Minnesota's demanding scheme.
</P>
<P>
   But they vanished as Cunningham, who never had to dissect
defenses as much and never had weapons like Moss, Carter and
company in Philadelphia, stayed in the pocket longer, looked for
secondary receivers and learned how to be a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Randall is one of the great stories in sports in a
year that has had some great stories,'' Billick said. ``You talk
about a guy that has gone through what he's gone through, the
transformation that he's gone through and to be able to come in and
be the catalyst for the team the way he has, it's a great story.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is, but it was not so great for Cunningham when he left
Philadelphia feeling bitter and unwanted after 11 roller-coaster
seasons. He discovered he really was unwanted when no one signed
him for the 1996 season. So Cunningham retired and started a marble
company in Las Vegas. Even though Cunningham owned Custom Marble
and Granite Accessories, he worked with the laborers each day and
found out what life was like off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all humility,'' said Cunningham, who signed with the
Vikings in 1997. ``I don't think I had a huge ego, but I think I
was a certain way with my life. I learned a lot about myself. To
get down with guys and bang tile and grind counter tops and your
eyes are burning and your back hurts, it made me realize it was a
whole lot tougher out there. It showed me another side. It humbled
me.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his company ever made gravestones, Cunningham
said, ``I didn't deal in any, but I've kind of been resurrected.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Cunningham talks about the post-season as if he is
talking about the birth of a child. Two years removed from being a
tile man, Cunningham is two victories away from steering the
Vikings to a Super Bowl title. It is an improbable story, one that
Cunningham is cherishing, moment by moment, and discussing,
syllable by syllable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has sunk in to a certain extent, but I don't want it to
sink all the way in,'' said Cunningham. ``If you let it sink all
the way in and say, `That was great,' then I think you can begin to
take things for granted. That's the way I'm approaching it.''

BRAZIL'S AUTOWORKERS, ONCE THE WORKING-CLASS ELITE, NOW REELING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, Brazil _ For 22 years and four months,
Luiz Porfirio Diniz reported daily to the bustling Ford do Brasil
automotive plant here, where three different car models are
manufactured. But then, just before Christmas, he got the bad news
he had been fearing ever since Brazilian interest rates shot to
nearly 50 percent four months ago: He was one of 2,800
assembly-line workers being laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Employees took over the plant on Jan. 5 to protest that move, so
Diniz still spends his day on the plant floor, playing dominos with
his fellow workers. The stoppage means that Ford is no longer
producing its daily quota of 1,000 cars, but the company has not
moved against the workers _ perhaps because car sales are declining
so dramatically in Brazil that Ford has the equivalent of nearly
two months of production stockpiled in storage areas here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to work, so all they have to do is give us the
word,'' said Valdecir Aparecido de Souza, another laid-off worker.
``But if nobody is spending any money, management is not going to
take us back, and we're not going to be able to find jobs anywhere
else. It's a real mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis that has shaken Brazil in recent months,
culminating last week in a 21 percent devaluation of the country's
currency, the real, is first and foremost a threat to workers and
their families. But for that very reason, it also represents a
growing danger for the hundreds of multinational companies that
have flocked to Brazil and invested billions of dollars in recent
years, lured by a market of 165 million people that seemed to be
enjoying sustained growth and stable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Though all of Brazil is now reeling, the once-flourishing
automobile industry centered here in the industrial suburbs south
of Sao Paulo, which produced as many as 2 million vehicles a year
at its peak, was hit early and particularly hard. Car sales in
Brazil, the world's seventh-largest auto market, slumped 27.5
percent last year, falling from 1.64 million to 1.19 million, with
Ford registering an even larger decline, 33.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   James Cain, a Ford spokesman in Detroit, said the elimination of
a shift at the factory here and the resulting layoffs were driven
by the conclusion that ``we did not believe there would be any
substantive improvement in the market in 1999.'' The company lost
money in Brazil in 1998, Cain said, and it indicated to Wall Street
analysts at a briefing on Jan. 7, even before the major devaluation
announced Friday, that it was unlikely to earn a profit in Brazil
this year either.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's top automaker, Volkswagen, is also suffering from a
sharp decline in demand, but last month negotiated an agreement
with its workers here to reduce pay by 15 percent rather than cut
jobs. On Friday, General Motors do Brasil reached a similar accord,
laying off 1,000 of its 8,700 workers for five months but
continuing to pay them 80 percent of their normal salaries.
</P>
<P>
   For Brazil's 275,000 autoworkers, once considered the elite of
the working class, that means hard times after years of hard-won
improvements in their standard of living. ``Yesterday, I was
dreaming,'' reads the bumper sticker on a car parked outside the
Ford factory here. ``Today I can't even sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Diniz, who is 44, married and has two children, is a typical
example. Born in the arid interior of the impoverished northeastern
state of Paraiba, he, like millions of other northeasterners hoping
for a better life, came to Sao Paulo as a teen-ager, and by working
hard and scrimping and saving, managed to buy his own house and
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Ford and think of it as family,'' he said as he and a
group of other workers congregated at the Bar do Pascual, just
outside the plant's main gate here. ``I grew up with this company,
so being in this situation is enough to make me cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent years had been especially good, he and other workers
said. The government's Real Plan, announced in 1994, tied the value
of Brazil's currency to the dollar, forcing a level of fiscal
discipline that quickly reduced inflation from more than 1,000
percent a year in the early 1990s to single digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing down inflation made it easier for people like us to
buy food, clothing and appliances,'' said Adailton Coelho dos
Santos, 55, who works on the same line as Diniz and also emigrated
from the northeast. ``For the first time in our lives, we were able
to figure out what our money was worth.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, millions of Brazilians could finally afford to buy
televisions, refrigerators, furniture and other consumer goods,
secure in the knowledge that their monthly payments would not
outstrip their wages. But measures taken by the government over the
past six months, especially the dramatic interest rate hike, have
driven the Brazilian economy into recession and forced consumers to
economize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of members who can no longer meet their rent or
mortgage payments, let alone think about buying appliances,'' said
Luiz Marinho, president of the metalworkers union of Sao Bernardo,
which represents the autoworkers here. ``We have guys who have had
to postpone their weddings because they don't have a cent to spend
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For American companies, the belt-tightening by working-class
Brazilians like those here is nothing but bad news. Brazil is the
United States' 15th-largest trading partner, and in recent years it
has been one of the fastest-growing markets for American-made
goods, ranging from equipment for heavy industry to potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   American banks also have a heavy exposure here. As of the middle
of 1998, they had about $16.7 billion in loans and other assets
outstanding in Brazil, with Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Bank and
BankAmerica each reporting more than $3 billion in assets here.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is especially alarming for the estimated 2,000
American businesses that are operating in Brazil, which has Latin
America's largest economy. American concerns have more than $27
billion invested here, giving them a higher profile here than in
other troubled areas like Russia or Southeast Asia, and weak
results this year, now expected to be the general rule as a result
of last week's economic turmoil, could affect their profit
statements back home.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the major car companies, for instance, Whirlpool
and General Electric manufacture appliances such as refrigerators,
stoves and microwave ovens. Companies like Johnson &AMP; Johnson and
Procter &AMP; Gamble make a wide variety of toiletries and cosmetics,
including soaps, shampoos and detergents.
</P>
<P>
   At their factories north of Sao Paulo, Motorola, Lucent,
Qualcomm and other companies turn out telecommunications equipment
such as cellular phones, whose availability has increased
dramatically as the result of the privatization of Brazil's
telephone system last year. With the market for computers here
having grown by as much as 30 percent a year recently, computer
makers such as Compaq and Dell have also installed themselves at
sites in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden and dramatic downturn here raises the question of
whether American, European and Japanese companies that have flocked
here in recent years may now have too much manufacturing capacity
installed in Brazil. Or as Pedro Reis Correa, a 39-year-old
assembly line worker, put it: ``If all of us are unemployed, who is
going to buy the products these companies make?''
</P>
<P>
   For Christmas, in fact, Correa, who earns a salary of about
$1,000 a month, had planned to buy a computer, mostly for use by
his two children, ages 8 and 11. He had even obtained a bargain
price through a nephew who works for a computer manufacturer and
saved up the down payment that would have allowed him to buy the
$1,600 machine on an installment plan.
</P>
<P>
   But when he received the layoff notice, he had to tell the
children that ``this is going to have to wait for some other
time,'' he recalled sorrowfully. ``I am trying to cut expenses as
much as I can, and that means no more car trips to the interior on
weekend or movies or candy bars for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Carlos Santos knows only too well the effects of
decisions like that. For the past four years, he has parked every
day outside the entrance to the Ford plant here, and from the back
of his beat-up station wagon, sold items such as kitchen knives,
watches, videocassettes and toys to the workers, with gross sales
of about $1,300 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sales are down 50 percent in the past month, so of course I
am very worried,'' he said on Friday morning, as a constant drizzle
added to his woes by driving his few potential customers indoors.
``If the money of the workers here dries up, then people like me
are going to go bust. This situation affects everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Santos said, his family too has begun economizing,
anticipating that the situation is going to get worse before it
begins to improve. ``We're eating less meat and more rice and
beans, buying cheaper brands of shampoo and soap and cutting back
on our consumption of soft drinks, doing everything we can to save
a penny here and there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is not what companies like Coca-Cola or Nabisco, which
derives about 17 percent of its worldwide sales from Brazil, want
to hear. Brazil is Coke's second-largest overseas market,
accounting for about 5 percent of the beverage giant's worldwide
profits.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1995, Coke's sales in Brazil expanded by a
spectacular 34 percent. But growth was estimated at only 1 percent
for last year, and with people like Santos and his family
determined to drink less, the most optimistic projection for this
year is flat sales.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the money Coca-Cola takes in here is earned in the
now drastically devalued local currency. ``They're not hedged on
the real,'' explained Emmanuel Goldman, a global consumer products
analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``Whatever happens to the real, happens
to Coke's earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how Friday's decision by the Brazilian
government to allow the real to float freely against the dollar
will affect other companies. In theory, the long-urged devaluation
of the real should make Brazilian exports cheaper across the board
and therefore more attractive than those of its competitors, while
also encouraging investment by making Brazilian companies available
at bargain prices to foreign purchasers who may be attracted to the
market.
</P>
<P>
   But economists have expressed concerns that the devaluation of
the real could set off a chain reaction across Latin America and
the rest of the developing world, with country after country trying
to gain a competitive advantage by lowering the value of its
currency. In addition, the price of the components, raw materials
and finished goods that Brazil buys will now go up, fueling
inflation here and cutting consumer purchasing power further.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, thousands of Brazilians who purchased cars on an
installment plan opted for financing terms that peg their monthly
payments to the exchange rate between the dollar and the real. Not
only will they now have to pay substantially more each month or try
to sell their vehicle before it is repossessed, but the devaluation
is expected to drive many potential buyers out of the market
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the population is frightened and stops consuming, things
can only get worse,'' Marinho said. ``That's what we are
confronting right now, a moment that threatens to erase all of the
gains we have made.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ At first glance, it is hard to tell a baby is there.
</P>
<P>
   Then the clues come from following the tubes that blow air into
the baby's tiny nostrils. Another tube carries nutrients into a
vein. The boy has black hair. He is barely a foot long. He is
curled up on a pillow and strapped in a cloth bumper, dotted with
hearts, to keep his arms and legs in the same flexed position they
were in in the womb. As he sleeps beneath a radiant warmer in the
dark and quiet room, machines track his skin temperature, heart
rate, blood pressure, oxygen level and other vital measurements.
Two Beanie Babies lie nearby. One toy serves an extra function: the
Beanie's weight holds the air tubes in place.
</P>
<P>
   Above, a cardboard sign identifies him as Baby F, or Ikem. At 1
pound 7 ounces, he is the smallest of the seven surviving octuplets
born here last month. The strongest and largest, at 2 pounds 10
ounces, is his only brother, Jioke. He rests in a similar warmer in
the same room. The five surviving sisters are in nearby rooms. The
babies are turned from time to time. As a nurse starts the task,
she playfully offers a finger, and the baby's hand grasps it.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving octuplets look and sound like babies, just
miniature ones. Sometimes they open their eyes and look around.
When bothered, they cry.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the eight babies, Ebuka, a girl, was born on Dec.
8, nearly four months earlier than the mother's due date of April
1. The mother, Nkem Chukwu had been treated at the MacGregor
Fertility Clinic in Houston and because of religious beliefs had
rejected the idea of destroying any of the fetuses to give the
others a greater chance of survival. The seven others were born on
Dec. 20, making them the world's first set of octuplets to be born
alive. The largest weighed less than 2 pounds. The smallest, a girl
named Odera, weighed 10.3 ounces and died on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The births made the octuplets an immediate sensation in the news
and renewed the debate about fertility drugs and their enormous
medical and human costs, but here in the neonatal intensive care
unit on the fourth floor of Texas Children's Hospital, the glare of
world attention fades away next to the blip of the infant monitors.
Now, although two babies remain under a pound and a half, all are
gaining weight, ounce by ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chukwu, 27, has visited regularly since her discharge from
the hospital on Dec. 30. When she can hold one of the infants, she
sits in a chair, unbuttons her blouse and touches the baby against
her chest. She does not try to nurse them; the babies cannot yet
suck and swallow well enough. It takes about 20 minutes for the
nurses, who must keep the tubes and wires connected, to get a baby
into her arms.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Iyke Louis Udobi, a respiratory therapist, also
visits and touches the infants. The parents, American citizens born
in Nigeria, gave the babies Nigerian names based on the
characteristics of God.
</P>
<P>
   The babies have a 95 percent chance of surviving to their
expected discharge in late March, said Dr. Leonard E. Weisman, the
head of the neonatal unit. As he led a visiting doctor through the
unit, Weisman said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' that the
babies, all listed in critical condition, would turn out normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a 10 percent or so risk of some long-term
problems, but I hope we are not going to see anything like
blindness, deafness, mental retardation or severe cerebral palsy,''
Weisman said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his 25-year experience as a pediatrician, Weisman
added: ``You learn in this business that things can turn on a
dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisman based his prediction on his study of 1,925 premature
infants the Texas Children's Hospital treated from 1986 through
1994, and reported last June in Pediatrics, a scientific journal.
Texas Children's describes itself as the largest pediatric hospital
in the United States. Of the hospital's 456 beds, 120 are for those
needing the most intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patti M. Savrick, the pediatrician who will care for the
babies after their discharge, said: ``By the time they are 2 to 3
years old, they are going to be good, normal kids, barring any
unforeseen disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Savrick said her optimism was based in part on an ultrasound
test of each baby's head that was performed about a week after
their birth. The test is a strong predictor of serious neurological
problems. When no baby showed evidence of bleeding or cysts, ``that
was dramatically good news,'' Dr. Savrick said. Her practice
includes five surviving sextuplets, two sets of quadruplets and
many sets of triplets and twins.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman credited a drug, surfactant, that supplies a missing
component to premature infants with underdeveloped lungs, as
``certainly the No. 1 reason that these kids are doing as well as
they are.'' Surfactant, which was first marketed in 1990, was given
in the first day of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Two octuplets have had general anesthesia for surgery. Eboka had
heart surgery as a 3-day-old to close a blood vessel (patent ductus
arteriosus) in her heart that failed to do so on its own. The other
was to repair a hole in Gorom's small intestine that was recognized
when her belly swelled and an X-ray showed air present where it was
not supposed to be. Both operations were performed at the bedside,
as is often the case for premature infants.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven surviving octuplets, six had good scores on the
10-point Apgar scale of a newborn's health, 8s or 9s at five
minutes; Gorom was rated at 6.
</P>
<P>
   All received antibiotics for the first two days after birth
because the doctors did not know whether an infection caused the
mother to go into labor. Two babies developed infections later.
</P>
<P>
   All are fed intravenously. In addition, the mother brings in
breast milk to the hospital. For now, the milk is given through a
tube into the stomach of each infant. In about a month the babies
will start feeding by mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, all the babies breathed with the aid of mechanical
ventilators. Now the surviving octuplets breathe on their own. A
pump blows air through the tubing to help keep their chest walls
from collapsing. The babies also receive caffeine to prevent apnea
and stimulate their breathing. As the babies grow and strengthen
their underdeveloped chest muscles in the next few weeks, the air
tubes will be removed.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a month, Dr. David K. Coats, a pediatric
ophthalmologist, will start dilating the infants' eyes each week or
two to check for a potentially blinding condition, retinopathy of
prematurity.
</P>
<P>
   A mild form of the condition develops in most premature babies.
But in about 9 percent it is severe enough to require treatment
with either a laser or freezing technique. The aim is to prevent
detachment of the retina. But treatment fails in about 10 percent
of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Some premature babies who do not develop the retinopathy
condition later develop weak eye muscles as young children.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors also will test the babies' hearing by putting sounds
in their ears and then measuring brain wave responses in a
technique known as brain stem auditory evoked response. The risk of
deafness and severe hearing problems is about 4 percent, Weisman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheezing from a chronic lung disease resembling asthma is among
the babies' other potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the octuplets' problems, like immature lungs, a
perforated intestine and the heart vessel condition, are those
faced by any premature infant. Some problems were compounded by
their numbers. Multiple fetuses create a crowded womb, which
increases the risk of growth retardation. Multiple fetuses also
increase the likelihood that the babies will be born prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman estimated the total cost for the octuplets at about $2
million. It will be covered by the health insurance that the father
receives through his work as a respiratory therapist for a local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the costs are almost irrelevant. ``The expense, as
large as it is,'' Weisman said, ``has to be measured over the
babies' lifetimes.''

   WASHINGTON _ Whether they want to see President Clinton driven
from office or whether they have completely tuned out the Senate
impeachment trial, Americans, on the first anniversary of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, do agree on one thing: They want it to be
over.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell has called the
matter ``the most investigated sexual relationship in all of human
history.'' But when the end will come for the investigation of
Clinton's liaison with the former White House intern depends on the
definition of end.
</P>
<P>
   The dissection of the Lewinsky affair will continue at least as
long as the Senate trial grinds on _ no one is sure how long that
will be _ and probably a lot longer.
</P>
<P>
   There are three criminal cases pending involving peripheral
figures in the Clinton scandals: Webster Hubbell, Susan McDougal
and Julie Hiatt Steele. Three more investigative bodies are looking
into aspects of the Lewinsky case. And even that is not necessarily
the end. If Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr believes anyone lied
during the Senate trial, he could seek more indictments.
</P>
<P>
   All this from what began nearly five years ago as an inquiry
into Clinton's involvement in a real-estate deal in 1978, the year
Clinton was first elected governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that a majority of voters want censure and a quick
end to the proceedings. More than 60 percent of voters in most
recent polls oppose removing the President from office. Most of
all, they are tired of the Lewinsky issue and want Congress to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent CNN/USA Today poll, voters ranked the impeachment
trial 10th in a list of issues to which Congress should give
priority in 1999, with only 16 percent citing it as an important
concern.
</P>
<P>
   The likeliest outcome of the unpredictable Senate trial is still
that the president will not be forced from office, but will face
some form of censure.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his staff are watching the trial closely. If, as part
of a censure deal, the president admits that he lied under oath _
something White House advisers say is unlikely _ he could be
criminally prosecuted for perjury. Although indictment of Clinton
has been considered unlikely until after he leaves office, one of
Starr's legal advisers, law professor Ronald Rotunda, believes that
nothing in the Constitution bars the indictment of a sitting
president.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for the Independent Counsel's
Office, would not comment on any indictment speculation, including
a report in December by CBS that Starr had not ruled out a deal
that would free the president of future criminal liability if,
during censure negotiations, he admitted perjury. The report was
attributed to anonymous friends of the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, during a breakfast with reporters at a Washington
hotel, Bakaly said he expected the Independent Counsel's Office to
be in business for two more years. Now he says he has given up
predicting when the office will finish its business.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the investigation has a life of its own. The only
person who could remove Starr is Attorney General Janet Reno, and
that is all but unthinkable, for political reasons. And even if she
did remove him _ or if he resigned _ the work of the office would
continue until all trials and appeals were completed and final
reports written on all matters under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The office is seeking to conclude the investigative phase and
matters it was assigned to by the special division as quickly as
possible, and then complete any prosecutions that arise from
that,'' Bakaly said last week.
</P>
<P>
   While Starr has stayed offstage since his marathon testimony
before the House Judiciary Committee in November, he has hardly
vanished from the scene. And the president is not the only one
still in Starr's line of sight. If the Senate calls witnesses,
Starr's staff will review their testimony to see if it square with
what they told his grand jury. And if witnesses veer too far from
what they told the grand jury last year, they, too, could face
perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who became a cooperating witness for Starr's
office, could find her immunity agreement revoked if she is called
before the Senate and tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 7, the opening day of the president's impeachment trial,
Starr's office sent out a stark reminder that it is still up and
running by indicting Ms. Steele, one of the peripheral figures in
the Lewinsky investigation. Ms. Steele's prosecution will provide
yet another occasion for the president's sexual conduct to be
deconstructed.

</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ms. Steele is to be arraigned in federal court in
Alexandria, Va., on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice
arising from the Kathleen Willey tentacle of the Lewinsky
investigation. This tentacle sprouted when Starr began
investigating whether Clinton was truthful about his relationship
with Ms. Willey, a former White House volunteer who says the
president groped her, and whether there had been unlawful attempts
to influence her testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
case. Ms. Steele, a confidante of Ms. Willey, has said Ms. Willey
asked her to falsely confirm her allegations about the White House
grope. Ms. Steele's lawyer said the charges against her were
politically timed and without merit.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said the case against Ms. Steele was filed when it was
ready and the timing had nothing to do with the beginning of
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the trial of Ms. McDougal, scheduled to begin
March 8 in Little Rock. A former Arkansas business associate of
Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ms. McDougal faces
charges of criminal contempt for refusing to answer Starr's
questions about the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, the former associate attorney general who was indicted
for a third time by Starr last year, is to be tried on fraud and
false statement charges in June in Washington. Meanwhile, Starr is
awaiting a decision on his appeal of a tax case against Hubbell
that was dismissed by the trial judge.
</P>
<P>
   These cases could provide problems for Clinton, especially in
the unlikely event that either Ms. McDougal or Hubbell decides to
cooperate with Starr. Ms. McDougal has loudly accused Starr's
office of mistreating her and has said she knows of no criminal
conduct by the Clintons. And Hubbell warned that Starr's
prosecutors ``can indict my dog, they can indict my cat, but I'm
not going to lie about the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Still underway is an inquiry ordered last fall by Norma Holloway
Johnson, a federal judge in Washington, into whether Starr
improperly leaked confidential information about his investigation
to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two open investigations involving Linda Tripp,
Ms. Lewinsky's former friend whose taping of their telephone
conversations set off the inquiry a year ago. A Maryland prosecutor
is looking into whether she violated that state's wiretapping law,
and Starr's office is examining her tape recordings to determine
whether any were doctored.
</P>
<P>
   And administrative business remains, including the writing of
final reports on other lines of Starr's investigations of the
Clintons: the Whitewater real estate deal, which was his original
mandate, the firings of the White House travel staff and the White
House's improper gathering of FBI files. In those matters, Starr
told the House Judiciary Committee, he did not find evidence of
impeachable offenses or criminal wrongdoing by Clinton. Finally,
Bakaly added, it will take time to close down the Independent
Counsel's Office, which has been investigating the president for
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are all the appeals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA DE AGUAN, Honduras _ Mirtha Martinez Arriola returned
to her home on a recent Sunday and wept when she saw her husband's
hat floating in brackish water beneath the roofless frame house
where they once lived.
</P>
<P>
   She wept not for the things they had lost, not for the years
they had worked to build their home and found a family, but for him
and for three of her children, who were all swept out to sea in
October and drowned in the worst hurricane of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to go far from here, to forget all this,'' she
said. ``Somewhere where there is a future.''
</P>
<P>
   Around her lay the detritus of broken houses and derailed lives,
left there by the wrath of Hurricane Mitch. Half of this coastal
village of 6,000 people _ more than 80 houses _ was swept out to
sea or submerged under the engorged River Aguan during three days
of floods, gales and rain so hard it felt like a thousand whips.
Forty-one people perished in a desperate attempt to reach higher
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Where once there was a road into the village, there is now only
a wide expanse of dirt-brown water, with the wreckage of two school
buses peeking from the waves. The grade school and high school have
been wrecked, along with the bus station, the library and several
businesses. Dozens of houses not swallowed up entirely by the sea
have been reduced to piles of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The storm even changed this sleepy village's geography. More
than 200 yards of land disappeared under the relentless pounding of
the surf. The narrow river that once ran through the village has
been moved a quarter of a mile from its original course and has
expanded to four times its normal size. Part of the community has
been turned into an sad island of devastated homes.
</P>
<P>
   More than two months after the hurricane struck, little has
improved. Power and phone lines are still lying on the ground.
There is no potable water. Many children are sick with diarrhea and
unexplained fevers. Although some shipments of food and medicine
have been ferried in by charities and the government, two large
containers of aid from a New York City group are being held up in
port by customs officials.
</P>
<P>
   And though it was always remote and impoverished, the village is
more isolated than ever. To reach Santa Rosa, one must travel more
than two miles on a dirt road, cross a swollen river in a canoe
where there was once a ford, then travel 11 more miles to the edge
of the village, where a canoe or launch can carry the traveler to
the town's center a mile across the water on the other side of the
Aguan River.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1887, Santa Rosa de Aguan has never had much
political influence in the capital, Tegucigalpa. Only in the last
few years was electricity brought in, and requests for a paved road
and a bridge to link the town to the outside world have been bogged
down for decades.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is cultural. Like many coastal communities in
Honduras, the village is dominated by the Garifuni, descendants of
slaves and Carib Indians from the island of St. Vincent who were
exiled to Central America in 1795 after a revolt there. The
Garifuni, of African descent, have never wielded as much political
power as lighter-skinned Hondurans of Spanish and Indian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people appear to be still in shock from the
hurricane. Like shipwrecked sailors, some spend their days
scavaging wood from the wreckage to build temporary shelters.
Others who lost family members have fled to live with other
relatives in nearby towns like Trujillo and La Ceiba, unable to
bear the place any longer. But most of the villagers were born here
and say they want to rebuild their small town.
</P>
<P>
   One is Robert Blanco, who spent 23 years working on tracks for
the Metro North railroad in New York before returning four years
ago to retire on a pension. Blanco's house is under the river,
along with all his belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people say they are going away, and others say they
will rebuild in a different spot,'' he said. ``I'm going to build
me a little house over here because I don't want to leave the
place. I was born and raised here.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say they would leave if they could, but they have nowhere
to go. Ms. Martinez Arriola's mother, Hilda Arriola Arouz, runs a
soda shop and outdoor restaurant on the side of town that was
largely swept away by the river. She used to live with her youngest
daughter, Nori Esperanza, but the 32-year-old woman has lost her
composure completely and can no longer bear to be in the village.
She becomes hysterical each time she returns, Mrs. Arriola Arouz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arriola Arouz is 67, and a widow. So many people have
abandoned the village there is no business for her restaurant. Her
son-in-law and four grandchildren are dead. Her surviving daughters
are both having trouble coping with the tragedy. The twisted roof
of her house lets in the rain now and she has no way to fix it. The
house seems dark and empty to her, bereft of children, who are the
light of the world, she says. Although she puts on a brave face,
she too says it is hard to confront each new day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most days I pass in sadness,'' she said, ``because all the
grandchildren that I lost lived most of the time in my house. Now
I'm sad and there is nothing but this sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Heartache: Sad Songs Are Sung For a Lost Family &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For many people here, the grieving appears to have just begun.
Some seem still in a state of denial. It is a measure of their
reluctance to talk about what happened that no Mass has been yet
been held for the victims of the storm, and though the municipal
authorities are supposedly planning one, no date has been set.
Still, the families have begun to grieve in private ways.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent night, Mrs. Arriola Arouz, her mother and a cousin
from the United States, Maria Guity, who had come to visit, sat up
late around a fire and sang sad songs of the Garifuni.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has trouble talking about what happened, Mrs.
Arriola's voice is full of pain when she sings. In the clear and
nasal lilt can be heard the echoes of slavery, of revolts against
planters, of great storms, and all the hard history of her people.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Mrs. Arriola ran into two acquaintances
as she walked through the part of town on the west bank of the
River Aguan. Both women had lost their houses in the flood and were
living like squatters in a half-finished Catholic church with
borrowed clothes and a few sticks of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the three women were telling one another how they had
survived. Their voices rose and their hands flailed the air in
describing the force of the rain, the immense pounding of surf, the
rising river. Then the conversation died down, like a storm
passing, and the women's eyes went daydreamy and still.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us from this neighborhood are left without homes,''
said one of the women, Enriqueta Martinez. ``It takes years to
build a house and it is destroyed in a few seconds.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other victims of the storm say they find it hard to talk about
it. One woman, Isabella Arriola, 32, a schoolteacher who is not
directly related to Mirtha, was swept out to sea and survived for
five days by clinging to the remains of a wooden roof before being
picked up by a ship. Her husband and children perished.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arriola wears sunglasses these days and black dresses.
Whenever she appears here, the townspeople crowd around and offer
condolences and small gifts. When she was approached by a reporter,
she first maintained she was someone else from another town and had
not been in Santa Rosa during the storm. When confronted with her
identity, she said it was too painful to recount what had happened
to her. ``I don't want to talk about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Hardship: A Farmer's Family Sinks Into Poverty &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even those whose families were unscathed have trouble
understanding the extent of what has befallen them. Before the
storm, Omar Lopez was a successful dairy farmer by local standards.
He and his wife had saved enough to build a spacious home for about
$7,500. He ran 200 head of fine dairy cattle on 150 acres inherited
from his father.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a third of his farm lies under the river. The house was
swept out to sea, with all his belongings. Worse, he lost all but
10 of his cattle. ``Everything was invested in the farm, and I
didn't have any insurance,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of cattlemen in this river valley lost their stock _
some 20,000 head in all. Even those whose livestock survived have
trouble getting their beef to market because of the damage to the
country's roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who is 30, has rented a house on the edge of town and has
moved his wife and their five sons into it. They are living with
borrowed furniture. His children, once among the best dressed in
town, now run around barefoot in tattered clothes given them by
charities.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding his business at this point is a pipe dream, Lopez
said, unless he and other farmers like him obtain some sort of
low-interest loans or grants from the government. In the meantime,
he said, he and his family depend on food from charities and the
United Nations. The children have been sick with diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are completely dependent on what they send us, because we
can't produce anything,'' he said. ``One maintains hope that
perhaps the government will do something.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Response: Aid From New York Is Held Hostage &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the government's response to Santa Rosa's
crisis has been minimal. The power and telephone lines are still
down, the schools closed.
</P>
<P>
   Military helicopters have delivered about 20 tons of food aid
from the United States and Canada and a few trucks from the United
Nations and various Catholic charities have managed to get through
the river ford. In addition, five tons of aid arrived from a group
of Hondurans in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But at least two containers full of aid gathered by Hondurans in
New York City were bottled up in the port of Cortez in December,
where customs agents demanded $740 in duty before they would let
them into the country. The Mayor, Biato Gonzalo Castillo Guity,
made a three-day trip over damaged roads and severed bridges in an
effort to free the hostage cargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have the money,'' said Cruz Castillo, the
chairman of the village's emergency committee. ``If the government
doesn't help us, it's possible we won't be able to bring those
containers in.''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said they were negotiating to buy several acres
of land to parcel out to people whose houses were inundated. ``We
have to move everyone,'' Castillo said. ``We have to find a place
for them to live.''
</P>
<P>
   But Castillo said these measures did not begin to address the
larger problems of unemployment and economic ruin. Most of the
villagers worked as hired hands on fishing boats or on one of the
local cattle ranches. Now the boats are largely destroyed, the
cattle drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Many see no future. On a recent afternoon, Hilberto Sanchez, who
is 40, was trying to build a house from bits and pieces of wood he
had salvaged from the debris that was once his brother-in-law's
house. His own home had been washed out to sea. A friend gave him
permission to build on a small plot in the section of the village
that survived.
</P>
<P>
   He has put up a rickety frame on the sandy soil, salvaging even
the nails he used to hammer it together. He says he knows it will
be a temporary dwelling, a flimsy house that will not withstand the
first tropical storm, but he has no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stay in the church any longer,'' he explained,
surveying the wreckage with weary eyes. ``We have to keep fighting
because after everything we can't just cross our arms and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than two months since Sanchez worked on the
fishing boats or farms. He has nine children. Asked what he will do
once the house is finished, he shrugged in an expression of utter
despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this I am the most worried,'' he said. ``Because here we
have no source of work.''

TOM KELLY AND THE TWINS BATTLE THE ODDS  
 MYSTERY BUYER HE ISN'T  
 A JORDAN 2-POINTER 
PHILLIPS FALLOUT?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago Jim Leyland grew tired of losing with no break
in sight and parlayed his unhappiness into a World Series
championship and then a $2 million-a-year job. Tom Kelly is no less
tired of losing than Leyland was, but as loyal as Leyland was
initially, Kelly has remained so loyal he is going down with the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a Viking ship. The Vikings are the successful Minnesota
team, the one playing in a conference championship game in the
Twins' ball park Sunday. Kelly didn't plan to be at the game, but
it wasn't a case of sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many years ago Jerry Burns and I were pretty close friends,''
Kelly related, referring to a former Vikings head coach. ``I used
to go to all the games. The last game he was coaching, they were
playing the Packers and both teams were around .500. It was the
man's last game. The Packers were ahead, 20-0, at the end of the
first half, and the Vikings, in my mind, didn't show up. I thought
that was a sad display of football. I left the building and never
went back to another game. I just had a bad feeling that day. I
couldn't understand the effort that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Effort has always played a major role in Kelly's style of
managing. It will be an even bigger component during the coming
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot to be said about playing the game the
right way, doing things right on the field,'' Kelly said. ``We're
going make sure we do all of those things. I don't know if that's
going to put people in the building, but the ones who show up
deserve that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins, who last season had the third poorest won-lost record
in the American League, aren't expected to fare any better in 1999.
Kelly, whose 12-year tenure in Minnesota is the longest of any
current professional manager or coach, could have thrown himself on
the mercy of the owner, Carl Pohlad, and asked out. But he did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people call it stupidity; some call it loyalty,'' Kelly
said. ``I haven't decided which it is with me.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the manager's plight even more dire, his team became
worse not long after Kelly reaffirmed his intention to remain with
the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple weeks after the season, the owner asked me to stay,''
the 48-year-old Kelly said. ``He outlined a little plan he had. It
was my understanding we were going to keep the shortstop, and we
didn't do that. That was the only thing I was disappointed about.
</P>
<P>
   The shortstop is Pat Meares, who last year had a $2.5 million
salary and would have gained about a $1 million raise through
salary arbitration. But when the Boston Red Sox gave Jose Offerman,
a free-agent infielder, $26 million for four years, the prospect of
a much bigger raise prompted the Twins to sever ties with Meares,
who has yet to sign with another team.
</P>
<P>
   A hefty salary for their shortstop would have made it impossible
for the Twins to reach Pohlad's desired payroll level of $10
million to $15 million. That was the ``little plan'' the owner
outlined after the season for Kelly, who said he understood the
reasoning. Their $24.5 million payroll didn't get the Twins
anywhere last season, and raising it to $30 million or so would not
have made a difference, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   So why did he decide to keep his job?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable here,'' Kelly said, referring to himself and
his wife, Sharon. ``We enjoy it here. My wife has family here. My
son lives here. Personally I have a lot of money tied up here. My
people explained if I move, I'm going to lose a lot of money that's
tied up in bonds and different things. So you add it all up and ask
is it economically important to move? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Kelly acknowledged, he probably would have a better chance
to win elsewhere. But, he added, ``I weighed everything and decided
we'd stay here and do what the owner asked me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But he really would like to have had Meares' stabilizing
leadership in the infield. ``I'll try to remedy that situation,''
Kelly said. ``I'll see what we have in spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who also has lost Paul Molitor's overall team leadership,
will have plenty to scrutinize in spring training. Will Denny
Hocking, a good utility player, be able to replace Meares on an
everyday basis? Is Doug Mientkiewicz ready to play first base
regularly? How about Corey Koskie at third? Can Torii Hunter win
the center field job?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important of all, can Marty Cordova, who has
salaries totaling $6.75 million the next two years, find the bat
that made him rookie of the year in 1995 and an even better hitter
the next season but has deserted him the past two years?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the team's No. 1 pitcher, Brad Radke, whose record
plummeted from 20-10 to 12-14. The Twins have been reported to be
considering trading Radke, but Kelly said Terry Ryan, the team's
general manager, had not said anything to him about such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be afraid to,'' Kelly said, still able to joke in the
face of serious adversity.
</P>
<P>
   MYSTERY BUYER HE ISN'T
</P>
<P>
   The anonymous telephone caller to the sports department of The
New York Times said he knew who bought the $3 million baseball, the
one Mark McGwire hit for his 70th home run that had been auctioned
the night before. Who was it? Allan Byer, the called said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the person who made the winning bid _ via telephone _
had chosen to remain anonymous, this tip was worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Byer is a limited partner in the ownership of the San
Francisco Giants. He also owns a clothing company and is in real
estate. A call was placed to his home in the San Francisco area.
His wife answered and said he wasn't home. All right, did she know
if he bought the McGwire ball?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did,'' she replied, obviously amused by the idea, ``he
hasn't told me. That's funny, but the answer is no. I'm sure he
hasn't gone completely insane over baseball, just a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Another call was then placed to Byer's son, Alex, who also is a
Giants limited partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to be kidding me,'' Alex Byer said, laughing. ``Oh,
that's absurd. That is outlandish. Maybe if the ball was 100
bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   When Allan Byer was finally reached, he didn't laugh but said it
was not he who won the bidding. Why would someone think he could be
the $3 million man?
</P>
<P>
   ``I collect baseballs,'' Byer said. ``I have about 900.''
</P>
<P>
   To put his collection in economic perspective, Byer said he had
never determined the value of his collection but added, ``If it's
$100,000, that would be a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   His baseballs, he explained, are mostly from the 1940s through
the '70s, the time when baseball most magnetically held his
interest. His most valuable ball ($5,000, he estimated) is one with
Mel Ott's autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' he said, ``that's an expensive ball. I'm not about
to spend $3 million for a baseball. Even if I could afford it, I
wouldn't do it. It doesn't make any kind of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Mrs. Byer knows her husband.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A JORDAN 2-POINTER
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan will be remembered for far different reasons, but
he may have a unique position in sports history: He most likely is
the only player to retire from two sports during labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jordan didn't announce his basketball retirement until
after the lockout had ended, he knew during the work stoppage that
he would not resume work when the league did. Nearly four years
ago, he retired from his short-lived baseball career during the
players strike and as a direct result of it.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan went to spring training with the Chicago White Sox minor
leaguers in 1995, but he became increasingly uncomfortable because
it appeared he would be labeled a replacement player, a designation
and a reputation he wanted no part of.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not what I'm here for,'' Jordan said on his first
day in camp when the subject of replacement games arose. ``I've
always said I wouldn't be a replacement player. I don't consider
myself one being here. I consider myself a minor leaguer. That's
why I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the exhibition games approached and it became clear that
major league players would consider anyone who played in them
replacement players, Jordan decided it was time to go. And he went
_ back to the National Basketball Association, whose commissioner,
David Stern, nearly four years later tried to frighten the
locked-out players by threatening to use replacement players.
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIPS FALLOUT?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their general manager was accused of sexual
harassment in November, a charge he denied, the Mets have been
ultra-sensitive. They recently conducted employee seminars, for
example, on club policies, including sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a rumor last week that the Mets plan to ban sex
magazines, including the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, from
their clubhouse. David Howard, the club's senior vice president for
business and legal affairs, declined to confirm or deny the rumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot comment,'' he said, ``about how our policies would be
applied in any instance.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets do plan a ban on sex magazines, they most likely
will encounter opposition from the Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the union had a position on such club actions, Gene
Orza, the No. 2 official, said: ``If magazines of any kind were
allowed previously, if one of their working conditions was that
magazines were allowed, this would be a change and would have to be
negotiated with the union. They can't stop serving free food or not
allow employees to have cell phones. They can negotiate those
things with us, but they can't make unilateral changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The players could always sneak the magazines into the clubhouse
and read them under cover of politically correct periodicals.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Throughout this murderous century, diplomats and
dreamers have envisioned a world in which nations would transcend
their boundaries, dispel their differences and band together to
preserve peace against dictators and despots.
</P>
<P>
   This vision of world federation helped create the United
Nations. And it engendered the U.N. Special Commission, charged
with disarming Iraq after the 1991 gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, known as Unscom, became an international
intelligence service for the new world order. It was the first of
its kind _ and, it now seems, maybe the last.
</P>
<P>
   For the more secret its work became, and the more estranged the
enforcers of disarmament grew from each other, the less Unscom
could withstand accusations of serving the last superpower, its
main supplier of spycraft: the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 weapons inspectors from around the world served
Unscom over seven years, spying on Iraq, surveying its military and
industrial plants, trying to do what smart bombs could not: destroy
nuclear, biological, chemical and missile programs hidden by Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, intelligence can achieve victory without war. But
espionage is a uniquely national enterprise. While nations may
share interests, spy services rarely do. ``There are friendly
states, but no friendly intelligence services,'' notes a spokesman
for Russia's foreign intelligence agency. When spies from two
countries shake hands, they are often trying to pick one another's
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   When the going got tough for Unscom, it sought U.S. spy
technology. U.S. intelligence gladly provided it but would not
share it with the world. The more secretive Unscom's work became,
the less open it could be with its member nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If secret information is open to all member states, it won't
work,'' said Gordon Oehler, former director of the CIA's
Nonproliferation Center. ``If you let in the French, the Chinese,
the Russians _ that would kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for international cooperation. In March the special
commission adopted a U.S. eavesdropping system so secret that only
a handful of Americans, British, Australians and New Zealanders had
full access to it.
</P>
<P>
   This, understandably, led to tensions, notably between the
Americans on one side and the Russians, the Chinese and the French
on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The special commission began as a unique experiment. It was
assembled quickly after the 1991 gulf war, when Iraq was shattered
and powerless and the world seemed united in the determination to
disarm that country. It assumed unconditional power to do its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought together communities _ intelligence, military,
non-proliferation _ from around the world, and it brought new
thinking about how to do inspections,'' said David Albright,
president of the Institute for Science and International Security,
who served as a nuclear-weapons inspector in Iraq. Its leaders
thought they could disarm Iraq in no time _ ``possibly as little as
a year,'' its chairman, Richard Butler, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Butler conceded, ``it has taken eight years, and the job
is still not completely finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until 1995 did the inspectors understand that Iraq had an
extraordinary system to hide its secret weapons programs. Now three
more years have gone by trying to pierce that shield. And as it
turned out, the secret weapons _ the foundation of Saddam's power,
the ace in the hole with which he might someday trump the world _
were hidden by the same soldiers and spies whose duty it is to make
sure that the Iraqi dictator dies peacefully in bed. That made
piercing the Iraqi veil far more difficult than anyone had
expected, and prompted the Americans to roll out the particularly
sophisticated and sensitive equipment that yielded a a product they
were reluctant to share too widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq is a sovereign nation, and there are limits to what you
can do if that nation wants to hide things from you,'' Oehler said.
``The best you can do is make it very painful for them if they
won't go along.'' Iraq has endured great pain _ including perhaps
$150 billion in lost oil revenues _ to defy disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson is you can't disarm a country unless you're willing
to occupy it and forbid them the trappings of a sovereign nation,
such as a military force and the right to built that force,''
Oehler said.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has been willing to conquer Iraq in the name of world
peace. And America's French and Russian partners on the Security
Council are increasingly eager to resume business with Baghdad,
which owes them billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Now the international coalition assembled by President George
Bush for the gulf war has dwindled to two nations: the United
States and Britain. Their four-day attack on Iraq in December was
``the first time in history that a nation has gone to war to stop
the spread of weapons of mass destruction,'' said Joseph
Cirincione, director of the nonproliferation project at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it failed, said Scott Ritter, the former marine who
resigned from Unscom in August to protest what he called a lack of
U.S. support. His accusations have helped raise suspicions that the
Americans used information supposedly gathered for Unscom to
precisely target Iraqi units closely linked to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was a final blow with which ``the U.S. killed
Unscom,'' Ritter said. ``The U.S. brought its own credibility and
objectivity into question. And the U.S. lost a lot of its moral
authority to lead on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Unscom is banished from Iraq and bloodied by international
infighting. The United States is back to taking potshots at Iraq,
playing Globocop, a role that alienates it from much of the rest of
the world. America's allies in the region are fed up with Saddam,
but their patience for U.S. bombing raids is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   Butler bravely hopes for a new and improved Unscom. But now the
French and the Russians are proposing lifting the oil embargo on
Iraq in exchange for a new system of overseeing Iraqi weaponry _
and the Russians want to abolish the special commission altogether.
The United States is against those proposals. In any case, Iraq
will not submit to more inspections unless it is freed entirely
from the eight-year-old economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment in international intelligence is over. No one
knows how a new arms control regime can be installed in Iraq. And
no one knows how much more pain Iraq is willing to endure to hide
its secret cache.
</P>
<P>
   Today, on the eighth anniversary of the launching of the gulf
war, Iraq's chances of rebuilding a secret arsenal look good. The
future for world federations devoted to disarmament looks bleak.

such as a military force and the right to built that force,''
Oehler said.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has been willing to conquer Iraq in the name of world
peace. And America's French and Russian partners on the Security
Council are increasingly eager to resume business with Baghdad,
which owes them billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Now the international coalition assembled by President George
Bush for the gulf war has dwindled to two nations: the United
States and Britain. Their four-day attack on Iraq in December was
``the first time in history that a nation has gone to war to stop
the spread of weapons of mass destruction,'' said Joseph
Cirincione, director of the nonproliferation project at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it failed, said Scott Ritter, the former marine who
resigned from Unscom in August to protest what he called a lack of
U.S. support. His accusations have helped raise suspicions that the
Americans used information supposedly gathered for Unscom to
precisely target Iraqi units closely linked to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was a final blow with which ``the U.S. killed
Unscom,'' Ritter said. ``The U.S. brought its own credibility and
objectivity into question. And the U.S. lost a lot of its moral
authority to lead on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Unscom is banished from Iraq and bloodied by international
infighting. The United States is back to taking potshots at Iraq,
playing Globocop, a role that alienates it from much of the rest of
the world. America's allies in the region are fed up with Saddam,
but their patience for U.S. bombing raids is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   Butler bravely hopes for a new and improved Unscom. But now the
French and the Russians are proposing lifting the oil embargo on
Iraq in exchange for a new system of overseeing Iraqi weaponry _
and the Russians want to abolish the special commission altogether.
The United States is against those proposals. In any case, Iraq
will not submit to more inspections unless it is freed entirely
from the eight-year-old economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment in international intelligence is over. No one
knows how a new arms control regime can be installed in Iraq. And
no one knows how much more pain Iraq is willing to endure to hide
its secret cache.
</P>
<P>
   Today, on the eighth anniversary of the launching of the gulf
war, Iraq's chances of rebuilding a secret arsenal look good. The
future for world federations devoted to disarmament looks bleak.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Twelve years. That is how long Bill Piner has waited to watch a
game like Sunday's, and right in his own living room.
</P>
<P>
   How many times, when Vinny Testaverde was throwing pro passes
for Tampa Bay, for Cleveland, for Baltimore, did he have to go
searching for a sports bar or a friend's house with a satellite
dish? How many lost Sundays, meaningless games, wasted seasons? How
many conversations with his former honorable mention high school
all-America player that sounded like pep talks and ended with the
promise that, sooner or later, Testaverde's time would come?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, sooner or later is right now, Sunday at Mile High
Stadium in Denver, the Jets and the Broncos, Testaverde trying to
answer the question asked of every quarterback who is handed a
competitive team: can you take it to the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   This is no attempt to reduce the American Football Conference
championship game to a tale of dueling quarterbacks. History, which
records but seldom recalls which part of the offensive line broke
down, will do that, anyway. Testaverde's team will defeat John
Elway's team, or it won't. Testaverde will come out of this with
the benefit of the doubt for all the frustration that came before,
or he won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three things that must be in place for a quarterback to be
successful are organization, supporting cast and coaching,'' said
Piner, who was Testaverde's coach at Sewanhaka High School in
Floral Park, N.Y. ``Vinny's never had all three of those things in
the past. His talent hasn't changed. But the ghosts are there. He
understands that. The realities of pro football are that you've got
to get to the game. Until you do, you're going to be thrown in with
the rest of the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   And that would be a shame, Piner said, a crying shame, and not
because Testaverde was blessed with a Super Bowl body. ``For the
way he has handled all he's been through, and the kind of person he
is, and has always been,'' Piner said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, now 54 and the athletic director at Cold Spring
Harbor (N.Y.) High School, is plenty partial, and why not? This
game, not only to be watched from home, hits home in a way that few
others could. Testaverde is much more than a former star pupil. He
is Piner's own son's boyhood hero, the big man on the University of
Miami's campus who received a letter one day from the Sewanhaka
High ball boy back on Long Island, asking that Testaverde come home
and be his sponsor on the day he would be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Piner is 25 now, but his father can close his eyes and
conjure up the most pleasing image in less time than Testaverde can
take the snap. He can still see his son walking into St. Barnabas
Church, hand in hand with Jimmy Johnson's starting quarterback. He
can remember a football in Testaverde's hand, and a copy of Sports
Illustrated magazine, with Alonzo Highsmith on the cover, following
a 1-point Miami victory over Nebraska in the 1984 Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``See this football?'' Testaverde asked the boy, who obediently
nodded. ``That's this ball right here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Vinny signed it and handed it to Michael,'' Bill Piner
said. ``He still has it.''
</P>
<P>
   Father and son have been riveted to their television screens, in
the storybook homecoming season of Vinny from Elmont. As the stakes
have risen, Sundays have been savored like a glass of fine wine
from a bottle unopened for 12 long years.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rang in the Piner home late last Sunday afternoon,
the son calling from the road on business, out in western Canada,
but not out of Testaverde range. ``You see that game?'' he asked,
knowing there was no chance his father had not seen every play of
Jacksonville at Jets. They toasted the notion of Testaverde in
Denver, one step away.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Piners, nor anyone else, could have known what good
fortune Testaverde was returning to, though Bill Piner suspected
early on that, for Testaverde, this would no season on the brink,
or the bench. He and his wife, Patty, were chatting with Testaverde
at the Jets' Hofstra training camp last summer, when Piner noticed
Bill Parcells eyeing them from a distance. When Testaverde walked
away, the Tuna strolled over to introduce himself.
</P>
<P>
   They made small talk, and Parcells, one coach to a
coach-turned-administrator, teased Piner about making sure his
team's buses were on time. ``But right as he was walking away, he
looked back and said, `Vinny is doing a heck of a job,''' Piner
said. ``He said, `Don't worry about him; I know what I'm doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Piner went home happy that his guy was in Parcells' hands. He
always hoped Testaverde would follow the path of other failed Tampa
Bay quarterbacks. Doug Williams won a Super Bowl in Washington.
Steve Young in San Francisco. Testaverde still has a mile high
climb just to get to Miami. One last, towering hurdle, but this
time, with the organization, supporting cast and coaching lined up
with Testaverde against the Broncos, and the ghosts of seasons
past.  &QL;

ETHAN NADEL, EXPERT ON BODY TEMPERATURE AND PEDAL-POWERED AIRPLANE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn., Mass, Ore., Calif.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ethan Richard Nadel, a Yale University physiologist and
authority on the body's temperature adjustments during exercise and
heat exposure, died on Dec. 26 at his home in Guilford, Conn. He
was 57.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, a Yale spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nadel was noted for his expertise in sports medicine, body
fitness and aging. At his death he held professorships of
epidemiology and public health and of cellular and molecular
physiology at the Yale School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 until last year he was director of the John B. Pierce
Laboratory at the Center for Research in Health and the
Environment. He oversaw the expansion and renovation of the
laboratory, added to its research staff of scientists and
postdoctoral students, and strengthened direct ties with the
medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Dr. Nadel's research centered on the mechanisms by which
the body achieves physical fitness through exercise training and
becomes acclimatized to heat exposure. A special interest was the
physiological factors that regulate blood volume and their effects
on physical performance and heat tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   He also ran a project to observe patterns of exercise and
fitness among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Nadel, who was born in Washington, graduated from Williams
College in 1963 and earned master's and doctoral degrees in
environmental physiology at the University of California at Santa
Barbara. He completed postdoctoral studies at the Pierce Laboratory
before being appointed to the Yale faculty in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Nadel is survived by his wife, Emilia Bergamasco; his mother,
Ruth G. Nadel, of Washington; two daughters, Dana Foley, of
Manhattan, and Maya Bergamasco, of Guilford, and three brothers,
John B. and Roger S., of Los Angeles, and Gordon L., of Jasper,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Nadel was a consultant to the 1980s Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Daedalus Project in human-powered flight, named after
the figure in Greek mythology who, held prisoner on Crete by King
Minos, escaped to Sicily on wings of wax and feathers.
</P>
<P>
   The MIT project used a 70-pound airplane powered solely by
bicycle pedals. It completed a nonstop flight from Crete to the
Aegean island of Santorini in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Nadel called it a ``tremendous athletic feat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken it to running two three-hour marathons back to back,''
he said.

SHARING A COMMON GOAL: EXPLOITING MISMATCHES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Both offenses in the American Football Conference
championship game on Sunday will slyly attempt to create
mismatches, either by formation or by movement. Then both will try
to take those mismatches and burn the defenses. All day long.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to trick the defense with a crafty appearance. Force
it, for example, to mistakenly place a slow linebacker in pass
coverage on a speedy wide receiver, or a sluggish strong safety on
a lightning-quick running back. Create a situation in which a tiny
cornerback is blocked and crushed on a running play by a mammoth
pulling offensive lineman, or the shortest defender on the field is
forced to pass protect against the tallest offensive player on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Football is a game of matchups. Creating mismatches in those
matchups is a staple of the game. The Jets and the Denver Broncos,
Sunday's AFC title finalists, have been masters of the tactic this
season.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason both teams have reached this pinnacle in Mile
High Stadium, an emotional and dramatic stage on which to decide
who advances to Super Bowl XXXIII and who heads home for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it; the Jets do it,'' said Mike Shanahan, the Denver
head coach. ``In the mismatch game is where you tend to find a
number of big plays being made.''
</P>
<P>
   Both team's offenses have soared, in part, by employing this
scheme. The Broncos rank first in the conference in total offense
(380.8 yards a game); the Jets rank second (357.2). The Broncos
rank first in the conference in points scored (31.3 a game); the
Jets rank second (26.0).
</P>
<P>
   Each offense versus each defense will be a sparkling show. But
since the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos feature the star
quarterback John Elway, the 2,000-yard rusher Terrell Davis and
Shanahan's crisp play-calling, the guessing game between Shanahan
and Bill Belichick, the Jets defensive coordinator, will be the
game within the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known Bill for years and I have called games against
him before,'' Shanahan said. ``He's adjusted over the years and so
have I. This will be fun. I've looked at all 16 Jets games from
their regular season. I looked at them in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked, what if Belichick had looked at the Broncos for
that period and even at tapes of the Broncos' preseason games?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't get a picture after 16 games ... '' Shanahan
said, a bit taken aback at even the thought that the Jets, that
Belichick, could possibly be more prepared for the mismatch game
than he. ``Let's just say if they have and it works, they are
smarter than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have been smart in gathering players. That is where
it starts.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has a quarterback, a running back, a tight end (Shannon
Sharpe) and receivers (Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith) who are
explosive and spread defenses. The Jets, in their quarterback
(Vinny Testaverde), running back (Curtis Martin), tight end (Kyle
Brady) and receivers (Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet) believe
they can match Denver's offensive power. Toss in two strong,
versatile offensive lines and intricate designs to create
mismatches, and what lurks is a blinding offensive show.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about two multiple-formation teams who rely on
this strategy a little more than others,'' said Norv Turner, the
Washington Redskins' head coach. ``You're talking about teams who
have a lot of people who can do a lot of things. It's the
quarterbacks; they are experienced. It's the personnel. Even the
backups behind these guys are good. These are teams that are
efficient. You can draw it up all day long. The players have to
perform it. They do.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for that, said Chan Gailey, the Dallas
Cowboys' head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be different, to scheme things that create mismatches, a
lot of times you have to have people in place who have been there
for awhile,'' Gailey said. ``This Denver offense has been together
for a little while with the same coaches. That is a great edge.
They can work off a base that everyone there knows. And then later
in the season they can say, `Hey, remember in Week 3 when we did
this? Let's change this part of it and do this.' That kind of stuff
on a particular play can go back even a year or two. And you have
to have smart players to do that. And a coach willing to try
different things. Denver puts all of this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating mismatches starts with formations and movement, and the
effect is bolstered when defenses make mistakes in substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use two tight ends, two backs and a wide receiver, does
the defense stay with four linebackers?'' Gailey asked. ``If so,
you've got an edge in the running game. If you use three wides, a
running back and a tight end, do they stay in their base defense?
That's to your advantage on the deep pass. If you line up with five
wide receivers, the quarterback looks to see which one has the
mismatch. If you put a tight end out wide as a wide receiver, if
the cornerback walks out there it tells the quarterback zone. If a
linebacker walks out, it is man coverage. These are indicators that
set up your mismatches on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and the Broncos play it both ways: both will read and
react on offense and at other times both will dictate.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey prefers read and react. He likes to see what the defense
does, how it responds to formations, and then adjust to find the
mismatch. Is it a defense based on speed and getting upfield? Is is
it one that sits back and waits for you? Is there a lineman who
pushes so hard upfield that the ball can be thrown behind him in
the vacated spot? Gailey searches for these keys.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Turner, however, likes the attack mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best strategy can be to dictate,'' Turner said. ``I like
these teams' offenses when they create situations where they are
not reacting to people but people are reacting to them. Denver does
a great job in the running game of the cutback runs. I coached
Marcus Allen at USC and he had this knack of cutting back on his
runs near the line of scrimmage. So, we said, if he's going to be
doing that, let's give him some help. Let's block the back side.''
</P>
<P>
   That creates plenty of mismatches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find ourselves here in the running game making sure the
backside is tied down and worked out,'' said Mark Schlereth, a
Broncos offensive guard. ``That means keeping the safeties blocked.
Sometimes linemen do that. It is a big advantage for us. It has
become a major part of our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in the coaching booth, defensive coaches look for the
offensive players being sent in by position from the sideline and
attempt to match that by inserting corresponding defensive
personnel. Three wide receivers come in? Three cover guys are sent
in to cover them. If a mistake is made in personnel deployment
Sunday, it could prove costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why there were screams a few years ago when teams were
putting 12 men in the huddle and then one guy was leaving the field
before the snap,'' Turner said. ``You couldn't set your defense.
But sometimes, despite that, the mistakes upstairs still happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And a huge mismatch can ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Matchups in Sunday's game could swing on a healthy player versus
an injured one. On faulty defensive technique, on picking on a
defensive player at a particular position at a particular spot on
the field because of his faulty technique.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets would love to see their fast receiver Dedric Ward
aligned in man coverage versus the slower Broncos safety Tyrone
Braxton. The Broncos would enjoy finding the 6-foot-5-inch receiver
Ed McCaffrey versus the 5-8 cornerback Ray Mickens on a lobbed
pass, a jump-ball situation in the end zone. Jets receiver Keyshawn
Johnson would smile if he were covered in a crossing pattern by
Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski. Schlereth (287 pounds) would
grin if he found himself pulling and blocking cornerback Aaron
Glenn (185 pounds).
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and Broncos will spread the defenses thin. Use their
offensive talent. Create mismatches in the matchups.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people start spreading out in this game and creating
things, they also can leave a variety of holes,'' Turner said.
``And if a defense is able to find and defend the hot receiver for
the quarterback and take away that dump-off pass, take away the
quarterback's safety valve, then you are vulnerable. You've got to
be able to handle the blitz and pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both defenses from the Jets and Broncos are going to create
overloads on the blocking schemes with major blitzes. The team that
handles that best will enjoy the mismatch game. The team that
doesn't will be in trouble.''

</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the issue are the insurance companies that
paid out millions of dollars more in claims than they expected
because of the magnitude of the Northridge quake.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor sprang from what is called a ``blind thrust'' fault
deep under the valley. This fault had never produced a rupture at
the earth's surface, thus its name. And the energy it released did
not have to travel far by earthquake standards to reach heavily
populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   The quake literally threw structures up in the air as well as
shook them from side to side, which compounded the damage.
</P>
<P>
   And the models that insurance companies had used to assess their
potential exposure for years became useless in less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bigger than the models indicated,'' Peter Debreceny, a
spokesman for Chicago-based Allstate Insurance Co. ``Nobody was
aware of this fault and the earth movement was different and
unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   All insurance is a balancing act on the part of both the
companies and consumers. Does the risk of something bad happening
merit the cost of a premium?
</P>
<P>
   That question has as many answers as there are homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, though.
</P>
<P>
   The quake laid waste to the kind of policies that were available
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect that you'll ever see the standard earthquake
policy that was there before,'' said Candysse Miller, regional
director of Western Insurance Information Service, an industry
trade group. ``It's just not realistic.''

AFTERSHOCKS OF '94 QUAKE STILL ROCKING CALIFORNIA'S INSURANCE
INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Five years ago, on Jan. 17, 1994, the city shook
for 30 seconds -- enough time to wreck $25 billion in damage and
wipe out a pool of earthquake insurance premiums that had been
accumulating for a quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the financial aftershocks still reverberate throughout
the state's insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of companies and the California Earthquake Authority,
a quasi-governmental agency created by the legislature to bring
order out of chaos after the quake, are writing homeowner
earthquake insurance policies and trying to bring more choices to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, though, say what coverage is available falls far short
of offering any kind of security to property owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's overpriced and we don't think people are getting
enough coverage for what they are paying for,'' said Lillian
Salinger, a staff attorney at the Santa Monica, Calif.-based
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the tab for the nation's worst natural disaster
continues to mount even as life, for the most part, has returned to
normal and the memories of that deadly day lose their sharp edges.
</P>
<P>
   As of last Sept. 30, property owners had filed 443,228 claims
with insurers to cover damage estimated at $15.3 billion, according
to the Institute for Business and Home Safety, a Boston-based
nonprofit group established by the insurance industry to help
reduce the impact of natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The institute ranks the Northridge quake second to Florida's
Hurricane Andrew in terms of loss to insured property and estimates
the total economic loss at $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this kind of reality the insurance industry, much
like homeowners and businesses, had to rebuild. How it all shakes
out may eventually impact the way carriers across the country
structure policies to cover natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers, pushed to the precipice of insolvency under the
crushing weight of claims, shunned the marketplace after the 6.7
temblor. Ninety percent of those doing business in California
ceased accepting new homeowner customers or drastically cut back on
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the state needed to act. In 1995, then-Gov. Pete Wilson
signed AB 1366, sponsored by then-Assemblyman David Knowles,
R-Placerville, which became the framework for the quake coverage
product offered today.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the CEA was created and it soon began offering the
infamous bare bones ``mini-policy'' featuring a 15 percent
deductible on damage to the home, contents coverage capped at
$5,000 and living expenses capped at $1,500 while a home is being
repaired. Coverage rates are based on the house's location, with
those in quake-prone areas like Los Angeles paying some of the
highest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Before the quake deductibles typically were 5 percent to 10
percent and some policies included generous living expenses and
coverage on other structures like fences, patios and free-standing
garages.
</P>
<P>
   Now the CEA, with Knowles installed as chief executive officer,
is proposing a package it is touting as more consumer friendly.
</P>
<P>
   In December, on the same day Knowles became the agency head, the
CEA's board approved a rate reduction that averages 4.5 percent
statewide. And it is also seeking permission to offer supplemental
coverage during the year's second quarter. This could bring down
the deductible and expand allowances for temporary shelter and the
contents of a house.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the CEA to offer its basic policy and nine
other coverage options. Deductibles are 10 percent and 15 percent
and the coverage for contents and temporary living expenses are
capped at $100,000 and $15,000, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   A decision from the state Department of Insurance should come by
spring.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed rate schedule for the bare-bones policy, based
on ZIP codes, is no bargain for the suburban San Fernando Valley
area of Los Angeles. There are 84 ZIP codes in the region and 63 of
them will have their rates increased.
</P>
<P>
   And homeowners in 33 of those ZIP codes will pay the highest
rate of $4.98 per $1,000 of coverage. That means that for a home
costing $190,000, the premium would be $946 a year, up from $805
under the old structure.
</P>
<P>
   With the 15 percent deductible, the home would have to sustain
$28,500 in damage before the coverage kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the San Francisco Bay Area, another seismic hot
zone, is tabbed for a rate reduction with coverage set at between
$2.59 and $4.41 per $1,000 of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say the rates were set according to a quake risk
assessment by EQE International in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, the former chief deputy insurance commissioner, said
the new rate structure could entice more property owners to buy
policies. Currently the CEA policies cover about 900,000 property
holders in the state and the agency could pay $7 billion in claims.
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, the policies available now are intentionally not
designed to replicate what was offered in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bare-bones coverages were not designed to fully replace
spacious half-million-dollar homes or million-dollar mansions. They
were designed to get a roof back over people's heads and get their
life back in order as soon as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that, says former Chatsworth, Calif., resident Jerry
Yandell, who moved to Las Vegas last summer, is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Yandell was living in a Chatsworth townhouse in the
northwestern San Fernando Valley and owned eight rental properties.
He eventually discovered they had a total of $600,000 damage and
ended up in a lawsuit with his insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they did away with the standard quake policies and
implemented the CEA policies I decided I couldn't recover from
another quake so I took my assets and moved to Las Vegas,'' he
said. ``Hopefully by the end of '99 I will be out of the state of
California and it's really sad because I'm a native. I'm too old to
start over and this is my retirement, I've got to protect it.''

   WASHINGTON _ Given the gravity of the occasion and everything on
the line, an observer might reasonably expect an attention to
detail that is, well, unimpeachable.
</P>
<P>
   But a certain sloppiness has infected the trial of President
Clinton, at least when it comes to spelling.
</P>
<P>
   The first big mistake came on the first day, when senators
signed their oaths to be impartial with pens whose inscriptions
scrambled the letters in the country's name, and in a rather
ominous fashion. The senators would be serving and safeguarding the
``Untied States'' as they weighed the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Then the president's highly paid and skilled lawyers churned out
a trial memorandum for the Senate this week that bobbled their
boss's surname, dropping a consonant. The cover page read, ``Re
Impeachment of William Jefferson Cinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Thursday, Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, one of
the 13 Republican congressmen acting as prosecutors in the Senate
trial, took a pointer and turned toward an intricate chart with one
glaring mistake. The first word of its title was misspelled, so
that what Hutchinson was referring to was a ``Calender of Job
Search Activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's a spelling gremlin loose somewhere around the
United States Capitol. Or perhaps events are hurtling forward with
too much speed and passion to accommodate such niceties as
linguistic accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a flurry of activity,'' explained Christopher
Battle, a spokesman for Hutchinson. ``The charts did not arrive
until practically moments before the presentation. We were back
there behind the Senate chamber unpacking them even as the
congressman was preparing to go on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle said in an interview on Friday that Hutchinson and his
staff members noticed the error but decided it was not important
enough to ditch the chart altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But Battle said that other hastily produced charts for other
congressmen came back from printing companies so riddled with
errors that they were unusable. He spotted one, he said, that
listed the punishments for a crime called ``bulgary.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle said he had had only a few calls on Friday from people
who noticed the chart error. By contrast, John DeCrosta, a
spokesman for Senate President Pro Tempore Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina, said he had gotten scores of calls about the pens.
</P>
<P>
   DeCrosta conceded to being mystified by all the misspellings.
``They are certainly not indicative of the character or caliber of
the men and women in the Senate,'' he said.

PARENTS, TEACHERS APPLAUDING ENGLISH-ONLY SWITCH IN L.A. SCHOOL
DISTRICT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In Room 9 at Erwin Street Elementary School in
suburban Van Nuys, 19 young voices belt out the Pledge of
Allegiance, then segue into the Woody Guthrie folk song ``This Land
is Your Land'' -- in perfect English.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, the same group of second-graders was learning
how to read and write in Spanish in a bilingual class. But under
Proposition 227, passed in June by 61 percent of California voters,
bilingual education largely has been replaced with
English-immersion classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really transitioning very well,'' second-grade teacher
Amy D'Elia said. ``Parents have been very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months after the Los Angeles Unified School District began
implementing the law, teachers and parents in the San Fernando
Valley area of the city say the transition from bilingual education
to English immersion has been largely successful.
</P>
<P>
   At Erwin Street and other valley schools, the biggest challenge
posed by the new law has been improvising lesson plans because of a
lack of textbooks and other materials in English.
</P>
<P>
   Restricted in speaking the children's native languages, teachers
say they are using more visual aides and performing even more
hands-on demonstrations in class to overcome language barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a change of the whole way they do things,''
Erwin Street Principal Marla Mondheim said. ``It's been a real
learning experience for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of Proposition 227 claim that the district is
defying the law by allowing teachers to use students' native
language and granting too many waivers to parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little compliance in terms of what the
proposition intended to happen,'' said Alice Callaghan, an
Episcopal priest who is one of the leading proponents of
Proposition 227. ``This year, children should be beginning to read
and write in English, but that's not what's occurring in many, many
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Proposition 227, schools are required to teach non-native
speakers in a one-year English-immersion program. Students who
already know English, are 10 years old or older, or have special
needs can receive a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   About 11 percent of parents districtwide have requested and
received waivers so far. Since school officials had only two months
to implement Proposition 227 after it was approved by voters,
schools have had to overcome a number of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Douglass, principal of Fernangeles Elementary School
in Sun Valley in the San Fernando Valley, said the new law forced
the multitrack school to hold multiple parent meetings for each of
its three calendar sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible disruption,'' Douglass said. ``It's not bad
if you have 30 kids in a school, but when you have 800 Limited
English Proficient children, that's an incredible job to get every
one of those parents to come in and explain what the proposition
says and what their options are.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``When people voted for 227, they had no idea the
tremendous amount of time and money it would cost schools to
implement something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was implemented so quickly that teachers at Canoga Park
Elementary School in suburban Canoga Park didn't have a chance to
order English language textbooks and materials; they bought and
made their own supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to jump right in,'' said Lorraine Mariglia, principal
of Canoga Park.
</P>
<P>
   Campus teachers said their biggest challenge, so far, has been a
lack of textbooks and other materials in English. The district used
part of a major state allocation to buy Spanish readers -- now
unusable in English-immersion classrooms. The district is
considering exchanging the Spanish books for English ones with the
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our textbooks are brand new but we can't use the textbooks
because they're in Spanish,'' said D'Elia who has her pupils sing
songs, read poetry aloud and chant phonic exercises to help them
learn English and other subjects. ``We're modifying what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Materials is where we're feeling the biggest crunch,'' Erwin
Street Principal Mondheim said, explaining that teachers have
either made or bought their own materials to make up for the lack
of textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers have been real troopers,'' Mondheim said.
``They've been real professional and been real generous with their
time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers also are using visual aids and hand gestures -- along
with some Spanish -- to help the children understand English,
social studies, science and other academic subjects.
</P>
<P>
   At Canoga Park Elementary, teachers are using more hands-on
demonstrations in class, Mariglia said. One teacher explained
westward expansion by having pupils make covered wagons while
another had kids learn about seismic activity by making stilt
houses in sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more hands-on and a lot more vocabulary
development,'' Mariglia said. ``It's been a challenge, but
(teachers and pupils) have met the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents agree with the rosy review of some educators.
Mariam Adamian pulled her two boys out of bilingual education when
they were younger because she felt they weren't learning enough
English. Now her 10-year-old son is in an English-only classroom at
Erwin Street and has been identified as gifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing well,'' said Adamian, who pulled her son out of
bilingual education when he was in third grade. ``I was seeing that
he was being taught in Armenian a lot. He was learning more
(English) by playing outside with children and watching TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lidia Valladares, who placed her 8-year-old son in a
bilingual class at Fernangeles Elementary in Sun Valley, felt her
son would suffer academically in an English-only classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting him in an English-only class would be more
difficult,'' said Valladares, one of many parents at Fernangeles
who opted for a waiver. ``We wanted him to have English, but with
Spanish support.''
</P>
<P>
   At Fernangeles, about 92 percent of 521 students who were in
bilingual classes last year requested waivers to continue with the
bilingual courses, according to district records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents are very strongly in support of it. They want
their children to be bilingual,'' said Douglass, who said her
school has only one English-immersion class in the calendar session
that started in September.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Room 9 at Erwin Street Elementary, D'Elia watched
proudly as her second-graders eagerly corrected sentences in
English filled with grammatical and spelling mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about them,'' D'Elia said. ``If this is best,
let's make it work.''

REPUBLICANS SEEK EAGLES TO HELP THEM SOAR 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Attn: Fla, Tenn., Ohio, Texas, Va., N.Y., N.D., Ohio, Okla.)  By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Posing for a photographer at the entrance of
The Breakers, a palatial Italian Renaissance resort where wealthy
Republicans converged this week, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of
Tennessee could not resist a quip about the party of Abe Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't exactly a log cabin,'' he said, recalling Lincoln's
humble birthplace. Then, looking as if he was having second
thoughts, he added, ``This confirms everyone's worst suspicions of
what Republicans are.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Alexander stood patiently for a photographer because
he is running for president _ and knows he must do whatever he can
to get his mug in the newspaper as he struggles to stand out in an
increasingly crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other Republicans who gathered here were less eager
to draw attention to their presence at this sunny resort as
Washington is overcome not only by frosty weather but by the
impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that contributors traveled here _ and politicians
from Capitol Hill flew in to hobnob with them _ is testament to how
nothing gets in the way of Republicans courting, wooing and hitting
up the party's most reliable donors. (Democrats are no different;
on Friday, Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and their wives were the
main speakers at the party's $15,000-a-person fund-raising dinner
and concert at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington).
</P>
<P>
   For years Republicans, including many corporate lobbyists, have
been accused of using these private retreats to buy access to the
powerful. Whether or not that is the case, it is clear from the
meetings at two lavish resorts here of the Republican Eagles and
Team 100 in the past few days that the party goes out of its way to
pamper its most reliable _ and altruistic _ backers.
</P>
<P>
   While contributors paid their own way, they were treated to
special panels on issues as well as their own sporting events, like
the ``Eagles Cup Tennis Tournament'' (the dress, participants were
advised, is ``tennis whites'') headed by Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr.
of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the ``Eagles' Cup Golf Tournament,'' headed by
Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma. (Nickles, the majority whip, had to
send his regrets at the last moment because of the impeachment
trial.) Then there was dinner on Wednesday night at Donald J.
Trump's gold-lined private club, Mar-a-Lago (Trump was out of
town).
</P>
<P>
   The politicians were as interested in rubbing elbows with the
donors as the donors were interested in rubbing elbows with the
politicians. Candidates here talked about ``stroking dollars'' from
monied Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the top Republican
champion of campaign finance overhaul, had planned to speak at a
dinner here but he and several colleagues, including Trent Lott,
the Senate Republican leader, had to cancel because of the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians were undeterred. Alexander, who stepped down
as honorary chairman of the Eagles, and Rep. John R. Kasich of
Ohio, who is also running for president, found themselves chatting
up prospective fund-raisers for their campaigns. Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, the Republican whip, was the dinner speaker Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's buying access,'' said Mel Sembler, a shopping center
magnate who is the national party's finance chairman (and who is
being wooed to raise money for expected presidential races of
Alexander and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas). ``This is how you get
involved in the process: You entertain them a little; you put on
some panels.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the palm tree-dotted surroundings were so luxuriant that
a few participants seemed a bit embarrassed. ``They picked one of
the most expensive, exclusive locations in the country to hold a
major meeting,'' said Scott W. Luellen, an Eagle who owns an
information technology company in Fairfax, Va. ``It's a billboard
for hypocrisy. If you don't want to appear exclusive, don't hold
your meetings at a $400-a-night-hotel.'' (Luellen, in something of
a personal protest, stayed at a hotel down the street for half the
rate.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in the privileged world of big contributors, some are
bigger than others. While the Eagles (they must donate at least
$15,000 a year) stayed at the five-star Breakers, members of Team
100 (they must give $100,000 every Presidential year and $25,000
the other three years) were housed nearby at the opulent Four
Seasons. That hotel, Team 100 members were quick to point out, is
not as historic but has bigger rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Some Team 100 members, with their understated silver-and-black
name tags, see themselves as in a more exclusive class than the
Eagles, with their clunky, oversize gold-colored badges that
feature a drawing of an Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group here seems to be a real hybrid of well-to-do
business people and zealots,'' Luellen explained. ``It makes
discussions among Eagles require a lot of judiciousness. You don't
know if you're talking to a zealot or a successful businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   Many big donors complain that they are not taken seriously
enough by politicians who do not sufficiently seek them out for
their counsel on political matters. But party officials seemed to
take their concerns seriously in the last few days, when many
contributors accused Jim Nicholson, the party chairman, and
congressional leaders, of allowing the party to be defined by
impeachment _ and not putting forth a forceful issue agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setting, the panels did not sound like fluff. For
example, Frank Gaffney, an assistant defense secretary under
President Ronald Reagan, made a presentation to the Eagles about
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, the Republican strategist who addressed a panel on
Presidential politics on Friday with Michael K. Deaver, President
Reagan's image adviser, warned that the donors should not be
underestimated. ``I was very impressed with the breadth of their
political knowledge and by their desire to make not only a
financial but a strategic contribution to the party,'' he said.
``It was not just a bunch of large donors just trying to have lunch
with someone who has power.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the benefits is that Eagles are included in periodic
conference calls with party officials. In a move to build
membership, the brochure says, ``new members receive a limited
edition lithograph of world famous painter John Ruthven's American
Eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a subgroup called the Young Eagles, who receive
full benefits with a contribution of $7,500. ``We have Young Eagles
so we can get them started young in the political process,''
Sembler said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, weighty issues often took a back seat to conversations
about golf, tennis, and whether Trump's club was too garish. While
party officials wheeled in televisions to a luncheon so Eagles
could watch the opening of the Senate trial, many donors conceded
that they were not following the proceedings closely.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his panel address, Reed changed from his
pinstripe suit, dashed up to his room to put on his golfing attire
and headed for the links with Team 100 members (and prospective
future clients).
</P>
<P>
   While politicians were hunting for generous donors, the donors
were looking for favors as well. As he headed onto his green golf
cart for the Eagles' Cup Tournament, Curly Haugland, a
manufacturing executive in North Dakota, said: ``I'm here to get
the flavor for the national political conversation. I'm also trying
to find a speaker for our Lincoln Day dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Haugland can look forward to the next big
Eagles events. In April, in Washington, is ``The RNC Gala,'' billed
as ``the premier black-tie fund-raising event of the party.'' In
August, they will gather at the Sagamore Resort in Lake George,
N.Y., for ``A Day at the Saratoga Races with the members of the New
York Congressional delegation.''

GIRL FINDS LONG-LOST GRANDFATHER WORKING AT HER HIGH SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Dennis McCarthy is a columnist for the Los Angeles Daily
News.) 
BY DENNIS MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- This is one of those times you shake your head at
and say, ``Nah, no way, couldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did.
</P>
<P>
   A high school music teacher notices the facial similarity
between a female student in his class and the school's longtime
security aide he's known only by first name -- Chuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her name's Heather,'' Dave Tautkus, band director at Kennedy
High School in Granada Hills, approximately 23 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles, told Chuck one day. ``I swear she could pass
for your daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old security aide laughed. ``How about my
granddaughter instead?'' he joked. ``What's her last name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perry,'' Tautkus said.
</P>
<P>
   The security aide blinked. His last name was Perry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't by any chance know her father's first name, do
you?'' Perry asked.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact he did, Tautkus said. They knew each other
from the Masons. His first name was Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck. Charles. Nah, it couldn't be, could it, Chuck Perry
thought? This couldn't be my son. She couldn't be my granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got home that night, I didn't know what to do,'' Chuck
Perry said Friday. ``It had been 35 years since I had last seen my
son. He was 5 when his mother and I divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it had been a pretty bitter, bad one,'' he
said. ``What if I called him up now, and he didn't want to have
anything to do with me?''
</P>
<P>
   Perry kept looking down at the phone number Tautkus had given
him, finally reaching for the phone. There was only one way to find
out, he knew. He dialed the number and got an answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Perry, this is Charles Perry, too,'' he said into the
machine. ``Would you please call me back, it's important. I think
there's a chance we may have something more than the same name in
common.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got home later, the younger Charles Perry listened to
the message on his answering machine, sensing something big was
about to happen in his life. Something he had been hoping for since
he was a young boy. He dialed the number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him two questions when he called back,'' Chuck Perry
said. ``His mother's name, and the names of his two sisters. They
were both right.''
</P>
<P>
   The men let silence hang on the line for a few seconds before
Chuck finally spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know who this is?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father?'' Charles Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, your father.''
</P>
<P>
   They're a real family now, Heather Perry said. No more
wondering, no more hoping her dad and the grandfather she never
knew would have the chance to be father and son again. They have
it.
</P>
<P>
   It is pretty wonderful and strange, her dad agrees. For the last
seven years, he's been living less than two miles away from his
father, and their paths never crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on a great relationship now,'' said Charles
Perry, a machinist. ``Catching up on a lot of lost time together as
a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Perry said not a day has gone by in his life since divorce
that he didn't think of his kids -- his son, Charles, and the two
daughters he's also re-establishing himself with now.
</P>
<P>
   When divorce gets ugly, people get hurt and separated. His
family was no different, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part for me has been Heather,'' Chuck Perry said.
``Seeing her every day around the campus, and thinking, There goes
my granddaughter. I'm a very lucky man.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a high school band director who looked at a girl in
his class one day and thought to himself she could be the daughter
of the campus security aide.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't. She was the granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those stories you shake your head at and say, ``Nah,
no way, couldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did.

MILLER SEETHING OVER FASSEL'S `NO INJURED' EDICT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corey Miller spent more than seven years as a linebacker for the
Giants. He played through severely sprained ankles and broken ribs
and, most recently, had a bulging disk in his neck that threatened
his spinal cord if he took another hard hit. Miller did not mind
sacrificing his body, because he was highly paid for it. And
moreover, the Giants always treated him like family.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Miller said he was shocked when asked to leave the
field before a Giants home game this season because of Coach Jim
Fassel's rule that prohibits injured players from being around the
team. Miller said he was stopped from entering the Giants' locker
room for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of teams' handling of injured players has long been a
sensitive one in the National Football League. An ESPN report
earlier this season in which injured players emotionally discussed
their feelings made clear the extreme upset they can endure.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches like Fassel and Miami's Jimmy Johnson do not like having
injured players around practices or games because they consider
them a distraction. Unlike Johnson, Fassel will make exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who said the swelling from the disk between his sixth
and seventh vertebrae has improved dramatically and hopes to make a
comeback with some other team, said not being allowed around his
teammates was crushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone from being angry to being humiliated to being angry
again,'' he said. ``I'm not going to take this lying down. I'm
going to fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   After sustaining the neck injury last August, Miller could not
play this season, but he still wanted to watch practices and be on
the sideline during games. He came to the season opener against
Washington on Sept. 6 and was on the field before the game,
speaking to teammates and coaches, when the Giants' trainer, Ronnie
Barnes, approached.
</P>
<P>
   Miller recalled, ``Ronnie came over and said: `You can't be on
the field. Jim doesn't want injured guys around.' The coach of the
Redskins was asking how I was doing, but my own coach was telling
me to leave the field?''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he then approached the locker room to clean out his
belongings, but was told by a team security official that he could
not go in. Miller said he was offered a ticket so he could watch
the game in the stands. He declined.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Miller said, cornerback Jason Sehorn, wearing a
brace because of season-ending knee surgery, greeted Miller and the
security official and proceeded into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was not allowed in, but Jason was?'' said Miller. ``It
made me wonder, `What kind of double standard is going on here?'
Why bend the rules for one guy and not the other? Teammates were
telling me Jason was in the locker room all the time. When I would
watch games on television, Brian Williams, who was out with an eye
injury, was always on the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller remained angry all season and finally met with the Giants
on Jan. 7. He and his agent, Ray Anderson, met with Fassel and
General Manager Ernie Accorsi at Giants Stadium for an
uncomfortable two hours. Miller said he and Fassel argued back and
forth, with the bulk of the conversation dealing with what Miller
perceived to be a double standard between him and Sehorn.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants declined to comment on the specifics of Miller's
accusations. Privately, however, team officials have confirmed that
Miller was barred from the locker room and was asked to leave the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Giants officials said the team implemented a policy preventing
anyone except owners, coaches and noninjured players from entering
the pre-game locker room. The policy was implemented, the officials
said, because the locker room had become too much like a social
club, with players even being asked to sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also said that Miller never asked about the policy.
If he had, they said, this might have prevented his later
embarrassment. They added that Sehorn was excused from the rule on
several occasions for personal reasons after he discussed them to
the team, and the Giants thought that an exception in his case
needed to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tension between Miller and Fassel has to do with
their stormy personal relationship. Miller missed a voluntary June
camp for personal reasons, which upset Fassel. Miller also showed
up at camp in August carrying 12 extra pounds, again irritating
Fassel. Miller said the added weight was muscle and came from
having taken creatine, a supplement used by many players.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Fassel may disagree about much in their relationship,
but one thing is clear: A coach may risk alienating players if his
rule about not having injured players around the team is not
thoroughly explained to each of them.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why some players may hate such a rule.
With injuries such a key part of the game, it is disconcerting to a
player to know that one minute he may be risking serious injury to
play, and the next minute the team may not want him around because
he is hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the rule say it simply keeps players focused.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Miller, 30, a sixth-round draft pick who was second
on the team in sacks with six and a half in his third year, 1993,
will try to restart his career. He knows he will not be with the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching List Swells
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's program of videotaping coaches for a database that
owners can review when looking for candidates continues. And now,
more names of coaches taking part in the program are beginning to
leak out.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty pro coaches and seven college coaches have been
identified as potential candidates in a memo sent to team
executives by Roger Goodell, the N.F.L.'s executive vice president
in charge of league and football development.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the NFL assistants named were Green Bay's Emmitt Thomas
and Sherman Lewis, Oakland's Wille Shaw, Kansas City's Jimmy Raye,
Cincinnati's Jim Anderson, Jacksonville's Dick Jauron and Chris
Palmer, the former Carolina assistant Vic Fangio, Pittsburgh's Jim
Haslett, Denver's Gary Kubiak, Minnesota's Brian Billick, Atlanta's
Art Shell, the Jets' Bill Belichick, and the Giants' John Fox and
Johnnie Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   Of the college coaches, the most notable are Stanford's Tyrone
Willingham, Miami's Butch Davis, Michigan State's Nick Saban and
Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many of the candidates will actually take part
in the program, which is designed in large part to improve the
hiring chances of minority candidates. About half the coaches on
the list are black and about half are white.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Montana Throws a Pass &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch this week signed with the agent
Tom Condon. How did Condon get him? Couch recently went to dinner
with the Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana, another Condon
client, and that basically sealed the deal. Couch is expected to be
the first pick in the April draft. &QL;

CHILDREN AND KEYBOARDS: TOO MANY BAD FITS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Nev., Pa., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By PAMELA MENDELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some elementary school computers are set up without
accommodation for healthy typing postures, and that could put
children at risk of developing the painful repetitive stress
injuries that have plagued office workers in recent years,
according to a study by researchers at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, which is to be published in the May issue of the
journal Computers in the Schools, researchers observed 95
elementary schoolchildren from 11 schools as they worked at
computers in classrooms and computer labs. The study found
``striking misfits'' between the children and the computer
workstations.
</P>
<P>
   In all of the setups, for example, keyboards were placed higher
than recommended for children and in most cases the computer
monitors were too high as well. That means the children are seated
in ways that encourage craned necks, hunched shoulders, awkwardly
placed wrists and other unhealthy postures, said Shawn Oates, the
principal author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The study concludes that because children are spending only
limited amounts of time at school computers, they are only at
``moderate postural risk.'' But Ms. Oates said in an interview this
week that classroom computer setups deserved close watching because
of a nationwide push to get computers into schools and the
increasing amount of time children spent using them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to monitor the situation as we encourage children to
use computers on a more frequent basis at home and school,'' said
Ms. Oates, who wrote the study as a master's thesis at the College
of Human Ecology at Cornell. ``We need to see what develops.''
</P>
<P>
   LaMont Johnson, the editor of Computers in the Schools, said the
study was the first he had seen examining the ergonomics, or safe
design, of computer furnishings in public elementary schools.
Johnson is a professor of educational psychology, with an emphasis
on the use of technology in education, at the University of Nevada
at Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Cornell are also looking at other aspects of
computer use and children. In a separate study, published this
month in the Journal of Research on Computing in Education,
researchers found that a group of middle-school children worked in
healthier positions when given adjustable trays for holding the
keyboard and mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Older students have complained of problems, too. A 1996 survey
of 350 professors, graduate students and staff members at Carnegie
Mellon University, for example, found that 22 percent of
respondents reported symptoms of repetitive stress injury that they
attributed to typing.
</P>
<P>
   There is little research on the rate of repetitive stress
injuries among children, said Alan Hedge, a professor of human
factors and ergonomics at Cornell and a co-author of the middle
school and the elementary school studies. Hedge said he feared that
in their eagerness to get technology into schools, officials are
paying scant attention to safe design.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to alert schools to the fact that when they are
planning to include computer use, they should pay some attention to
these kinds of issues,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the study of elementary students, Ms. Oates examined schools
in three diverse districts _ one suburban, one rural and one urban
_ but the results suggested that a larger sample of schools needed
to be examined for definitive results.
</P>
<P>
   There are many issues the study does not address. Among them are
the amount of time children are spending on computers and the
interplay between home and school computer use, said Robin Mary
Gillespie, an ergonomics specialist at the Center for Occupational
and Environmental Health at Hunter College in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It is also not known whether children, whose bodies are more
supple than adults', may be less susceptible to repetitive stress
injuries, said Dr. Robert Markison, a San Francisco hand surgeon
who specializes in repetitive stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Another unknown, said David Rempel, a physician and director of
the ergonomics program at the University of California at San
Francisco, is whether the cumulative effects of young children's
work in poor postures could lead to injuries later in life.
</P>
<P>
   But after reviewing Ms. Oates' study, Rempel, Markison and Ms.
Gillespie agreed that it pointed to a concern: Schools may be
failing to teach children facing a future of heavy computer work to
use healthy work postures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are taught something and don't have the right
equipment, you are not going to be ingrained with the right
habits,'' Rempel said.

   LOS ANGELES -- When the Northridge Earthquake hit Jan. 17, 1994,
at 4:31 a.m., the swath of destruction included Mike Eller's
collection of English china -- and his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally lost my nerves. It was a trigger that really set me
off,'' he said, adding that since that day he has suffered heart
problems, depression and panic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it also brought the 57-year-old computer consultant closer
to his neighbors in suburban Winnetka in the San Fernando Valley
area of Los Angeles, and spurred him to prepare for the likelihood
of another quake.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Eller's experiences reflect those of us all.
Still, for every person who survived the 6.7-magnitude earthquake
there is a story as unique as Eller's.
</P>
<P>
   Some people shaken from bed resolved never to be caught unaware
again, and laid in supplies for The Big One. Others unwilling to
endure another quake simply packed up and left town.
</P>
<P>
   Some soldiered through the aftershocks and years of recovery and
now barely think of it. And still others look back on the
earthquake with curious fondness, choosing to remember the good
deeds and heroism in its aftermath. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; While many still mourn the the 57 confirmed deaths from the
quake, Valentine and Christina Rodriguez rejoice over their
``miracle baby.''
</P>
<P>
   When the quake hit, their son Johnnie was 12 days old and in
intensive care at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where he
wasn't expected to survive a bout with jaundice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up yelling, `My baby, my baby,' '' Christina said, when
she felt the tremor at their home in Moorpark. And the couple's
anxiety deepened when it took them two days to learn he had been
transferred to a Tarzana hospital from the damaged Northridge
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to just keep cool,'' Valentine said. ``I kept telling
her, He's in good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Johnnie is a typical 5-year-old, with bright eyes he
bashfully averts from strangers, and no signs of after-effects from
the quake or the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our miracle baby,'' said Christina, who relives her
elation by watching tapes of news accounts that revealed her boy
was at the Tarzana hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people went through a lot of things that day,''
Valentine added. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The temblor hurled Mayor Richard Riordan from a sound sleep to
the floor of his Brentwood home. He immediately tried his telephone
and cell phone, but neither worked, so he donned his sweats and
drove to the city's emergency operations center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a life where I've had enough crises,'' Riordan said.
``You don't get scared. You just go forward and do things.''
</P>
<P>
   That day five years ago was filled with see-saw emotions for
firefighter Mike Henry -- elation and pride at the lives saved, and
sadness for those who couldn't be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, a hook-and-ladder driver with the Los Angeles Fire
Department, pulled Jerry Prezioso to safety after he had been
pinned for six hours from the waist down when the Northridge
Meadows apartments collapsed in Northridge, about 25 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Prezioso, 73, recalls the incident with laughs and jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the good people die,'' Prezioso cracked, and guessed that
it's not yet time to meet his maker. ``He keeps throwing me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the earthquake, Prezioso said, ``I don't particularly
like to discuss it, but I don't avoid it. There's going to be more
tragedies, and people need to have hope.''
</P>
<P>
   So Prezioso tries to do his part by spreading encouragement
through humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, laughter is the best medicine in the world. It makes
you forget about the pain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Henry said he doesn't dwell on the events of that day -- the
emergencies he faces every day at work prevent that. He thinks
about Northridge only when an anniversary reminds him, or when
Prezioso stops by the fire station with a bottle of homemade
marinara sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good friendship, and I'm sure it will be
lifelong,'' Henry said of their rapport, which started when they
talked for an hour while Prezioso lay buried. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; It's the cooperation and compassion that arose in the quake's
aftermath that enables Dr. Pamela Davis to look back on the day
with some good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have good memories, once we got back our water and
electricity,'' said Davis of Northridge Hospital Medical Center.
``Everyone pulled together.''
</P>
<P>
   The quake displaced scores of people, who camped in parks or
parking lots near the hospital and lacked food or supplies for
their babies.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, her husband, Dr. Carl Jonokuchi, and some colleagues
decided to raise money for the needy and started selling T-shirts
with a map of the hospital site and the date of the earthquake on
the front. Printed on the back was ``Northridge Hospital Medical
Center,'' with ``Medical Center'' crossed out and replaced with
``epicenter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made 20 and ended up selling 2,000,'' Davis said. The
$10,000 raised went to the homeless surrounding the hospital for
food, diapers, medicine and other supplies. She said her family
also took two doctors into their home in the San Fernando Valley
community of West Hills after theirs had been destroyed. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A Los Angeles native, Eller said he'd survived other
earthquakes, including one in the San Fernando Valley community of
Sylmar in 1971. ``Nothing has bothered me like this quake has,'' he
added quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is good that springs from tragedy. Eller said the
quake bonded him and his neighbors, as residents on his cul-de-sac
fired up barbecue grills to feed each other, and scooped out pool
water to flush toilets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had something to give each other,'' said Eller, who
retired from Pacific Bell and now works as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others around the city, he said he sought
psychological help to deal with his fears in the months and years
that followed the quake. But now he feels he could cope if another
``big one'' hit today.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: he feels he could cope if another ``big one'' hit
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some minor shakers. I could feel them but I didn't
feel the beginnings of a panic attack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the quake did spur him to buy a 26-foot travel trailer and
stock it with food and other supplies. Just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can live in it. Wherever, whenever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Roller said the earthquake cost him much more than the mere
expense of rebuilding his home. He blames it for the loss of his
wife, Beatrice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stress of the earthquake brought on her death,'' said the
78-year-old resident of the San Fernando Valley community of Studio
City. He believes the breast cancer that killed her two years ago
originated with her trauma from the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to grieving for his spouse, Roller has had to
wrestle with his insurance company for a settlement, and then
redecorate alone the condominium where only a year before the
earthquake he and his wife had picked out every curtain, every
knickknack, every stick of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   But he was determined to rebuild -- to honor his wife's memory,
to please his children, and because he had nowhere else he wanted
to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of nights I was back were very traumatic. I
had sleeplessness, a loss of appetite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still traumatic, but not as much,'' Roller said. ``Time
heals all wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   And, having already lost something he can't replace, Roller is
philosophical about the threat of another earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell, if it's going to happen, it's going to
happen,'' he said. ``If it does happen, I'm not going to rebuild.''

NORTH KOREA AND U.S. MEET OVER INSPECTION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ With tensions rising on the Korean peninsula, the
United States and North Korea opened new talks here Saturday over
whether North Korea would allow inspections of a suspected
underground nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which are to continue Sunday, precede a new round of
four-way meetings planned here next week aimed at reaching a formal
peace treaty for the peninsula, where war ended 46 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the fourth such gathering in the past 13 months of
North and South Korea and their chief allies, China and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks North Korea has issued a series of unusually
belligerent statements, threatening that the United States ``will
be reduced to ashes and will no longer exist if they ignite the
train of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks follow a visit to South Korea by Secretary of Defense
William Cohen, who agreed on Friday with his South Korean
counterpart to strengthen their military alliance to counter ``a
wide range of possible threats'' from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Among the security concerns are the suspected underground
nuclear site and the North's missile capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the North launched a three-stage rocket over Japan,
catching American intelligence by surprise. The test demonstrated
that North Korean missiles could reach as far as Tokyo and all
major American military bases in South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond concerns over the missile program, satellite photos have
fueled suspicions that North Korea may also be developing one or
more underground nuclear installations.
</P>
<P>
   The activity has raised concerns in the Clinton administration
that the North will scuttle a 1994 accord that guarantees
international aid in return for a pledge from the North to freeze
its nuclear weapons effort.
</P>
<P>
   The accord also promised North Korea heavy fuel oil and two
nuclear power plants that would produce radioactive waste that
would be more difficult to turn into warheads.
</P>
<P>
   But the North has repeatedly accused Washington of not keeping
its end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Since last August, administration officials have been seeking
access to a vast underground installation in North Korea near
Kumchangri, about 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon. The site, the
topic of three previous rounds of talks, is expected to be the
prime topic Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   During his trip to Asia, Cohen said there was ``sufficient
evidence to be suspicious of that site.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   North Korea's response to demands for access has only added to
the anxieties. Initially officials demanded $300 million for a
visit, which was rejected. More recently they suggested that food
aid could win entry. Washington has already donated substantial
food supplies, including grain, to the famine-stricken North.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has argued that opening the site to outside scrutiny
can jeopardize its national security. And in December, North Korea
announced it was prepared to launch another medium-range missile.
</P>
<P>
   A second missile test could jeopardize congressional approval of
any further role in the 1994 accord. Congressional review of the
pact is expected by May.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering the administration's stand, Cohen's trip to East Asia
began with a declaration in Japan that it was important to
``maintain a very strong deterrent against any attack upon the
South or upon Japan on the part of North Korea.'' In South Korea,
where 37,000 American troops are stationed, Cohen reportedly
approved that nation's development of longer-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean missile development has so far been curbed because
of American concerns about proliferation. The specifics of the new
U.S.-South Korea arrangement have not yet been worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the tensions, China's official news agency said, ``It
seems rather unjustified and ridiculous that the United States
should demand that it can monitor another country's activities
simply because it merely suspects that country is up to no good.''

SANCTIONED BURUNDI ANTICIPATES BREATHING EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi _ No gasoline is supposed to come into
Burundi, yet the streets here are full of cars. No commercial
flights are supposed to arrive, yet cargo planes land regularly
from Belgium and the United Arab Emirates, full of foreign goods
that no one here is supposed to get: radios, Moet &AMP; Chandon
Champagne, whisky, cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The strict economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by its
neighbors in August 1996 have not worked out exactly as planned.
</P>
<P>
   And now it looks increasingly likely that Burundi's neighbors
will decide late this week to suspend the sanctions, in an
acknowledgment that they have outlived their usefulness and may be
doing more harm than good to Burundi's fragile peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension of the sanctions is being awaited with great hope in
Burundi. They have become an all-purpose demon, cited as the cause
of everything from stunningly high prices, which is true, to the
continuation of ethnic and regional violence in Burundi, which
seems less certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the sanctions are lifted, people will live together
happily, with no problems,'' Marcel Averimana, 25, a shoe seller in
the main market in Bujumbura, said optimistically. Since a civil
war broke out in 1993, 200,000 people have been killed in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, a suspension of sanctions would be likely over time
to decrease prices, stimulate the economy and give the population a
psychological push toward normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   But there are dangers. It might also lead rebel fighters who
support the sanctions to increase their violence. In addition, some
outside officials are worried about the effect a suspension could
have on the stability of the government of Maj. Pierre Buyoya, who
led the coup in July 1996 that prompted the sanctions in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things do not improve when the sanctions are lifted,'' said
one relief agency official here, ``then this government has a
problem, maybe, because the expectations are very high.'' The
official spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In a search for regional stability in 1996, a group of East
African nations _including Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya,
Ethiopia and Zaire (now Congo) _ protested the coup by cutting
trade and transportation links to landlocked Burundi. Under the
embargo the countries, which surround Burundi, make use of their
roads and airspace off limits to people and goods bound there.
</P>
<P>
   There were several goals. One was to force Buyoya, who is Tutsi
and to some degree represents the powerful ethnic minority of Tutsi
who run Burundi, to negotiate with Hutu rebels. People from the
Hutu ethnic group make up 85 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Julius Nyerere, the former Tanzanian president, the
neighboring countries also demanded that Buyoya form a Tutsi-Hutu
coalition government and restore both the National Assembly and the
constitution drafted in 1993. He complied with their demands.
</P>
<P>
   International organizations did not oppose the sanctions
initially, in part because they were regarded as a local solution
to a local problem. But now there is much debate about whether they
were a success and how the tactic might affect other regional
efforts, ranging from peacekeeping to economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first year, smuggling became institutionalized as
goods leaked through the borders in vast quantities. Local
merchants, many from the Tutsi elite, made fortunes charging
wartime prices for basic goods. Their foreign partners, many
critics maintain, were often officials from the governments that
had imposed the sanctions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While goods like gasoline and luxury items were smuggled in
because they were profitable, relief officials say that necessities
like medicine and fertilizer often did not make it through. And
although merchants have few problems getting goods in, the costs
have doubled, tripled or more while salaries have remained flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy, but it's expensive,'' said Thomas Bangurambona,
37, a minister who was shopping at a market stall stocked with
biscuits from Oman, toothbrushes from Uganda and notebooks from
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the borders are porous, many experts argue, the
sanctions succeeded in that they caused enough hardship to force
Buyoya to negotiate with the rebels and other Hutu groups.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks began last summer in Arusha, Tanzania, and are
scheduled to resume Jan. 23. The main Hutu opposition party, the
Front for Democracy in Burundi, says Buyoya has also complied with
demands for greater power-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly brought Buyoya to the table,'' said a U.N.
official in New York, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It's
not perfect. But it's certainly a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, though, even supporters of the sanctions, like
the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, have
urged that they be lifted. These groups argue that the effect on
Burundians has been too harsh and that the sanctions have killed
any economic progress in a country already isolated and desperately
impoverished. Several officials say they also worry that Tutsi
hard-liners may topple the government, or force Buyoya to end the
peace talks, unless some concrete gesture is made toward easing
economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. official said that Nyerere, the leader of the peace
talks, has said privately that at the Arusha talks he will urge a
suspension, not an outright lifting, of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   One major worry, officials say, is whether once sanctions are
withdrawn Buyoya will renege on his commitment to the peace talks.
Several outside officials said he seemed committed to the talks and
understood that any gains, with both the Hutu opposition and
international groups, would be wiped away if he backed out.
</P>
<P>
   And they point to his unusual provenance: Buyoya has taken power
twice by force, the first time in 1987, but he also has the odd
distinction of having given up power after organizing, and losing,
Burundi's first elections in 1993. The winner, the Hutu politician
Melchior Ndadaye, was assassinated soon after taking office,
igniting the violence that is now in its fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya's spokesman, Apollinaire Gahungu, said the stakes were
too high for the president to give up his commitment to peace
talks. Denis Nshimirimana, a Hutu opposition politician who is the
minister of public works, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone comes today and says he does not want to
negotiate,'' he said, ``nobody will support him. To say you don't
want to negotiate, that means you want to fight.''

RACE WEEK BECKONS BEST ITALIAN SAILORS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA LLOYD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An annual regatta on the warm, aquamarine seas off Key West,
Fla., is a winter magnet for many of the most competitive sailboats
in the United States. But this year, foreign teams, especially the
Italians, are flocking to the regatta as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Of the record 276 yachts expected to compete this week at the
GMC Yukon Yachting Key West Race Week, 37 are from 18 foreign
countries. But the team with the biggest presence is from Italy.
Six boats, twice as many as last year, are most likely to make
other sailors take notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italians are always incredibly competitive,'' Ken Read,
twice United States yachtsman of the year, said last week from
Newport, R.I. ``I sailed against some of them last fall at a world
championship in Hilton Head, S.C. They were the best prepared,
sailed the best boat, and were the fastest on the water. They're
not to be taken lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Italian contenders at Key West is a three-boat team
led by Breeze, a Farr 49 owned by Paolo Gaia of Milan. Its crew
makes no secret of its intention to use Key West as a training
ground for winning the Admiral's Cup next summer off England.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italian Sailing Federation has committed us to racing in
Key West,'' Tommaso Chieffi of Italy, helmsman for the 49-foot
Breeze, said in a recent telephone interview from Milan. ``They are
making it part of our selection trials for the Admiral's Cup. There
are not many opportunities to train and practice here in Europe. It
is a great chance for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italians' hopes are tangled in a lost laurel at the 1997
Admiral's Cup. A freshening breeze allowed competing boats in the
final Fastnet Race that year to overtake Brava, the Italian leader.
It was enough to allow the United States to win over all instead.
</P>
<P>
   So focused are the Italians on winning next time that they are
looking at every ngle. By entering two of their new Sydney 40
yachts in Key West Race Week, they will be racing each other in a
mixed fleet. They are the only two boats of that design entered,
leaving race officials no choice but to place them in their own
handicap division.
</P>
<P>
   But the Italians don't care. The Sydney 40 is one of three new
designs required under Admiral's Cup team racing rules. That makes
it a necessary component of the nation's Admiral's Cup selection
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a strange deal,'' said Dave Ullman, a sailmaker from
Newport Beach, Calif., who will crew on Seven Things, one of the
two Sydney 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be match-racing with each other to see who will be
first,'' Ullman said. ``What all the other boats in the class are
doing will be secondary. It is not a normal situation at all, which
will complicate things for the Italians enormously.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a long train of events that carries Italy's
momentum. ``They work on end-sight goals,'' Read said. ``Americans
tend to compete on an event-to-event basis. Every goal is
individualized. But the Italians are always looking at the end of
the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   For American sailors, Key West is one of those isolated goals.
Competition is apt to be intense regardless of which handicap rule
or one-design class a team belongs to. Among the top United States
sailors competing will be Ed Baird, Peter Holmberg, Peter Isler,
Gavin Brady, Harry Melges, Philip Garland and Vince Brun.
</P>
<P>
   International helmsmen include Russell Coutts of New Zealand,
the America's Cup skipper; and Karol Jablonski, of Germany, a
four-time iceboat world champion.
</P>
<P>
   In the team racing division, 10 groups will be competing with
three boats each. The winner of the team event will be determined
by overall scores from competition in each boat's respective class.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big boats competing in team racing are: Exposure, a
Castro 50 from the Netherlands; Beau Geste, a Farr 49 from China;
Rubin XV, a Judel-Vrolick 49 from Germany; Numbers, a Taylor 49
from New Zealand; Hi Fling, a Carroll Marine 60 from England; and
Idler, a Nelson/Marek 50 from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The competition calls for eight windward-leeward races from
Monday through Friday this week. Unlike in other national regattas,
the competition officials are not allowing teams to discard their
worst-place finishes.

JAPAN PARTY'S NEW COALITION PARTNER SEEN AS `TIGER IN THE TENT'
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The coalition announced last week by Japan's governing
Liberal Democratic Party with the smaller Liberal Party was clearly
calculated to gain support in Parliament, but it may amount to more
trouble than it is worth, political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The new alliance pulls the Liberal Democrats farther to the
right, but it appears to have been based as much on arithmetic as
anything else. Although the party controls the Lower House, it
desperately needs more votes in the Upper House. It lost many seats
there in elections last summer, when the electorate turned out in
record numbers to vote for opposition party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much has been said about the seeming significance of the
realignment,'' the Japan Times, an English-language daily, said of
the new coalition in a lead editorial Friday. ``But it seems to
have ended up, essentially, as another political numbers game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberal Democrats could have used a better calculator.
Their alliance with the Liberals, the fourth-largest opposition
party, still leaves them 10 votes short of an outright majority in
the unruly Upper House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make it less likely that there will be elections any
time soon, and thus we have the primary reason for making the
coalition in the first place,'' said John Neuffer, senior political
analyst at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute. ``But I think the
LDP has bought itself a lot of trouble. It has let a tiger back
into the tent.''
</P>
<P>
   That tiger is Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa, whose 1993
defection from the ruling party toppled it from power for the first
time since the 1950s. It returned to power in 1994 but only as part
of unstable coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Having Ozawa on board moves the Liberal Democrats decidedly to
the right. Whether Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi can manage the
internally fractious party from the right instead of its
traditional centrist position remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risky position for him,'' said Ikuo Kabashima, a
political- science professor at Tokyo University. ``It makes the
division between political parties here much clearer, and that
could be an opening for the opposition if the Liberal Democrats
make any mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, who is the closest thing Japanese politics has to a
neo-conservative of the Thatcher-Reagan mold, is a proponent of
smaller government and a bolder defense policy, which is a touchy
subject here.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the coalition almost foundered over Ozawa's demand for
a higher-profile role for Japanese forces involved in military
peacekeeping operations, including broadening the U.S.-Japanese
defense relationship. Ozawa and his supporters in the governing
party favor proposed legislation that would allow Japanese forces
to support U.S. forces in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Younger governing party leaders and opposition parties are
staunchly opposed to expanding the role of the Self Defense Forces,
as is much of the public. Indeed, many have speculated that Ozawa's
real aim in establishing a coalition is to split the governing
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ozawa is trying to deliver a punch to the ruling
party,'' Yukio Hatoyama, deputy secretary general of the Democratic
Party of Japan, the largest opposition party, said in an interview
when the Liberal Democrats and the Liberals were just beginning
their courtship.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Ozawa's power, however, is unclear. Although the
Liberals did win their demands for a smaller Cabinet, they won only
one seat for themselves.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, Joy Chatel appeared in Civil Court in
Brooklyn to account for her $7,000 unpaid gas bill. A contractor
had bilked her out of $40,000, she told the judge, forcing her to
close her beauty parlor. She had no income and four grandchildren
to raise. When her husband died at about this same time, she had to
barter two years of free hairstyling for a proper funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The judge instructed the lawyers from Brooklyn Union Gas Co. to
work out a payment plan with Ms. Chatel, and the lawyers handed her
account to Kristen Yontz. Ms. Yontz, though, is not a bill
collector. She is a social worker, part of the utility's experiment
in getting people to pay their bills by helping them straighten out
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   She has met regularly with Ms. Chatel, advising her on
low-interest loans, enrolling her in a grandparents support group,
steering her to federal emergency funds and, significantly for
Brooklyn Union, placing her on a flexible repayment plan. Ms.
Chatel is still struggling, but she has reopened her beauty parlor
and soon plans to rent the top two floors of her building.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help me manage,'' Ms. Chatel said.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities, which for decades have operated as regulated
quasi-governmental entities, have provided some aid and emergency
help to their low-income customers. Many collect fuel funds, which
are emergency grants for customers about to be cut off, as well as
weatherization programs and other services. But in these last few
years of shrinking government benefits, Brooklyn Union and a small
group of other utilities across the nation have gone one step
further, into a realm once reserved for nonprofit social service
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   At Brooklyn Union, Ms. Yontz is one of four certified social
workers in what the utility calls its On Track program; in three
years, its clients have reduced their arrears by an average of 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, which has one of the nation's first and most
extensive welfare-to-work programs, Wisconsin Gas works with
nonprofit agencies to offer social services for low-income
customers in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   And since 1994, a staff of 15 at Baltimore Gas &AMP; Electric,
including several social workers, have offered counseling, job
referrals and other services to about 3,000 low-income Maryland
families every year. ``As the social service community began to
scale back in some of the services they had provided, we began to
develop some of the needed assistance programs,'' said Don Dasher,
the utility's director of customer assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But if these initiatives are admired, they are not necessarily
imitated. Nationally, as the industry undergoes deregulation, many
utilities that once operated as regional monopolies are now cutting
costs to prepare for competition. Because low-income programs often
do not pay for themselves, some utilities are quietly eliminating
them.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. in Detroit recently discontinued a
program much like the one now offered by Brooklyn Union, in part, a
company official said, to prepare for deregulation. Last year, the
New York State Electric &AMP; Gas Corp., an upstate utility, had
proposed eliminating one of its two low-income programs. After
criticism from advocacy groups, the New York Public Service
Commission, which regulates utilities in the state, required the
company to continue and expand the program. But advocates for
low-income customers warn that other utilities could also try to
eliminate such programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could happen is that an outside supplier of natural gas
who is located in, say, Texas, is not committed to the people
Brooklyn Union has been serving for the last 20 years,'' said Jim
Benfield, executive director of Campaign to Keep America Warm, a
low-income advocacy group in Washington. ``In order to stay
competitive, Brooklyn Union is going to have to get out of the
social service business.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a buoyant national economy, advocates say, large numbers
of low-income customers continue to struggle to meet their utility
bills, particularly during the bitter cold of winter. For
competitive reasons, Brooklyn Union refused to release the dollar
amount of unpaid bills due the company. But in Ohio, which collects
such statistics on a statewide basis, the dollar amount of unpaid
bills by all low-income utility customers has risen to about $110
million in 1998 from $48 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation, advocates say, is Congress' cutting the federal
emergency relief program for the poor, known as the Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program. Its funding has fallen to $1.1 billion
this year from $2.1 billion in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn Union, which supplies natural gas to 1.1 million
customers in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, began On Track as
part of a rate agreement with the Public Service Commission that
also created the utility's current holding company, Keyspan Energy.
Before On Track, company officials commissioned an internal study
in 1992 and 1993 that found that 43 percent of the company's
delinquent residential customers were considered low income, or
about 150 percent of the federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Today, On Track is two-pronged: 1,500 delinquent low-income
customers are selected each year. Most of these customers receive
telephone counseling, money management advice, a video cassette
recorder, a series of instructive videos and a magenta box to help
organize their bills. As an incentive, participants in the program
are forgiven $400 against unpaid bills. Of the overall group, 250
customers, usually with debts greater than $1,000, are assigned a
social worker.
</P>
<P>
   The program costs slightly more than $1 million a year, said
James M. Jacob, the manager of Brooklyn Union's consumer advocacy
division. He said the program essentially pays for itself by
reducing the company's overall collection costs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yontz, the 27-year-old daughter of an Illinois farmer, knew
very little about utilities when she joined Brooklyn Union in
October 1995. She had decided to become a social worker after a job
in a soup kitchen, and was completing her master's degree in social
work at Columbia University when she heard about the job at
Brooklyn Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really strange,'' Ms. Yontz said. ``I feel like I say all
the time, `Yes, I am a social worker, and yes, I work for the gas
company.'''
</P>
<P>
   She now rattles around Brooklyn in a company sedan, calling on
about 50 ``clients'' in a job that seems equal parts cheerleader
and trouble-shooter. Usually, the people she meets hover just above
poverty line: grandparents on fixed incomes or people like Ms.
Chatel, whose modest income falls short of her monthly expenses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to teach people not to live in crisis, and maybe
learn different behavior so they are not living crisis to crisis
and month to month,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yontz describes part of her duties as ``advocating,'' or
navigating the social service system, whether government or
nonprofit, to find any and all benefits that a client might qualify
for without knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as adviser, Ms. Yontz says she often has to help
people make difficult decisions. When she and Ms. Chatel discussed
ways to earn more income, they decided to rent the two floors atop
the beauty parlor to help meet the mortgage. But doing so meant
telling Ms. Chatel's 26-year-old son to move out and find a job.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Norlander, deputy director of Public Utility Law Project,
an advocacy group for low-income customers based in Albany,
commended On Track as a responsible collections program. But
Norlander said the Public Service Commission needs to place as much
emphasis on rate reductions for the poor as on collection programs.
In Massachusetts, he said low-income customers qualify for rate
reductions of up to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamental affordability is a major issue that must be
addressed, and it has not been addressed by the Public Service
Commission,'' Norlander said. ``They're only giving it lip
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Flanagan, a spokesman for the commission, said that
officials were aware of the problems facing poor customers in a
deregulated environment and that the commission was experimenting
with pilot programs in two upstate counties to find ways to hold
down rates.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Yontz, deregulation and its potential problems are just
distant, unheard noise by the people she serves. Last week, she
visited Samuel Wilson, a 92-year-old Jamaican immigrant, now a U.S.
citizen, who lives alone in a small apartment in Canarsie,
Brooklyn. Wilson had received $129 every month in food stamps for
more years than he can remember when, last year, the benefit
inexplicably stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yontz intervened, discovering that Wilson had either failed
to fill out necessary paperwork or the form simply had not been
sent. She quickly organized his application and appeared at the
welfare office on his behalf. While Wilson waited two months for
his food stamps to be restored, Ms. Yontz and social workers from a
social service agency arranged for meals from a food pantry.
</P>
<P>
   When Wilson's landlord recently sold the Canarsie row house, Ms.
Yontz helped Wilson navigate the social-service bureaucracy,
finding him a subsidized studio apartment in Far Rockaway, Queens.
He will likely move later this month. ``You can't imagine how happy
I am to have you here today,'' Wilson told Ms. Yontz before she
left last week. ``I wish you were here all day to talk to, to cheer
me up.''

MEXICO CITY POLICE CHIEF PURGES TOP BRASS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SAM DILLON

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Alejandro Gertz, the Mexico City police chief, sat
at his desk at headquarters the other day reviewing the dismal
results from a recent inspection that led him to dismiss six of his
seven top police commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This officer wasn't at his post,'' Gertz said, leafing through
a stack of inspection reports. ``This guy didn't have his weapon.
This one had taken his badge off. Here's a fellow driving his
patrol car outside his precinct. This guy was asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This can't continue!'' Gertz said, slamming his hand on his
desk. ``I won't be held hostage to corruption and sloth.''
</P>
<P>
   His dismissal of the six top commanders this month was his most
forceful action since Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the city's reformist
mayor, appointed him in August to modernize the force. He said the
dismissed officers had been systematically undermining his
campaigns against graft, inefficiency and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never told me, `I'm not going to obey this order,' ''
Gertz said. ``They just wouldn't do what I told them, so what could
I do but get rid of them?''
</P>
<P>
   The dismissed officers included the chief of operations and all
five regional commanders, who oversaw the 52 precincts and 36,000
uniformed officers. The only top commander to survive the purge was
Gertz's chief of staff, Miguel Gonzalo Adalid.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 7, the police chief dismissed five more senior
commanders, all members of the headquarters staff.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took office, Gertz said, he has set up a computerized
statistical system that allows him to track crime rates virtually
block by block. As a result, he can review the performance of his
force's officers far more consistently, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, shortly after the system was up and running, Gertz
announced a surge in violent crime, and he accused organized crime
leaders, who he said worked closely with corrupt commanders, of
ordering the violence with the aim of beating back his reforms. In
recent weeks, however, violent crime has fallen back to levels that
were average before he took office, Gertz said.
</P>
<P>
   Truck hijackings and car thefts have fallen, he said, partly
because major companies now report to authorities when their
tractor-trailers enter the city, allowing police computers to
monitor their movements.
</P>
<P>
   But armed robberies, home burglaries and many other crimes
continue at epidemic rates, he said. The stable rates of many
crimes, he said, suggest that police commanders and organized crime
leaders have set up a quota system in which a certain number of
crimes are tolerated as long as criminals share the profits with
the police.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gertz, a former university rector who once headed Mexico's
antinarcotics campaign, is the latest in a string of recent police
chiefs who have promised to end corruption. His predecessors all
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cardenas took office in December 1997 as the city's first
elected mayor, the federal government ran Mexico City directly, and
President Ernesto Zedillo ordered thousands of soldiers into police
duty and installed a group of generals to command them. But that
effort collapsed when the generals were accused of organizing death
squads to kill recidivist teen-age criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz said he decided to dismiss almost all his top supervisors
after reviewing the latest depressing internal reports on his
force. ``You know what I felt after I let these people go?'' he
said. ``I felt freer. Suddenly I had a sensation of not being
surrounded.''

<P>
   DENVER _ Both offenses in the American Football Conference
championship game on Sunday will slyly attempt to create
mismatches, either by formation or by movement. Then both will try
to take those mismatches and burn the defenses. All day long.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to trick the defense with a crafty appearance. Force
it, for example, to mistakenly place a slow linebacker in pass
coverage on a speedy wide receiver, or a sluggish strong safety on
a lightning-quick running back. Create a situation in which a tiny
cornerback is blocked and crushed on a running play by a mammoth
pulling offensive lineman, or the shortest defender on the field is
forced to pass protect against the tallest offensive player on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Football is a game of matchups. Creating mismatches in those
matchups is a staple of the game. The Jets and the Denver Broncos,
Sunday's AFC title finalists, have been masters of the tactic this
season.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason both teams have reached this pinnacle in Mile
High Stadium, an emotional and dramatic stage on which to decide
who advances to Super Bowl XXXIII and who heads home for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it; the Jets do it,'' said Mike Shanahan, the Denver
head coach. ``In the mismatch game is where you tend to find a
number of big plays being made.''
</P>
<P>
   Both team's offenses have soared, in part, by employing this
scheme. The Broncos rank first in the conference in total offense
(380.8 yards a game); the Jets rank second (357.2). The Broncos
rank first in the conference in points scored (31.3 a game); the
Jets rank second (26.0).
</P>
<P>
   Each offense versus each defense will be a sparkling show. But
since the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos feature the star
quarterback John Elway, the 2,000-yard rusher Terrell Davis and
Shanahan's crisp play-calling, the guessing game between Shanahan
and Bill Belichick, the Jets defensive coordinator, will be the
game within the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known Bill for years and I have called games against
him before,'' Shanahan said. ``He's adjusted over the years and so
have I. This will be fun. I've looked at all 16 Jets games from
their regular season. I looked at them in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked, what if Belichick had looked at the Broncos for
that period and even at tapes of the Broncos' preseason games?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't get a picture after 16 games ... '' Shanahan
said, a bit taken aback at even the thought that the Jets, that
Belichick, could possibly be more prepared for the mismatch game
than he. ``Let's just say if they have and it works, they are
smarter than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have been smart in gathering players. That is where
it starts.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has a quarterback, a running back, a tight end (Shannon
Sharpe) and receivers (Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith) who are
explosive and spread defenses. The Jets, in their quarterback
(Vinny Testaverde), running back (Curtis Martin), tight end (Kyle
Brady) and receivers (Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet) believe
they can match Denver's offensive power. Toss in two strong,
versatile offensive lines and intricate designs to create
mismatches, and what lurks is a blinding offensive show.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about two multiple-formation teams who rely on
this strategy a little more than others,'' said Norv Turner, the
Washington Redskins' head coach. ``You're talking about teams who
have a lot of people who can do a lot of things. It's the
quarterbacks; they are experienced. It's the personnel. Even the
backups behind these guys are good. These are teams that are
efficient. You can draw it up all day long. The players have to
perform it. They do.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for that, said Chan Gailey, the Dallas
Cowboys' head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be different, to scheme things that create mismatches, a
lot of times you have to have people in place who have been there
for awhile,'' Gailey said. ``This Denver offense has been together
for a little while with the same coaches. That is a great edge.
They can work off a base that everyone there knows. And then later
in the season they can say, `Hey, remember in Week 3 when we did
this? Let's change this part of it and do this.' That kind of stuff
on a particular play can go back even a year or two. And you have
to have smart players to do that. And a coach willing to try
different things. Denver puts all of this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating mismatches starts with formations and movement, and the
effect is bolstered when defenses make mistakes in substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use two tight ends, two backs and a wide receiver, does
the defense stay with four linebackers?'' Gailey asked. ``If so,
you've got an edge in the running game. If you use three wides, a
running back and a tight end, do they stay in their base defense?
That's to your advantage on the deep pass. If you line up with five
wide receivers, the quarterback looks to see which one has the
mismatch. If you put a tight end out wide as a wide receiver, if
the cornerback walks out there it tells the quarterback zone. If a
linebacker walks out, it is man coverage. These are indicators that
set up your mismatches on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and the Broncos play it both ways: both will read and
react on offense and at other times both will dictate.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey prefers read and react. He likes to see what the defense
does, how it responds to formations, and then adjust to find the
mismatch. Is it a defense based on speed and getting upfield? Is is
it one that sits back and waits for you? Is there a lineman who
pushes so hard upfield that the ball can be thrown behind him in
the vacated spot? Gailey searches for these keys.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Turner, however, likes the attack mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best strategy can be to dictate,'' Turner said. ``I like
these teams' offenses when they create situations where they are
not reacting to people but people are reacting to them. Denver does
a great job in the running game of the cutback runs. I coached
Marcus Allen at USC and he had this knack of cutting back on his
runs near the line of scrimmage. So, we said, if he's going to be
doing that, let's give him some help. Let's block the back side.''
</P>
<P>
   That creates plenty of mismatches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find ourselves here in the running game making sure the
backside is tied down and worked out,'' said Mark Schlereth, a
Broncos offensive guard. ``That means keeping the safeties blocked.
Sometimes linemen do that. It is a big advantage for us. It has
become a major part of our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in the coaching booth, defensive coaches look for the
offensive players being sent in by position from the sideline and
attempt to match that by inserting corresponding defensive
personnel. Three wide receivers come in? Three cover guys are sent
in to cover them. If a mistake is made in personnel deployment
Sunday, it could prove costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why there were screams a few years ago when teams were
putting 12 men in the huddle and then one guy was leaving the field
before the snap,'' Turner said. ``You couldn't set your defense.
But sometimes, despite that, the mistakes upstairs still happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And a huge mismatch can ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Matchups in Sunday's game could swing on a healthy player versus
an injured one. On faulty defensive technique, on picking on a
defensive player at a particular position at a particular spot on
the field because of his faulty technique.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets would love to see their fast receiver Dedric Ward
aligned in man coverage versus the slower Broncos safety Tyrone
Braxton. The Broncos would enjoy finding the 6-foot-5-inch receiver
Ed McCaffrey versus the 5-8 cornerback Ray Mickens on a lobbed
pass, a jump-ball situation in the end zone. Jets receiver Keyshawn
Johnson would smile if he were covered in a crossing pattern by
Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski. Schlereth (287 pounds) would
grin if he found himself pulling and blocking cornerback Aaron
Glenn (185 pounds).
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and Broncos will spread the defenses thin. Use their
offensive talent. Create mismatches in the matchups.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people start spreading out in this game and creating
things, they also can leave a variety of holes,'' Turner said.
``And if a defense is able to find and defend the hot receiver for
the quarterback and take away that dump-off pass, take away the
quarterback's safety valve, then you are vulnerable. You've got to
be able to handle the blitz and pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both defenses from the Jets and Broncos are going to create
overloads on the blocking schemes with major blitzes. The team that
handles that best will enjoy the mismatch game. The team that
doesn't will be in trouble.''

   ``Facts are the enemy of truth,'' says poor, pure-hearted Don
Quixote in ``Man of La Mancha,'' the musical based on Cervantes'
classic novel.

   A friend recently gave Rep. Henry Hyde, the House Judiciary
chairman, the original Broadway cast recording of that show, and
when in odd moments he listens to its hummable tunes about the
Spanish Inquisition, he also hears Quixote sing: ``Heathens and
wizards and serpents of sin, all your dastardly doings are past.
For a holy endeavor is now to begin and virtue shall triumph at
last!''
</P>
<P>
   Along with ``The Impossible Dream,'' theme song of the virtuous

``I'm Only Thinking of Him.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, America is divided over whether Hyde is now

things as they truly are. Drown in the mirror.''

<P>
   Paula Jones clearly isn't his Dulcinea, the victimized barmaid
in whom Quixote sees only virtue; on ABC's ``Nightline,'' Hyde

</P>
<P>
   But perhaps when Quixote wonders if facts really are the enemy
of truth, he means that everything depends on what the meaning of
``facts'' is.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Leigh, who wrote the music for the show, said he doesn't
like either the president or his prosecutor for the part. But when
he read that Hyde was a fan, he said, ``After one loud guffaw I
thought, well, if it helps him turn back into Dr. Jekyll, then I'm
glad.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was the eve of the most woeful of anniversaries,
that of President Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
Saturday dawned with the Senate's trudging through the wintry
morning to attend a third salvo of impeachment arguments that the
president deserves to be banished for all the misdeeds that came to
light following upon that ill-fated event.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, that lawsuit has been settled. But it continues to
haunt the president, leaving him on the brink of political
extinction before the Senate. His defense lawyers complained
outside the chamber on Friday that the House Republican prosecutors
had been referring ``again and again'' to Clinton's deposition in
the Jones suit, despite the fact that the full House rejected
perjury charges built around that testimony.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17 a year ago, long months of chaos began with an
unlikely trip of a few blocks by the president to his lawyer's
office, his limousine notably minus the fender flags of office
because of his personal mission. It was in the Jones deposition
that the president first denied a sexual liaison with Monica
Lewinsky, even as the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, was laying the groundwork for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate closes in on final judgment, the House prosecutors
are insisting that now is the time to bring Ms. Lewinsky forward,
to observe her and judge her credibility as she tells her story to
the Senate and the nation. ``Let's examine her face to face,'' said
one House prosecutor, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. The Democrats only
shudder at the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   NO `JURORS,' BUT A JUDGE
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are still smarting from the rebuff delivered by
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the trial chairman, when he agreed
with an unusual Democratic floor objection on Friday that it was
inaccurate to call the senators ``jurors,'' because they are a
complete court of impeachment with far more powerful options than a
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the House Judiciary Committee, where the
impeachment articles were spawned, immediately put out a sharp
statement praising their own prosecutorial arguments before the
Senate. ``One hopes that such protests arise from linguistic
scrupulosity and not the fear that `jurors' are expected to convict
when the evidence is overwhelming,'' declared the committee
spokesman, Paul McNulty, in an echo of the House rancor the
senators have vowed not to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice directed the ``jurors'' ruling at Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., and thereby delighted Democrats. The sharp-tongued
Barr is a conservative acolyte of former Speaker Newt Gingrich and
bare-knuckled Clinton critic who first urged the House on toward
impeachment. ``We were lectured to,'' said Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga.,
annoyed like some other lawmakers at Barr's tone of professorial
self-certainty in addressing the Senate as an outsider. ``This is
not the way you win an argument in the Senate,'' said Cleland.
</P>
<P>
   The incident underlined the question of just how much guidance
senators, Republican or Democrat, will tolerate from House visitors
eager to see the president removed.
</P>
<P>
   SCURRYING IN THE TUNNELS
</P>
<P>
   Because of intensified security cordons around the Senate
chamber's work areas, the trial has seen the blossoming of a great
subterranean stakeout of passing senators by news workers who now
loiter about the network of pedestrian tunnels under the Capitol.
Police trying to frustrate reporters and shield senators are
themselves being frustrated by the reporters' guerrilla tactic.
There are Keystone Kops chases at times that offer a leitmotif to
the trial above. When the senators' special electric subway system
broke down on Friday, the tunnel walks were the only alternative.
Reporters fell upon a veritable sluiceway of talkative senators.
</P>
<P>
   During the short trial breaks, police try to rope the news
workers off into pens, but they have blazed roundabout routes to
the ground-floor cafeteria where senators have a fast cup of coffee
before resuming their silent task as ``triers,'' not jurors.
``You've got a tough job,'' Sen. John Warner, R-Va., told reporters
who found their way to his side at the cafeteria. ``And I've got a
tough job _ keeping quiet,'' he added apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   MIXED AUDIENCE
</P>
<P>
   The assortment of people who turn up each day for the trial
offers a wide range of presidential friends and foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to see justice dispensed,'' said David Bossie, a
Republican specialist in negative research. He served on the
Whitewater investigation by Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same motive, to see justice through to the very end,
was voiced by a far different politician in daily attendance, Rep.
Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, who as a member of the House Judiciary
Committee fought the president's impeachment every bit as much as
Bossie was cheered by it.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORLD GOES ON
</P>
<P>
   Anyone reeling from trial fatigue and yearning for the
nontabloid routine of self-government could, in the spirit of
political Groundhog Day, warily turn to the rack of Senate press
releases. Of 17 publicity handbills being offered on midday Friday,
only four were about impeachment. The rest were on sundry mundane
legislative topics, with action verbs like ``announces'' and
``praises'' and ``launches'' in the headlines, and not a mention of
high crimes.

to her home on a recent Sunday and wept when she saw her husband's
hat floating in brackish water beneath the roofless frame house
where they once lived.
</P>
<P>
   She wept not for the things they had lost, not for the years
they had worked to build their home and found a family, but for him
and for three of her children, who were all swept out to sea in
October and drowned in the worst hurricane of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to go far from here, to forget all this,'' she
said. ``Somewhere where there is a future.''
</P>
<P>
   Around her lay the detritus of broken houses and derailed lives,
left there by the wrath of Hurricane Mitch. Half of this coastal
village of 6,000 people _ more than 80 houses _ was swept out to
sea or submerged under the engorged River Aguan during three days
of floods, gales and rain so hard it felt like a thousand whips.
Forty-one people perished in a desperate attempt to reach higher
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Where once there was a road into the village, there is now only
a wide expanse of dirt-brown water, with the wreckage of two school
buses peeking from the waves. The grade school and high school have
been wrecked, along with the bus station, the library and several
businesses. Dozens of houses not swallowed up entirely by the sea
have been reduced to piles of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The storm even changed this sleepy village's geography. More
than 200 yards of land disappeared under the relentless pounding of
the surf. The narrow river that once ran through the village has
been moved a quarter of a mile from its original course and has
expanded to four times its normal size. Part of the community has
been turned into an sad island of devastated homes.
</P>
<P>
   More than two months after the hurricane struck, little has
improved. Power and phone lines are still lying on the ground.
There is no potable water. Many children are sick with diarrhea and
unexplained fevers. Although some shipments of food and medicine
have been ferried in by charities and the government, two large
containers of aid from a New York City group are being held up in
port by customs officials.
</P>
<P>
   And though it was always remote and impoverished, the village is
more isolated than ever. To reach Santa Rosa, one must travel more
than two miles on a dirt road, cross a swollen river in a canoe
where there was once a ford, then travel 11 more miles to the edge
of the village, where a canoe or launch can carry the traveler to
the town's center a mile across the water on the other side of the
Aguan River.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1887, Santa Rosa de Aguan has never had much
political influence in the capital, Tegucigalpa. Only in the last
few years was electricity brought in, and requests for a paved road
and a bridge to link the town to the outside world have been bogged
down for decades.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is cultural. Like many coastal communities in
Honduras, the village is dominated by the Garifuni, descendants of
slaves and Carib Indians from the island of St. Vincent who were
exiled to Central America in 1795 after a revolt there. The
Garifuni, of African descent, have never wielded as much political
power as lighter-skinned Hondurans of Spanish and Indian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people appear to be still in shock from the
hurricane. Like shipwrecked sailors, some spend their days
scavaging wood from the wreckage to build temporary shelters.
Others who lost family members have fled to live with other
relatives in nearby towns like Trujillo and La Ceiba, unable to
bear the place any longer. But most of the villagers were born here
and say they want to rebuild their small town.
</P>
<P>
   One is Robert Blanco, who spent 23 years working on tracks for
the Metro North railroad in New York before returning four years
ago to retire on a pension. Blanco's house is under the river,
along with all his belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people say they are going away, and others say they
will rebuild in a different spot,'' he said. ``I'm going to build
me a little house over here because I don't want to leave the
place. I was born and raised here.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say they would leave if they could, but they have nowhere
to go. Ms. Martinez Arriola's mother, Hilda Arriola Arouz, runs a
soda shop and outdoor restaurant on the side of town that was
largely swept away by the river. She used to live with her youngest
daughter, Nori Esperanza, but the 32-year-old woman has lost her
composure completely and can no longer bear to be in the village.
She becomes hysterical each time she returns, Mrs. Arriola Arouz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arriola Arouz is 67, and a widow. So many people have
abandoned the village there is no business for her restaurant. Her
son-in-law and four grandchildren are dead. Her surviving daughters
are both having trouble coping with the tragedy. The twisted roof
of her house lets in the rain now and she has no way to fix it. The
house seems dark and empty to her, bereft of children, who are the
light of the world, she says. Although she puts on a brave face,
she too says it is hard to confront each new day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most days I pass in sadness,'' she said, ``because all the
grandchildren that I lost lived most of the time in my house. Now
I'm sad and there is nothing but this sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Heartache: Sad Songs Are Sung For a Lost Family &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For many people here, the grieving appears to have just begun.
Some seem still in a state of denial. It is a measure of their
reluctance to talk about what happened that no Mass has been yet
been held for the victims of the storm, and though the municipal
authorities are supposedly planning one, no date has been set.
Still, the families have begun to grieve in private ways.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent night, Mrs. Arriola Arouz, her mother and a cousin
from the United States, Maria Guity, who had come to visit, sat up
late around a fire and sang sad songs of the Garifuni.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has trouble talking about what happened, Mrs.
Arriola's voice is full of pain when she sings. In the clear and
nasal lilt can be heard the echoes of slavery, of revolts against
planters, of great storms, and all the hard history of her people.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Mrs. Arriola ran into two acquaintances
as she walked through the part of town on the west bank of the
River Aguan. Both women had lost their houses in the flood and were
living like squatters in a half-finished Catholic church with
borrowed clothes and a few sticks of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the three women were telling one another how they had
survived. Their voices rose and their hands flailed the air in
describing the force of the rain, the immense pounding of surf, the
rising river. Then the conversation died down, like a storm
passing, and the women's eyes went daydreamy and still.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us from this neighborhood are left without homes,''
said one of the women, Enriqueta Martinez. ``It takes years to
build a house and it is destroyed in a few seconds.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other victims of the storm say they find it hard to talk about
it. One woman, Isabella Arriola, 32, a schoolteacher who is not
directly related to Mirtha, was swept out to sea and survived for
five days by clinging to the remains of a wooden roof before being
picked up by a ship. Her husband and children perished.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arriola wears sunglasses these days and black dresses.
Whenever she appears here, the townspeople crowd around and offer
condolences and small gifts. When she was approached by a reporter,
she first maintained she was someone else from another town and had
not been in Santa Rosa during the storm. When confronted with her
identity, she said it was too painful to recount what had happened
to her. ``I don't want to talk about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Hardship: A Farmer's Family Sinks Into Poverty &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even those whose families were unscathed have trouble
understanding the extent of what has befallen them. Before the
storm, Omar Lopez was a successful dairy farmer by local standards.
He and his wife had saved enough to build a spacious home for about
$7,500. He ran 200 head of fine dairy cattle on 150 acres inherited
from his father.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a third of his farm lies under the river. The house was
swept out to sea, with all his belongings. Worse, he lost all but
10 of his cattle. ``Everything was invested in the farm, and I
didn't have any insurance,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of cattlemen in this river valley lost their stock _
some 20,000 head in all. Even those whose livestock survived have
trouble getting their beef to market because of the damage to the
country's roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who is 30, has rented a house on the edge of town and has
moved his wife and their five sons into it. They are living with
borrowed furniture. His children, once among the best dressed in
town, now run around barefoot in tattered clothes given them by
charities.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding his business at this point is a pipe dream, Lopez
said, unless he and other farmers like him obtain some sort of
low-interest loans or grants from the government. In the meantime,
he said, he and his family depend on food from charities and the
United Nations. The children have been sick with diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are completely dependent on what they send us, because we
can't produce anything,'' he said. ``One maintains hope that
perhaps the government will do something.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Response: Aid From New York Is Held Hostage &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the government's response to Santa Rosa's
crisis has been minimal. The power and telephone lines are still
down, the schools closed.
</P>
<P>
   Military helicopters have delivered about 20 tons of food aid
from the United States and Canada and a few trucks from the United
Nations and various Catholic charities have managed to get through
the river ford. In addition, five tons of aid arrived from a group
of Hondurans in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But at least two containers full of aid gathered by Hondurans in
New York City were bottled up in the port of Cortez in December,
where customs agents demanded $740 in duty before they would let
them into the country. The Mayor, Biato Gonzalo Castillo Guity,
made a three-day trip over damaged roads and severed bridges in an
effort to free the hostage cargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have the money,'' said Cruz Castillo, the
chairman of the village's emergency committee. ``If the government
doesn't help us, it's possible we won't be able to bring those
containers in.''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said they were negotiating to buy several acres
of land to parcel out to people whose houses were inundated. ``We
have to move everyone,'' Castillo said. ``We have to find a place
for them to live.''
</P>
<P>
   But Castillo said these measures did not begin to address the
larger problems of unemployment and economic ruin. Most of the
villagers worked as hired hands on fishing boats or on one of the
local cattle ranches. Now the boats are largely destroyed, the
cattle drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Many see no future. On a recent afternoon, Hilberto Sanchez, who
is 40, was trying to build a house from bits and pieces of wood he
had salvaged from the debris that was once his brother-in-law's
house. His own home had been washed out to sea. A friend gave him
permission to build on a small plot in the section of the village
that survived.
</P>
<P>
   He has put up a rickety frame on the sandy soil, salvaging even
the nails he used to hammer it together. He says he knows it will
be a temporary dwelling, a flimsy house that will not withstand the
first tropical storm, but he has no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stay in the church any longer,'' he explained,
surveying the wreckage with weary eyes. ``We have to keep fighting
because after everything we can't just cross our arms and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than two months since Sanchez worked on the
fishing boats or farms. He has nine children. Asked what he will do
once the house is finished, he shrugged in an expression of utter
despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this I am the most worried,'' he said. ``Because here we
have no source of work.''

   Clinton Is Advised Not to Free Pollard  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, President Clinton came under pressure from Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to free Jonathan Pollard from the
life sentence he is serving for spying for Israel. The president's
key national security advisers now appear unanimous in urging the
president to keep him locked up.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said there is no
compelling foreign policy reason to free Pollard. The director of
Central Intelligence, George Tenet, and Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Pollard severely damaged U.S. national security.

   A New Look At the Right to Move
</P>
<P>
   The federal welfare revision of 1996 was notable for ending the
concept of welfare as an entitlement, but a less noticed provision
was perhaps even more radical. By letting states pay lower benefits
to newcomers than to long-term residents, Congress challenged a
long-held assumption about U.S. citizenship: that people can move
from state to state without being relegated to second-class status.
</P>
<P>
   California's two-tier welfare program, which holds newcomers for
the first year to the benefits they would have received in their
home states, has now been challenged before the Supreme Court, and
the justices were not buying the state's argument that this was a
minimal, cost-saving measure.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper values were clearly at stake. It was the ``genius'' of
the American system, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, that
``people can pick their states, but the states can't pick their
people.''

   A break-in at the Washington offices of an American pollster who
advises Ehud Barak, the leader of Israel's opposition Labor party,
at first seemed to have the makings of an Israeli Watergate. But it
caused hardly a ripple in Israel's election campaign, where the two
main candidates were otherwise preoccupied. Barak was at a Labor
convention securing slots for his allies on the party slate. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was shoring up support in his own Likud
party, where Moshe Arens, a former ally and mentor, announced that
he would challenge Netanyahu for the party leadership.

   Olympic Scandal Fallout
</P>
<P>
   Last Thanksgiving, Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini was
letting slip to reporters that members of the International Olympic
Committee were encouraging her to run for a third term, perhaps
allowing her to preside over the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah. But
only two months later, the Olympic Committee is imploding over
reports that Salt Lake got the games by bribing members with land
deals, tuition payments, free surgical operations and contributions
to political campaigns and charities.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mayor Corradini has announced she will not run for
re-election this year. Three days before she took that step, the
top leadership of the Olympic Committee resigned, and reporters had
begun to ask the Mayor what she knew about Salt Lake's methods of
winning the selection process.

   The mayor has not been publicly linked with any Olympic
corruption allegations.

   Trash Talk From Giuliani
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps eyeing higher office, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has roamed from California to New Hampshire touting his
record of cleaning up New York. Now Giuliani is trying to spread
something else around the country: surplus city garbage. New Jersey
balked at his plan to ship trash there, and Virginia wants to block
New York waste.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor declared that in return for cultural and financial
benefits generated by the city, the rest of the nation has an
obligation to dispose of Gotham's garbage. He even warned of suing.
While his Solutions America political committee is promoting the
mayor nationally, his trash talk ruffled two prominent Republicans,
Govs. James Gilmore of Virginia and Christie Whitman of New Jersey.
Her response: ``Whitman to New York Garbage Plan: Drop Dead.''

   A Harsh Strategy For Breast Cancer  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For women with a high risk of breast cancer, a report published
last week offered hope, but at a cruel price. Removing both breasts
while they are still healthy reduces the risk of getting breast
cancer by 90 percent, according to a study of 639 women who had the
surgery from 1960 to 1993 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers cautioned that the findings should not be used to
put pressure on patients to take such desperate measures. But women
who wanted the surgery in hopes of preventing breast cancer _ many
of whom had seen mothers and sisters die of the disease _ said
doctors were overly reluctant to recommend the procedure, or, in
some cases, even to talk about it.

   Princeton Gets the Shivers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Princeton University president Harold Shapiro suggested ending
the Nude Olympics, an annual tradition in which sophomores run
naked through a campus courtyard at midnight after the first big
snowfall. The problem: Many of the streakers use liquor to numb
their modesty before the cold numbs everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Running drunk and naked in circles around a frozen courtyard can
be perilous. After 350 students participated in this year's run,
five were hospitalized with alcohol poisoning and four more were
treated at the university's health center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am simply not willing to wait until a student dies to take
preventive action,'' Shapiro wrote in a letter to The Daily
Princetonian, the student newspaper.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican prosecutors contended Saturday
that President Clinton, in committing perjury and obstruction of
justice, had weakened the country at home and abroad and deserved
to be convicted and removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   As they wound up their three-day presentation, House managers
argued that Clinton's offenses, which they said they had proved on
Thursday and Friday, were neither private nor trivial, but rose to
the level of the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that the
Constitution sets as a standard for impeachment and removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your judgment should rise above politics, above partisanship,
above polling data,'' Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said in his prepared
closing statement. ``This case is a test of whether what the
Founding Fathers described as `sacred honor' still has meaning in
our time.''
</P>
<P>
   The centrality of Saturday's presentation to the entire trial
was underlined before the session began by Sen. Thad Cochran,
R-Miss. As he entered the chamber, he said, ``This may be the
biggest challenge of all _ to show that the offenses rise to the
level of impeachment.'' Many Democrats have insisted, long before
Saturday's arguments, that the alleged offenses fell far short.
</P>
<P>
   In a critical speech in only the second presidential impeachment
trial in the 209-year history of the Republic, Rep. Steve Buyer,
R-Ind., said the president's offenses ``assault the administration
of justice.'' And justice, he said, was an essential core of the
nation because only with confidence in settling disputes in court
could society avoid relying on ``brute force.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., conceding with a folksy manner that
the proceedings could be called ``a snoozer,'' said that
demonstrated the country was calm and could survive either
conviction and removal or acquittal. What other country, he asked,
could be so ``calm'' in the face of a possible sudden change of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer (pronounced BOO-yer) warned against what he expected the
White House lawyers to argue in their defense: ``Do not be tempted
to believe the argument that lying about sex doesn't matter, that
it's private.'' He said the judicial system was essential to the
enforcement of laws against rape and sexual harassment, and that
without the perjury and obstruction laws, none of those rights
``could be vindicated in court.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that this argument, in fact, ``demeans the civil rights
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   And Buyer contended that the president's reputation as a liar
had weakened the nation abroad, especially by damaging morale in
the military. He said this should matter to the Senate, which would
never vote to promote a military officer charged with the offenses
of which Clinton is accused.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer opened the House case Saturday morning by ridiculing the
White House argument that the alleged crimes were not the sort of
crimes against the state that merited impeachment and removal from
office _ the consequence of a Senate conviction by a two-thirds
vote.
</P>
<P>
   He called it ``the `so what' defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, he contended, ``willfully and repeatedly violated the
rule of law and abused the judicial system.'' The subject of the
lies and obstruction was irrelevant to the dominant fact that they
were committed within the judicial system, which those crimes
undermined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer argued that while lying to someone's wife about an
extramarital affair was not a crime, lying about it in court was
``a crime against the state and is therefore a public matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Acts which are not crimes when committed outside the judicial
realm,'' he said, ``become crimes when they are committed inside
the judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   And as to whether those crimes merited impeachment, Buyer said
they did. He cited James Madison, one of the Constitution's chief
authors, as holding the British legal analysis of Blackstone's
Commentaries in the highest regard, and observed that Blackstone
put bribery and perjury on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, he said, when the Constitution said impeachment was
proper for treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors,
it was clear that perjury was one of those ``other'' offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer said, ``What I'm saying unto all of you is that there is
no difference here, and that's the pain of this case. There is no
difference between a cash bribe or sitting before a federal judge
and perjuring oneself. Whether it be in the underlying civil
deposition or in fact the grand jury perjury, perjury and bribery
are side by side.''
</P>
<P>
   Their presentations, and the reaction from Republican senators,
left House managers optimistic that they had succeeded in
persuading a Senate majority to let them go forward and call
witnesses. In their three days of opening arguments, the House
managers had argued that if senators had any doubt of Clinton's
guilt, they had to summon witnesses to resolve any questions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One Republican who was persuaded, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said
Saturday morning, ``There are some very clear conflicts that need
to be resolved.'' He added, ``I don't see how we can avoid
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers have made it clear they will attack that
argument in the 24 hours they are allowed for opening defense
arguments that begin on Tuesday. If the House needed no witnesses,
they have said, neither does the Senate. They have also warned that
calling witnesses, who would be questioned under oath by both sides
before possibly appearing before the full Senate, would drag out
the proceedings for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Saturday that the
final presentation by the House managers was ``a clear concession
and admission that their case isn't strong enough without the need
for witnesses. They were given 24 hours to make their case and
they've spent the bulk of it arguing for the need to call
witnesses. When all the politics is stripped away, what we have are
House managers conceding that they haven't built the case and they
need something more.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton was spending much of the day preparing for
the State of the Union Message on Tuesday. A practice run-through
was scheduled for Saturday afternoon in the White House family
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican senators sought to offer the White House a
slightly less unpleasant alternative _ ``stipulating'' or agreeing
to various facts they said witnesses could confirm if they
testified. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Rules
Committee, said that while a ``rather strong case'' had been made
for witnesses, ``Maybe the president will stipulate to the facts
and it won't be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The witness issue _ the most difficult the Senate had faced in
its efforts to appear more sober and dignified than the House _ has
produced repeated clashes. Another of those clashes came with an
exchange of letters between Senate Republican and Democratic
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, laid out his plan
in a letter sent late Friday to Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the
minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe that a bipartisan group of senators could
anticipate and help resolve in advance any complications that may
be presented by our hearing the testimony of witnesses,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Daschle said in a letter Saturday, ``I appreciate
your desire to continue to work toward a fair and expeditious
conclusion of this matter. I strongly believe, however, that
appointing a group of senators to make preparations for witness
testimony would violate the bipartisan agreement that now governs
our process.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the bipartisan agreement reached last week, he
wrote, ``Senate Resolution 16 anticipates that issues related to
witnesses would be addressed if _ and only if _ the Senate votes to
compel such testimony,'' and he added, ``It is my hope that such
arrangements will ultimately prove unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott has written that he supports considering ``safeguards now,
so that testimony could begin as soon as fairness allowed _ should
the Senate decide to call witnesses. Forming a bipartisan group to
consider witness issues now may save us time and trouble in the
days ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That group could be the instrument for our communication with
both sides in this trial,'' Lott said. ``Because senators are
judges, as well as triers of fact, it is our responsibility to work
with both sides to arrange the logistics of the trial.''
</P>

 GROWTH OF GAMBLING ON TRIBAL LAND STARTS TREK BACK HOME BY INDIANS
 (ART ADV: A photo is being sent to NYT photo clients.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAC DU FLAMBEAU, Wis. _ Coming home to Indian country from
suburban life after 16 years, Carl Edwards recently lifted his
young daughters through a window of their new house on Gunlock Lake
here, and let their little feet prance on the stiffening concrete,
leaving symbols of permanence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your house,'' Edwards, a Chippewa, told his daughters,
who he has promised to teach to hunt on this reservation, and to
sprinkle tobacco around the fallen prey, a sign of thanksgiving to
the Creator. ``These are your woods. That is your lake.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribal economy here was lifeless as stone in the early
1980s, when Edwards fled this backwoods pocket of Wisconsin,
certain that survival would mean existing on crumbs from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Marines for a stint, then settled near Milwaukee,
where as a construction worker he earned enough to buy a small
house and become familiar with the trappings of middle-class life.
But he never quite felt comfortable in the mall-and-traffic rhythms
of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   So the growth of tribal gambling in recent years, which created
120,000 jobs on reservations and an additional 160,000 spin-off
jobs, breathing a whisper of prosperity in the nations of Indian
country, meant homecomings for people like Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would be possible to come home,'' said
Edwards, who works at the Lake of the Torches casino here, and just
last November finished building a knotty-pine house. ``There was
nothing here when I left, and there was no reason to think there
was ever going to be anything here. So you left.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a century of American Indians leaving
reservations for cities and towns, many tribes have started to
experience a reversal in the trend, said Tim Giago, a Lakota writer
and former publisher of Indian Country Today, the nation's largest
American Indian newspaper, with main offices in Rapid City, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the biggest story in Indian country,'' Giago
said, ``people actually starting to come home for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers on such homecomings are hard to come by, partly because
the trend is so new. Even with gambling, many tribes still struggle
mightily with poverty in conditions that are often much worse than
those found in the poorest of urban neighborhoods, but there is
plenty of reason for rejoicing over the turn of events in Indian
country.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 34, who earned about $50,000 a year as a construction
worker, and is regarded here with awe for his service as a marine
in Beirut, also rejoices over his return. ``Look at the stars and
the moon _ it's like daylight,'' he said. His view of the heavens
had been obscured for years by the neon and sulphur glow of city
lights.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, which does not pay as much as his old trade,
Edwards trains workers at the casino for jobs ranging from card
dealer to dishwasher. Some of the workers have reached their late
30s without ever having earned a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up on that hill across the road,'' Edwards tells the
recruits. ``I know what life on the reservation can mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up on the Lac du Flambeau reservation, Edwards learned
to harvest wild rice in the late summer and to dance at the powwow,
where his godfather, David Careful, gave him the name Little Fawn.
Living just 100 steps from Lake Pokegama, he learned to fish in the
darkness with flashlights and nets, to clean walleye, to shoot, gut
and dress a deer, and to sprinkle tobacco in thanks.
</P>
<P>
   He also knew the feeling of going to bed hungry. His mother was
so sickened with alcoholism that she could not care for a baby. He
became a ward of the state and was placed as a foster child in his
Aunt Flora's two-bedroom house, a ramshackle place on the hill that
was already crowded with eight other people.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian children attended Lakeland Union High School, about
15 miles from the reservation. A majority of the students were
white.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people whose houses you knew you didn't go
inside,'' Edwards said. ``Some of my friends, you know, they'd be
kind of embarrassed and say, `Sorry, but my parents just don't like
Indians.'''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of fights. He was short, and not so quick with
his fists. So he lost some battles, Edwards said, and at times he
was confronted by mobs. He endured black eyes, fat lips, bloody
noses and ``sore ribs from the boots,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   He went to school wearing ill-fitting, throwaway corduroy
trousers that were laughably out of style. He never owned a pair of
blue jeans. He saw his mother occasionally at family gatherings,
depending on how she was feeling. His father, a fishing guide,
walked past the boy without a word or a glance because he suspected
that Carl's mother had been unfaithful, and so refused to
acknowledge him as a son.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children will always have a mother and father who love
them,'' said Edwards, as he played with his his daughters, Joelle,
5, and Kendra, 1, on a murky December day at the reservation, while
his wife, Lisa, 32, fixed a pizza. ``And I will never wear a pair
of corduroys.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and his wife, who is not Indian but grew up near the
reservation, met in high school and married after he left the
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   It was Edwards' father who unknowingly inspired him to join the
Marines, where he served in Beirut after the attack on the U.S.
Embassy in 1983. The father was known around the reservation as At
Ease, a reference to his long-ago service in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I wanted to one-up the old man,'' he said. Edwards'
father died a few years ago. Carl, who had known such cold
rejection, drove home anyway to attend the funeral and pay his
respects. Some people wondered why. ``He gave me his name,''
Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   With his own children, he has many plans. ``I'm going to teach
them to hunt for deer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will also teach them how to cope with people, like an old
study hall teacher, who Edwards said showed disrespect for the
Chippewa way of hunting and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards recalled that the teacher had become enraged one morning
when he, as a teen-ager, dared to lay his head on his desk in study
hall. The teacher stood over the young Carl Edwards and began to
bellow in a sarcastic voice, mocking the tribe's method of fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go spearing last night?'' Edwards said the teacher had asked.
``That why you're tired?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the boy replied truthfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes you did,'' the teacher pressed. ``I'll bet you and your
father went spearing last night.''
</P>
<P>
   The taunt cut like glass to a boy who, for all of his 17 years,
had longed for a father who would take his son hunting and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The boy glared back at the teacher, then screamed a profanity.
Edwards said he stood up from his desk and challenged the man to a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   He was suspended from school for a week.
</P>
<P>
   When Edwards told his employer that he would be moving back to
the reservation, his boss asked. ``Why on earth?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's home,'' Edwards replied.

LAC DU FLAMBEAU, Wis.: Edwards replied.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joelle was almost ready to start school. Edwards did not want
his children growing up with stereotypes and falsehoods about his
people. More than that, he wanted his daughters to grow up in the
culture of their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   The forebears of Edwards were among the Chippewas who resisted
government efforts to force the tribe to move west. The Chippewas,
who would not be starved or frozen into submission, clung to the
ancient homelands that circle Lake Superior, a region dotted by
thousands of freshwater lakes and forests of quaking aspen and
sugar maple, teeming with elk, deer and bear.
</P>
<P>
   As he walks the grounds of the reservation these days, he is
likely to see old friends or relatives. The other day, he saw his
boyhood pal Hank Schuman.
</P>
<P>
   He gets to see his sisters, Ann, Donna, Patty and Mary, and his
brother, Archie.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Sunday, his mother visited. She has been sober now
for nearly 20 years, and her eyes shine like sunrise when she hears
Joelle call out to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma,'' says the little girl, words that make the older
woman grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was playing with his daughters one recent afternoon. A
smile danced across the face of Joelle, who delighted in pleasing
her father. She began to recite words she had learned in her new
Ojibwe language class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Makwa,'' she called out, the Chippewa word for bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say deer,'' her father urged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waawaashkeshii,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabbit,'' he challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waaboos,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, with the hardened muscles of a man who hauled 180-pound
bundles of drywall for a living, swallowed hard and bent to engulf
his daughter in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want something so hard, for so long,'' he said, ``and you
don't think you're ever going to get there.'' &QL;

POLITICAL NOTES: INDIANA, OREGON, LOUISIANA
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANA: Extramarital Penalty, Hoosier Style  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's how they handle a sex scandal involving an elected
official and an office intern in Indiana:
</P>
<P>
   Last September, The Kokomo Tribune reported that state Sen.
Steven Johnson, a 50-year-old Republican who represents four
counties in the central part of Indiana, had engaged in an
adulterous relationship in 1997 with a 23-year-old college intern
who worked in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the Senate's ranking Republican, did not deny the
report and engaged in no verbal hair-splitting. Rather, he
confessed to committing ``a moral and ethical wrong'' and said
``choices should have consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, on a voice vote and with no debate, the Indiana Senate
set forth the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   It removed Johnson from two of the Senate's most powerful
committees, Ethics and Finance, took away his chairmanship of the
Planning and Public Services Committee, and most punishing of all,
in a way, banished him to a seat in the very back of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose marriage failed as a result of his affair,
accepted the sanctions, which will remain in effect for two years,
and praised his Senate colleagues for their ``civility and grace.''
He said that ``in a very strange sense'' he had been given a
``fascinating'' opportunity to start his life anew.
</P>
<P>
   Then, noting that he would be up for re-election in 2002, he
added, ``I'll go on from here, and in four years we'll let the
constituents determine the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   OREGON: Voting Easy May Be No Democratic Vote
</P>
<P>
   No state tries harder to make voting easier than Oregon. And in
an era when the voter participation rate is scandalously low in
most states, no state consistently enjoys a higher rate than
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   How does Oregon do it?
</P>
<P>
   Mail ballots are readily available and mail balloting is
aggressively promoted. In fact, the state's presidential primaries
are now entirely vote-by-mail affairs, and almost 60 percent of the
voters participated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble looms. The Democratic National Committee says
Oregon's delegates to the 2000 national convention may not be
seated unless the state changes its vote-by-mail procedure for that
year's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand, the primary will be held March 14, which is
fine with the Democratic committee. What is not fine is that
ballots will be mailed out about three weeks earlier, in late
February, and thus voters will be able to vote not only well before
primary day but, more to the point, well before March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Under new DNC rules, no state, other than the
first-in-the-nation states of New Hampshire and Iowa, can hold a
primary or caucus before March 7. The party imposed that threshold
for Election 2000 because officials were worried that the primary
and caucus calendar had been unbalanced by the recent rush of
states to vote earlier and earlier to increase their nominating
clout.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, for example, joined the stampede in 1996, moving its
voting date to March after many years of voting in May. As DNC
officials see it, the stampede will grow even more thunderous next
year if Oregon permits voters to cast mail ballots before March 7,
even though the ballots are meant for a March 14 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, some officials say, news and polling organizations
will try to get an early _ and possibly disruptive _ read on where
the primary is headed by contacting some of the voters who mail in
ballots earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't want to keep pushing the date,'' Tom Wyche, a
Democratic committee spokesman, said last week, calling for
negotiations on the issue. Then he warned, ``For any state that
selects delegates outside our rules, there's a possibility their
delegation might not be seated.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon election officials deny any intent to break party rules.
They also question whether the committee intends to go after every
state that has scheduled an early primary and intends to send out
mail ballots, regular or absentee, before March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to disenfranchise the voters of Oregon,'' the
state's secretary of state, Phil Keisling, argues. ``It's absurd,
offensive, a phony problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the rules are somewhat different and
there is no clash of dates.
</P>
<P>
   LOUISIANA: From Dudley Dudley To Monica Monica
</P>
<P>
   Dudley Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a name from the political past. For years she was a
power in the Democratic Party of New Hampshire, someone
presidential wannabes always called on while tramping through the
snowy notches during primary season, someone no out-of-state
reporter could resist quoting.
</P>
<P>
   Comes now her replacement, as it were, one Monica Monica _ no
relation to Monica Lewinsky, though there is something of a
political nexus. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Monica _ Monica Squared to her friends _ is a New Orleans
ophthalmologist. She is running for Congress, seeking, along with
former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, to succeed a fellow
Republican, Bob Livingston. He is leaving because, just as the
House moved to impeach President Clinton as a result of l'affaire
Lewinsky, it was revealed that Livingston had also had adulterous
dalliances.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Monica says her candidacy is not some ``politically cute''
trick and that she plans to put at least $500,000 of her own money
into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was Monica long before the other one was,'' she says, noting
that at 48 she is almost twice as old as Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   How did she get her double moniker?
</P>
<P>
   From her father, Elihu Root Monica, she says, who was himself
named for the famed secretary of state, and who, she recalls, once
told her:
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved you so much and felt so much honor in the name Monica
that I named you twice.''

COMMENTARY: INVOKING THE BIBLE IN A KOSHER WAR OF THE WOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (Duplication notice: also sent with `d' code) 
(bl) 
By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ This is the story of this city's Great
Kosher Chinese Food War.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning _ two years ago, that is _ Michael Zeitouni
opened a delicatessen on North Avenue. He sold pastrami and
knishes. He sold falafel. He also sold Chinese _ General Tso's
chicken, moo goo gai pan _ absolutely, incontrovertibly kosher
Chinese prepared by a Chinese chef.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last month, 10 doors down, Kevin Cohnen opened Eden Wok.
He did not sell pastrami. But he did sell Chinese, absolutely,
incontrovertibly kosher and prepared by four seasoned Chinese chefs
working at six woks.
</P>
<P>
   Zeitouni's business, Wykagyl, went into a nose dive, tumbling 30
to 40 percent. He had to fire a counterman and a deliveryman and
bring in his wife, Beth, to help. Business has been so bad that
Zeitouni has publicly turned his complaint into a religious issue.
He accuses Cohnen of violating a verse in Deuteronomy that has to
do with moving boundary markers, but has been interpreted by some
rabbis as barring one Jew from opening a business that directly
injures another Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking my traffic,'' said Zeitouni, 45, a bearded Israeli
immigrant whose woes are written on his weary face. ``We're
fighting over the same 700 religious families. They're either going
to eat by me or they're going to eat by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeitouni is so angry that he is considering the ominous step of
hauling Cohnen into a beth din _ a rabbinical court _ for a
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Cohnen, who at 23 has made himself into the New York City
region's kosher Chinese king (he has 3 of the more than 30 kosher
Chinese restaurants around), thinks Zeitouni has no case. Zeitouni
sells deli; he sells Chinese. ``I don't look at it as stealing
business,'' he said. ``I look at it as expanding the kosher
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is indisputably bitter, but a kosher fortune cookie
might suggest looking on the bright side. What the fight
illuminates is that New Rochelle's Orthodox population is
flourishing, having doubled in just two decades as Orthodox
professionals snap up the classic Tudor-style houses in the city's
north end. Two of the four Orthodox synagogues have built or are
planning new sanctuaries, and the two restaurants share North
Avenue with a kosher bakery, a kosher pizza shop and a kosher
grocery.
</P>
<P>
   If the Orthodox continue to multiply and their craving for
Chinese food rises to that of less stringent Jews, both restaurants
should do well. But both may not survive the waiting, which is why
Zeitouni has resorted to his biblical argument. Some rabbis would
say that Zeitouni may make a tasty corned beef sandwich but his
biblical scholarship leaves them with heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi William Herskowitz, administrator of the Westchester Vaad
Hakashruth, the board that supervises kosher shops, said that in
Eastern Europe's tightly knit communities, rabbis could enforce
communal edicts, but in a democratic country like the United
States, with laws prohibiting restraint of trade, he cannot deny
Eden Wok a kosher certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say, `It's not nice, it's foolhardy, it's stupid,'''
he said. ``But I can't force anybody not to open up on the same
block.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeitouni has asked the Vaad to restrict Eden Wok to takeout. He
has even contended that Eden Wok's menu has matzoh ball soup. (Eden
Wok's owners say the broth has Chinese flavors.) It has all been to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The deli's biggest problem, the Zeitounis concede, is that it is
a deli, not a Chinese restaurant. If they're eating Chinese,
Orthodox diners want to see Chinese waiters, not Jewish faces like
Zeitouni's.
</P>
<P>
   Zeitouni may insist, ``My Chinese food is better than his
Chinese food, my portions are bigger.'' But the manager of Eden
Wok, David Zaitschek, retorts, ``You can't do Chinese without
Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Impishly watching the dispute has been Paul Ciafolo, a gentile
whose kosher pizza shop has ducked the fire because it serves dairy
only. ``It's a meat war,'' he said. He doubts Zeitouni will prevail
in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the Torah and there's the Constitution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had this advice for Zeitouni: ``He should make the best damn
deli and the people will come.''

   People just tuning in to Washington over the past year of sex,
pizza and judicial racing stripes could be forgiven for wondering:
Is government usually this diverting?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's all in the eye of the beholder. But don't decide
for yourself until after you've sampled the one-minute House floor
speeches of Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   One-minute addresses are a House tradition, affording members
the opportunity at the beginning of the day to hold forth briefly
on any topic they wish _ yielding a sound bite and added verbiage
for the Congressional Record regardless of whether anybody present
is paying much attention. The speeches will resume shortly when the
new Congress takes up normal business.
</P>
<P>
   When they do, rest assured that Traficant will rise to be
recognized. Over his more than 11 years in the House, the
pro-labor, pro-school-prayer ex-county sheriff has turned the short
address into his trademark, a verbal blunderbuss loaded with
inanities to blast what he sees as Washington's absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   Usually he punctuates his remarks with a request to be ``beamed
up,'' a la ``Star Trek,'' to someplace where there's more
intelligent life. Here are excerpts.

   On the Economy
</P>
<P>
   Let us tell it like it is: When you hold this economy to your
nosey, this economy does not smell so rosy. If there is any
consolation to the American workers, I never heard of anyone in
America committing suicide by jumping out of a basement window. I
yield back all of the propaganda on this great economy.

<P>
   On Nike's Asian Factories
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, I say it is time for the American consumers to tell
Nike to take a hikey and buy some American shoes before, so help me
God, we are all working in some sweatshop.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aug. 2, 1996
</P>
<P>
   On NAFTA
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, the White House says Nafta ((the North American
Free Trade Agreement))is creating new and exciting jobs. I did some
research on those jobs: zipper trimmer, brassiere tender, jelly
roller, bosom presser, chicken sexer, sanitary napkin specialist
and a pantyhose crotch closer machine operator. That is what I call
exciting jobs, Mr. Speaker.
</P>
<P>
   _ May 13, 1997
</P>
<P>
   On Regulation
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, the Lord's prayer is 66 words, the Gettysburg
Address is 286 words, the Declaration of Independence is 1,322
words. U.S. regulations on the sale of cabbage _ that is right,
cabbage _ is 27,000 words. Now, if that is not enough to give Hulk
Hogan's dictionary a hernia, check this out. Regulatory red tape in
America costs taxpayers $400 billion every year, over $4,000 each
year, every year, year in, year out, for every family. Beam me up.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 29, 1998
</P>
<P>
   On Foreign Policy
</P>
<P>
   Let us check this out: China gets $60 billion in MFN
((most-favored-nation status)) from Uncle Sam. Russia gets $15
billion in foreign aid from Uncle Sam. In exchange, Uncle Sam gets
nuclear missiles pointed at our cities, two tape decks and three
cases of vodka. Beam me up. I say our national security brain trust
needs a proctologist on staff.
</P>
<P>
   _ April 1, 1998
</P>
<P>
   On China
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is time to tell it like it is. When it
comes to China, we have gone from ``Speak softly and carry a big
stick'' to ``Take the fifth and carry a toothpick.'' Beam me up.
</P>
<P>
   _ June 22, 1998
</P>
<P>
   On Reinventing Government
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, the vice president said America needs to reinvent
government. To find out why, the GAO called the RTC, the ITC and
the PMS. They did not know.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO. then called the DOD, the DOT and the DDT. They did not
know. The GAO then called the CIA, the DIA, the EPA and the IUD.
They did not know. Then they asked the OMB to find out. The OMB
created a whole new program called the Government Analysis Service,
known as GAS.
</P>
<P>
   _ By Sept. 3, 1993
</P>
<P>
   On God
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, a new report says only 7 percent of scientists
believe in God. That is right. And the reason they gave was that
the scientists were ``super smart.'' Unbelievable. Most of these
absent-minded professors cannot find the toilet. Mr. Speaker, I
have one question for these wise guys to constipate over: How can
some thing come from no thing?
</P>
<P>
   And while they digest that, Mr. Speaker, let us tell it like it
is. Put these super-cerebral master debaters in some foxhole with
bombs bursting all around them, and I guarantee they will not be
praying to Frankenstein. Beam me up here.

<P>
   _ Aug. 3, 1998
</P>
<P>
   On Space Toilets
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, space. The final frontier. The search for new life,
new civilizations and now new toilets. That is right: NASA has a
$30 million space toilet. You strap yourself in and 12
high-pressure air jets aid your relief. ... Mr. Speaker, I say is
time to call out the Roto-Rooter man. ... Beam me up, Scottie,
nature is calling.

<P>
   On Russia's President
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, in 1993, Boris Yeltsin fell off a stage in Germany.
In 1994, Boris could not get off his plane in Ireland. In 1996
Boris came up missing for seven consecutive days, unexplained,
before an election. In 1997, he forgot about a meeting with Vice
President Al Gore. Yesterday, he fired his entire Cabinet. The
White House says they are monitoring it. ...
</P>
<P>
   I say monitor this. Boris Yeltsin does not need monitors. Boris
Yeltsin needs Alcoholics Anonymous. I say let us save our foreign
aid and let us sent some counselors over to take care of this guy.

<P>
   On Flag Desecration
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, in many cities and towns across America it is
illegal to kiss in public. It is illegal in some places to ride a
skateboard. It is illegal to burn trash or leaves. It is illegal to
yodel or sing in public and it is illegal, Mr. Speaker, to tamper
with a mailbox. However, in America, it is completely legal to burn
the flag, completely legal to desecrate the flag. It is even legal,
Mr. Speaker, to urinate on Old Glory. In the words of a Russian
comedian, ``America _ What a country.''

<P>
   On Belching Cows
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, talking about garbage, the EPA is spending $210,000
to study cow belching and its effects on global warming. Here is
how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Cows will wear backpacks and have hoses connected to their
mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me, Mr. Speaker, what happens if the backpack is so tight
and instead of an oral emission, Elsie goes 7.0 on the Richter
scale? Will the president declare a garbage emergency ...? Or how
about maybe appoint a Congressional Bovine Burp Task Force. Or
maybe the EPA will require _ think about it _ scrubbers on udders,
bag hoses on nostrils. I think we ought to take a cattle prod to
the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sept. 26, 1991
</P>
<P>
   On Radioactive Beagles
</P>
<P>
   Madam Speaker ((Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn., filling in as
speaker)), the remains of 800 beagles and 1,700 tons of their
radioactive urine and feces will be buried at a nuclear site in the
State of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The dead dogs have been in freezers since 1950. They were part
of a study to assess the damage of radioactive fallout. The study
is now conclusive: Radioactive fallout is fatal, and canines
subject thereto died. But the point is, Madam Speaker, the funeral
is going to cost $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me, are they going to ship the bodies by limo? Are they
going to have gold tombstones for every hound?
</P>
<P>
   With 37 million people in America without health insurance, 9
million people unemployed, I would like to say that our government
is spending $22 million to erect a giant fire hydrant as a
mausoleum to dead beagles.
</P>
<P>
   I think that says it all, Madam Speaker: America's domestic
priorities have gone to the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oct. 9, 1991
</P>
<P>
   On the Government Shutdown
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Speaker, something does not add up. . . . Experts say,
``Don't worry, America. If the federal government shuts down, only
nonessential workers will be furloughed.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Now the dictionary says nonessential means not necessary. Now,
if that is the case, did anyone around here ever stop to think that
if Congress did not borrow money to hire nonessential workers,
Congress would not have to borrow more money to pay nonessential
workers and Congress would not have to shut down?
</P>
<P>
   Beam me up, Mr. Speaker. Maybe, just maybe, the Congress of the
United States is a little nonessential.

TED HUSTEAD DIES AT 96; BUILT LEGENDARY WALL DRUG STORE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: S.D., Neb., Kansas, Kenya, Britain)  By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anybody who watched Ted Hustead roll into Wall, S.D., on a
cattle truck in December 1931, his wife and 4-year-old son at his
side, the family's entire stock of meager possessions piled in the
back, would have needed quite a crystal ball to predict that by the
time Hustead died two-thirds of a century later, the governor of
South Dakota would be moved to open his annual state-of-the-state
address with a tribute to the man who became a beloved South Dakota
legend by turning a smalltown pharmacy named Wall Drug into the
world's most popular drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   A sprawling tourist attraction of international renown, it takes
in more than $10 million a year and draws some 2 million annual
visitors to a remote town whose population has never risen above
800.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, hot, dusty and remote as Wall was and is, 50 miles
east of Rapid City on the edge of the notorious Badlands, not even
Hustead could have predicted how far a pharmacist could go _ or how
far people would travel to come to him _ with the offer of a free
drink of ice water and a ubiquitous, world-famous network of clever
roadside signs and bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Gov. William J. Janklow put it on Wednesday, a day after
Hustead died at 96 at a hospital in Philip, S.D., 30 miles from
Wall: ``He's a guy that figured out that free ice water could turn
you into a phenomenal success in the middle of a semi-arid desert
way out in the middle of someplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Or nowhere, as it seemed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, in 1931 it would have been hard to predict that
anyone who settled in Wall would make much of a mark, let alone a
28-year-old pharmacist who had used the entire $3,000 he inherited
from his father to buy the town's lone drug store.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor's son from Phillips, Neb., Hustead had earned a
pharmacist's degree from the University of Nebraska and worked as a
farm laborer and later at a grain elevator in Sioux Falls before
heeding his mother's advice to seek independence.
</P>
<P>
   According to family lore, as the truck made the 300-mile trek to
Wall, the driver described the rigors of the West with such
mounting fervor and in such vivid detail that by the time he got
around to the snakes, little Billy was so distraught he asked why
in the world the family had left its nice brick house in Sioux
Falls for such a forsaken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' his mother, Dorothy, explained, ``your father is
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Settling in the store's back room, the Husteads agreed to stick
it out for five years, but after taking in only $360 the first
month and not much more after that, it began to seem that Wall Drug
had been a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with only six months to go on the five-year limit and just
after the family had moved to a house near the highway, Mrs.
Hustead had a brainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Going home for a nap on an especially hot Sunday in July 1936,
she was back in an hour complaining that she hadn't been able to
sleep because of the incessant rumble of traffic on Route 16.
</P>
<P>
   It got her to thinking, she said, that if they put up a little
sign out on the highway offering free ice water to tourists on
their way to Mount Rushmore maybe some of them would turn off to
quench their thirst and perhaps even buy something.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the proliferating Burma Shave ditties of the day,
she even composed a little jingle: ``Get a soda/Get root beer/Turn
next corner/Just as near/To Highway 16 and 14/Free Ice Water/Wall
Drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Hustead needed no further prodding. By the time he got back from
putting up the sign the next day, cars already had started turning
off and making the block and a half to Wall Drug on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't stopped. Fired by the initial success, Hustead
began expanding the store, adding wares and attractions while
installing signs along every highway in South Dakota and
neighboring states, all proclaiming just how much farther a
motorist had to go to reach the promised land of Wall Drug.
</P>
<P>
   In time Hustead was spending $300,000 a year on billboard
advertising, including Wall Drug signs on London buses and in every
train station in Kenya. But it was American GI's who took up the
craze and spread the Wall Drug word to the far corners of the
world. During World War II it seemed that every sign saying
``Kilroy was here,'' was accompanied by one giving the mileage to
Wall Drug.
</P>
<P>
   (Regulations to keep the nation's scenic highways free of visual
pollution eventually crimped the Hustead style. Still, after I-90
replaced the old highways, periodic surveys showed that as much as
three-quarters of the traffic turned off to visit Wall Drug, but
then who can resist an exit marked by an 80-foot dinosaur?)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to delighting motorists, the signs generated
hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles, many of them displayed
on a wall of Wall Drug, a tourist attraction that seems famous
largely for its very fame.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even after the little store has been expanded into a
75,000-square-foot colossus of western kitsch with an enclosed
mall, dozens of shops selling everything from T-shirts to expensive
boots (you can have wine with your buffalo burger in the
400-plus-seat restaurant), a summertime staff of 250 and an array
of corny free attractions like a cowboy orchestra that plays every
15 minutes, the quintessential way to experience Wall Drug seems to
be to stand at the wall of clippings reading about people standing
at the wall of clippings reading about people standing at the wall
... .

<P>
   Long after he turned over active management to his son, Bill,
whose recent illness has forced him to hand the reins to his sons,
Rick and Ted, the proprietor was a constant, proud presence at Wall
Drug.

   Hustead, whose wife died in 1994, and whose survivors include
another son, Charles of Topeka, Kan.; two daughters, Mary Bottum
and Catherine Roe, both of Los Angeles, 17 grandchildren and 22
great-grandchildren, knew that there were other popular
international tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The Taj Mahal, for example. As the sign says, it's ``only 10,728
miles to Wall Drug.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 17:
</P>
<P>
   The Constitutional Test
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the House impeachment managers shifted their
arguments from the facts of President Clinton's misdeeds to the
central question of whether, based on those facts, there is a
constitutional basis for removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The key assumption of their constitutional theory had emerged
during the presentation of the evidence against Clinton on the
counts of perjury and obstruction of justice. In essence, the
prosecutors argue that perjury and obstruction, while not named in
the Constitution, are so serious that they are tantamount to the
offenses that are specifically named, those being ``treason,
bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer insisted Saturday that ``perjury and bribery
are side by side'' as offenses that meet the constitutional
standard. He reminded the senators of Rep. Bill McCollum's earlier
presentation of a chart based on the federal sentencing guidelines.
It showed that under a point system used by federal judges, perjury
and obstruction of justice outrank bribery in seriousness.
Therefore, McCollum argued, the president's offenses belong in the
same category as the offenses stipulated in the Constitution ``and
he should be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   These presentations illuminate the heart of the case. In
examining it, we can see how it is possible to embrace two
propositions that appear in conflict on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Like the House prosecutors, we believe that Clinton lied under
oath and tampered with the legal process. But we also contend that
Clinton should finish his term because his failures are not of a
scale to qualify under the Constitution as high crimes or
misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   While we are not fans of the White House legal team, it framed
the constitutional question correctly in its trial memorandum to
the Senate. Removal of the president should be reserved for
``offenses against the system of government,'' such as a serious
political crime or an assault on constitutional order or an act of
malfeasance or abuse bearing directly on performance of official
duties. Here Clinton is saved by the lowness of his conduct. His
offenses lack the requisite constitutional grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   In regard to scale and proportionality, the Framers clearly gave
great weight to the continuity of government. They were reluctant
to disrupt the normal electoral rhythm except in the most extreme
cases. The White House memorandum argues that the Senate must ask
whether the alleged misconduct is ``so malevolent to our
constitutional system that it justifies undoing the people's
decision'' and inducing a ``national trauma.'' Clinton's lawyers
say these charges do not rise to that standard, and we agree.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is electoral continuity that trumps the House
prosecutors' argument that perjury is perjury and that equality
before the law can only be asserted by removing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Our view remains that Clinton can be _ indeed, must be _
punished through censure in a way that affirms the primacy of the
law. But removing him on these offenses sacrifices something too
important _ the orderly transfer of power on a four-year schedule _
to accomplish a condemnation that can be delivered through other
means.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the genius of the Constitution is its farsighted
embodiment of principles of balance and proportionality. Read
closely, it clearly demands that the ultimate punishment be
reserved for systemic threats to the state, rather than the
personal failings of a reckless individual.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is possible to believe every allegation against
Clinton and still believe it better to let his presidency dwindle
away than to distort the Constitution.

EDITORIAL: CHURCHES AND CHARTER SCHOOLS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 17:
</P>
<P>
   The slapdash process in Albany, N.Y., that created the state's
new charter-school law without any public input was a disgrace. It
is no wonder that the legislation raises difficult, unresolved
issues. In theory, charter schools can offer families more choice
and encourage educational innovation. But they must be created
without unfairly draining resources from the public system that
will continue to educate the vast majority of students and without
funneling public money into religious education.
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows creation of up to 100 charter schools _
schools that are publicly financed but run independently by
parents, teachers and community groups. Fifty of the charters will
be granted by the Board of Trustees of the State University of New
York, and the other 50 will be granted by the State Board of
Regents and local school boards, or in the case of New York City,
by the schools chancellor. Beyond the 100 new schools that can be
created, existing public schools can under the law convert to
charter-school status, and gain independence from most regulations
that govern public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents, which oversees public and private schools,
is supposed to monitor charter schools to insure that they meet
certain academic and financial standards. But the Regents do not
have sole authority to interpret the provisions of the statute.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious leaders in New York City are eager to establish
charter schools on church property. That should be viewed
skeptically. The law says that no charter shall be given to a
school that would be ``wholly or in part under the control or
direction of any religious denomination or in which any
denominational tenet or doctrine would be taught.''
</P>
<P>
   The state constitution prohibits public funding of parochial
schools. The charter law bars the overt teaching of religion, as
well as the conversion of religious schools into charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear what forms of church involvement may be
permitted, and how far religious groups can go in taking advantage
of charter funding. Some might try to get around the constitutional
limits by setting up a secular school on church property and then
providing religious instruction during off hours. Others may create
a nominally secular school that nonetheless caters mostly to
children from a particular religious community. But a school that
is largely run by church members _ even with a secular program _
might well violate the law.
</P>
<P>
   The convoluted statute allows the Board of Regents and the SUNY
trustees to come up with separate, potentially different,
interpretations of the religion question. Gov. George Pataki, for
one, is taking an expansive view of what the law allows church
leaders to do, so long as they do not teach religion. That may not
be enough to prevent charter schools, which are supposed to be
alternative public schools, from becoming de facto church schools.
</P>
<P>
   The more prudent course would require that any schools with
church-related ties recruit students actively from outside the
denomination and that the schools be run by boards dominated by
community leaders from outside the church.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton on trial for his political
life, the name of Sen. Edmund G. Ross of Kansas is apt to come up
whenever people talk about courage, honor and duty.
</P>
<P>
   In American political legend, he chose personal ruin rather than
betray his principles, defying his party leadership in voting to
acquit President Andrew Johnson during the last presidential
impeachment, in 1868. If he had voted the other way, Johnson would
have been removed and American history might have been much
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost literally looked down into my open grave,'' he wrote
of the vote that he knew would destroy his Senate career.
</P>
<P>
   His sacrifice stirs admiration among his descendants. ``We're
proud of our ancestor,'' a great-grandson, Edmund Pitt Ross, a
retired clergyman and civil engineer from Albuquerque, N.M., said
the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our family lore,'' said a great-great-grandson
who is a foreign service officer for the State Department and
agreed to speak only if his name was not be used. ``He was someone
who kept his own moral compass.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a man who found his way out of the political
wilderness, leaving a legacy beyond the Senate vote that John F.
Kennedy wrote about in his 1955 book ``Profiles in Courage.'' He
was a man who lived to see himself vindicated by history and who,
in writing his own political obituary, showed that he had not only
a sense of duty but a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Gibson Ross had been a printer and owned an interest in a
Topeka newspaper, been a dedicated abolitionist and helped to
organize a railroad before the Civil War. He was an officer in the
Union Army and had a powerful presence.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise when the Kansas governor appointed him to
the Senate in 1866. Ross was a Republican, named to take the seat
of another Republican, Jim Lane, who had been so vilified as a
supporter of Johnson's that he committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and Southerner, Johnson was detested by those
Republicans who wanted to punish the defeated Confederate states
rather than continue Abraham Lincoln's policy of reconciliation, as
Johnson did. So Johnson's enemies were overjoyed at the selection
of Ross, who had been sharply critical of Lane and disliked the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had given Republicans an excuse for impeachment by
moving to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a Lincoln
holdover whom he distrusted, in 1867. The president's action defied
an act (later ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court) that had
been passed by Congress to hobble his power to remove
officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   Incensed, the Republican-controlled House voted overwhelmingly
to impeach. Since there were 42 Republicans and only 12 Democrats
in the Senate, the Republican leadership could lose six votes and
still have the two-thirds majority necessary for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   To the party leaders' dismay, six Republicans soon announced
that they had found the evidence insufficient and would vote to
acquit. That put terrible pressure on Ross, who had not declared
his intentions but who, as a lawmaker from a state whose people
generally loathed the president, was at first counted as a safe
vote for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was 51 years old in 1868, with a seemingly bright political
future. But his dislike of Johnson notwithstanding, he thought the
president was right. On May 16, 1868, he voted to acquit. The tally
was 35 to 19 in favor of conviction. Had he voted the other way,
Johnson would have been ousted and, historians agree, the
presidency would have been seriously weakened. (Votes on two other
articles of impeachment 10 days later were anticlimactic; the
outcome was the same.)
</P>
<P>
   Back in Kansas, he held interests in several newspapers and ran
for governor as a Democrat in 1880. He lost. Two years later, he
moved to Albuquerque, thinking that the dry air would be good for
his health. In the 1884 campaign, he was a strong supporter of
Grover Cleveland; the new president named him governor of the New
Mexico territory.
</P>
<P>
   His stubborn principles served him well. He battled land
speculators and, perhaps more important, worked tirelessly to
establish public schools. Providing an education, he said, ``is the
highest duty and most sacred function of government.'' The
University of New Mexico was founded in 1889.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of Ross's great-grandsons, Edmund Ross Harrington, is a
retired school superintendent from Redondo Beach, Calif. ``We are
proud that our great-grandfather was a man of courage,'' Mr.
Harrington said recently. He, two brothers and a sister are the
grandchildren of Arthur Ross, one of the Kansas Senator's six
children.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Pitt Ross of Albuquerque, who is 73, is a grandson of the
senator's son Pitt. Ross said he and his brother, Everitt, and
their sister, Elizabeth Lackman, were pleased that an elementary
school in Albuquerque was named after their great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Gibson Ross was nothing if not a political realist. When
Benjamin Harrison defeated Grover Cleveland in 1888, he knew what
it meant. ``I was again, and very promptly, relegated to private
life,'' he reflected later, ``and am now by turns printer, farmer,
gentleman at leisure, author, philosopher, tramp _ but never a
sorehead.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His place in history secure, surrounded by family and friends,
Ross spent the evening of his life quietly and happily. He died in
New Mexico on May 8, 1907, at the age of 80.

UNYIELDING CHIEF FOR THE LOS ANGELES POLICE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Attn: Penn.)  By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One of the complaints heard most often about the
tenure of Police Chief Willie L. Williams earlier this decade was
that he was just too soft for the job, too soft in his heart when
it came to disciplining his officers and leading them to better
days.
</P>
<P>
   He was in a tough spot. The Los Angeles Police Department's
reputation and morale had suffered in the wake of the Rodney King
beating, and Williams was brought in from Philadelphia to right the
department after the rage and flames of the riots of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was popular with the public, Williams, the city's
first black police chief, was forced out in 1997 after one
five-year term. He was replaced by Bernard C. Parks, a
ramrod-straight disciplinarian and 32-year department veteran.
</P>
<P>
   No one would ever accuse Parks, who is also black, of being
soft. He looks as if Hollywood had sent him to play the part of the
chief. But the hardness that served him so well on the mean streets
and the treacherous world of office politics at police headquarters
is now apparently a source of growing discontent within the ranks
of the 9,730-officer police department.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his officers grumble that Parks is so hard, strict and
unfair when it comes to discipline that a group of them do not want
him to attend their funerals if they are killed in the line of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Los Angeles Times, which first reported the
officers' requests on Friday, some of the officers have even
included a no-Parks last wish on their emergency information cards,
which are left at their stations when they go on out patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hepburn, president of the Police Protective League, the
police union, which has been at odds with Chief Parks over work
rules and discipline issues since his tenure began in August 1997,
said that the funeral protest was not orchestrated by the union. He
also said he did not know how many officers were involved, although
it is believed the number is several dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't our idea and we don't support it,'' Hepburn insisted
at a news conference about the protest. ``But we understand why the
officers are upset. What it indicates is the depth of the negative
feelings towards the chief.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Parks refused to comment as he attended a graduation
ceremony at the police academy. But during his speech, the chief
told the new officers that ``we will accept nothing less than
professional conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 54 officers were fired by the Parks administration
for various infractions and seven others resigned before they could
be dismissed, Hepburn said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, only 11 officers were dismissed. The year before, it
was 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is when is enough enough?'' Hepburn said. ``This
is a shock to the system. The officers are used to one level of
discipline and this chief is firing five times as many officers as
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 54 officers dismissed last year were ousted for
excessive force and several longtime observers of the department _
from a retired assistant police chief to a civil rights lawyer to
the writer of a book on the history of the department _ say that it
is about time that someone cracked the whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernard inherited something that had been allowed to slip and
one of the things that had slipped was the attitude toward police
misconduct,'' said David D. Dotson, a former assistant chief, who
retired in 1992 after 34 years. ``He believes that sometimes you
have to do unpopular things if you are going to turn the ship
around, you're going to have to bloody a few noses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Manes, a lawyer for Police Watch, a citizen's group that
monitors the department, said the department had had ``very little
self control over the officers, at least in the area of excessive
force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is,'' Manes said, ``Parks is doing what
has got to be done. The city is paying millions of dollars a year
in excessive force cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But how much and what kind of changes Parks is committed to is
uncertain, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out,'' said Connie Rice, a civil rights
lawyer, who is suing the department on behalf of a group of women,
both civilian employees and police officers, alleging
discrimination and harassment. ``He could be the most brilliant
police chief we've ever had, but I see some disturbing signs of
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those signs, Ms. Rice said, is Parks' apparent hostility
to meaningful civilian input into the police department, a longtime
goal of advocates of departmental change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no confidence,'' she said, ``that civilian oversight is
taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, crime is down in Los Angeles, as it is many big cities
across the country, and Parks seems popular outside of the police
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job Chief Parks is doing is outstanding,'' said Ken
Ferber, a spokesman for the Police Commission. ``You would probably
be concerned if there weren't grumblings.''
</P>
<P>
   When people talk _ or grumble _ about Parks the words
``brilliant,'' ``charismatic,'' ``stubborn,'' ``tough'' and
``autocratic'' come up again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parks is one of those people who are convinced that they are
never wrong,'' said Joe Domanick, the author of a history of the
department, ``To Protect And To Serve.'' ``I think this is both an
asset and a problem for him. He's so convinced that he's always
right, there's an unwillingness to learn and to assimilate other
people's point of view. That's a problem for him, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotson, the former assistant chief, said that Parks was not the
first chief to feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that infects most chiefs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dotson said that he was worried that Parks, who used to be
his highly capable subordinate, might be too enamored with his own
counsel for his or his department's own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does seem to be extremely autocratic,'' Dotson said. ``He's
making a lot of important and long-lasting changes and he's
accomplished more than any other chief I've known. But his handling
of people has suffered. He seems to be sort of oblivious to it.''

REAL ESTATE: IMMIGRANTS' DREAM IS FINDING A HOME INSIDE THE GOLDEN
DOOR
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beaming with pride of ownership, Jose and Paula Lora stood
before their dark-red, split-level home in Teaneck, N.J., last
weekend, a long way from the city of Santiago in the Dominican
Republic and _ if not geographically, at least in their minds _
nearly as far from the cramped Bronx rental apartments in which
they had lived since arriving in the United States a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The house cost $170,000 and, after several years of saving, the
Loras managed to make a down-payment of $25,000. ``It has four
bedrooms, a study and a small basement for the kids to watch TV,''
Lora said, ``you know, to do the mess, the games, the toys.'' Jorge
is 9, and Ruth is 8.
</P>
<P>
   The Loras occupy one band on the spectrum of experience faced by
immigrants in dealing with the intricacies of real estate in the
New York area.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-story walk-up on Orchard Street in Manhattan's
Chinatown, a 37-year-old man from China's Fujian province hides his
face behind a newspaper. His name is Liu; he did not want to give
his full name. Liu occupies a far distant band on the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of eight men who share a 12- by 12-foot space,
sleeping on slapdash, raw-lumber bunk beds. Together, the eight men
pay $640 a month for the room, as do eight men living in each of
the two other rooms in the same apartment _ all sharing the
filth-encrusted bathroom and kitchen. There are about 70 people
living in the building's three apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Liu has lived there six of his 10 years in America. ``Not used
to it,'' he said through an interpreter, ``but what can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   For all sorts of reasons _ both imposed and, to a degree,
self-imposed _ some immigrants succeed in their quest for decent
housing in and around New York City, some don't.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the tens of thousands of newcomers _ and their
numbers are increasing _ must navigate a nuanced web of factors in
finding a home: the language barrier, jarring cultural differences,
the complexity of the rental and mortgage-acquisition systems, lack
of credit histories, lack of banking services in their communities,
incomes off the books, the driving urge for family reunification,
loyalty to two countries, sending money home, being treated as
intruders, racial discrimination and being cheated _ sometimes,
even, by their own countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Through all that, more and more new Americans _ like the Loras _
make it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 (the last year for which data were available), according
to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, 37.7 percent, or
1,048,000, of the 2,780,000 households in the city were headed by
immigrants. That represented an increase from 1991, when 33.2
percent, or 924,600, of all households were headed by immigrants.
And over the same period, the number of immigrants who purchased
homes increased from 257,000 to 276,000, so that, as of 1996, 26.3
percent of all immigrants in the city were home owners.
</P>
<P>
   There are no numbers to gauge the impact of immigration on the
city's suburbs. But one hint is that the Loras now belong to the
year-old, dozen-member Dominican Home Owners Association of Bergen
County, N.J. ``We were living in the Bronx, near Lehman College,''
Lora said. ``Our rent was $550. It went to like $650. Then we
moved, and we paid there $720 _ the last rent we paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other tenants, Lora _ who in 10 years here has
worked his way from restaurant cashier to accountant _ did the math
and wondered: Why pay someone else? That was four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was easy securing a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at
8.5 percent. ``At the beginning, they made life impossible,'' Lora
said of the lender. ``We dealt with the mortgage company for five
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought he was being discriminated against, Lora
said, ``I don't think it was that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time we bought a house,'' he said. ``We
didn't know how. At one point you think maybe because you are Lora,
not Johnson, that they are making life impossible to give you the
loan. Now that I know the process, I would know if they are trying
to bother me or if they just need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   For lack of understanding of the system, Lora said, many
immigrants ``don't have the documentation together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the person they tried to get the loan from is
trying to take advantage,'' he said. ``I don't say that doesn't
happen, but sometimes it's misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Or utter unfamiliarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no tradition of mortgages in India,'' said Vanitha
Venugopal, housing director in the office of Queens Borough
President Claire Shulman _ a point made by representatives of other
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come from a cash-based economy,'' said Hugh Hamilton, a
Guyanese native, speaking about members of the Caribbean community.
``Most Caribbeans are unaware of the criteria that must be met in
order to qualify for mortgages.'' Hamilton is legislative director
for City Councilman Lloyd Henry, a Brooklyn Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   In November, during a conference on immigrant housing at the New
York University School of Law, one participant raised his hand to
say, ``When Latin American immigrants see 30-year mortgages, we get
scared and limit ourselves to short-term loans'' _ sometimes from
unscrupulous lenders who, knowing that the buyer knows no better,
charge exorbitant rates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the real-estate agent and the mortgage broker are in
cahoots, and the guileless buyer appreciates what seems like
one-stop shopping. Victor Morisete-Romero, executive director of
the Community Association of Progressive Dominicans, a social
service agency, said immigrants often pay 24 percent over a
seven-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural norms ``often clash with the American-dream
mentality,'' he said. ``In the Dominican Republic, when you buy a
home the deal is done; there aren't additional expenses. Here, with
taxes, water bills, fire inspections, boiler inspections, building
regulations, amortizing the mortgage, they look at a $140,000
investment for 30 years at 7.65 percent, do the numbers and
basically say they don't really own it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, if they have got that far in the mortgage-buying
process _ no mean feat for most immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Some newcomers, particularly professionals and established
business people, arrive in the United States with considerable
wealth, education, connections and access to the system.
</P>
<P>
   Others, arriving for the raft of reasons that have impelled
immigration to America for generations _ political, religious,
racial persecution; yearnings for a better life, hopes of easing
the economic burden of those in the old country _ come ill-equipped
to deal with real estate. The difficulties are compounded, of
course, if the immigrant is here illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing back home as rent regulation,'' said
Ms. Venugopal. ``So, at least for the first few years, they may
live in terrible conditions because they are unaware of the
protections available to them.''
</P>
<P>
   A participant at the NYU conference, which was sponsored by the
law school's Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, said that
besides being unaware of the rental protections, many immigrants
avoid filing a complaint, fearing that an appearance in Housing
Court will leave them with a police record.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Kui, executive director of Asian Americans for
Equality, a nonprofit community and housing development
organization, pointed out that just as immigrant renters are
unaware of their rights, ``some Chinese landlords are ignorant of
their responsibilities under the law, so housing codes are not
enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kui said, Chinese immigrants ``often buy
houses with basements to rent them, only to find that it is against
the law, after they have calculated mortgage payments based on that
income.''
</P>
<P>
   Many new arrivals must, of course, take menial jobs in factories
or restaurants, where they are paid off the books, rendering it
impossible to start building the credit histories indispensable for
eventually working their way up the rental ladder and, perhaps,
purchasing their slice of the proverbial American pie.
</P>
<P>
   To save, they live together _ extended families and strangers
alike _ doubling and tripling up, or crammed like Liu into
barracks-like hovels. ``I want to buy a house or rent a house,'' he
said, ``but not without my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu fled from the Chinese population police in 1986. ``Because I
have five children, the government gave me trouble,'' he said.
``Before I got arrested, I went away.'' He has seen his family once
in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I save to bring them here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Poorer immigrants forgo buying a car, going to the movies,
medical insurance. Accustomed to all-cash economies, many keep
their savings at home, exposing themselves to further risk. To pay
the rent, they go to the Post Office and buy a money order.
</P>
<P>
   Erika Rodas, assistant coordinator of minority lending in the
Westbury office of Skyscraper Mortgage Co., told the tale of a
Salvadoran couple with three children who kept $7,000 under a
mattress in the dilapidated one-bedroom apartment for which they
were paying monthly rent of $1,400. Ms. Rodas said the father, a
pizza cook, could not read; the mother worked in a factory. They
dreamed of a decent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prequalified them to see how much they could really afford
for a house,'' Ms. Rodas said. ``We took them to open a bank
account. We finally found the house they needed _ a cape, four
bedrooms, in a much better area of Westbury.''
</P>
<P>
   The house, appraised at $140,000, was facing foreclosure, Ms.
Rodas said, ``so they got it for $90,000 and they have a lot of
equity now.'' The 30-year mortgage had a fixed rate of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the family moved out, fire gutted their old
apartment house. ``They were very grateful,'' Ms. Rodas said.
``They would have lost their savings.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigrant housing quest can come up against ``cultural
quirks'' _ Ms. Venugopal's phrase _ that sometimes act like ruts in
the road, sometimes smooth the way and even on occasion profoundly
change the communities in which the newcomers settle.
</P>
<P>
   Some immigrants from the Indian subcontinent are adherents to
Vastu Shastra _ a code, similar to Chinese Feng Shui, that guides
one toward the most spiritually propitious way of laying out a
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one person who told a realtor he wanted the master
bedroom facing east, so the morning sun will wake him,'' Ms.
Venugopal said.
</P>
<P>
   At the NYU conference, a man from Nigeria said that in his
country most people live in inherited houses, or build their own,
so buying someone else's home is a foreign concept.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic groups, denied access to banking services, form
networks of relatives and friends _ buyers' clubs, in effect _ to
exchange information and pool their resources. Hamilton, the native
of Guyana who is now a city official, said that in Caribbean
communities such a network is called a ``sou-sou'' _ an informal
system of rotating credit based on African tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say six of us decide to set aside $200 every month,''
Hamilton said. ``It would take six months for any one of us to get
$1,200, but by pooling our contributions, each person is able to
get $1,200 from any single pool.'' The contributors pick the order
of beneficiaries. ``In terms of buying a house, of course, you
multiply it significantly, involving as many people as necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The language barrier can literally change the face of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It may be apocryphal but, by some accounts, Sunset Park in
Brooklyn became a haven for Chinese immigrants after several
settled there and put the word out: get off at the Blue Sky Station
_ the BMT stop after the train comes out of the tunnel. ``It
illustrates the barriers people face when they can't read signs,''
said Kui of Asian Americans for Equality.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 7 line from Flushing to Times Square is known by some as
the New Orient Express.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 1970s, immigrants from Odessa, Ukraine, then part of
the Soviet Union, chose to settle in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn,
because, like Odessa, it is by the sea _ sowing seeds for the
still-blossoming Russian enclave in southern Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more recent buds are Ilya and Inessa Rubenstein and
their 4-year-old son, Samuel. The Rubensteins were fortunate:
someone told them to start building credit soon after they arrived
from the former Soviet republic of Belarus in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein had worked for a Jewish organization in the city of
Minsk. And when the collapse of communism released pent-up
right-wing extremism, he said, ``it was, of course, anti-Semitic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``we had letters that Jews should go
back where they came from, threatening phone calls and many things
that forced us to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Mrs. Rubenstein had already fled to the United
States. ``And the minute we came,'' Rubenstein said, ``they told us
to start our credit history. So I got credit cards almost
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, the Rubensteins _ he now the administrative
director of the Jewish Community Council of Kings Bay in Brooklyn,
she working toward a degree in medical technology _ have passed
muster with the co-op board of Sheepshead Bay Terrace, a 168-unit
building, and are awaiting final approval of their mortgage from
Chase Manhattan to buy a $45,000, two-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of the burgeoning middle class of immigrants
moving toward home-buying that developers like Joshua Muss,
president of Muss Development _ a company that has built 20,000
housing units in the city since 1906 _ are tapping into.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about probably a million immigrants who have
come within the last decade,'' Muss said. ``Many are improving
themselves and aspiring to better housing, and there's nothing
available.''
</P>
<P>
   After several Soviet emigres bought $200,000 to $300,000 houses
at Captain's Quarters, a 270-unit Muss development in the Princes
Bay section of Staten Island, ``there was word of mouth and we
started advertising, targeting them in Russian newspapers in
Brooklyn,'' Muss said. ``And of the last 100 homes, half went to
former Soviet emigres.''
</P>
<P>
   Within months, he said, his company will begin construction of
an 850-unit complex on the site of the old Brighton Beach Baths.
And the company is considering construction of 1,200 units on a
100-acre expanse of downtown Flushing recently rezoned by the City
Planning Commission. ``The market there is enormous,'' Muss said,
``a huge community of Korean, Chinese and Indian immigrants, very
anxious for housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants are vital to the city's housing health, said
Professor Michael Schill, director of the NYU real-estate center.
``They maintain the city's population.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1997, according to Census Bureau estimates, the
city's population increased modestly, by 0.3 percent, or about
20,000 people. And while the city experienced a net loss of
1,073,500 people to other parts of the country during that period,
the city gained 677,200 people through immigration and 421,200 more
by natural increase _ meaning more births than deaths. ``So without
immigration,'' Schill said, ``the city would have lost 9 percent of
its population.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have had a tremendous effect on the city's economy,
its retail, the labor force and its neighborhoods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, immigration tightens the housing market and
contributes to higher rents for all New Yorkers, Schill said. But
without it, he said, rents at the bottom of the market would be
insufficient to enable owners to maintain buildings, ``which would
lead to disinvestment, tax delinquencies and, ultimately,
abandonment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, while immigration is a mixed blessing,'' he said, ``in my
view it is ultimately a positive because without it neighborhoods
would be scarred by vacant and deteriorating housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Bayer is director of the New York office of Fannie Mae,
the federally chartered funding source for issuers of mortgages.
``Much of our work is aimed at breaking down barriers and providing
the information immigrants need,'' Ms. Bayer said. In cooperation
with the Queens Borough Public Library system, Fannie Mae has
started a series of home-buying workshops in a variety of
languages. It has adopted policies allowing lenders to use
alternate forms of credit _ rent stubs, phone bills _ as parts of a
buyer's credit record, and to accept ``sou-sous'' as an alternate
down-payment source.
</P>
<P>
   It has also created low down-payment products _ 3 percent for
single-unit properties, 5 percent for a two-family and 10 percent
for a three- or four-family home. And it has adopted a formula for
two- to four-unit properties in which rental income can count far
more significantly than in the past in allowing a lower-income
family to afford a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Jenny Gao are about to join the ranks of American home
owners. Newly arrived from China in 1990, the Gaos first lived with
relatives in Newport News, Va., then moved to a rental in
Philadelphia, then doubled up with strangers in Flushing _ the
``new Chinatown,'' Gao called it _ then moved into a second-floor
bedroom in another Flushing home, sharing the kitchen and bathrooms
with the owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My landlord had a baby,'' said Gao, a shipping clerk for an
import company, ``so I need to get a new place.'' The Gaos took a
homebuyers workshop from Asian Americans for Equality. Then, it all
seemed so foreign. ``In China, we don't need to buy,'' Gao said.
``government gave me the apartment; just pay like $3, a few
peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   At the buyer's workshop, ``they taught me the difference between
buying an apartment or a house, a condominium and co-op _
condominium you own the space, co-op just share the stock,'' Gao
said proudly. ``They say for a mortgage we need to pay no more than
30 percent of the expenses every month. They told me to save in the
bank, and put in every month.'' On Wednesday, the Gaos will close
on a two-bedroom, $50,000 co-op in Briarwood, Queens, with a
30-year mortgage at a fixed rate of 6.875 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want privacy,'' Gao said. ``I want space. I have lots of
books.''
</P>
<P>
   The apartment is on the seventh floor, with a westward view. ``I
like this place,'' Gao said. ``It's very beautiful from the living
room. I can look at the Manhattan skyline.''

EX-ARMS INSPECTOR SAYS PENTAGON SEEKS TO CENSOR BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 4 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 7 p.m. ET EMBARGO
for electronic media.) 
(mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Defense Department has demanded that Scott
Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, turn over advance
copies of a book in which he is expected to step up his criticism
of the Clinton administration and detail some of his work for the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, who resigned last summer and accused the United States
of undermining the inspection program, said through his lawyer that
he is unlikely to agree to a prepublication security review. His
refusal could prompt a court battle with the Pentagon that might
delay publication of the book, now scheduled for late March.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Matthew Lifflander, said the Defense Department
appeared to have joined in an administration-wide attempt to
intimidate Ritter into silence. Ritter is already under
investigation by the Justice Department on charges that he may have
shared classified information with Israel while working at the
United Nations, a accusation that he denies.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Pentagon dated Jan. 14, Lifflander said, ``We
have been reliably informed that certain very senior officials of
more than one federal agency have recently gone out of their way to
deprecate Ritter and denigrate his views.'' And as a result, the
letter said, ``we are not inclined to submit unnecessarily to any
potential suppression of his First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has not said explicitly that it will try
to stop publication of the book or to censor portions of it. And
asked whether the Defense Department was attempting to intimidate
Ritter, the Department issued a one-word statement on Friday:
``No.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter to Ritter dated Dec. 23, the Pentagon demanded
that several copies of the book be turned over to the department at
least two months before publication and reminded him of his
``contractual obligations'' to the Defense Department not to
divulge ``material obtained as a result of your work'' at the U.N.
Special Commission, which supervised arms inspections in Iraq until
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, a retired Marine intelligence officer, had been formally
under contract to the Defense Department as a consultant while he
worked at the special commission. He was considered to be on loan
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has come to our attention that you may write a book that
pertains to your involvement with the United Nations Special
Commission on Iraq while performing under contract to the U.S.
government,'' the letter said. ``Your contracts with the U.S.
Government require that you obtain written authorization from the
contracting officer prior to the public release of any material
obtained as a result of work performed under the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster announced early last month that it had signed a
contract with Ritter for a book, tentatively titled ``Endgame.'' It
said it had no immediate comment on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Lifflander said the book would provide some details about
Ritter's work as an arms inspector in Iraq but would focus
primarily on his views about President Saddam Hussein and how the
United States and other nations should deal with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will deal with things Scott learned about Saddam Hussein
because Scott was there in Iraq,'' the lawyer said. ``It's
information that's all in the public domain.'' He said the book
would contain no classified information _ ``absolutely none.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter has given hundreds of interviews to news organizations in
recent months about his work at the United Nations to unmask Iraq's
programs to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Since
resigning, Ritter has repeatedly accused the administration of
undermining the work of the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who has testified before both houses of Congress,
who has given interview after interview, who has written for a
variety of leading publications, and all of a sudden, they want to
know in advance what he's going to say?'' Lifflander said. ``He
doesn't have any classified information to give away.''
</P>
<P>
   In answer to questions, the Defense Department suggested that it
was open to negotiations to avoid a court battle. Instead of
repeating its demand to see the book before publication, the
department said, ``We would make ourselves available to review
material to avoid the release of classified information.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lifflander, a longtime friend of Ritter, said it was clear that
Ritter was under a lifelong ban not to discuss or publish
classified information that he saw while in the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   But he said his reading of the Pentagon contracts signed by
Ritter after he left the Marines in 1991 and went to work for the
inspection team did not impose a similar ban on information he
obtained while working for the United Nations, when he no longer
had a security clearance from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Lifflander provided a copy of portions of the contracts. One of
the Defense Department contracts included a clause requiring that
Ritter not release ``any unclassified information, regardless of
medium (e.g. film, tape, document) pertaining to any part of this
contract'' unless the information is ``otherwise in the public
domain'' or the release has been approved in writing by the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Legal specialists have long debated the constitutionality of
contracts requiring prepublication review of books or other works
by government employees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 the CIA won a landmark case before the Supreme Court
against a former analyst, Frank Snepp, who refused to submit his
1977 book on the fall of Saigon, ``Decent Interval,'' for review.
The agency confiscated more than $200,000 in royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Another former agency official, Philip Agee, has been under
court order since the early 1980s to submit all writings to the
agency after his book, ``Inside the Company: CIA Diary,'' divulged
the names of dozens of American intelligence officers and agents
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Sanford, a Washington lawyer who specializes in
free-speech issues, said that after the Snepp and Agee decisions,
the government began to impose review requirements on ``all kinds
of employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the contracts, government employees are required to hand
over books and other materials for review even if the authors
handled little or no classified information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether that's constitutional or not is a very large question,
and I'm not aware of any test cases yet,'' Sanford said. ``This has
been a constant source of controversy.''

 &HT;    Faceoff: Steve Yzerman
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   _ Team: Detroit
</P>
<P>
   _ Update: Ranks 11th on the all-time goal-scoring list with 581.
Will start at center for North America in next Sunday's All-Star
Game in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   _ On how he would grade Detroit's first half: ``I guess a `C.'
It's been a struggle. We've had a tough time in various games to
really come in with a lot of energy, a lot of excitement and
enthusiasm necessary to win games against some teams who are really
playing hard and playing well. Our play as an entire team
defensively, we've just allowed far too many goals to win games. As
a team we're a lot sloppier.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On speculation of the Wings' Stanley Cup hangover: ``I don't
know if that is a term I'd use. It's not like we're sitting around
and said, 'Well, we'll kind of coast along the first half of the
year and get it going in the second half and be ready by playoff
time.' But there is no question we have had a tough time. I think
as long as we keep grinding along, we'll get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On competition for the Cup: ``There's more competition,
particularly in the West. Phoenix has really elevated its play.
Dallas has gotten stronger each of the last three years. Colorado,
after a slow start, has come on. So getting to the finals will be
more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On whether Sergei Fedorov's effort has diminished since his
big contract: ``Sergei has had a tough year. He hasn't played with
consistency, but we all have flaws in our game. We'd like him to be
a dominant player, and he has that ability. But I don't think it
has anything to do with his contract.''
</P>
<P>
   THRASHERS UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   When the Toronto Maple Leafs traded Felix Potvin to the New York
Islanders, it strengthened the chances the Thrashers will get a
strong goaltender in the expansion draft in June. How so?
Twenty-one of the 27 existing NHL teams must expose one of their
two goaltenders and the Islanders' Tommy Salo became a likely
discard when Potvin arrived. Teams that can't lose a goalie are
first-year Nashville and five other teams who lost one last year _
Buffalo, Los Angeles, Montreal, New Jersey and the New York
Rangers. Though Salo would be attractive, Roman Turek of Dallas
likely remains the team's top choice. Assistant general manager Les
Jackson, formerly of the Stars, and Thrashers goaltending
consultant Andy Moog, who played in Dallas and continues to live
there, both are familiar with Turek. A handful of teams with strong
backups _ the Stars, Islanders, Detroit (Norm Maracle), Phoenix
(Jim Waite) and San Jose (Steve Shields) _ have several options to
avoid losing a goaltender without compensation in the draft. The
two most plausible: 1) dealing a netminder to another team down the
stretch to get a player in return; 2) making a pre-draft
arrangement with the Thrashers to accept a draft pick or other
compensation in lieu of Atlanta taking a goalie. Nashville
stockpiled draft choices with similar deals last season. But
Atlanta general manager Don Waddell has said he won't likely make
as many pre-draft deals as the Predators, citing a preference for
the team to be competitive quickly. ... The team's scouting staff
began week-long meetings in Fort Lauderdale Friday. Scouts will
begin the process of ranking amateurs and potential available pros.
... Waddell hopes negotiations for a Thrashers' practice site are
completed ``in the next couple of weeks.'' Existing rinks in Duluth
and Alpharetta are the bidders.

 &HT;    Capturing the spirit of a King
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As he rode through Selma, Ala., on a spring day
in 1975, John Hindsman perched in the passenger seat of his Pontiac
and tensed his finger on the shutter button of his Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where it all began,'' said a friend as Hindsman
snapped frame after frame of the landmarks rolling by.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Dallas County Courthouse, where 10 years earlier
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had led hundreds of blacks in a
futile voter registration effort. There was Brown Chapel, where
King's followers gathered to march for justice. There was the
Pettus Bridge, where state patrolmen turned back the demonstrators
with tear gas, bullwhips and rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time Hindsman had been to Selma, but the
memory of violence that hung over the city made it feel like coming
home. Hindsman grew up on a Georgia plantation in the 1920s, when
the law and the lash made a pipe dream of equality. He had seen
black men imprisoned on trumped-up charges. He had seen his father
routinely cheated at the commissary. He had inhaled the stench of a
burning cross.
</P>
<P>
   King's crusade changed everything, but Hindsman wasn't around to
witness it. Like so many others, he left the blistering cotton rows
and teeming boarding houses for the promise of a better life up
north. While King and his allies dodged police cudgels and
firehoses, Hindsman was in Dayton, working at a hospital and
rearing eight children.
</P>
<P>
   Yet stepping out of history's stream left him with a smudge of
discontent. He carried his memories of the civil rights movement in
a scrapbook. Many who stayed in the South carried them in scars.
</P>
<P>
   That day in Selma, as Hindsman burned through his film, an idea
struck him. Maybe he could make up for his absence.
</P>
<P>
   With camera in hand, he vowed, he would follow the path King
took, from Montgomery to Memphis. He would record the places where
King, with little more than the force of his personality, caused
America's apartheid to crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one man,'' Hindsman would reflect 20 years later. `` You
can take it all the way from Abraham to Moses to David to Solomon,
all down through history. Just one man. He always gets the
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston, Ga., doesn't exist anymore. It hemorrhaged people for
so long that the surrounding county finally swallowed it.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1917, when Hindsman was born, Winston was a tiny farm
town to the west of Atlanta, the kind of place where the mayor ran
things from his general store. Hindsman's home was a shotgun house
with a tar paper roof on the grounds of the David T. Howard
plantation.
</P>
<P>
   For $200 in annual rent, the family broke the plantation's rich
soil to raise corn, cotton, sugar cane and melons. They kept a
garden for themselves and supplemented it with the wild greens and
onions that grew in the lowlands. They got their meat with a
12-gauge shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   The children went to school just three months of the year. Their
parents needed them at home, and not simply for work, for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Every spring, a man from the county inspected the community on
horseback to see how well everyone tended their crops. He couldn't
abide waste, and in his mind, that included sending black children
to school when they could be plowing or picking. Brooking his
displeasure meant a flogging for the man of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Hard times nurtured a stern religion among the county's black
folks, and Sundays brought shouted threats of hellfire and
damnation from the pulpit. Some of the most energetic soul-saving
came from an Atlanta preacher by the name of Daddy King.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy King brought his wife and three children to revival week
services at the Old Mountaintop Missionary Baptist Church, and one
of the kids caught Hindsman's eye. He was a little boy called M.L.,
12 years Hindsman's junior, who sat quietly during the marathon
orations while other children fidgeted or tried to sneak from the
tent.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, after Hindsman had moved to Atlanta to car
hop and bus tables, he saw that boy again, at the Yates-Milton Drug
Store. He was the magnetic center of a crowd of kids, as radiant
and self-assured as a prince. Hindsman felt privileged to hand him
a nickel for an ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last Hindsman would see of Martin Luther King Jr.
In 1940, King went to Morehouse College, a 15-year-old prodigy. In
1941, Hindsman went to Burma, a freshly drafted member of the
United States Army.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsman became a dispatcher with the 823rd Aviation Engineer
Battalion, a segregated unit that carved out a supply road to
China. Japanese troops clustered just across the Pataki mountains,
and their Zeros filled the sky like insects at twilight.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers dynamited a path over frigid peaks and bulldozed
through swamps overgrown with 10-foot tufts of elephant grass. Asia
in wartime could be a terrible place, yet what struck Hindsman most
was its beauty. The fierce colors of its gardens. The mad pageantry
of its festivals. The serenity of Mahatma Gandhi, who chatted with
the international soldiers one day as they pushed the road through
India.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsman longed for a camera to capture these images, but the
Army wouldn't let him have one. Security reasons, they said. But
the seed had taken root, and at war's end, when Hindsman returned
to Georgia, one of the first things he bought was a $1.25 Kodak
camera.
</P>
<P>
   He started slowly, taking shots of his new bride, Hazel, and of
their families. People liked his work, and soon, they invited him
to photograph weddings, reunions, church functions and conventions.
</P>
<P>
   While a new world cracked open before his lens, the old one
seemed as constrictive as ever. Hindsman had guided a huge fleet of
vehicles as an Army dispatcher, but in Georgia, the only work he
could find was tending crops and delivering groceries.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1947, when a buddy told him about high-paying
manufacturing jobs in Dayton, he made his decision in a heartbeat.
He and his wife were gone.
</P>
<P>
   His first job at Frigidaire didn't last long, but he quickly
found a secure position as a nurse's assistant at the Veterans
Administration Hospital. A few years later he bought a house, and
he and his wife took their places in the city's black middle class.
</P>
<P>
   But as they settled into Dayton life, their old homeland
convulsed. Civil rights organizations grew ever more restless with
segregation's status quo. White authorities cracked down ever
harder. Boycotts and sit-ins were met with bombings and assaults.
In the middle of everything was that luminous child Hindsman
remembered so well, now a world-famous man.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsman followed Martin Luther King Jr.'s exploits with relish,
scarcely believing anyone had the guts to buck the system he grew
up with. He pasted all the great events in a scrapbook: The
Montgomery bus boycott. The March on Washington. The Selma to
Montgomery March. The Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Had he not left the South, Hindsman figured he might have been
part of it all. But when he went to Selma in 1975 to hear his
pastor lecture, his tour of the history-soaked city convinced him
he could still participate.
</P>
<P>
   So four years later, he took a week's vacation from his nursing
job at the hospital, packed a camera into his Oldsmobile
Bonneville, and headed to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsman began in Atlanta, a city that had become into
cosmopolitan boomtown in his absence. Still, he remembered the
curves of its streets, and he didn't need to ask directions to get
where he was headed.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped by Auburn Avenue to photograph King's home, then
headed two blocks west to the Ebenezer Baptist Church where King
returned in 1960 to preach alongside his father. He shot the
buildings and grounds of Morehouse College, where King turned a
class assignment on David Thoreau's ``Civil Disobedience'' into a
strategy of nonviolent resistance.
</P>
<P>
   From there Hindsman took Interstate 85 to Montgomery, Ala., the
city where King first became a pastor, and where he first reached
national prominence by leading a boycott on the city's segregated
bus system.
</P>
<P>
   King preached at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, a small
building across the street from the state capital. The
juxtaposition that jolted Hindsman no less than it did King when he
took the job in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have come together without all this struggle,''
Hindsman would reflect years later. `` ... Yet we had to kill and
we had to march and we had to boycott and all these kind of things,
because the system says that it's separate but equal. And that was
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery led to Selma, where Hindsman revisited Brown Chapel
and Pettus Bridge. He took photos of Highway 80, the road on which
King and his partners overcame savage resistance to lead thousands
of demonstrators on a march to the state capital in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Selma gave way to Birmingham, the city that in 1963 boiled with
televised mayhem. This was the city of Bull Connor, the police
commissioner who didn't hesitate to unleash police dogs and
firehoses on peaceful protestors. Here, Hindsman photographed the
16th Street Baptist Church, where four little girls were killed in
an bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time for the final destination: the Lorraine Motel
in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   King had come to the city in 1968 to support striking garbage
workers. His mission of desegregation had evolved into a campaign
against poverty, and he arrived in Memphis aiming to help the
nearly all black sanitation union gain better wages and improve
working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, King addressed a throng at the city's Mason Temple.
He was tired and had not wanted to go, but his words were
nonetheless electric, sounding even then like a prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anybody, I would like to live a long life,'' he said at
one point. ``Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned with
that now. I just want to do God's will.
</P>
<P>
   ``And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked
over. And I've seen the promised land. And I may not get there with
you. But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to
the promised land.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, as King stood on the balcony of the pale green
Lorraine Motel, a sniper across the street shot him in the head. He
was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead at
7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsman was unemotional as he photographed the motel, which had
been preserved as a memorial. He had always accepted the hard
things in life. He knew he had no choice but to accept this too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what happened,'' he would say later. ``You know he's
not coming back. Life goes on. That's what you have to live by in
order to get some strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindsman created a slide show of his photos, calling it ``From
Montgomery to Memphis.'' He showed it at family gatherings and at a
Dayton fraternal hall, but that was it. He didn't think anyone else
would be interested in his pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The photos have since scattered among the thousands of others
Hindsman has taken over the years, but he plans to reorganize them
someday. He wants to leave this record to what he calls ``the
unborn generations.''
</P>
<P>
   But he rarely feels an urge to look at those 1979 photos. He
says the images from his journey shine brighter in his mind than
they do on paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always emphasize, `Keep the dream alive,''' he says.
``Now how do you keep the dream alive? You keep the dream alive by
remembering (King's) dedication to the civil rights movement.
Remember what he has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time I go now into the South - and the North - and I
sleep in a hotel or a motel, I always thank God for Dr. Martin
Luther King. Because it was he who had this vision.''

 &HT;    Perfect time for Jordan's exit
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``A devastating blow to an already-hurting NBA.'' That
was the unanimous verdict regarding Michael Jordan's retirement.
Me, I find unanimity boring. And in this case, I find it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This truncated NBA season was already shot. Resentment over the
lockout will fade eventually but not immediately. Great as he is,
Jordan couldn't have overridden the fallout by himself. He'd have
helped, sure. But then he'd have retired over the summer, and that
would have touched off another round of hand-wringing, would have
led to another shakedown season.
</P>
<P>
   Better it happened this way. Better to get all the bad news out
now. Better to treat the 50-game schedule and subsequent playoffs
as an extended rehearsal, not yet the real thing. And then, when
the new full season commences this fall, the Jordan understudies _
Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, Kobe Bryant _ will have had the
chance to learn their lines. And we'll have had the chance to
decompress post-MJ.
</P>
<P>
   Come autumn there will be a new defending champion, a new
glamour team, a new scoring champion, new rivalries beginning to
boil. The Bulls' reign was riveting to watch, but even the most
stimulating programming loses oomph over time. How many more times
could Jordan hit the winning shot? How many more times could we be
awed when he does? How much longer before we got sick of seeing the
same guys win?
</P>
<P>
   Now we'll see someone else. (Early-line favorite: The
long-suffering Indiana Pacers.) It will take some getting used to,
but there's time. The masses will watch this season out of the
corner of a collective eye, not sitting rapt in anticipation of the
latest Jordan wonder. Ratings will be way down. Fences will need
major mending. But this, remember, is the NBA. Unlike baseball, pro
basketball is a user-friendly product, and the NBA has proved it
can do the marketing dance like no other league.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of 15 years, Jordan was the central
component of that sales pitch. But the NBA revival was in flight
before Jordan left Chapel Hill. Earvin Johnson and Larry Bird
already were trading titles. Jordan took the league to a higher
plateau, but at some point the NBA was going to have to learn to
live without him. The guy couldn't play forever.
</P>
<P>
   As with almost everything else, Jordan got retiring right. He
leaves at the absolute pinnacle. He leaves having won a
championship with the final shot of his competitive life. He leaves
having left nothing undone. He leaves at a time when his leaving
will be one of two major stories, not the unchallenged focus. And
he leaves having removed the league's sky hook.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kareem Abdul-Jabbar invented the shot of the same name, a
sky hook was a magical contraption we mortals grabbed at for
balance. So long as Jordan played, the NBA would have kept reaching
for him. Now he's gone, and the league has to find something else,
something tangible. Maybe it never will. But at least this way it
gets to find out, sooner rather than later. And it gets to do it in
a season of lowered expectations. What's a little more turbulence
when you're already in flux?

 &HT;    Hawks could lose Henderson
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't be surprised if the Atlanta Hawks start the
season next month with a brand new power forward that is only a
short-term solution to their needs. The team appears close to
losing both of its free agents, Alan Henderson and Christian
Laettner.
</P>
<P>
   As agents and teams talk money and options, Henderson is getting
a sense of his worth that might far exceed what the Hawks are
willing to give him.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks general manager Pete Babcock won't say so, but Henderson
apparently believes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing things,'' Henderson said with a coy smile Friday
at Life University's gym.
</P>
<P>
   What Henderson hears is that there are a handful of teams with
some important money to spend and that he is at least an object of
their affections.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is eligible for a contract that could start as high as
$9million with annual raises of 10 to 12 percent, the low number if
he signs with any team but the Hawks. Voted the league's most
improved player, he averaged 14.3 points a game, 19 as a starter,
and 6.4 rebounds last season. That makes Henderson an attractive
athlete at age 26. The Pistons, among others, have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is one of the names they are mentioning in Detroit.
But they also are talking about Laettner, Cliff Robinson, Joe
Smith, Loy Vaught and Matt Geiger. What the Pistons want most is a
big man who can shoot, to open the lane for Grant Hill. That's not
necessarily Henderson, whose best game is in the paint, but his
passion for the game might make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Laettner continues to be linked with Detroit because he played
so successfully with Hill at Duke. However, it has been reported
reliably that Laettner is asking for $8million, which might kill
his chances. Laettner played so indifferently with the Hawks that
he lost his starting job, then he tore an Achilles tendon in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Lon Babby, who also represents Hill, said, ``Our doctors
say he could play as early as March and for sure by the playoffs.
Obviously, they can't guarantee anything, but Christian is ahead of
schedule, and that is what we are shooting for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks, however, aren't buying. Their medical information is
that Laettner can start working on the court in March, not that he
can play.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line on Laettner is that the Hawks would sign him to
trade him, thereby helping a team that has cap trouble, but that he
won't play here again.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Philadelphia is ready to offer the Hawks a
sign-and-trade deal for Henderson if his asking price is more than
Atlanta can swallow. However, the player offered is Derrick
Coleman, who weighs close to 300 pounds now.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock responds with the air of a man who has heard it all
before. ``When we get the numbers from the league and know what all
the values are, then we can make some decisions,'' he said. ``Right
now, all the talk is interesting, but for the most part it's only
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have made no secret of their desire to remain flexible
for next summer's round of free-agent signings. That's when Shareef
Abdur-Rahim, Allen Iverson and Stephon Marbury come on the market.
</P>
<P>
   With such veteran big men as Popeye Jones, John ``Hot Rod''
Williams, Cherokee Parks, LaPhonso Ellis, Will Perdue, Bill
Wennington and Antoine Carr available _ some at door-buster prices
_ the Hawks might take a step back, in hopes of taking a giant step
forward July 1.

 &HT;    Free agent rumor mill's in overdrive
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Somebody's lying. Maybe everybody's lying. It's a
time-honored sports tradition during a signing period, but the NBA
is over the limit here.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gugliotta is going to sign with Phoenix, Houston or
Minnesota, with maybe a sign-and-trade to the Lakers for Elden
Campbell. Why Elden Campbell? Who knows? Just remember that the
Wolves' Kevin McHale previously signed Stojko Vrankovic and gambled
on Stanley Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning. Today, we will take you through
the fact and fancy of cranking up an NBA season in February. All of
this is credible. Someplace.
</P>
<P>
   As teams, agents and players look closer at the new
collective-bargaining agreement, it's clear that several teams that
expected to be contenders for free agents this summer aren't going
to have anywhere near the salary-cap room they anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento, for instance, was hoping it might have nearly
$15million but will be closer to $3million unless the Kings
unexpectedly renounce rights to some of their own free agents,
including Corliss Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is compromised because it wants to retain a few of its
free agents, notably Rex Chapman, but the Suns could open
$15.6million under the cap. Denver has $13.5million available if it
renounces forward LaPhonso Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Houston has the inside track on Scottie Pippen. The
deal is estimated at four years, starting at $9.3million. Pippen's
agents are trying to get the Bulls to do a sign-and-trade so Pippen
can get the maximum, but Chicago GM Jerry Krause can't seem to pull
it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rockets have interest; Scottie has interest,'' agent
Jimmie Sexton confirms. ``It's more than (casual). It's something
that he's considering strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   And Charles Barkley doesn't want to leave the stage in Texas.
``I would love to play for the Rockets,'' Barkley said. ``If
they're handcuffed, we'll have to see how it works out. Money will
not matter. If I have to play at minimum, that's cool. I have
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley might leave Bulls
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls also are on the verge of losing center Luc Longley to
the Suns for six years, starting point at $3.5million. That would
allow the Suns to double dip and go after Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   Longley's agent, Jeff Austin, confirms there are talks going on,
but said he was unsure a deal will be struck, saying, ``Either
you're there or you're not. Right now, we're not there.''
</P>
<P>
   On a smaller scale, both Indiana and Milwaukee are after forward
Sam Perkins, who apparently is done in Seattle. The Bucks also like
Derek Harper. So does Indiana if ex-Georgia Tech point guard Travis
Best elects to go somewhere else for starter's money.
</P>
<P>
   The price of centers
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte has a problem with Glen Rice, who demands a
renegotiation with two years at $5.4million and $7.1million. But a
Rice signing would compromise the Hornets' chances of getting a
center. They already cringe at the idea of having to pay Vlade
Divac $105.875million over seven years or Matt Geiger as much as
$86.625million over seven. But if the Hornets want a center who can
take them back to the playoffs, those are the prices. Alternatives:
Ike Austin (ex-Clippers) or 76ers free agent Theo Ratliff, both
looking at $67.5million over six.
</P>
<P>
   Pistons clean house
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons are prepared to renounce Grant Long, Rick Mahorn,
Steve Henson and Malik Sealy and unload Eric Montross and Charlie
O'Bannon, if they can. Then, if they can sign Jerry Stackhouse and
Joe Dumars at $3.5million each, they could clear $8million and go
after a combination of power forward Christian Laettner or Loy
Vaught and $1million shooter Steve Kerr or Dennis Scott. But there
also is a report that Detroit has settled on Cliff Robinson to open
the inside for Grant Hill. ... Denver is one of four teams _ along
with the Suns, Rockets and Bulls _ who can make a play for Antonio
McDyess, whose talent is enormous but whose command of the game's
intricacies remain in question.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets also want Chauncey Billups, the ex-Colorado point
guard now under contract in Toronto. They are willing to send a
first-rounder and role player to get him. ... With Michael Jordan
gone and Pippen no longer welcome, the Bulls also got the cold
shoulder from McDyess. Now, they can turn their attention to free
agent Brent Barry, who is 6-foot-6 and can pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprewell bidding
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Knicks have joined the Heat and Pacers in talking
to the Warriors about Latrell Sprewell. The Spurs have dropped out
of the bidding for lack of ammunition, narrowing the field to
three.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what each is offering: the Knicks have put up Chris Mills
and Chris Childs, but John Starks could come into the picture if
the Warriors reject Childs; the Pacers are dangling Dale Davis,
Jalen Rose and Haywoode Workman to make the cap work; Miami is
offering Jamal Mashburn and Voshon Lenard, but the Warriors want
P.J. Brown instead of Mashburn, and that's a deal-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks have another problem, trying to re-sign free
agent point guard Charlie Ward, who opted out of his last contract.
Since Childs is starting the third year of a six-year deal
averaging $4million, figure that Ward will get more. Ward's wife,
Tonja, a lawyer with a sports-marketing business, has suggested
that he ask for a no-trade clause. That would put him in New York
for seven years. Asking price: $5million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's Best is another young free-agent guard who would
accept a nice raise to stay with his team. ``The rules don't allow
for a lot of movement,'' Best said.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando also likes Austin, but the Magic might bite on another
rumored deal with the Lakers that would re-unite Horace Grant with
Shaquille O'Neal and send Campbell to the Magic.

 &HT;    NFC gets high rating from Fox
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since Fox began televising the NFL in 1994, it has
grown accustomed to getting a ratings windfall from the NFC
Championship Game. The network also has grown accustomed to having
the Cowboys, 49ers or Packers playing.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, America also has grown accustomed to seeing one
of those three teams in the title game. The last time there was an
NFC championship that didn't include at least one of them was 1991,
when the Redskins trounced the Lions 41-10.
</P>
<P>
   That game drew a 29.5 Nielsen rating on CBS, just a shade below
Fox's 30.1 average for the past four years. So Fox is quite
confident viewers across the country will be drawn to Atlanta and
Minnesota in similar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no concerns about that,'' Fox executive producer Ed
Goren said. ``It goes back to the fact that our playoff ratings
this season are up 19 percent (with a 21.4 average), and we've had
three new teams, Atlanta, Minnesota and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Falcons never have been in the NFC title game, and
the Vikings are ending a 10-year drought, Fox was heartened by the
21.4 rating for last week's Cardinals-Vikings game, and the 18.2
for the Falcons and 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get the championship game, the public appreciates the
fact the two teams have earned the right to be there,'' said former
CBS Sports president Neal Pilson, who operates a television
consulting company. ``The public is not sensitive to market size
and who's playing. The key to the ratings will still be the quality
of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the quality of competition won't affect the bottom line for
the telecast. Fox has sold out the advertising for the game, which
is usually two to three times higher than regular-season rates and
can generate more than $20 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fox is coming off a championship telecast that drew the
first sub-30 rating in the network's brief NFL history. Last year's
NFC Championship Game between the Packers and 49ers got a 26.2, the
lowest number for the title game in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was still the second-highest-rated show in all of
television behind the Super Bowl, and we expect this game to beat
that number, even in the early window,'' Goren said. ``With all the
options viewers have today, cable, DirecTV, computers, big-event
sports still draw eyeballs to the sets like no other programming.
Major sports is the real must-see TV, because people want to see it
when it happens.

 &HT;    Elder Falcons play advise and consent role
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cornelius Bennett has counseled Chuck Smith on
everything from the mushrooming media horde to the value of
postseason travel agents. Tony Martin has conveyed the wonder, and
urgency, of playoff football to such January innocents as O.J.
Santiago, Henri Crockett and Elijah Williams. And the other day in
practice, Eugene Robinson imparted a most practical lesson to Tim
Dwight.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bennett and Martin, Robinson tried to explain about playing
in an NFL conference championship game _ and for a shot at the
Super Bowl. It is something that younger Falcons players have been
asking all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on the football field, that's when you (often) get
that type of question,'' said Robinson, the 14th-year free safety
who played in the past two Super Bowls with the Green Bay Packers.
``When I come over the top and say, `Hey! You've got to be over
here!' And Tim Dwight says, `Hey, Gene, I need you to slow down,
man. You're too hyped up.' I said, `Tim, the reason why I am
(hyper) and running all over the place is because that's what
you've got to do at this juncture. So if I have to push you out of
bounds or I have to get my hands in your face and you don't like
it, I'm sorry. Cause I'm going to make sure I'm doing my thing. So
you get on the same boat.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm that you run across the field (with), it
conveys to the other guy that this is an important deal: `I'm 35
years old. I shouldn't be outrunning you. So you'd better get in
gear. Let's get ready to go and play a huge game.'''
</P>
<P>
   The survivor of today's Falcons-Vikings NFC title game goes to
Super Bowl XXXIII on Jan. 31 in Miami. Only four Falcons _Robinson,
Bennett (a four-time loser with Buffalo), Martin and backup
cornerback Randy Fuller _ have Super Bowl experience. Just two
others _ defensive backs Ray Buchanan and William White _ played in
conference championship games. Since the Falcons clinched the NFC
West title on Dec. 20, those six players have tried to explain the
aura and seriousness of such games and detail the necessary
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Bennett told some players after last Saturday's playoff
victory against San Francisco: ``You have to realize we're playing
for the greatest trophy in all of sports, the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, this game has more media representatives. And
additional security guards at the stadium. More TV commercials
interrupting play. Travel on Friday instead of Saturday. And a
Friday news conference for some players. As for game tickets, plane
flights and hotel rooms, Bennett advised, ``Just get your
significant other there. Trying to get people in town, get hotel
rooms and tickets, that's not something we need to worry about. Let
the travel agent worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different game when you get to this level,'' said
Martin, whose only catch in the 1994 AFC title game was a 43-yard
touchdown reception that gave San Diego a 17-13 victory in
Pittsburgh. ``It requires a high-level intensity.'' To younger
teammates who have wondered what it's like playing for, then in,
the Super Bowl, Martin used such words as ``wonderful,''
``indescribable'' and ``the ultimate high.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell 'em, `It's amazing,''' he said. ``Once you get to this
level, it's amazing to keep winning and winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson advised how loud the Metrodome will be. How emotion is
crucial, but, ``you've got to remain (fundamentally) sound.'' And
most of all, how the time is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to go out there and seize the moment,'' Robinson
said. ``If you don't seize the moment, man, it's going to pass you
by, and you'll be watching someone else play.''

 &HT;    Andersen's Super goal: Kick up heels at dance
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He can hyperbolize with the rest of 'em. ``The Big
Dance,'' ``the Ultimate Dance,'' ``a Wonderful Show,'' Morten
Andersen called the Super Bowl, all in a single conversation. In a
17-year football career, he's attended eight Super Bowls, seven
while working as an analyst for Danish television on TV 3 ScanSat.
In Minneapolis today, Andersen will be one victory away from
finally putting his best foot forward on sport's grandest stage.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Big Ultimate Not-So-Wonderful irony of it all.
</P>
<P>
   The one year that Morten Andersen _ the Ernie Banks of kickers,
the best kicker to never sideswipe in a Super Bowl _ has a chance
to reach the Roman-numeral affair and erase the lone blemish on his
resume, the game won't be televised in his native Denmark, land of
the midnight kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The viewership last year was too poor to warrant showing it,''
Andersen said. ``So unless you have satellite TV and you want to
watch the Danish guy kick the football, you're out of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Danes always could go to Norway to catch the Super Bowl. Or, as
Andersen discussed with his father, Erik, back in his hometown of
Struer, ``You'd need a (TV) de-coder to watch it.'' Otherwise, if
the Falcons upset the Vikings in the NFC Championship Game, the
Danes couldn't watch the Danish guy kick at night on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me as kind of odd,'' Andersen said. ``All these
years we've shown it with me as a commentator, and now I may get to
play in it and...''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not being televised in Copenhagen, pre-empted by _
what? A Fran Tarkenton infomercial? The Sunday midnight movie, ``On
Frozen Fjord''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me kind of weird,'' Andersen said. ``Ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the Danes could do something, to find a way to show
XXXIII on TV 3 if it includes Andersen. He is, after all, a
national hero in Denmark and one of the greatest kickers in NFL
history, the holder of seven NFL records who has converted 25
game-winning field goals in his career. He is to long-range kicking
what Michael Jordan was to mid-air majesty. The best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting, an exciting time for me personally because I've
never been this far,'' Andersen said.
</P>
<P>
   Until last Saturday's victory against San Francisco, Andersen
had played in five NFL playoff games, losing all five: Four with
New Orleans, where he played from 1982-94, and a 1995 wild-card
defeat in Green Bay with the Falcons. After kicking two field goals
and two extra points in the 20-18 victory against the 49ers,
Andersen finds himself a game away from a Super Bowl blackout back
home in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to describe what it means to me personally is hard to
describe,'' said Andersen, the NFL's No. 3 career scorer with 1,761
points _ 71 points behind Vikings kicker Gary Anderson (``More of a
finesse kicker, a very pure ball; and I'm more of a power
kicker''). ``But it's more important to this team and this city.
Win Sunday, and you get to the ultimate dance.''
</P>
<P>
   If that would leave 'em re-programming in the studios of
Copenhagen, it would also greatly satisfy Andersen, 38. ``It just
means if you stick around long enough, you'll get a chance to be
here,'' he said, smiling. ``It's something that's been missing in
my career. I've never gotten to the big dance. We're one step
away.''
</P>
<P>
   A Super Bowl. ``As time goes on, who knows if it's ever going to
happen?'' Andersen recalls thinking. ``But it won't be, `If I don't
go, if I don't make it, I'll be devastated.' I'll be disappointed,
but I won't lose sleep. But there's no doubt I want to play in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen will have a life after football, whether he ever plays
in a Super Bowl. Asked what it would mean to finally kick in a Big
Ultimate Wonderful Dance, he replied, ``It would mean closure in
some way, I guess. I don't mean I would retire. (But) I would feel
I couldn't say I wasn't afforded that opportunity. And how you
handled that opportunity is what defines you as a person and a
player.''

 &HT;    Bourbon Street bound
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The record-setting goaltending of John Vanbiesbrouck
is getting most of the credit for making the Philadelphia Flyers
into the hottest team in the NHL. But maybe the players are just
trying to pay back coach Roger Neilson. The Flyers, like many NHL
teams, will take a warm-weather retreat to get some R&AMP;R. But the
destination isn't the usual Florida or Arizona. A four-player
committee of Rod Brind'Amour, Eric Desjardins, John LeClair and
Eric Lindros selected New Orleans as the team's destination for a
four-day break in March. Surprisingly, Neilson agreed. ``I was a
little worried about the drinking, but they assured me there would
be drinking everywhere we went,'' he said. Bourbon Street and all
its lures will be waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada Centre, Toronto's new home replacing Maple Leaf
Gardens, will open on Feb. 20. Among the special features in the
new arena is an exhaust system in the coaches' quarters designed to
filter out cigar smoke. That would be because coach Pat Quinn, a
former Atlanta Flames defenseman, is a legendary cigar smoker. The
last game at Maple Leaf Gardens is Feb. 13, against the Chicago
Blackhawks. The team already is practicing at Air Canada Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Speed kills
</P>
<P>
   The way the young Ottawa Senators are playing now, they might
turn into the surprise team of the playoffs. What makes Ottawa a
threat is its speed. ``We have a lot of young, fast guys on this
team, and that's what the NHL is about these days,'' defenseman
Jason York said. ``Speed kills. Teams with speed are the teams that
are winning.'' New Jersey forward Brian Rolston said, ``If you turn
the puck over they can turn it up ice pretty quick. There is no
question they have speed. They have a lot of speed, but they are
disciplined as well. If they don't have an opportunity to
forecheck, they stay back and clog up the neutral zone. They're
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   New York Rangers center Wayne Gretzky, who has never missed an
NHL All-Star Game, trails only Gordie Howe's record 23 appearances.
Selected as a reserve on the North America squad, Gretzky will play
in his 18th All-Star Game at Tampa on Jan. 24. ...Washington
defenseman Sergie Gonchar was penalized two minutes for using an
illegal stick in a game in which he already had scored two goals.
``It's just a long curve,'' Gonchar said.... Maple Leafs president
Ken Dryden says goaltender Curtis Joseph allows his team to play a
go-go offensive style: ``Our thought is, if you have a good goalie,
why do all this work to only let him face 20 shots a game? If you
have a good goalie, you have to trust him.'' ...Rangers forward
Todd Harvey is expected to be sidelined 4-6 weeks with a sprained
left knee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Things could get interesting Monday when the San Jose
Sharks host New Jersey. Devils defenseman Scott Stevens could be a
target after some trash talk the last time the teams met. He is
accused of calling Sharks right wing Brantt Myhres ``a drunk'' and
saying he should ``have another beer.'' Myhres, a former Atlanta
Knight, spent the start of this season in alcohol rehabilitation,
his second time in treatment. ``He's a kid trying to get his career
together,'' Sharks right wing Owen Nolan said about Myhres, 24.
``What was said is unacceptable. If they're going to suspend people
for (making racial comments), this is just as bad.'' Stevens
wouldn't confirm or deny the remarks, saying, ``Sometimes you say
things you regret.'' Stevens' longtime teammate Ken Daneyko spent
time in a rehab center last season.
</P>
<P>
   Looking glass
</P>
<P>
   The new Staples Center in Los Angeles, which opens next season,
will not have the seamless glass above the boards that has been
blamed by players for injuries because it's rigid and doesn't give
when heads and bodies hit it. ``The seamless glass is nice to look
through and gives nice, true bounces, but we were worried about
concussions,'' said Kings general manager Dave Taylor, whose career
was ended because of a head injury. The Atlanta Thrashers have not
made a decision on what type of glass will be installed in their
new arena.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Vancouver general manager Brian Burke might have infuriated
Canucks fans with his attempts to trade Pavel Bure, but he made one
fan for his response to a testy e-mail. Travis Lindgren, an
educator in Napean, Ontario, said he just wanted to get a few
things off his chest. But Burke responded, and included his private
phone number. Lindgren called, and the two spoke for 15 minutes.
``I was pretty impressed,'' Lindgren said. Burke said he was glad
to restore the faith of at lease one fan. ``I take that very
seriously,'' Burke said. ``From my perspective, it's really
important, especially in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit will have the most players (five) in the All-Star Game
at Tampa on Jan. 24. Left wing Brendan Shanahan and center Steve
Yzerman will start for the North American team, defensemen Nicklas
Lidstrom and Uwe Krupp for the World squad. Defensman Larry Murphy
was selected as a North America reserve.... Despite the best record
in the league, Dallas has only three players in the game, all
reserves.... Kingscenter Ray Ferraro had surgery to repair torn
cartilage in his right knee. He may be sidelined 4-6 weeks.

 &HT;    Small-game workshop set
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde and Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fostering respect for the environment is one of the
chief goals of an upcoming small-game hunting workshop sponsored by
the Wildlife Resources Division of the state Department of Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   The Introduction to Small Game Hunting for Youth program, 10
a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday at the Charlie Elliott Wildlife Center in
Mansfield, will provide hands-on instruction and activities for
children ages 10-12. Wildlife Resources associates and volunteers
will provide the instruction for the free workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting kids involved in outdoor sports such as hunting at a
young age teaches them respect for the environment, wildlife and
other natural resources,'' WRD director David Waller said.
``Workshops like this offer youth a chance to learn new outdoor
skills in a fun, non-threatening and safe environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids first will be taught how to identify the main small
game species found in Georgia. Then the group will be introduced to
appropriate beginner firearms, firearms safety and Georgia's
hunting rules and regulations. Squirrel- and rabbit-hunting
techniques will be taught using dogs trained for hunting those
small game species on the Clybel Wildlife Management Area.
Participants also will have the opportunity to practice shooting
.22 rifles under the direct supervision of WRD associates.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife Resources will provide all firearms, for safety
reasons, but each participant must bring a fluorescent orange
hunter-safety vest. Preregistration is required, and registration
is limited to the first 25 applicants. An adult at least 21 must
accompany the youth for the entire length of the program.

<P>
   Here come the pros
</P>
<P>
   It seems appropriate that BASS Fishing Techniques '99, the
bass-fishing seminars sponsored by the Bass Anglers Sportsman
Society, is part of Kennesaw State University's Continuing
Education Program. Learning to catch America's favorite gamefish is
an ongoing process for anglers of all skill levels.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day course, Saturday and Sunday at the Wyndham Garden
Hotel in Marietta, covers most techniques from lure presentation to
bass behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The class is taught by six top tournament professionals,
including two-time BASS Angler of the Year and BASS Masters Classic
champion Larry Nixon. The Bee Branch, Ark., pro has competed in 16
Classics.
</P>
<P>
   Other pros expected are Jack Hains, Alton Jones, Rich Tauber,
Greg Hines and Gerald Swindle.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are from 7 a.m.-3:30 p.m. Saturday and 8 a.m.-3:30 p.m.
Sunday. Cost is $89, $44.50 for a spouse or a child 16 or under.
The class is part of a nationwide program that began in 1974.

<P>
   For more information on the Kennesaw State course, call
770-423-6765.
</P>
<P>
   And the winner is
</P>
<P>
   The trout fishing and wild-turkey hunting in the Chattahoochee
National Forest and paddling down Talking Rock Creek are three
reasons why Ellijay is Georgia's best outdoors sports towns,
according to the February issue of Sports Afield magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The publication's ``50 Best Towns'' feature, which lists the
best in each state, says the north Georgia city of 1,700 located in
the southern foothills of the Appalachians also offers rugged
mountain-biking terrain.

 &HT;    Reeves seeing another side
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dan Reeves has made his living in football since 1965,
when he poured his soul into making the Dallas Cowboys' roster as
an undrafted quarterback who was moved to running back.
</P>
<P>
   After his playing days, he kept chasing his dream, becoming an
assistant in Dallas, then head coach of the Denver Broncos in 1981
and head coach of the New York Giants in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Football took him across the nation, but his heart stayed in his
native Georgia, where he grew up on a farm in Americus.
</P>
<P>
   After the Giants fired him in 1996 and the Atlanta Falcons
offered their job, it was automatic that Reeves would return to
Georgia. But only after he underwent quadruple heart-bypass surgery
on Dec. 14, and Atlanta fans exhibited their love for the coach,
did he and his family truly grasp the meaning of what it meant to
be back home.
</P>
<P>
   It has been magical watching the Falcons set all kinds of
records while going 15-2 and advancing to today's NFC Championship
Game for the first time in the team's mostly dreadful 33-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming an icon, and, more important, getting a chance to
extend his life, has been Reeves' ultimate _ yet trying _
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very much hurt, disappointed, with an aching in my heart
when they said `bypass,''' said Pam, his wife and high school
sweetheart of more than 34 years. ``The last two years in New York
(1995-96) were very hard ... to where it was hard for Dan to go to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gotten through that, we had gotten to Georgia, and you
could see the changes taking place,'' Pam Reeves said. ``My first
thought was, `No, we're on the brink of something here. It's not
fair that he won't be able to finish it out, to enjoy it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, 54, will enjoy today's game against the Minnesota
Vikings (16-1) on the sideline at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   His energy level in increasing daily, his color is better, and
he's not getting winded during interviews. All that will continue
to change.
</P>
<P>
   Some things won't.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of heart surgeon James Kauten holding Reeves'
non-beating heart in his hand roughly a month ago ``still blows me
away,'' Reeves said, and it always will.
</P>
<P>
   And there may be no way to surprise him as much as he's been
surprised by the reaction caused by his condition.
</P>
<P>
   Home, sweet home.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are the envy of the NFL and the talk of the town.
Signs all over the city, callers to radio shows and letters to the
editor profess fans' faith in their team and its coach.
</P>
<P>
   The city has fallen in love with Reeves, and he's shocked more
by that than the miracle last month of having his heart stopped for
three hours during bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been overwhelming how many cards and letters and so forth
have come in. You think about yourself getting sick, but you don't
think about that many people responding to it,'' said Reeves, who
has received 1,500 to 2,000 letters and cards. ``It's amazing when
we're out ... how everybody sees you and wishes you well, and tells
you they're praying for you and they hope the team does well. They
seem to recognize you a lot more than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' son Lee, 31, a lawyer in Atlanta, said, ``There have
been so many blessings this year. It has been a great year for the
city of Atlanta, the Falcons and the Reeves. We're thankful. You'd
be amazed at how people have rallied around the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reeves family _ which includes wife Pam, daughters Dana and
Laura, two sons-in-law, a daughter-in-law, granddaughters Caitlin,
Ashley and Morgan, and Reeves' 82-year-old mother, Ann _ has always
been close by any description. It's closer now.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves got choked up several times at his Dec. 18 news
conference when he was first released from the hospital. Earlier
this week, he again had to pause a couple times, thinking back to
Dec. 14, when his family _ minus his mother, who remained in
Americus _ was at the hospital. His older brother, Charles, was
there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tense time,'' Reeves said, pausing for about 20
seconds. ``My brother ... led us in a word of prayer. That was the
most touching thing. I don't know how he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Reeves, 62, lives in Dunwoody, where he just retired
from a job as president of a crushed-stone company.
</P>
<P>
   They grew up eight years apart, but the two have always had a
special relationship. It grew stronger after Charles graduated from
Georgia Tech, where he was a manager for Bobby Dodd's football
teams, and returned to Americus.
</P>
<P>
   While working, he followed his brother's athletic career, even
driving the bus for road games when Dan played basketball. Miles
separated them during the years, at least until Reeves moved to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, they couldn't have been closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember whose idea (the prayer) was,'' Charles Reeves
said. ``It could have been any one of us. It wasn't the first
(prayer). You don't wait until this crisis to start praying for the
well-being of your family.''
</P>
<P>
   The past month has left other impressions on Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   He went back in the hospital on Dec. 20, when his heart rate
started fluctuating at home, just a couple of hours before he was
going to watch the Falcons play the Lions on television, a game
Atlanta won 24-17 to clinch the NFC West title.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the scariest time for my family because
nobody knew what was going on,'' said Reeves, who was released from
the hospital a second time on Christmas Eve. ``Through it all, Pam
has been the one who has taken the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' brother said the prayer that day, but Reeves' wife has
been the family's pillar, leaving him both in awe and completely
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Doctors) won't let you do anything, lift anything,'' said
Reeves, who still is limited to 30 pounds. ``You go through
Christmas, and everything is taken down. She's doing that, and I'm
trying to help, but I can't, and I feel worthless. She was doing
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves packed a few Christmas tree ornaments away, but Pam
handled most of the work. That's not all she handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the one thing that has slapped Dad in the face is how
strong my mom is,'' Lee said. ``She has been the beacon. He might
have expected it to be a male in the family, maybe me or him. I
crumbled in my mom's arms, my dad's arms. She has been so strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Reeves said she just did what she had to. ``Nurturing is
maybe a little bit more of a female characteristic,'' she said.
``If they perceive me as coming through as strong, I would say,
thank you very much. But I don't know if I felt strong. We had no
time to think about it; it was just upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have shown their concern for Reeves. NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue called, and Reeves has spoken with Tom Landry, under
whom he played and coached with the Dallas Cowboys (1965-80).
</P>
<P>
   He also has heard from actor Burt Reynolds, New York Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner and comedian Bill Cosby, whom he first
met in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill sent me a card that said something like, `I've got 12
pounds of bacon and deep-fried hamhocks when you're ready, but get
well first,''' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Reeves always thought her husband should have shown his
Cosby side. ``People have always thought of Dan as stern or stoic,
but in our family people always thought of him as Bill Cosby,'' she
said. ``I've always said, `Dan, just please try to be at your press
conferences like you are when you go golfing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves earlier this season joked that former Cowboys teammate
Walt Garrison was his friend until Reeves became a player-coach and
had to supervise Garrison with the Cowboys. The other day, Garrison
sent Reeves a talking and singing frog.
</P>
<P>
   ```Frog' was a nickname he gave me years ago,'' Reeves said,
referring to a moniker he got for his low, rumbling voice.
</P>
<P>
   Another high point came during halftime of the final
regular-season game Dec. 27 against Miami. Reeves spoke to the team
before the game at the Georgia Dome and then watched on television
at home. At halftime, 14 get-well cards, each 4 feet by 8 feet,
were paraded on the field with signatures from thousands of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got that on video,'' he said proudly. ``It was
overwhelming. Who thought of that? It's just amazing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   After he won the Associated Press Coach of the Year award a
couple of weeks ago, Reeves joked that the ``sympathy vote'' was
part of the reason. But there's no joking about the fact his
perspective on life has been reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've always had a good understanding of how fragile
life is,'' he said. ``Any of us who've had a death in the family
understand it's very short and it goes by very quickly _ that
everything is very precious.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Reeves said ``people's perception of Dan has changed. Maybe
they saw him at the news conference tear up. Those are the same
people who see him ... on the sidelines ... when he's exploding at
officials. People's perception of Dan is that he's mellowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves dismissed the rumor that he will step down as coach after
the season, work only in the Falcons' front office and appoint a
successor, perhaps defensive coordinator Rich Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a question about that,'' he said. ``Unless
something happens that I can't foresee, I should be better able to
(coach) better than I was able to this past year. I'll have more
energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I want to coach 10 more years, but as long as I
feel good, enjoy what I'm doing, and I'm good at it, I plan to keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   His son sees a new kind of energy in his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk a couple times a day, and, if anything, he may be a
little more mellow in that he appreciates life that much more,''
Lee said. ``Praying in the hospital was nothing new. Dad was best
man at my wedding (last fall), and he prayed for me to give me a
stillness before I went out in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible, scary situation last month, but it unified
us even more as a family. Dad has seen God's blessing on his life
in more ways than he did a few weeks ago, and we all have, too.''

 &HT;    The many signs of Martin Luther King Jr.
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His name is on street signs just about everywhere in
Georgia _ everywhere except the white part of town.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 cities and towns all across the state have named
streets for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a tribute to his
message of equality and unity that will be celebrated with Monday's
national holiday in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   However, the geographical reality of King's asphalt legacy is
more about boundaries than about bridges.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, with only minor exceptions, King's namesake streets
are fully contained in black neighborhoods. Some of those streets
are busy and thriving urban thoroughfares; others are little more
than country lanes; and several are home to vacant lots and public
housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   None of the numerous state academic and economic experts
consulted could name a city where the Martin Luther King namesake
street runs outside a black neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, the first black person
to hold that office, said the number of King namesake streets is
more important than their location.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who has traveled Georgia extensively, said he couldn't
recall a city that has a Martin Luther King Street in a
predominantly white neighborhood; nevertheless, he said the
proliferation of streets named for King is a ``tremendous honor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been concerned over which streets cities have
chosen to name after Dr. King,'' he said. ``The key point is that
so many cities, in Georgia and around the nation, have chosen to
recognize Dr. King and his achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   But some who live and work on the Martin Luther King streets ,
boulevards and avenues around Georgia express concern that the
streets typically don't run outside their communities _ although
most of those interviewed seemed glad that they can see King's name
on virtually every corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a remembrance of what he stood for,'' said Faison Elijah
as he walked down Albany's Martin Luther King Drive. ``That man
gave his life for his dreams, and that street keeps the dream
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be celebrations and memorials on many of Georgia's
Martin Luther King roadways this week. Here is a sampling of what
those streets are like and what's on the minds of some of the
people there:
</P>
<P>
   WAYCROSS
</P>
<P>
   This city's Martin Luther King Drive would be a pleasant place
to live in any part of town. The homes are neat and well-kept.
There are palm trees and children's bikes in the yards. But there
also is disquiet in Neyea Harris' voice as she talks about street
names and racial understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only find Martin Luther King streets in African-American
communities,'' she said. ``I feel like all people should remember
him. He helped all the people. But here, it's still segregated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waycross MLK has something many other King streets in
Georgia do not have: a monument to the slain civil rights leader.
It is a polished granite marker partially surrounded by a low brick
wall, located adjacent to a city housing project and a few yards
from a maintenance garage.
</P>
<P>
   Unilla Mitchell, who lives a few houses away from the marker,
thinks the setting detracts from the desired effect of the
monument. A large dumpster for the housing project sits close by,
and the area is often clogged with garbage trucks and maintenance
vehicles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the way it's so jammed-up looking,'' Mitchell
said. ``No offense, but I just think it should be displayed
better.''
</P>
<P>
   ALBANY
</P>
<P>
   Here, there's a street named Martin Luther King Drive and a
parallel road, Jefferson Street, that some residents would like to
re-name Martin Luther King Drive. The former street begins and ends
within the black community; the latter runs the length of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The street-name debate has been a political hot potato for
years. The majority of the City Council has switched back and forth
from black to white in recent elections, and the issue of renaming
Jefferson Street for King has flared up in most of the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Ewings Sr., who directs the Martin Luther King
Outreach Mission in south Albany, said those who oppose the
renaming of Jefferson Street cite problems such as the costs to
businesses that would have to change their mailing addresses. They
typically sidestep the racial implications, he added, but most
people know they exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Martin Luther King Drive runs out of the black community,
then it gets to be a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ewings thinks the prospects are good for improvement in
race relations in Albany. ``Things are going to change,'' he said,
``and we'll be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewings acquired his patience the hard way. His mission was in
the sector of Albany most devastated by the floods of 1994. After
years of waiting for recovery programs to be implemented, he gained
approval last February for an expansion of his center.
</P>
<P>
   Then new floods hit last March, and the paperwork mountain had
to be climbed again.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks from the mission is the recently opened Albany
Civil Rights Movement Museum, and here one can find indications of
progress in the causes that King lived and died for. Museum
director Angela Whitmal said blacks and whites alike turned out for
the museum's 1998 dedication ceremonies; and the local paper, which
opposed many of the actions of civil rights activists in Albany in
the 1960s, gave the museum front-page coverage for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes will be the featured speaker at Albany's Martin
Luther King Day celebration this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably not going to change the world, but all these
things taken together are significant for Albany,'' Whitmal said.
</P>
<P>
   FORT VALLEY
</P>
<P>
   From the railroad tracks south of downtown to the city limits,
Martin Luther King Drive is a renamed highway running through a
decidedly non-bustling industrial and commercial district.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing much going on here; over in Warner Robins,
they got new stuff going up all the time,'' said Frank McCrary, who
owns a grocery on the strip. ``It holds the small man down.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrary said his market does pretty well in the summer, when
there's plenty of fresh vegetables to sell. In winter, the traffic
is pretty much limited to folks buying turnips and processed
collard greens.
</P>
<P>
   Several other businesses along the section of Ga. 341 renamed
for King have folded in recent years, McCrary said.
</P>
<P>
   A Martin Luther King Day parade will pass McCrary's stand. There
could have been more of a crowd if the local Bluebird bus plant had
given its workers a day off for the holiday, McCrary said.
</P>
<P>
   DARIEN
</P>
<P>
   There are two majestic live oaks at one end of Martin Luther
King Jr. Boulevard. Otherwise, the median of this four-block-long
street is pretty much barren. It runs through a residential
neighborhood that has modest homes, trailers and some vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could use a little sprucing up,'' Jerry Bradley said as he
paused during a bicycle trip down the boulevard. But then, he
added, the same could be said about a lot of things in this quiet
coastal county seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of changes could be made in this little town,'' Bradley
said. ``It's slow, and so many things need to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   One change that has been made is in the McIntosh County
sheriff's office. During the 1950s and '60s, the office was held by
a man whose patronizing and domineering attitudes towards blacks
were a main topic of the award-winning book ``Praying For
Sheetrock.'' Now, the sheriff is a black man, Charles ``Chunk''
Jones, a Vietnam veteran and a former shrimpboat captain.
</P>
<P>
   SAVANNAH
</P>
<P>
   The King name has added a little bustle to old West Broad
Street.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, West Broad was the commercial artery of
Savannah's black community. Since its name was changed to Martin
Luther King Boulevard, and a freeway exit ramp added, traffic is up
and business is great at Gene Stevens' Rib Castle restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everybody knows where Martin Luther King ... is,'' Stevens
said. ``It's like this is the main drag.''
</P>
<P>
   A sizeable segment of Savannah's tourist trade cruises across
town on MLK, and regular customers, from soldiers to plant workers,
find their way to the small, concrete-block building that sends up
the sweet smoke of a barbecue fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sell out every day,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks down MLK Boulevard, Alberta Passmore sits on her
stoop, enjoying a cool January evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right here it's a nice neighborhood, but over there in the
projects, it was kind of rough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the housing project on the opposite side of the street from
her apartment is being remodeled, so no one lives there and she
feels better about sitting outside.
</P>
<P>
   Passmore said she's puzzled that most of the streets named for
King are found only in the black community. ``He wasn't nobody to
be afraid of,'' she said. ``Looks like to me, he was trying to help
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   WAYNESBORO
</P>
<P>
   A passerby stops in City Hall to ask directions to Martin Luther
King Drive. A white woman in the office shrugs; a black woman at
the next desk knows right where it is.
</P>
<P>
   The street spans a placid 10 blocks or so. A cemetery takes up
the land on one side for about half the length of the street. There
are two businesses, about six blocks apart.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ebony House of Styles, Clarence Johnson said he's
delighted to work on a street named for King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an honor,'' he said, ``something really special
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Emma Adams and her husband George operate a coin laundry with a
candy counter. They moved back to her hometown of Waynesboro after
living in New York for about 30 years. Emma said she's glad to be
home _ although things have changed. Drug trafficking in and around
the housing projects up the street have brought fear and crime, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here, but I didn't recognize the neighborhood when I
got back,'' she said. ``Now, you don't open the door without a
shotgun nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   The street may be named for King, but Adams isn't sure his story
is being told so much nowadays. ``Parents are not really teaching
their children what the man stood for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, life along the street is mostly good, she said. There are
plans for a local black history museum in the one-room schoolhouse
where she went to school up the street.
</P>
<P>
   And Adams and her husband get a chance to follow the growth and
struggles of the children who stop into her store for candy. She
relishes the triumphs of the ones who go on to good schools and
good jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some great things are happening on Martin Luther King Drive,''
Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Across Georgia, the streets named for King intersect other
streets with evocative names: Peace, Hope, Cotton, Victory. But
you'll have to look hard to find places where King's vision of
black children playing harmoniously with white children is realized
on Martin Luther King Street.
</P>
<P>
   But for many, it's more important that King's name is
perpetuated, no matter where the street runs.

   On the corner of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Victory Drive,
in Savannah, an elderly man named Thomas Brown summed up those
feelings succinctly.

 &HT;    Dogs and cats living the dream as America's pets
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ 59 million dogs.
</P>
<P>
   71.8 million cats.
</P>
<P>
   The American Pet Association keeps tabs on such awe-inspiring
numbers (figures as of December 1994) while promoting responsible
pet ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs have come a long way from the days when they hunted for a
living. And cats _ first domesticated in Egypt _ went through that
nasty period of being feared and associated with witches.
</P>
<P>
   In my next life I am coming back as one of my dogs, who lead
more pampered lives than either my husband or my children and
certainly ones more carefree than mine. Think about it. Food,
medical care, clothing and shelter are provided for pets with a
minimum of demands. My dogs never drove a carpool, cooked a turkey
dinner for 16 guests or waxed a floor.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom does my mail not include a question (or six) on the
foibles of the Fidos and Garfields of Central Texas. To what
lengths do pet owners go to ensure the life, liberty and pursuit of
furry-friend happiness? Take a peek at what the Greig Files contain
on pets.
</P>
<P>
   _ What's that, Lassie? What did you say, girl? Timmy is stuck at
the bottom of a gorge and forgot to mail your insurance premium?
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a long line of commercial pet ventures is pet
medical insurance. The oldest pet insurance outfit is Veterinary
Pet Insurance, covering dogs and cats beginning at eight weeks _
with no age cap. More than 850,000 policies have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage includes vaccination, routine care, cancer, heart
conditions and accidents. The best part? VPI says the average
turnaround time for a claim is one week and coverage starts at $89
a year. (Think the company would want to take on humans?)
</P>
<P>
   _ Does your ``best friend'' need a little help these days
getting around on all fours?
</P>
<P>
   Custom Pet Wheels of Austin makes devices to help pets when they
can no longer use one of their limbs. All sizes, all prices.
</P>
<P>
   For an order form, call 837-7509 or fax 835-6479.
</P>
<P>
   _Could you pass the catnip, Lefty?
</P>
<P>
   Most cat lovers are surprised to learn that many cats are either
right-pawed or left-pawed. The feline encyclopedia ``Cat World,''
by Desmond Morris, says after careful tests (no idea what the tests
were) it was revealed that out of every 100 cats, about 40 percent
are left-pawed, 20 percent are right-pawed and 40 percent are
ambi-pawed. A sharp contrast to humans, where left-hand preference
is the exception.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to the American Pet Association, 41 percent of
American pet owners display a picture of their pets in their homes
and 17 percent have a photo in their wallet or purse.
</P>
<P>
   _ Does this jacket make my flanks look big, Morris?
</P>
<P>
   A one-stop shopping collection of fashions for pets is Posh Pups
of California, where biker outfits, cowboy hats and jackets in
pinto pony patterns are de rigueur.
</P>
<P>
   And if you feel the need to have your pet go to the altar, it
also stock-- bridal outfits and tuxedos. Call (800) 347-0567 to
order. The small sizes for dogs are perfect for felines.
</P>
<P>
   Another catalog is In the Company of Dogs at (800) 924-5050.
Leather jackets and cocktail attire are just a couple of the items.
Pet Quarters at (888) PET-NETT stocks jackets _ denim, biker,
bomber._To shave or not to shave?
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarian John Treadwell has many clients who elect to shave
their chows and even a few Labs (once in the spring and again in
August). When in doubt, ask your vet.
</P>
<P>
   Carol-Lynne Meissner of Mobile Veterinary Clinic says it is
appropriate to shave chows and other furry breeds such as Norwegian
elkhounds, leaving about one-fourth to one-half inch of fur for
protection. Chows are susceptible to skin problems and need to be
shielded from the sun. Slather your favorite sun block on Fido's
pink skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Book of Dogs'' notes ``chow'' is Cantonese for ``food.''_ Want
spaghetti with that garlic?
</P>
<P>
   Some pet owners report success in keeping pets flea-free with
the regular addition of garlic and brewer's yeast to a pet's diet.
Prepared, pre-mixed flakes are available at area pet stores or you
can make your own.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe for a 25-pound dog begins with a half clove of garlic
minced with a 1/2 teaspoon of yeast per day. Work up to a full
clove of garlic and 1 teaspoon of yeast per day. The animal's coat
then becomes inhospitable to fleas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where does blood come from for animal transfusions? Donor cats
and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarian Rick Lusk says a transfusion is given to about one
animal a month at Westgate Pet and Bird Hospital. Cats are more
likely to need transfusions for treating flea anemia. Donors
usually are the hospital staff's pets, whose vaccination and
disease histories are well-known, although there are a few animal
blood banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Emergency Animal Clinic of Northwest Austin keeps cat and
dog blood on hand, whereas Westgate collects it as needed. Donor
animals regenerate blood in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Cats have three blood types; dogs, eight. In the canine world,
there are universal donor blood types; in felines, purebred cats
(often Type B) donate for purebreds, and nonpurebreds (usually Type
A) for nonpurebreds.
</P>
<P>
   A new blood product called Oxyglobin carries oxygen just like
blood does.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do any vets prescribe Prozac for cats? Mine bites her fur off.
</P>
<P>
   Your cat has a case of flank sucking (common in depressed cats),
known as psychogenic dermatitis, or inflammation of the skin from
self-trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Felines are susceptible to stress just like humans. The ideal
solution? Eliminate the cause of the stress, says veterinarian Ed
Childress of Highland's Pet Medical Clinic. Have a new pet in the
house? Been away? ``Chemicals should be used as a last-ditch
effort,'' adds Childress. Risks are associated with any drug,
including anti-depressants for animals with separation anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   _ This little pig went to market; this little pig did not come
home.
</P>
<P>
   A popular pet tidbit is baked pig ears. Yep, real pig ears. But
watch those calories, pet owners.
</P>
<P>
   Smokehouse Dog Treats sells about 12 million pig ears annually
and estimates each ear is 30 percent fat. The average baked ear
weighs 1.1 ounce and delivers 150 to 165 calories.
</P>
<P>
   Is it good for your dog? Veterinarian Geoffrey Wisbrock of the
Love Pet Hospital says if a 50-pound dog has a weight problem, the
culprit is probably overall diet rather than the one-pig-ear-a-day
treat. A 50-pound dog should be getting between 1,500 and 2,500
calories per day. Of course, working or pregnant dogs need more
calories. All treats should be given in moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Did Wisbrock ever give his dogs pig ears? Nope.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, several dogs have experienced dental problems caused
by chewing hooves, another popular treat. And dogs sometimes
swallow a bigger chunk than they should. Gulp!
</P>
<P>
   _ Out! Out! !!! spot!
</P>
<P>
   Keep a clean, dry rag under a chair cushion in every room where
Garfield or Fido might have an accident. This allows you to blot up
puddles immediately. Should you discover it later, use club soda
and cornstarch (pat, sprinkle, let dry, vacuum, repeat) to leach
the stain from carpet or upholstery. Always test for colorfastness
on fabrics. Some readers report luck with Windex as a quick fix
since it contains ammonia. Others swear by enzyme-based cleansers.
Vinegar neutralizes odors _ pet and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   _ Face it, they all shed
</P>
<P>
   Keep masking tape in the car to remove pet hair from your
clothes at the last minute. Toss pet bedding covers in the dryer on
fluff to remove first layer of pet hair before washing. Brush your
pet often to remove loose hair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shopping for Fido's vittles
</P>
<P>
   The ``Good Dog! Dog Product Buyers Guide'' offers these tips.
More than 250 products for your dog were tested and reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Try several brands for six to eight weeks before settling on
one. Use the brand that keeps your dog looking his best. Read
ingredients label for content of protein, fat, etc. Dried meat has
less water than fresh meat and therefore weighs less. Spend more to
save more. Premium dog foods have more nutrition per bite and so
may cost less per serving. Interpret the date code. Foods with
chemical antioxidants will generally be edible for one year; with
natural antioxidants like vitamin E, about nine months. Calculate
the shelf life based on your usage and the manufacturer's ``best
before'' date or manufacturer's code date.

the appearance of Sirius, the dog star, contributed to the heat.

   Dog Biscuits Deluxe
</P>
<P>
   2 cups whole wheat flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup soy flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon bonemeal (available at pet stores)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sunflower or pumpkin seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 cloves minced garlic or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
(optional)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons melted butter, fat or oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsulfured molasses
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs mixed with 1/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Mix the flours, cornmeal, bonemeal and seeds together. Add the
garlic and yeast, if desired. In a separate bowl, combine the
butter (or fat or oil), molasses, salt and egg/milk mixture; set
aside 1 tablespoon of this liquid mixture and combine the rest with
the dry ingredients. Add more milk, if necessary, to make dough
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Knead together dough for a few minutes and let the dough rest a
half hour or more. Roll out to 1/2-inch thick. Cut into shapes and
brush with remaining egg mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until lightly toasted. To
make harder biscuits, leave in turned-off oven for an hour or more.
Biscuits keep longer if you use oil instead of butter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tattoos not just for people
</P>
<P>
   To protect and identify animals, many owners have registration
numbers tattooed on a pet's tummy or thigh. Here are a few places
that perform such a service: Century Animal Hospital (442-9518) and
North Austin Animal Hospital (459-7676). Prices vary.
</P>
<P>
   Tattooing is done while an animal is sedated. Consider having
the tattoo done during Garfield's or Fido's next surgical
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   A less visible and less expensive alternative is an AVID
microchip implant. Contact your veterinarian or Century Animal
Hospital for details.

 &HT;    Not all Georgians leaving welfare are going to work
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Overhauling welfare was meant to get people off of aid
and onto someone's payroll. But Georgia's shrinking caseload, which
dropped from about 114,000 when the overhaul began to 73,000 by
June 1998, isn't the sole result of people finding jobs, numbers
show.
</P>
<P>
   The lower numbers also resulted from fewer people applying for
welfare and the state denying more applications, according to
statistics reported to the federal welfare agency by the Department
of Human Resources, which operates Georgia's welfare program.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, caseworkers were confused by the new rules and
may have denied welfare assistance to people who were eligible for
help, officials acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   During 1997, the year the state began changing the welfare
system, about 20,000 fewer people sought public assistance than in
previous years. The state also denied 31,801 and turned away 28,983
others, instead providing them with some type of one-time
assistance, according to the statistics DHR reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although seldom mentioned, the number of people denied,
discontinued or diverted from public assistance is a significant
part of Georgia's diminishing caseload. DHR does not know how many
of those might actually have qualified for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a void in our conversation,'' said Kathy Palumbo,
community services director of the Atlanta Community Food Bank and
a member of the Georgia Safety Network, an assembly of nonprofit
advocacy organizations that keeps track of the changes in welfare.
``We can't gauge how well or how poorly we are doing if we don't
know something about what happens to how many.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three years before Georgia implemented Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families, the new welfare program that
requires recipients to work, an average of 93,000 Georgians applied
for public assistance each year, records show.
</P>
<P>
   But when TANF began in 1997, the number of applicants fell to
73,430. And caseworkers turned away 43 percent of applicants
compared to the average 35 percent denied in each of the three
previous years, according to statistics from the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Beavor, a member of the state's Welfare Reform Advisory
Council, has noted two possible reasons for the drop in
applications through her work on the council and in her previous
job as director of the Legal Clinic for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The word on the street among needy people was that it was harder
to receive benefits, so some people didn't bother to apply, Beavor
said. Council members also learned there was a lot of confusion
about TANF policy because specific guidelines for Georgia's welfare
program hadn't yet been established when caseworkers began
implementing TANF, she said. Consequently, caseworkers did not
grant benefits to some people who might have been eligible.
</P>
<P>
   When the program began, there was some confusion about the new
policy and who did or did not qualify for benefits, acknowledged
Peg Peters, director of the Division of Family and Children
Services, which administers the welfare program for DHR.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were thousands of people who lost their welfare
benefits because they failed to comply with the new rules. During
the first six months of TANF, the period for which statistics are
available, caseworkers discontinued benefits in more than 15,208
cases for that reason. An average case involves a mother and two
children, so those cases could represent some 45,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   However, Peters contends that in all 11,186 cases removed from
the welfare rolls during the second quarter of 1997 for failing to
follow the new rules, the recipients voluntarily decided they did
not want to receive welfare anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Records don't reveal how many, if any, of those people returned
to the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Stiffer rules may have weeded out people who weren't in dire
straits but who would have applied for benefits before TANF, when
it was easy, said Darcy Olsen, an entitlements policy analyst at
the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have a temporary crisis, such as a broken car or
loss of a babysitter, that keeps them from working and prompts them
to seek public assistance. With new welfare laws, Georgia now can
pay for the necessary service that will allow them to continue to
work, or start working, and divert them from welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Before welfare's overhaul, that type of one-time help wasn't
available.
</P>
<P>
   From January 1997, when TANF began, to June 1998, the latest
month for which statistics are available, welfare workers diverted
28,983 people, 11,274 at the time they applied and 17,709 who found
work before benefits took effect.
</P>
<P>
   DFACS spent $7 million on diversion expenses. Child care
services cost $4.3 million, transportation assistance $1.2 million
and incidentals such as uniforms, glasses or professional licenses,
$1.5 million.

 &HT;    Bass keeps growing
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANA _ Thomas R. Oliver was once asked by a search firm if he
knew of someone capable of assuming the helm of one of the world's
largest hotel companies.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Oliver, then chairman and chief executive
officer of AudioFAX, an Atlanta-based telecommunications company,
said he knew just the right person.
</P>
<P>
   Himself.
</P>
<P>
   What may have seemed a bit self-aggrandizing at the time has
perhaps turned out to be one of the best personnel recommendations
for Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts, the largest operating unit of
London-based Bass PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Since Oliver joined the division in 1997, the company has
continued to expand its reach. It now owns, operates or franchises
more than 2,700 hotels in 95 countries. And it just seems to keep
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next five years, the company plans to add more than
1,200 properties worldwide to its portfolio of some of the world's
most recognized brands, including Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express,
Crowne Plaza and Inter-Continental Hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've got is a company that's got a very, very strong
position in major markets that is not only growing now and not only
grew in the last five years, but frankly, for as many years as we
can foresee,'' said Oliver, 57, chairman and chief executive
officer and a member of the board of the division's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Such growth has not gone unnoticed ``across the pond.''
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1998, the division constituted about 40 percent of
Bass PLC's operating profits, up from about 25 percent a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the company announced it was moving several key
executives, including Oliver and Vice Chairman Craig Hunt, from its
Dunwoody headquarters across the street from Perimeter Mall to
London to be closer to parent company Bass PLC. Hunt, 46, is the
former president of Holiday Inn, North America.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Crowne Plaza and Inter-Continental Hotels brands will
be based in London, along with the international operations for
Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Several operations will remain here, including Holiday Inns
North America. Additionally, more than 800 employees will stay in
metro Atlanta, including top executives such as John T. Sweetwood,
president of Holiday Inns North America.
</P>
<P>
   The move signals the growing importance of the hotel division to
Bass PLC, which also has pubs, restaurants and branded drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said the move makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that we now have such a significant global
presence,'' said Oliver, the former chief operating officer and
executive vice president of worldwide customer operations for
Federal Express in Memphis. ``Our being much closer to the people
in London allows us to have a substantially better communications
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The move also simplifies the operations here, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel business has taken on even greater significance
``because that's where the investment is going and the other
divisions (brewing and pubs) have done rather worse than
expected,'' said Fraser Ramzan, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in
London. ``There was a bit of a hiccup in 1998,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, profits in the company's soft drink business were
down due to product recall and high marketing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Good reputation is key
</P>
<P>
   The company has come a long way since 1952 when entrepreneur
Kemmons Wilson opened the first Holiday Inn hotel on U.S. 70 in
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson became a pioneer in the franchising business and quickly
expanded the chain. Eventually, Holiday Inn became a well-known
name in the lodging industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost unbelievable the way it's kept on growing,'' said
Wilson, 86, whose hotel business still includes four Holiday Inn
Expresses, two Holiday Inns and one Holiday Inn Select. ``The key
is to build a good reputation where everyone knows they will get a
nice room at a reasonable price.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass acquired the Holiday Inn chain in 1990, moving its
headquarters from Memphis to metro Atlanta a year later. But the
chain's U.S. operations were starting to show their age and at some
units the quality of service started to decline. That, and
competition from newer hotel properties such as Hampton Inns, led
to a drop-off in customers.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the company began an ambitious program to
spruce up its properties and expand its brand offerings.
Franchisees, tired of losing business to their fresher competitors,
heartily embraced the move.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800 hotels have undergone some level of renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Under Oliver's direction, the company also strongly pushed
separate brand identities.
</P>
<P>
   Last March it purchased the Inter-Continental hotel chain. That
acquisition was indeed a feather in Bass' cap, analysts noted,
nabbing one of the world's most recognized high-end hotel
properties, which already had operations in 73 countries and
contributed significantly to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the company changed its name from Holiday
Hospitality to Holiday Inn Worldwide and eventually _ reflecting a
change in image from a dowdy, midscale, U.S.-focused franchise
operation to a global player _ to Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   `Our plate is full'
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the company plans to continue to aggressively eye
both domestic and international markets. Oliver estimates Bass
Hotels &AMP; Resorts will contribute more than 50 percent of the parent
company's operating earnings within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Further acquisitions are not in the immediate future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very much digesting what we acquired with
Inter-Continental,'' Oliver said. ``Our plate is full so we're not
aggressively seeking those opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, the company is especially optimistic
about the prospects of one of its newest brands _ Staybridge Suites
by Holiday Inn. Already more than 25 franchises have been sold. The
first opened this month in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   Growth is planned for other brands as well. Bass' Hunt estimates
20 percent annual growth alone for the upscale brands outside of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the company plans to open another Crowne Plaza and
an Inter-Continental in downtown and Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, who also will be in charge of development of businesses
outside of the hotel brands, said possible options include vacation
ownership, assisted-living facilities and other franchising
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   With Bass set on such an aggressive course, an oversupply of
rooms is an obvious concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a dramatic increase in the supply of
economy-oriented limited service hotels throughout the United
States, particularly in the Sun Belt within the last six months,''
said Mark Woodworth, executive vice president of PKF Consulting in
Atlanta. ``As a result, the development of these limited service
properties has slowed down dramatically. We expect the growth of
the Holiday Inn Express brand to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   From Oliver's vantage point, on the 31st floor of an office
complex in Dunwoody, that growth will be fueled by two factors _
service and employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always approached business from the standpoint that you
have to make sure your customers and employees are happy and
satisfied.''

 &HT;    May your dreams fit your abilities
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is a coincidence, but in the same week when Chicago
Bulls legend Michael Jordan announced his retirement, Kenneth I.
Chenault spoke at Clark Atlanta University and advised young people
to dream practical dreams, not pipe dreams like being the next
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media often encourages us to indulge in magical thinking,
that we can be Michael Jordan,'' said Chenault. ``But we should
dream realistically and then work to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Chenault, 47, is a living example that dreams and hard work can
have wonderful results. He is president of American Express and one
of the world's authorities on credit cards. By any measure he is
one of the most senior African-Americans in corporate life and an
executive on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Clark Atlanta last week as a participant in a series
of forums in the Clark Atlanta School of Business Administration
called the Dean's Executive Lecture Series. The talks have featured
such outstanding black executives as Ann Fudge, president of
Maxwell House Coffee; Raymond McGuire, managing director of Merrill
Lynch; and Ernest Green, managing director of Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Chenault, like the rest, came to give practical advice and also
to embody business success for the students. He was greeted by
hundreds of students who filled the main gathering place in the new
student center and gave him several standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   Chenault, the son of a Morehouse College-educated dentist, was
featured in Business Week magazine last month in a piece that
credited him with bringing the huge 147-year-old financial firm
back from the brink of trouble. He seems destined for bigger things
at American Express.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Chenault's message to the black students was
that they need to ignore racial prejudice and any other artificial
barriers that may seem to bar them from succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father used to tell me that whatever happens, there is one
thing I can control, and that's the quality of my own
performance,'' said Chenault. Regardless of the attitude of others,
he said, personal fortitude could overcome the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Even the great dreamers have often sold African-Americans short,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jefferson said all men are created equal, but there was
evidence he did not believe his own words,'' said Chenault. ``But
DuBois did, and he said education can lift us all.'' His reference
was to William Edward Burghardt DuBois, the historian and political
activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jefferson said we, the races, could not live together because
black people would be too consumed by hatred and retribution (over
slavery and mistreatment), but DuBois knew better.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when some young African-Americans and women are
choosing to use their business and financial education to start
their own businesses, Chenault urged the students to strive for
whatever goals satisfied them.
</P>
<P>
   But he said certain facts of life must be kept in mind by those
who hoped to succeed. Opportunity is expanding, he said, with the
fall of geographic barriers, changes in the global economy and
changes in the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low-skilled jobs are leaving, many headed for overseas,'' he
said, ``and clearly knowledge is the power that each of us needs to
succeed in the new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Chenault laid out some very practical steps students could take
to improve their own chance to succeed in life and business. He
said:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep personal integrity in mind. Don't go with the highest
bidder, but ``go with a company whose goals and purpose you can
embrace.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Associate with the best and brightest people in the company.
``Stay away from dumb people.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Do your job. ``People talk so much about networking, but the
most important rule is to complete the job at hand. In college you
can do all the networking you want, but it means nothing when the
blue books (test booklets) show up.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't fear chaos. ``When the company is undergoing change and
may be in trouble, that provides the best opportunities for those
willing to pitch in and work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Realize that as college graduates, joining the mere 11
percent of African-Americans who are graduates, you will be looked
upon as a leader. You need to act like leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The students gave Chenault a spirited standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   He obviously had connected with them.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Boyce, an undergraduate student in finance, took notes
furiously during Chenault's presentation. She said afterward she
was enlightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard him say `enjoy what you do, but be prepared,' and
that's what I plan to do,'' she said.

 &HT;    Lyricist of 'Chicago' enjoying Act II of his success
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As goes Fred Ebb, so goes the fortunes of the
American musical.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seems.
</P>
<P>
   The career of the lyricist for ``Chicago,'' the hit musical that
arrives Wednesday at Bass Concert Hall, is not as illustrious as
Stephen Sondheim's, nor as popularly favored as Jerry Herman's.
Yet, among Americans writing musicals, Ebb, and collaborator John
Kander, closely track the rise and fall _ and rise again _ of the
artform over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Ebb, 66, feels mellow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regional theater is healthy; Broadway is healthy,'' Ebb said
from Arlington, Va., where he is rehearsing his latest show, a
musical version of Thornton Wilder's ``The Skin of Our Teeth.''
``Passing that line at TKTS (the Times Square half-price tickets
service) just makes your eyes water. Knowing that people will line
up all around the block in the cold, simply to see a show, that's
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebb and Kander, who penned ``Cabaret,'' ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman'' and ``New York, New York,'' among other shows, are on
something of a roll in the late '90s. Although their last original
show, ``Steel Pier,'' sunk like, well, a steel pier, two highly
acclaimed revivals have reminded theatergoers why the team is among
the most auspicious ever to write for Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   A slimmed-down, sexy version of ``Chicago,'' their 1975 satire
of show business and crime in the 1920s, is still playing to full
houses on Broadway after two years.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Broadway is a rethinking of ``Cabaret,'' their 1966
musical about pre-Nazi Germany, set in a confined, grimy space to
give the period piece a distinctly period feel. After winning a
handful of Tony Awards, the revival moved to the former Studio 54,
home base of another era's ``divine decadence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both have been reimagined by extremely talented directors,''
Ebb said of ``Chicago'' and ``Cabaret.'' ``I am delighted to have
my material molded in that way, the work of different
imaginations.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other musical-makers, Kander and Ebb are not so touchy
about new interpretations of their shows. After all, they allowed _
and loved _ the eccentric takes on their greatest songs in the
revue ``The World Goes Round'' (yet to be staged in Austin.)
</P>
<P>
   Kander and Ebb came into their own during the '60s and '70s, the
so-called Silver Age of the American musical, well after the Golden
Age of the '40s and '50s. They persisted during the dark days with
minor shows, such as ``The Happy Time'' and ``70, Girls, 70.'' But
midcareer, they created a highly acclaimed musical, ``Chicago,''
which nevertheless failed to capture the imagination of the times.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the Sin City of the '20s, it concerns women who turn
their criminal fame into show-biz glamour, while their lawyer spins
the tabloid press with fantastic versions of their stories. No
wonder it speaks more clearly in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. Simpson was on the page month after month, and everybody
knew about his trial and who represented him. Everybody had an
opinion about the justice, or lack of it, in the judicial system
and the world of journalism,'' Ebb said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebb feels he follows in the tradition of the great lyricists _
Ira Gershwin, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Dorothy Fields, Alan
J. Lerner, Frank Loesser _ who also spoke for their times. Of
course, he admires his contemporary, Sondheim
</P>
<P>
   ``He's superior in every way. There's a great, great craft at
work there,'' Ebb said.
</P>
<P>
   As for failing to attract the kind of attention Sondheim gets _
the books, the articles, the inductions into bookish societies _
Ebb is philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's never been terribly important to me,'' he said. ``I
just wanted to do my work and wanted people to like it. I love
putting on the radio and hearing Frank (Sinatra) singing my songs,
or walking down the street and hearing a truck driver whistling one
of our songs.''
</P>
<P>
   As each year passes, it seems more likely that Ebb, like the
musicals he creates, will outlast the former underestimation of his
work encapsulated in historian Gerald Bordman's one-time
evaluation: ``His lyrics have rarely displayed any exceptional
characteristics other than admirably suiting the mood and period of
text and music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People love music; it's the universal language,'' Ebb said.
``They know that's what they are going to get in a musical, the
emotional involvement, the immediacy of having live performers in
front of you with real voices. That's tremendously attractive. It
always has been and always will be.''

 &HT;    College savings plans popular, but shop carefully
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More and more people are jumping into college savings
plans that allow them to defer taxes on their investment income
until the kids are in college.
</P>
<P>
   When New York opened its 529 plan _ named after the section of
the law that set them up _ it took in $90 million in only four
months. That represents investments for 25,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, sign-ups are accelerating. More than 200,000
accounts were opened in 1998, according to the College Savings Plan
Network. That brings the total to about 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what the soccer moms want,'' said Marshall Bennett, the
Mississippian who chairs the CSPN. ``The middle-class has had to
depend on debt to pay for college. The rich could always pay for
it. But the middle-class needed some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the popularity: ``It's a way to save for
college and to earn tax breaks at the same time,'' said Mike
Fitzgerald, who oversees the Iowa program.
</P>
<P>
   The programs are sponsored and administered by state
governments. Thirty-four states have programs now. Georgia does not
have a college savings plan, but a number of other states accept
out-of-state accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rules vary from state to state, but the pattern is the same.
Anyone _ parent, grandparent, even a friend _ can set up a child's
account. Any number of people can contribute to it. Every plan has
a limit on maximum lifetime contributions, usually about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The money is invested for you in predetermined ways. In the New
Hampshire plan, for example, Fidelity splits your money among stock
and bond mutual funds and possibly a money market. The asset
allocations shift over the years, moving toward more stable
investments as the child nears college age.
</P>
<P>
   The donor has to pay current income taxes on his or her
contribution. But the earnings are sheltered. The income tax bill
is deferred until the money comes out. Then it is taxed at the
child's tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend the money for college expenses, including room and
board, at any accredited post-high school institution in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The option to spend it anywhere makes college savings plans a
lot more attractive than their predecessors, prepaid tuition plans.
Those were almost always limited to colleges in the state that
sponsored the program.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those prepaid tuition plans are still being offered and
draw contributions from more conservative families. Shop carefully.
</P>
<P>
   The plans have numerous differences. The chart shows, for
example, some types of investments offered by several states'
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Expense levels can vary, too. Vanguard charges Iowans .31
percent a year for management expenses. It is among the cheapest
for college savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Iowa has by far the lowest ceiling on annual
donations. Any person can deposit no more than $2,000 a year in any
child's account. To beat that limit, each parent _ or anybody else
at all _ could contribute $2,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   You can make direct contact with state agencies through the
College Savings Plans Network. Go to http://www.collegesavings
</P>
<P>
   .com or call 877-277-6496.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of all the available state plans can be found at
http://www.kiplinger.com.
</P>
<P>
   There are some drawbacks to the college savings plans, or at
least points to consider carefully. Chief among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ As noted, you have no control over how your money is invested.
</P>
<P>
   _ You can't move to a different investment if you don't like the
results your plan gets.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are cash penalties if you take money out of a plan for
anything except education. That could be exasperating if one or all
your kids decided not to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   _ The biggest advantage comes to those who can invest a lot
while their kids are young. That gives the investments plenty of
time to grow. One possible strategy: Encourage grandparents, when
they're in a giving mood, to consider a college savings plan.

 &HT;    Break out of that post-holiday slump
 &HT;    By Vikki Ramsey Conwell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you've had trouble getting back into the swing of
work, don't despair. You could be suffering from a holiday
hangover.
</P>
<P>
   A workplace slump at the start of the new year is only natural,
experts say. It's so widespread, it shows up as a seasonal slump in
the economy in December and January, and again in August _ when
summer vacations end, according to the Conference Board, a business
research group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For computer consultant Keith Debowles, being away from the
office for two weeks made him realize how good it is at home. ``I
just had too much fun spending time with my kids,'' said Debowles,
who took an extra week off to be with a sick daughter. ``When I
went back to work, I suffered a slight relapse. I was very slow
getting up and running again.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of returning to a job is not energizing for many
people, said Bill Kahnweiler, associate professor of human resource
development at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize how good it is not to be there,'' said Kahnweiler.
``When you're caught up in the treadmill of working, you don't have
time to think about how bad it is. When the treadmill slows down or
stops, it gives you time to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This holiday slump generally lasts a week or two, experts say.
If it still has a grip on you, the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday
Monday will give many people another three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That can only work in your favor.
</P>
<P>
   If you're back on track, an extra day off could further energize
you. If you're not, experts say, this may be a last shot to recover
_ at least until spring break and summer vacations roll around.
Until then, there's a long stretch between now and the next major
holiday, which isn't until Memorial Day, May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just that you've been out of the office partying and
sleeping,'' said Eric Greenberg, director of management studies at
the American Management Association in New York. ``There are
physical factors such as colder temperatures and shorter days.
Then, there's the extra 5 to 7 pounds that most people gain during
the holidays. Lugging around that extra weight drains our energy
and makes us feel sluggish,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back into a routine can be difficult for most people,
Greenberg said. How well you handle it depends on what you do
before and after your break. But there are steps you can take.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you should sprint toward a holiday instead of
cruising into it, Greenberg recommends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decide to have a clear desk before you leave so you won't be
swamped when you get back.''
</P>
<P>
   When you return to work, pace yourself. Don't overdo it trying
to make up for lost time, experts say. Regular breaks can help keep
you focused.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Jackson, a computer analyst with the state of Georgia,
sometimes listens to the radio while at work and takes breaks
periodically to either walk or read the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exercising is good to increase your energy level,'' said
Jackson, of Decatur, who has been on the job 22 years. ``Meditating
is also good.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many workers, though, have a tendency to put too much
pressure on themselves at the beginning of a new year, said Emory
Mulling, president of Mulling Group, an Atlanta outplacement firm.
Then they get overwhelmed and become more down than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is your responsibility to take charge of a slump and do
things that will get you out of it,'' said Mulling. ``Knowing what
it takes is a gift to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Start by making a list of short-term goals. Also, now is a good
time to set performance goals with your supervisor, if you haven't
already.
</P>
<P>
   Managers also need to allow workers to ease back into their jobs
after a break, said Kahnweiler.
</P>
<P>
   If expectations are too high, ``the employee gets discouraged.
Managers should be mindful of the delicate balance between
stretched goals and unachievable goals that discourage people from
even trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Many employers recognize such a slump is ``just a byproduct of
being a human being in this country,'' said Burke Stinson, a
spokesman with AT&AMP;T operating headquarters in New Jersey, one of
the nation's largest employers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company really doesn't address the issue formally
because ``it's short-lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, however, require their managers to stay in touch
during long breaks.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 survey by the American Management Association, 81
percent of managers and executives reported they kept in touch with
their offices by phone during vacations and holiday breaks. Another
21 percent kept in touch by e-mail, and 43 percent said they did
some sort of office-related work while they were out. Sixteen
percent of employers said they required managers and executives to
keep in touch while on extended vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies realize that productivity is lost in direct
proportion to how much time a person is away,'' said Greenberg.
``It is worth their while to establish guidelines about keeping in
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   But such down periods can be a good thing, said Stinson.
</P>
<P>
   It's similar to what happens when people leave for lunch, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   People leave their work on their desk, eat a meal and then come
back refreshed and renewed.
</P>
<P>
   He sees holidays as an extended period to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an intellectual exercise,'' said Stinson. ``The new

 &HT;    Web's just like TV: Parents need control
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The good thing about the Internet also is the bad
thing, if you're a parent. There is information on almost any topic
you can name, out there for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   So parents often face this worry: Do I let my kids have full use
of the Web and take a chance they'll run into adult material or
violence or even strangers who are dangerous? Or do I shield them
from all that and take the chance they won't do as well at school
as their friends who do use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That's why _ for some parents _ the middle ground is best:
Control the Internet and Web, just as some parents control the use
of the TV and video games. There are sites built especially for
kids that are designed to keep out objectionable material (although
a smart parent will still rely on his or her own judgment, not that
of a stranger).
</P>
<P>
   For starters, here are some Web sites made for kids that would
be accepted in most families.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yahooligans: It's a search engine made to be used by young
people. There's less chance of it being used to find sites not
approved in your family. It is, of course, owned by Yahoo!, the
same folks who made the search engine popular.
http://www.yahooligans
</P>
<P>
   .com/
</P>
<P>
   _ Kid's Corner: It's more of a full-blown destination than
Yahooligans. You will find ways to surf the Web here, but there
also are games and areas where art and stories by other kids are
displayed. Everything here is rated G and should meet demanding
standards of most homes. http://kids.ot.com/
</P>
<P>
   _ Kids Identifying and Discovering Sites: If there are nights
when you need homework help and no one in the family has the needed
knowledge, this is the place for you. There are lots of links to
places that cater to the kindergarten through high school grade
range. http://wwwscout.cs.wisc.edu/scout

 &HT;    Simple, reliable savings bonds just got easier to buy
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ U.S. Savings Bonds, an old-fashioned investment, have
gone electronic.
</P>
<P>
   Although they pay rates of return below most private
investments, millions of Savings Bonds have been bought by
Americans over the years because of their simplicity as an
investment and because of their Uncle Sam-guaranteed safety.
</P>
<P>
   But for many would-be investors in the past, there was a
problem: How do you buy Savings Bonds?
</P>
<P>
   Previously there were two ways investors could buy the bonds.
They could buy them through a bank or broker, or through payroll
deduction at work if their employer offered the service.
</P>
<P>
   But about 120 million Americans worked for companies without
payroll deduction for the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   So last month the U.S. Treasury initiated the EasySaver Plan for
Savings Bonds, which allows investors to buy the bonds by
authorizing the agency to deduct a set amount each month from their
checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Two types of Savings Bonds are available through the plan _ the
Series EE bonds, which sell for half of their face value that's
paid at maturity; and the Series I bonds, which sell at face value
and pay inflation-indexed interest.
</P>
<P>
   Series EE bonds are available in $50, $75, $100, $200, $500 and
$1,000 denominations, and Series I bonds in $50, $75, $100, $500
and $1,000 denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Investors choose the dates and amounts to charge their account
for the bond purchases. The only requirement is that investors must
purchase at least two bonds each year.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wish to set up an account can call 1-877-811-7283, or
download the EasySaver enrollment form from the Treasury's Web site
at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .easysaver.gov.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about four weeks to set up the account. Then the
Treasury will begin debiting your account for the amount you said
and send you the applicable bonds.

 &HT;    Bottom line: Economics does matter
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Think you know a lot about sports? Then answer this
question: Why do professional sports players generally earn more
than farmers and steelworkers?
</P>
<P>
   Before answering, you need to understand it's not really a
sports question but an economic question that was asked in a recent
survey of consumers by the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   What's your guess? Because athletes usually are bigger and
stronger than farmers and steelworkers? Because tickets to
professional sports events are so expensive?
</P>
<P>
   No, those answers are wrong, but don't feel too dumb if you
can't answer the question. Only one in four participants in the
survey answered correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is scarcity. When something is scarce, and
there's a demand for it, its price is high. The Minneapolis bank
explained it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Salaries earned by most individuals depend basically on the
demand for their services relative to the supply of such services.
Since excellent baseball players are very scarce relative to the
strong demand for their services from major league clubs, the
salaries they receive are higher than those received by most other
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey asked 12 other questions and, in total, the
respondents flunked, with an average score of 45 percent. But the
outcome was not surprising, because numerous surveys have shown
that most Americans are economically ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of understanding about ``pure'' economics, as taught in
college, is understandable because it can be a rather dull subject.
But understanding ``real life'' economics is important because it
directly affects salaries, investment and credit. A better
understanding of economics usually means a better standard of
living.
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation, a number of groups are trying to teach that
lesson, beginning with improved courses at all levels of school.
The Georgia Council on Economic Education, for example, works with
various groups to provide schools with economic education materials
to help teach personal finance and its relation to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   As with many lessons, however, the best place to begin is at
home, which is the goal of College Parents of America, an
association that seeks to help parents talk to their children about
``the financial facts of life'' and how the proper use of money and
credit affects their entire lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of students will turn to their parents for advice
on money matters,'' said Richard Flaherty, president of the
Washington-based association. ``Our goal is to be sure parents are
ready to answer the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   To assist parents, the association, in conjunction with
MasterCard International, has produced a 10-page brochure to make
the financial conversation more effective _ ``Money Talks: Helping
Your High School and College-Aged Children Master the Financial
Facts of Life.'' For a free copy, call toll-free 1-800-999-5136.

REAL ESTATE: THE MOUSE CHECKS IN BUT NOT OUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J.)  (jw) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Mice are the No. 1 infestation problem in the city
today,'' said Michael Deutsch, an entomologist with Allied/Pioneer
Pest Management Companies in Manhattan. ``We have a pretty good
handle on roaches. But the rodent population has been steadily
increasing. I would say that most buildings in the city today have
some level of infestation.''
</P>
<P>
   While such an assessment might appear self-serving coming from
an employee of an extermination company, others agree Deutsch may
be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be at all unusual to find mice in most New York
City buildings,'' said Richard Ostfeld, an animal ecologist at the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies, a research organization in
Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld said that there were basically two kinds of mice in and
around New York _ the house mouse and the white-footed mouse, which
prefers the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The house mouse, Ostfeld said, settles more or less permanently
inside buildings to be near a steady source of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``A female house mouse can produce litters of eight new mice
every three or four weeks,'' Ostfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   The white-footed mouse prefers to remain outdoors _ at least
until the weather turns cold. ``The white-footed mouse will enter
people's homes, especially in the fall and winter,'' he said,
adding that while the numbers of mice fluctuate from year to year,
the fluctuations can often be predicted by the number of acorns in
their environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are a lot of acorns in the fall, there are a whole
lot of mice the next year,'' he said. ``We've had two good acorn
years in a row and that's produced high numbers of mice. And when
the weather turned cold, they probably started moving inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Crudo, president of Paladin Pest Control in the Bay Terrace
section of Staten Island, can vouch for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last year or so has been terrible,'' Crudo said. ``We deal
mostly with apartment buildings in Manhattan, and the influx of
mice has been so bad, we've had to re-treat some buildings two or
three times.''
</P>
<P>
   Crudo said there were three basic strategies for dealing with
mice _ sealing, trapping and baiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sealing up holes is the first line of defense,'' he said,
explaining that any hole with a diameter larger than that of a
pencil can be an entry point for mice. Such holes can be found
around plumbing lines, heat pipes and in gaps between floors and
baseboards. ``We generally use an expanding foam to seal all entry
points,'' Crudo said, explaining that while steel wool is sometimes
used to seal holes, the steel will deteriorate over time if the
mice have not already clawed through it.
</P>
<P>
   Once a house or apartment is sealed as tightly as possible,
Crudo said, it is then necessary to eliminate the source of the
problem using poison bait or traps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important rule for using bait is to keep it out of
sight and out of reach,'' Crudo said, adding that the best strategy
for using any kind of poison is to use tamper-resistant bait
stations that mice can get into, but children and pets cannot. Such
products can be bought at hardware stores, he said, adding that it
was usually best to buy a bait station with the bait pre-installed.
</P>
<P>
   Crudo said that mouse baits generally come in two forms:
single-feed, fatal after just one feeding, and multiple-feed, which
requires several feedings to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The multiple-feed works best,'' he said, explaining that more
mice are likely to use it because its delayed reaction makes it
less likely they will recognize the bait for what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what you use, it's important to follow the
instructions on the package, and check the baits on a regular basis
so you can replace any that have been eaten,'' Crudo said. He added
that it usually takes several days for the mice to become
comfortable enough with the bait stations to start to eat. And, he
said, the old story about mice eating the bait and dying in the
walls is unfortunately true. ``It probably happens more often than
people know,'' he said. ``But mice are so small, they dry up and
skeletonize pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer to avoid having poison in their house and
skeletons in their walls, there are alternatives. ``There are
several traps on the market that are very effective,'' said Kirk La
Pierre, owner of A-1 Saver Services, a pest control company in
Rutherford, N.J. ``But the kind of trap to use depends mostly on
your attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the least expensive and most effective traps _ the
glue-trap _ also happens to be the cruelest for its victims. A
glue-trap, La Pierre said, is basically a stiff piece of cardboard
coated with glue. Bait is placed in the center of the trap _ an
unshelled peanut with a drop of almond extract works best _ and the
trap is placed on a floor or ledge next to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   La Pierre, who is also president of the New Jersey Wildlife
Damage Control Association, said that since a mouse trapped on a
glue board could suffer considerably before it died, it was usually
preferable to use more humane ``snap traps'' that would kill
instantly. Such traps, which come in easy-to-set plastic models as
well as the standard wood-and-spring latch-type designs, should
also be set along walls where mice meander, taking care to keep
them out of reach of children and pets.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer to evict the invaders rather than execute
them, La Pierre said, there are a number of ``humane'' traps on the
market. Such traps, he said, can be either single-occupancy devices
that a mouse enters but cannot exit, or multiple-catch machines
that catch and hold several mice without harming them. The problem
with such traps, however, is disposing of the day's catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to release the mice a decent distance from the house
or they'll just find their way back,'' said Ostfeld, the animal
ecologist. ``A mile away is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   A mile?
</P>
<P>
   ``Mice have surprisingly good homing instincts,'' Ostfeld said,
explaining that he once conducted an experiment in which
white-footed mice were marked to identify them and then taken more
than a mile away from home and released.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few days later, we started getting animals returning,'' he
said, noting that to do so, the mice had to cross a busy road, swim
through a rapidly moving stream, and then climb a three-foot high
fence, passing through some perfectly acceptable mouse country
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how they did it,'' Ostfeld said. ``But these
mice were obviously highly motivated to get home.''

   WELFARE-GACASES _ Overhauling welfare was meant to get people

caseload, which dropped from about 114,000 when the overhaul began
to 73,000 by June 1998, isn't the sole result of people finding
jobs, numbers show. The lower numbers also resulted from fewer
people applying for welfare and the state turning away more
applicants, according to statistics reported to the federal welfare

Georgia's welfare program. (Oglesby, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

will address human rights, poverty and the economy, religious
competition, abortion -- or even drug trafficking -- during his
visit. The visit marks the closure of a bishops' conference on
challenges to the Catholic church in the Americas. In addition to
church business, however, the frail Catholic leader often comments
on broader questions of social policy. A Catholic Diocese in
Mexico's Southern Chiapas state, is hoping the Pope will take on
the Mexican government and the long-simmering Chiapas conflict,
which has led to the expulsion and imprisonment of Catholic
priests. The Diocese may present a report to the Pope claiming that
Chiapas' poor and Indian populations are victims of human rights
violations, haphazard free-market economic policies and the
corruption of drug traffickers. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

society. But the church and the state are still in a tug-of-war
over just how much religious freedom should be allowed on the
island. While Cuba has released some political prisoners and has
granted visas for some foreign priests, the church remains closely
restricted by the state. We'll talk to church officials in Cuba and
in the United States to examine the events of the last year.

   SAVINGS _ U.S. Savings Bonds, an old-fashioned investment, have
gone electronic. Although they pay rates of return below most
private investments, millions have been purchased over the years
because of their simplicity as an investment and because of their
Uncle Sam-guaranteed safety. But for many would-be investors in the
past, there was a problem: How to buy Savings Bonds. They could buy
them through a bank or broker, or through payroll deduction at
work. But about 120 million Americans worked for companies without
payroll deduction for the bonds. Last month, the U.S. Treasury
initiated the EasySaver Plan for Savings Bonds, which allows
investors to buy the bonds by authorizing the agency to deduct a
set amount each month from their checking account to pay for them.

REAL ESTATE: IN PHILADELPHIA, CENTER CITY TOWERS GET NEW USES
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DAVID J. WALLACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Stimulated by a 1997 city tax abatement for
conversion of older commercial buildings, there has been a rise in
the renovation of downtown towers. About a dozen buildings have
taken advantage of the abatement, and when all completed they are
expected to add about 1,000 apartments to the city's inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Although most may turn out to be standard apartments leased to
users, some of the buildings are emerging entirely or in part as
extended-stay corporate apartments, a conversion approach that was
under way in response to market demand even before the abatement
was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Three towers have been renovated entirely for this type of
housing, which mainly serves relocated executives and employees
working on open-ended consulting projects. Two of them, former
office buildings at 1411 Walnut Street and 120 South 17th Street,
have been converted for leasing to companies in the business of
operating extended-stay apartments. They supply furnishings and
some household services and lease the apartments to corporations or
to individual tenants on a short-term basis.
</P>
<P>
   The third tower, a former apartment building at 222 Rittenhouse
Square, was bought by Korman Communities, a Philadelphia-based
owner, which renovated it and reopened it with 100 extended-stay
apartments. Because it had originally been an apartment house it
did not qualify for the tax abatement.
</P>
<P>
   These renovations created about 350 downtown apartments,
developers said. The Walnut Street and 17th Street projects are
expected to qualify for the tax abatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia has been a huge market for us and there was an
opportunity for us to take a large block of rooms downtown,'' said
Robert Philips, spokesman for Oakwood Corporate Housing, a Los
Angeles company that leases apartments and furnishes them for
tenants. ``Business travel and relocations are our biggest uses
there, compared with other cities. And our length of stay has been
increasing, particularly for financial companies that are moving
people around for six months at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Oakwood's clients is SmithKline Beecham, the
pharmaceutical company, which has its national headquarters here.
Others include financial companies addressing mergers or Year 2000
computer consulting in longer-term projects, Philips said. In some
cases, Oakwood and other companies lease vacant units in existing
apartment houses on an as-needed basis, furnishing them and paying
the owner a higher monthly rent than he could get on an annual
lease.
</P>
<P>
   The tax abatement allows developers to avoid for 10 years any
tax increase based on the higher value that results from
redevelopment. Modeled on a similar law crafted for lower
Manhattan, the abatement applies to any institutional or
nonresidential building that is more than 50 years old or has more
than two-thirds of its potentially residential space vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The abatement, which expires in 2002, requires property owners
to apply for it within 60 days after getting a building permit for
the reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Dranoff, a developer who championed the tax incentive and
is using it to develop standard apartments, said the ordinance was
vital to developers seeking financing. He is creating 152 rental
apartments at a former printing plant at 25th and Locust Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Dranoff said the additional rental income made available by
holding taxes to $60,000 a year for 10 years made it possible to
finance the $24-million project.
</P>
<P>
   No older office buildings had been sold in nearly five years
before the rush of transactions in late 1997 and last year, said
Neal Rodin, who heads a real estate development firm here. His
$16-million renovation of the former PNC Bank office building at
120 South 17th Street will yield 200 apartments, a new health club
and restaurant, scheduled to open in April.
</P>
<P>
   Rodin said he expected to sell the building to Club Quarters, a
New York operator of extended-stay apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-story office building at 1411 Walnut Street was purchased
by the Philadelphia Management Corp. for $2.8 million and converted
at a cost of $8.2 million to create rental apartments on the top
eight floors, said Ronald Caplan, president of the corporation.
Four of these floors have been leased to Oakwood for extended-stay
units, he said. The base floors will be used for stores and
offices.
</P>
<P>
   For the furnished extended-stay apartments, with services
included, operators typically get rents of $2,300 a month for a
one-bedroom unit to $3,300 for a two-bedroom. In standard
unfurnished apartments, with much lower operating costs, rents may
range from $825 for a one-bedroom to $1,500 for a two-bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Removing nearly one million square feet of Class B, or
secondary, office space has driven vacancy rates in that sector
down to 15 percent, said Jeff Seligsohn, president of
Seligsohn-Hess, which specializes in leasing and sales of older
buildings. And with choice buildings for restoration already gone,
he said, asking prices have risen as much as 50 percent on
remaining properties,
</P>
<P>
   ``Retail is slowly coming back downtown and it's getting more
exciting to be in Center City,'' Seligsohn said. ``The bargains are
gone. People are shopping for `good enough' because if they wait,
the few opportunities go quickly.'' Incentives by sellers to spur
sales are a thing of the past, he said, and prices are rising.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dranoff and other builders are now seeking a similar abatement
for new construction of residential towers. Demand for luxury
rental apartments here is strong enough that developers are
floating proposals after a decade-long absence of new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Rents for apartments in full-service buildings here rarely
exceed $2,000 a month. At 222 Rittenhouse Square, however, rents
range from $2,100 a month for a studio to $3,800 for a two-bedroom
unit, with housekeeping and concierge service. The renters are
usually relocating executives, participants in corporate training
programs, convention visitors and other clients, said Larry Korman,
executive vice president of Korman Communities, which operates 600
other extended-stay and hotel rooms and suites in downtown
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Korman, who declined to give the cost of renovating his
Rittenhouse Square building, said that the owners of buildings
devoted entirely to extended-stay apartments were keeping their
options open, watching the hotel and apartment vacancy rates. ``Now
there are lots of people who want to be in the city,'' he said.
``But we have flexibility and a hedge. If individual, as opposed to
corporate, rentals get hot, we can convert the building, or if a
hotel is needed we can go that way and get rezoning.''
</P>
<P>
   With lower operating costs because of limited housekeeping and
other services, extended-stay apartments are a fast-growing and
profitable industry, said Warren Marr, a lodging and hospitality
analyst at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Philadelphia. Most companies
restrict leases to a minimum of 30 days to avoid the higher
turnover business of convention or conference visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's hotels are experiencing annual occupancy rates
above 70 percent, and during high-demand weekends and special
events, there may be no rooms available downtown, Marr said. For
some large events, visitors are forced to stay in hotels as much as
a half hour's drive from the downtown Pennsylvania Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Yet extended-stay rooms account for only 3 percent of the
lodging-room inventory nationwide, according to a recent
PricewaterhouseCoopers report. As many as 300,000 rooms in the
category may be added nationwide, the report says, as demand for
lower-priced accommodations rises and the length of stay increases
for certain business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for downtown apartments means the long-ignored luxury
market for individuals is ready to expand, said Albert M.
Greenfield III, the third-generation of his family to develop real
estate in Philadelphia. He is renovating a 1922 office tower at
15th and Chestnut Streets into 162 apartments. Apartments in the
$30-million project at 1500 Chestnut, scheduled to open in March,
will range from $1,150 for a one-bedroom to $1,775 for a
two-bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teaching hospitals, conventions and corporate job growth
are all bringing people here,'' he said. ``But there are still
fewer than 1,000 new apartment units being created by all this
activity. More supply won't hurt the market. It will generate more
business and prices will rise.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHEN FORMER AUDITORS HELP COMMIT FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were going to commit a crime, wouldn't it be nice to have
the former chief of detectives from the local police on your staff?
</P>
<P>
   In the white-collar world of accounting fraud, that happens all
too often. A former auditor of the company's books turns out to be
the person preparing the phony accounts.
</P>
<P>
   When criminal charges were filed in the case of Livent Inc. last
week, the headlines went to the 16 counts against Garth Drabinsky
and Myron Gottlieb, the co-founders of the theater company that
brought ``Ragtime'' to New York. They deny the charges that they
orchestrated a fraud that cost investors millions.
</P>
<P>
   But the more interesting defendant may be Maria Messina, 36, who
pleaded guilty to one count of filing false financial statements
with the Securities and Exchange Commission when she was Livent's
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to Livent, Ms. Messina was the partner in charge of
auditing Livent's books for Deloitte &AMP; Touche, which for years
failed to notice what the government now says was a massive
accounting fraud aimed at making Livent look like something other
than the money-losing operation it was.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Ms. Messina was not aware of any fraud before
she worked at Livent. Some time elapsed before she committed the
crime she now has admitted, but the SEC claims she became a willing
participant. Having a top officer who knew how Deloitte worked, and
what its auditors were looking for, no doubt made it easier for the
company to keep auditors from finding evidence of any fraud. She
also had credibility with former colleagues when questions arose,
which may have been used to reassure them if something suspicious
was noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The revolving door is a problem even when there is no fraud.
Accounting issues are not always black and white, and auditing
firms frequently must decide when a client has pushed the rules so
far that it has gone over the line. Auditors say privately it is
harder to do that when the company is represented by a former
partner of the auditing firm _ one who perhaps used to supervise
the partner now running the audit.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of revolving-door accountants has been around for
years, but the accounting industry has not dealt with it. Now,
under pressure from the SEC, the issue is on the agenda of the
profession's Independence Standards Board.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the industry hope little will be done, with firms just
warned to be careful in such cases. Some in the SEC would like a
more radical change, requiring a company to switch auditing firms
if a partner makes such a move. That idea horrifies many in the
profession. Auditing firms do not want to lose clients, and
partners fear it would make it more difficult to get jobs when they
want to leave. It would, they say, hurt everyone because of a few
bad apples.
</P>
<P>
   This decision will be the first major test of the Independence
Standards Board, which was formed in 1997. At a minimum, the board
should require that when the accounting doors revolve, everyone
connected with the old audit must be swept out. If the auditing
firm keeps the client, all those who worked with the departed
auditor should be taken off the new audit and replaced by others.
In some cases, firms would have to bring in staff from other
offices, perhaps at great expense. But to do otherwise is to risk
the firm appearing not to be independent. Both the appearance and
the reality of independence are vital to our financial system, in
which investors depend on independent auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors should not be alone, of course. They should have allies
on the audit committees of company boards. But there are no
guarantees. The SEC says the former chairman of Livent's audit
committee took part in one of the transactions the commission
believes were fraudulent.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous storm system will pound the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday as a persistent onshore flow continues across the region.
Heavy rain will fall in coastal areas from Washington to northern
California, with rainfall amounts of more than 2 inches possible in
some spots. The additional rainfall will only act to worsen
existing flooding problems brought on by recent rains. Up to a foot
on snow will fall in the Cascades, with snow levels lowering to
near 3,000 feet by afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will also fall in the northern Rockies from Montana to Utah
while scattered rain showers occur in the valleys of eastern
Washington and Oregon and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will grace the Great Plains from central Texas to the
western Dakotas as brisk breezes from the west are forced to
descend the sloping terrain. It will be very mild, with many areas
experiencing readings as much as fifteen degrees above average.
</P>
<P>
   Developing low pressure will spread a mixture of precipitation
across the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys. Patches of wet snow will
occur from central Iowa and southern Minnesota to central
Wisconsin. A few inches of snow accumulation are likely. Rain
showers are expected from central Michigan southward. A
thunderstorm is even possible near the Gulf coast, where a powerful
jet stream disturbance aids in lifting the warm air over the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, partly sunny skies are expected in the Piedmont of
the Appalachians. Areas near the East Coast will experience bright
sunshine, where retreating high pressure will provide mild readings
and breezes from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Siege Ends &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The siege of wintry weather has temporarily ended in Chicago. At
2 a.m. Saturday, the mercury reached 32 degrees for the first time
in 1999 at O'Hare airport. Temperatures had been below freezing
since December 29, a period of 18 days. The longest period below
freezing in Chicago occurred in 1977, when 43 consecutive days had
sub-freezing readings. The current thaw will continue through much
of this coming week as a series of Pacific air masses bring more
seasonable conditions. There could be some wet snow Sunday night,
but the milder weather should help reduce the snowpack. &QL;

THOMAS BINFORD, WHO LED INDIANAPOLIS 500 THROUGH CRISES, DIES AT
74  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ind.)   By JOSEPH SIANO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas W. Binford, an Indianapolis businessman who was a
co-founder of that city's Urban League and who helped steer the
Indianapolis 500 through two crises, died on Thursday in
Indianapolis. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage. Binford was stricken on
Wednesday at the downtown Indianapolis office of Binford and
Associates, his management consulting firm, and taken to Methodist
Hospital, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Binford, an Indianapolis native, was one of the city's leaders
in civil rights, education and downtown development. As chairman of
Indiana National Bank, which was purchased in 1992 by NBD Bancorp
of Detroit, he saw it through a rocky period in the mid-1970s
caused by failed real-estate loans.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the director or chairman of numerous companies,
including the Indianapolis Power and Light Company, Boehringer
Mannheim and the Indianapolis Water Company.
</P>
<P>
   After helping to establish the Urban League of Indianapolis in
1965, he was its chairman from 1967 to 1969 and from 1975 to 1977.
In 1975-76, he was the acting president of DePauw University.
</P>
<P>
   Binford will probably be remembered outside Indiana for his
involvement in that state's most renowned sports event, the
Indianapolis 500. From 1956 to 1969, he was president of the United
States Auto Club, the Indianapolis 500's sanctioning body until
1998. He was also chief steward of the race from 1974 to 1995. In
each role, he led efforts that helped keep the race going.
</P>
<P>
   After an accident during the 1955 24-hour sports car race in Le
Mans, France, which killed more than 100 spectators, the American
Automobile Association decided to end its role as overseer of auto
racing competition in the United States. The pullout left the
Indianapolis 500 with no sanctioning group to set the rules and see
that they were enforced. To fill that void, the United States Auto
Club was formed, with Binford as one of its founders.
</P>
<P>
   Binford was called back to the Indianapolis 500 after the
chaotic, rain-delayed 1973 race, which included crashes that killed
two drivers and a crew member and injured 11 spectators. Public
sentiment ran strongly against the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,
with some newspaper editorials questioning whether the track should
be shut down. The blame fell upon the chief steward, Harlan
Fengler, although the speedway itself had safety shortcomings
outside his control. Six days before the 1974 race, Binford was
chosen to replace Fengler.
</P>
<P>
   A repeat of the 1973 calamity anytime soon after could have
severely damaged the race's future. But Binford made procedural
changes that, along with upgrades to the track itself, eased safety
concerns. He did not hesitate to make decisions that might cause an
uproar, as two episodes demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the 1981 race, Binford penalized the apparent
winner, Bobby Unser, one lap for an illegal pass, a ruling that
gave the victory to Mario Andretti. It would have been the only
time since the race began in 1911 that an apparent winner had his
victory taken away. But in October of that year, Binford's ruling
was overturned on appeal, and Unser was reinstated as the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't hard to call,'' Binford said later of the penalty,
``except you knew the minute you called it you were in for a lot of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final race as chief steward in 1995, Binford gave a black
flag to the leader, Scott Goodyear, with a handful of laps
remaining after Goodyear passed the pace car too soon. That gave
the victory to Jacques Villeneuve and brought bitter criticism from
Goodyear. Videotape replays supported the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Binford is survived by his wife, Kai; a son, Wilson C. Binford
of Zionsville, Ind.; a daughter, Florence W. Kichler of Carmel,
Ind.; a stepdaughter, Linda Kai Miller; a stepson, Bryan Irwin, and
a sister, Virginia Binford Turner.  &QL;

FARCE OR A FIGHT? IT'S TYSON-BOTHA
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Some people who follow boxing believe that the
heavyweight boxing bout between Mike Tyson and Francois Botha at
the MGM Grand on Saturday night is nothing more than a carnival
sideshow. They think that many of those who tune in on the
pay-per-view telecast will do so only to see if Tyson will snap
again and commit an even more flagrant foul than he did in his last
bout against Evander Holyfield on June 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In that bout, Tyson bit both of Holyfield's ears, was
disqualified and subsequently had his boxing license revoked. It
was reinstated by the Nevada State Athletic Commission on Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Only the outcome of Tyson-Botha will determine whether it is a
farce. But what is the impact of the bout on the heavyweight boxing
picture?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to have any effect on the heavyweight
division,'' said Lou DiBella, senior vice president of programming
for HBO/TVKO.
</P>
<P>
   DiBella's view may be clouded by the fact that his network has
the pay-per-view for the heavyweight championship unification bout
between Holyfield and Lennox Lewis scheduled for March 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what's going to happen after Holyfield and
Lewis,'' said the veteran trainer Lou Duva. ``There's going to be
an opening there for someone to take advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has said if he wins the undisputed championship, he'll
be satisfied. But recently he has said that he is willing to fight
Tyson in a third bout if the price is right. However, in light of
the Holyfield-Lewis unification bout Tyson-Botha is merely an
exercise for Tyson to regain his viability in the division. It
could be a long climb.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tyson's next bout might not have any effect on the
heavyweight division. If Tyson beats Botha, the plan is for him to
fight either Brian Nielsen, Vaughn Bean, who went the distant with
Holyfield before losing a unanimous decision last September, or
Axel Schulz, whom Botha defeated for the International Boxing
Federation championship in 1995. Botha was later stripped of that
title because he tested positive for steroids after the bout.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime, which will broadcast the Tyson-Botha bout on its
pay-per-view arm, Showtime Entertainment Television, has signed
Tyson to a four-fight deal. They are hoping that he displays some
of the explosiveness that made him one of the top grossing
pay-per-view attractions in television. Tyson-Holyfield II drew 1.9
million buyers, a pay-per-view record. Tyson has been involved in
the top four all-time pay-per-view events.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Greenberg, executive vice president of Showtime, believes
that a great performance against Botha can catapult Tyson back into
the heavyweight mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson needs to demonstrate that he's fit to fight again,''
Greenberg said. ``If he demonstrates that he's the Mike Tyson of
old, he's at the top of the list again.''
</P>
<P>
   And what will Tyson have to show in order for Greenberg to
determine whether he is the Tyson of old?
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mike looks sharp, if he is in control of the fight in the
ring, if he is connecting with a high percentage of his punches,
then I think that will show that he's back,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Holyfield-Lewis unification bout, it will be a while
before Tyson gets a chance to fight for the title, particularly if
Lewis wins. There will be mandatory bouts lined up for the winner
of the unification bout. Although stranger things have happened, it
seems unlikely that any of the boxing organizations would make
Tyson a No. 1 contender at the expense of those boxers who are
already there after only one fight against an opponent like Botha.
But money changes everything in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the younger heavyweights are crowded at the top of the
list and many will be in action during the first three months of
the year. But there will always be room for Tyson. Tyson's handlers
will be very careful who they put him in against, which means he
won't be fighting any of the noteworthy young heavyweights anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson loses to Botha, then Botha will figure into the mix.
But not nearly as prominently as Tyson. Botha was the IBF's No. 1
contender, before he opted to fight Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   A loss would not completely sink Tyson in the division.
Greenberg believes a Tyson-Holyfield III is viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our research,'' Greenberg said, ``we've determined that
people would like to see that fight again, because they didn't get
to see the fight they wanted to see.''

KORDA WILL PLAY IN THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN TO DISMAY OF PLAYERS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Czech Republic, Switzerland, England)   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ There will be no player boycott of the
Australian Open over an appeals committee's decision to rescind
Petr Korda's one-year ban for testing positive for the steroid
nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   The players who traveled to Melbourne to compete in the year's
first Grand Slam event will compete. But after a mandatory ATP Tour
meeting Saturday in which tennis' drug-testing procedures were
debated at length, not all of Korda's peers were pleased that Korda
will defend his first and only Grand Slam singles title.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the circumstances, Petr is going to play,'' said
Jim Courier, the Floridian and former No. 1 player in the world.
``Am I happy about it? No. I think it reflects poorly on us and our
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Alex O'Brien said, ``I feel if Korda can't explain
how this got in his body, he shouldn't be playing. I feel there are
a lot of players taking advantage of the system. I can't prove
that, but I think there needs to be a strong message sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Korda, the 30-year-old Czech now ranked 21st, attended the
meeting, an annual gathering that was scheduled long before his
positive test was announced in December. But Korda chose not to
address the group. When Korda later left the room flanked by three
security guards, he walked through a large gathering of reporters
and television crews without commenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the players in that room understand that this
case is still in litigation,'' said Mark Miles, the chief executive
officer of the ATP Tour, who made it clear that the player was not
required or expected to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Martin, the president of the player council, said, ``It
would be terribly unfair if Peter is not allowed to play and in the
end he's innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Korda's case is still in the courts because the International
Tennis Federation has asked the Court of Arbitration for Sport in
Lausanne to overturn the ruling of an independent appeals committee
appointed by the ITF That committee ruled on Dec. 22 that the
one-year ban for players who test positive for Class One substances
should not be applied because ``exceptional circumstances'' existed
in Korda's case. Instead, it reduced the penalty to loss of ranking
points and prize money at Wimbledon, the tournament where Korda
tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   Korda and his lawyers are attempting to block the ITF's appeal
in England's High Court, arguing that the ITF has no grounds to
appeal an appeals committee. If the High Court rules in Korda's
favor, the case ends there. If the High Court rules for the ITF,
the Lausanne court must render a decision by no later than May 8.
</P>
<P>
   According to Miles, the court of arbitration likes drug programs
to be able ``to consider circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the need to allow for exceptional circumstances, which
Miles said could include sabotage of a players' drug sample or the
administering of banned substances without the players' knowledge
during a emergency medical procedure. Neither of those things
happened to Korda. In its ruling, made public earlier this month,
the appeals committee agreed that Korda ``was guilty of a doping
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee reduced Korda's punishment because, in its words,
``each of us found Korda to be an honest, open and reliable
witness.'' The committee also wrote that it was swayed by the fact
that ``Korda had no prior or subsequent positive tests and by the
testimony about Korda's character from player Boris Becker and
Korda's former coach Tony Pickard.'' &QL;

 NEW JERSEY'S GOVERNOR HOPES TO PUT REBATE CHECKS IN THE MAIL 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>

   TRENTON, N.J. _ When Christine Todd Whitman was trying to decide
between seeking an income tax cut or property tax relief during her
1993 gubernatorial campaign, her top political advisers said
lowering property taxes would earn the most points with voters.
</P>
<P>
   But her economic advisers, including her childhood friend, the
publisher Steve Forbes, pushed for the income tax cut, arguing that
it would best help the state recover the jobs lost to the
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman's plan for a 30 percent income tax cut helped her
win the election that year and made her the darling of the national
Republican Party. But her decision not to provide direct property
tax relief during her first term angered enough voters that she
nearly lost her re-election bid four years later.
</P>
<P>
   By proposing last week to use $1 billion from the state budget
to reduce local property taxes over the next five years, Mrs.
Whitman said she had now addressed voter concerns well enough that
she might just ask for a recount. Yet, she said, she has no regrets
about adopting the income tax cuts first and waiting to propose the
more politically popular property tax relief plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly would have made my life easier 18 months ago,''
she said in an interview at her State House office. ``But the time
is right now. It is because of what we have done over the last five
years that we are in a position to do something more. The economy
is doing well. The state is doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Mrs. Whitman proposed cutting New Jersey's
income tax rates in 1993, supporters and critics have debated the
role that tax cuts play in stimulating the state's economy. The
governor herself concedes that the booming national economy played
a major role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, the national recovery helps,'' Mrs. Whitman said.
``There is no question about that. I would be the last person to
ignore that or claim that it did not have a role. But what you have
to look at is the relative positions of the states, and that their
internal policies and tax policies make the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that by June 1997, New Jersey had recovered all
the jobs lost in the recession, something New York did not achieve
until a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Economists agree that Mrs. Whitman's tax cuts, including reduced
corporate taxes, reinforced her message that New Jersey was ``open
for business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that New Jersey has led the region in terms of job
growth and recovery,'' said John L. Wieting, regional commissioner
for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. ``The reasons are
multiple and varied. It is very difficult to separate out the
factors that contribute to growth. But something like tax cuts
would give a perception that it is a friendly place to do
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Seneca, chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic
Advisers and a vice president of Rutgers University, said that all
economic indicators, from personal income growth to retail sales,
have been up in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to disentangle the causes of the state's
strong economic performance,'' he said. ``But there is no question
that the improvement in the business climate, broadly defined, has
been a significant, positive factor in the strength of our economy.
The income tax cuts were an important component of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Shure, a former top aide to Gov. Jim Florio who now runs a
public policy group, New Jersey Policy Perspective, takes a
different view. He said the national economic boom was coming to
the state, regardless of New Jersey's income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she cut the income tax, she fixed the one tax that wasn't
broken,'' Shure said. ``That helped the politician's image as a tax
cutter, but the income tax in New Jersey was never so high that
cutting it would have had any large economic impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Shure said that Mrs. Whitman should have addressed the state's
heavy reliance on property taxes for local school costs. The state
now pays a little more than 40 percent of the cost of public
education. The national average is 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is the approach that Florio adopted. He raised state taxes
by $2.8 billion, poured money into local schools, and found himself
in the midst of a taxpayer revolt. Property taxes remained low for
a couple of years, but then they began to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dire predictions from Democrats that Mrs. Whitman's
income tax cuts would lead to skyrocketing property tax increases
because fewer state dollars were going to cities, towns and
schools, property tax collections statewide have slowed in the last
few years. Even so, the average property tax bill in New Jersey is
$4,000, the highest in the nation. There are many contributing
factors, including the longstanding tradition of home rule: 566
municipalities, 611 school districts, 21 counties and 188 fire
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman said she decided to send rebate checks directly to
homeowners rather than to dole out extra state dollars to local
governments because she wants to keep pressure on them to reduce
their costs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To pay for her income tax cuts during her first term, Mrs.
Whitman used several fiscal maneuvers, like a massive pension
borrowing program, which raised questions among some Wall Street
analysts and conservatives about the state's fiscal management.
</P>
<P>
   But New Jersey, like many other states, is now flush with cash
from the booming economy. The state is expected to end the fiscal
year on June 30 with a budget surplus exceeding $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   So both state officials and Wall Street analysts say that the
Whitman administration can probably afford to pick up the cost of
the property tax rebate checks in the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But the size of the program raises questions about whether the
next governor and future state legislatures would be able to afford
it. Mrs. Whitman's second term ends in 2002, two years before the
five-year program is to be fully implemented at a cost of $1
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mrs. Whitman's proposal, which is similar to the Pataki
administration's property tax rebate program in New York, the
average check to 1.9 million homeowners would be $600 a year,
beginning in 2004. The plan would also provide tenants with an
average check amounting to $100. There are no income limits. In New
York, homeowners do not get rebate checks; they get a credit on
their property tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman promises that if the Legislature approves the plan
by April 15, she will send out the first checks by Labor Day. This
year the average check would be $120, 20 percent of what a
homeowner would get once the plan is fully phased in. The amount of
the rebate checks would increase by 20 percent each year until
2004. The amount of local school taxes paid determines the size of
the rebate checks.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the state budget begins at about $200 million in the
coming fiscal year. It climbs by $200 million each year until it
reaches the full cost of $1 billion annually by 2004, about 5.5
percent of the state's total budget.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns about paying for the plan in future years,
Democrats and Republican lawmakers are expected to adopt it.
</P>
<P>
   Economic analysts seem to approve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the economy, and the structure of the tax system, they
are generating pretty large surpluses,'' said Timothy Blake, vice
president of Moody's Investors Service. ``They seem to be disposing
of the surpluses prudently. We changed our outlook from negative to
stable in September 1998 and that was in reflection of the fact
that structural balance has improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman said she did not think future lawmakers and
governors would consider eliminating the rebate checks. ``I believe
that this is going to be a priority for state government because it
is going to be a priority for the people,'' she said.

year the average check would be $120, 20 percent of what a
homeowner would get once the plan is fully phased in. The amount of
the rebate checks would increase by 20 percent each year until
2004. The amount of local school taxes paid determines the size of
the rebate checks.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the state budget begins at about $200 million in the
coming fiscal year. It climbs by $200 million each year until it
reaches the full cost of $1 billion annually by 2004, about 5.5
percent of the state's total budget.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns about paying for the plan in future years,
Democrats and Republican lawmakers are expected to adopt it.
</P>
<P>
   Economic analysts seem to approve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the economy, and the structure of the tax system, they
are generating pretty large surpluses,'' said Timothy Blake, vice
president of Moody's Investors Service. ``They seem to be disposing
of the surpluses prudently. We changed our outlook from negative to
stable in September 1998 and that was in reflection of the fact
that structural balance has improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman said she did not think future lawmakers and
governors would consider eliminating the rebate checks. ``I believe
that this is going to be a priority for state government because it
is going to be a priority for the people,'' she said.

FARM SILOS HOUSE CELLULAR TOWERS, HELPING THEM BLEND IN WITH
SURROUNDINGS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSFORD, N.Y. _ Larry Knickerbocker's favorite place in his
sprawling farmhouse here is the porch. There he can look over the
sloping hillsides onto the fields that he and his brother farm, as
their family has done for five generations before them.
</P>
<P>
   He loves the view not only for what it offers, but for what it
does not _ the images of modern suburban life that have crept onto
the landscape most every place else.
</P>
<P>
   That is why he readily agreed when Sprint, the telephone
company, asked if it could replace one of his empty silos with a
fake silo that would conceal a cellular tower. ``The towers can be
ugly,'' he said. ``I wouldn't want it out on one of the fields.''
</P>
<P>
   About 60,000 cellular towers are in place across the country,
and industry experts say recent developments in digital technology
_ which require shorter towers placed closer together _ will double
that number over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular companies build the vast majority of their towers so
they blend into the urban landscape, on rooftops and water towers,
said Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association, an industry organization
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside, though, camouflage has been more difficult.
Cellular equipment has been placed inside flagpoles, clock towers
and church steeples, even though such disguises can be quite
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the problem, the cellular organization recently
spent $10,000 to study the best ways to incorporate cellular towers
into historic structures, including silos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a necessity, because they see neighbors will fight
them,'' said Alan Knauf, an environmental lawyer from nearby
Rochester who frequently represents residents in disputes with
cellular phone companies. ``People have their life savings invested
in their houses, and when someone wants to build a monstrosity next
to it, residents tend to object.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is one of four cellular phone companies serving upstate
New York. Two more are expected to set up shop in the next 10
years. That could mean an additional 50 to 100 towers. Of those,
perhaps 5 to 10 will be built in silos, said Ben Campanelli, a
consultant in Rochester who helps companies find locations for
towers.
</P>
<P>
   Campanelli estimated that it can cost as much as $150,000 to
replace a wood silo with a concrete one appropriate for cellular
transmissions. The wood silos need to be torn down because the
metal used in their construction, nails and the like, interferes
with cellular phone frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester area has at least one other cellular tower in a
silo, in the town of Mendon. It was built by Frontier Cellular in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't mind it that much,'' said Anne Martin, whose
home is near the tower. ``It's taller than what a silo would
normally be, but otherwise, it looks just like a silo.''
</P>
<P>
   Landowners are generally paid $400 or more per month to lease
their property for cellular towers, Campanelli said, adding that
the companies can usually find a taker. But the community may
resist.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sprint sued the nearby town of Ontario after planners
refused to approve three 150-foot towers in rural setting. Town
planners suggested a compromise, a single 250-foot tower in an
industrial area, but the company rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Michael A. Telesca of U.S. District Court in Rochester
ruled in favor of the town, saying it had the right to exert some
control, but Sprint has appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular companies often win when they take a tower dispute to
court, industry experts said. But companies do not want legal
battles any more than towns do. ``No one wants a tower, but
everyone wants the service,'' said Dana Bell, a Sprint spokesman.
``It's in everyone's best interest to use an existing structure
when it's available.''
</P>
<P>
   Knickerbocker _ who owns a cellular phone and knows reception
can be spotty _ said he would have refused if he had been asked to
put the tower outside the silo.
</P>
<P>
   He said his main motive in letting Sprint use his land was not
the monthly payments. His silos are empty and have been since his
family shifted in 1971 from dairy farming to more lucrative crop
farming. His view is intact. His son, now 3, is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he farms the land, he'll be the seventh generation,'' he
said. ``I want to keep it the same for him.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the duel over impeachment witnesses intensified,
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, has suggested to
Democrats that a bipartisan group of senators deal with the issue,
but the Democratic leader rebuffed his offer and called it
premature.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by several Senate Republicans who are concerned about
the near party-line split over witnesses, Lott sent a letter to
Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., the Democratic leader, on Friday
evening, in the hope of reviving bipartisan discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe that a bipartisan group of senators could
anticipate and help resolve in advance any complications that may
be presented by our hearing the testimony of witnesses,'' Lott
wrote. ``Forming a bipartisan group to consider witness issues now
may save us time and trouble in the days ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daschle turned Lott down. He said that any discussion of
witnesses would be premature if it occurred before the full Senate
takes a vote later this month to decide which, if any, witnesses to
depose. He said those talks ``would violate the bipartisan
agreement that now governs our process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope that such arrangements will ultimately prove
unnecessary,'' Daschle wrote, ``regarding the many complicated
issues that will result if the Senate votes to call witnesses in
the impeachment proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   In a war of words that is beginning to echo the verbal crossfire
in the House, some Democrats say they are growing increasingly
convinced that Senate Republicans want to call witnesses simply to
embarrass President Clinton and draw out the trial. Republicans
counter that they must take seriously their mandate as jurors and
judges, and that means trying to clarify conflicting testimony and
unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman James Kennedy said Saturday that the House
prosecutors' insistence on calling witnesses ``illustrates their
lack of confidence in their circumstantial case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who demand witnesses are demanding delay and we don't
think a long and drawn-out trial is in the interest of the
Congress, the president and the American people,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's exchange of letters was only the latest partisan volley
in the debate over the trial's second phase: whether the Senate
needs to hear from Monica Lewinsky; Betty Currie, Clinton's
secretary, and Vernon Jordan Jr., his friend, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last week, Daschle expressed anger and surprise when he
learned that three Republicans had met secretly with House
prosecutors to discuss witnesses. Republicans invited Democrats to
attend the second meeting, but Daschle declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to take a vote on whether to take
depositions from witnesses once the White House completes its
presentation and senators query both sides. If 51 senators vote to
move forward with the depositions, votes would be taken at some
point on which, if any, witnesses to summon before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican prosecutors argued forcefully and repeatedly
during their presentations last week that the Senate must hear from
witnesses in order to deliver an informed verdict.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who chairs the House
Judiciary Committee, said bluntly that getting witnesses to appear
before the Senate is ``our purpose. We try.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The strategy has worked, at least for now. Many Republicans,
even those who were disinclined to hear from witnesses just last
week, have said the prosecutors' arguments persuaded them to change
their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a sense of inevitability,'' said Sen. Connie
Mack, R-Fla., a party leader. ``There are more and more people who
believe we will end up with witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., another Republican leader, put
pressure on the White House Saturday, raising the possibility that
if Clinton were to acknowledge some of the allegations presented by
House prosecutors, the Senate may not have to summon witnesses at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made a rather strong case on that point,'' McConnell
said, referring to the House push for witnesses. ``Maybe the
president will stipulate to the facts and it won't be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House is not likely to bend on the question of
stipulations. ``We already have stipulated to the record and, as we
will demonstrate next week, the House managers have ignored and
misstated many of the relevant facts contained in that record,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats stood firm Saturday on the point of witnesses.
Many of them said Daschle was right to turn down Lott's suggestion.
``It's too late,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli argued that a ``critical moment'' will come when the
Senate decides whether to dismiss the case, a vote that is
anticipated on Jan. 25. The vote requires a simple majority, and
will likely fail, but Democrats are painting it as a decisive
factor in the trial's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is clear that significantly more than 34 Senators
support dismissing the case, then the dynamics are altered,''
Torricelli said. ``Because then it becomes a question of what value
these witnesses would provide if more than one third of the Senate
believes the case should be dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., who was one of the three Republicans who
met with House prosecutors, also said he saw no need to resume
bipartisan discussions on the question of witnesses until after the
first series of votes. ``It's fine to wait until the decision is
made on whether there are witnesses, and then we can get together
at that time,'' Kyl said.

HOUSE PROSECUTORS REMIND SENATE OF JUDGES WHO WERE IMPEACHED FOR
LYING

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House managers Saturday implored the Senate to
hold President Clinton to the same standard that it used in 1989 to
remove two federal judges from office for lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Three House managers drew a parallel between the accusation that
Clinton lied before the grand jury about his relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky and the Senate's perjury convictions of Judge
Walter L. Nixon Jr. of Mississippi and Judge Alcee L. Hastings of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors reminded the senators that Nixon was convicted
because of a ``single, discreet false statement before a grand
jury,'' as Sen. Herb Kohl, a Democrat from Wisconsin , said in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the president's lawyers' arguments next week
that Clinton should not be removed from office, the prosecutors
repeatedly challenged the senators who had voted a decade ago to
convict Nixon and Hastings to apply the same standards when they
judged Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate should not establish a lower standard for integrity
for the president than the standard it has already established for
federal judges,'' Rep. Charles T. Canady, a Republican from
Florida, said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' message clearly was intended for the Democrats
who voted to remove both Nixon and Hastings. They include Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts, John B. Breaux
of Louisiana, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   When he was removed from office, Nixon was in prison, serving a
five-year term. He had been convicted of lying to a grand jury when
he denied that he had influenced a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy oil man, Wiley Fairchild, had asked Nixon to intervene
in a drug case against Fairchild's son. The judge persuaded the
prosecutor, an old friend, to dismiss the charges. In an interview
with federal agents, Nixon denied that he had any involvement in
the case. He repeated those denials before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   After the conviction, on two counts of perjury, the House passed
three articles of impeachment, charging the judge with making false
and misleading statements to the grand jury and to federal agents.
In 1989, the Senate convicted Nixon of perjury on two articles
(with votes of 89 to 8 and 78 to 19).
</P>
<P>
   ``The question becomes,'' Rep. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina
told senators Saturday: ``If a federal judge can be thrown out of
office for lying and trying to fix a friend's son's case, can the
president of the United States be removed from office for trying to
fix his case? That's not a scholarly word, but that's what
happened. He tried to fix his case.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hastings was impeached and convicted, he already had been
acquitted by a jury in Miami of bribery charges. But the House
voted 413 to 3 to impeach Hastings in 1988, approving 17 articles
of impeachment. Fourteen of them accused Hastings of lying under
oath at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers' report on the Hastings matter said that
lying under oath is an impeachable offense. ``It is important to
realize that each instance of false testimony charged in the false
statement articles is more than enough reason to convict Hastings
and remove him from office,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 69 to 26 to convict and remove Hastings from
office. Hastings, 62, returned to the public stage, winning a seat
in the House of Representatives from Florida. A Democrat, he voted
last month against the four articles impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your
job in this constitutional republic if this body determines that
your conduct as a public official is clearly out of bounds in your
role,'' Rep. Graham argued.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prosecutors drew parallels between the convictions
of the federal judges and the article of impeachment alleging
perjury against Clinton, there are also some striking distinctions
that the president's lawyers are expected to draw next week.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cite a section of the Constitution that says federal
judges ``shall hold their offices during good behavior.'' But there
is no similar language about presidents. The cases against the
judges were related to misstatements under oath related to bribery
cases. The president's lawyers are expected to argue next week that
the allegations against Clinton involve a private affair and are
not analogous to the judges' cases.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After two days of storms dropped more than a foot of
snow across New York state, stranding travelers, knocking out power
and causing roofs to collapse, the weather settled into relative
calm Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 15th straight day, it snowed in Buffalo on Saturday
morning, a light dusting that pushed the city's total accumulation
this month to 60.5 inches. The one-month record is 68.4 inches, set
in December 1985. The 15-day streak could end Sunday, said Paul
Knight, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible it will be the first day without snow,'' Knight
said, adding that there is a chance of rain.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the temperature hit 29 degrees in Central Park
at 11 a.m. Saturday. It was colder than Friday morning, when the
temperature in the commuting hours hovered around 32 and the wind
pelted freezing rain at people venturing outside. Knight said the
forecast called for Sunday to be clear, with temperatures in the
40s and a chance of rain on Monday.

 &HT;    Rule changes not helping
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the NHL enters its All-Star break later this week,
league officials can feel comforted that rule changes implemented
before the season have not destroyed the fabric of the game. But
they haven't helped, either.
</P>
<P>
   Despite moving the nets farther from the end boards to create
more skating room, shrinking the neutral zone, shrinking the size
of the goal crease and placing new restrictions on the size of
goaltenders' pads and jerseys, teams are scoring at the same pace
as last year _ 5.3 goals per game through 500 games. When broken
down in 50-game segments, scoring steadily increased from 4.7 goals
in the first 50 games to 5.7 in games 150 to 200, seemingly an
indication that players were adjusting. But then, averages declined
again.
</P>
<P>
   League officials may have to start making Goaltenders Central
its marketing campaign: 32 currently had saves percentages of .900
or higher entering the weekend, five had goals-against averages
under 2.0 and 16 were at 2.5 or less. Conversely, only nine
forwards had reached the 20-goal plateau.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made those (goalie pads) smaller and the goalies are
even better now,'' Anaheim forward Teemu Selanne said. ``The
goaltending is just better now. It's a big challenge right now to
find the way to score. The style of the hockey has changed so much.
Most of the teams play so good defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell believes it's too early to
judge the affect of the rules changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the expectations were in terms of the
scoring, but I think the games are more entertaining,'' he said.
``When teams dump the puck in, not as many goaltenders can come out
to stop it for their teammate because the boards are too far away
now. So there's more action behind the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you make a rules change, you need to give it two or
three years before you can be objective about it. But there's no
question the goaltending is better now than 10 years ago, and
there's more depth at that position.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been some discussion about removing the center red
line, which would eliminate the offside (two-line) pass. There was
not red line at the recent World Juniors Championships in Winnipeg.
``I found the games really interesting that way,'' said Thrashers
assistant general manager Les Jackson. But many in the NHL consider
removing the center line as too radical a change.
</P>
<P>
   Other numbers from the first half of the season are more
encouraging:
</P>
<P>
   _ Attendance has been a problem in some cities, like Carolina
(where the Raleigh-based franchise is playing in Greensboro), Tampa
(which is struggling) and Long Island (where the New York Islanders
have suffered ownership problems). But overall attendance in the
league is running at 90.6 percent capacity. Crowds were at 88.3
percent capacity at this point last season.
</P>
<P>
   _ The two-referee system and crackdown on penalties behind the
play and hits to the head have been a success. League vice
president Colin Campbell has handed out 28 suspensions since the
exhibition season. That's one more than predecessor Brian Burke
handed out all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   The league did not make any significant gains during the NBA
lockout _ but it also avoided a marketing campaign intended to
capitalize on it. ESPN spokesperson Diane Lamb said NHL ratings on
ESPN and ESPN2 are running equal to last season.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL and some teams actually have been contacted by some NBA
officials regarding how hockey made the transition from its lockout
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the questions from basketball officials have pertained
to marketing. The NHL will not offer any advice on how to increase
scoring.

 &HT;    Young, Ganga benefited from business, IOC dealings
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In August 1990, a month before the International
Olympic Committee voted to award the '96 Summer Games to Atlanta,
Andrew Young traveled to the Republic of Congo to visit Jean-Claude
Ganga, his new friend.
</P>
<P>
   Young, an original member of Atlanta's Olympic bid committee,
didn't go empty-handed. He brought boxes full of athletic shorts
and shirts, soccer balls and basketballs. ''We took all the
athletic equipment we could beg from around here,'' Young recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It proved a worthwhile trip. Ganga, an IOC member and president
of the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa
(ANOCA), became a last-minute convert, withdrawing his support of
the Toronto bid and throwing it to Atlanta as host of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, Ganga is believed to be one of nine IOC
members facing possible expulsion for their dealings with the Salt
Lake City bid committee, which won the 2002 Winter Games. Several
news agencies have reported thatGanga made $60,000 in a Utah land
deal arranged by a member of the Salt Lake committee, has received
up to $70,000 in cash payments to help children in his homeland,
and obtained, along with his mother, free medical care. Ganga has
not addressed the specific allegations but has said he did nothing
illegal and will fight any attemt to oust him from the IOC. He
could not be reached for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Young said Friday his offerings to Ganga nearly a decade ago
were ``humanitarian aid,'' not bribes. Young recalls seeing
youngsters eating their food off leaves, running around in little
more than loincloths.
</P>
<P>
   Such sights spur Young to action. A former U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations and one-time Atlanta mayor, he says he's always
maintained a warm spot in his heart for the needy people of Africa.
As Atlanta readied for the 1996 Games, his generosity and energies
touched African athletes _ and officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta bid committee had left Young on his own to work
Africa, recognizing no one could do it better. (It wasn't until
late in the process that Melbourne or Toronto had minorities on
their bid teams.) Young visited Africa to develop international
business in his position with the firm Law Engineering and to sell
Atlanta as a city where African-Americans could prosper and hold
positions of power. If the trip generated support in IOC balloting,
all the better.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did what we do in local politics: We'd go to each (IOC)
voter personally, reach every voter we can, to try to make our
point because people do vote relationships,'' Young said. ``You
cannot buy votes. I mean, you cannot buy votes in a secret
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Payne, who led the bid group and later the Atlanta Olympic
committee, said: ''Andy, not bribery, is the reason we were
supported by the African continent. They saw in Atlanta a
black-white city that worked and made them proud.''
</P>
<P>
   At the IOC voting in September 1990, the Young-generated backing
from Africa is believed to have kept alive Atlanta's bid through
early rounds of voting until it eventually won.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (relationships) were very important because Africa had
been neglected,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Told by the president of Mozambique that its women marathoners
couldn't afford the proper foods to get enough protein in their
diet, Young returned to Atlanta and organized companies to send
foods and protein powder. He ultimately oversaw the shipment of 56
tons of food to 13 African nations _ after the IOC vote, Young
noted.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped set up a training center for African athletes in
LaGrange, Ga.; and he and his friends approached airlines for free
tickets to bring African athletes to Atlanta before the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his work unmistakably benefited Ganga.
</P>
<P>
   The Ganga-led ANOCA was allowed by the Atlanta Olympic committee
to market its own T-shirts and merchandise in Atlanta during the
Games, even though licensing practices that compete with official
sponsors are frowned upon by host organizers. A press release
announcing the deal credited Ganga with ``rallying African nations
to support Atlanta's bid to host the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1991, when Ganga requested equipment for his
association's office, printers, computers and other office supplies
were shipped to the Congo. The two printers came from the city of
Atlanta after it closed down its print shop. Young said the
shipments were lost or stolen in the Congo and never reached Ganga.
</P>
<P>
   Young understands why some might view this assistance in the
wrong light, but he casts it as just helping the needy. He preaches
that the Olympic movement should use more of its wealth on the less
fortunate. He operates under the premise that providing goods and
even cash shouldn't be frowned upon so long as it gets to people
who deserve it and there's accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga's friends in Atlanta include Shirley Franklin,
administrative chief during Young's term as mayor and later a
senior Atlanta Olympic official. She first met Ganga at the opening
of The House of Africa, a hospitality facility for the 1996 Games,
and later started a nonprofit business with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know him as a very influential leader among his peers in
Africa,'' Franklin said. ''I know him as a visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Olympic flame went dark in Atlanta, Franklin had
hatched plans to establish USA/Africa Sports Development Fund Inc.,
with the idea of raising corporate and other monies in the United
States to upgrade sports facilities in Africa, train coaches and
athletes, and help African athletes to attend U.S. colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Secretary of State records show the corporation was
registered as a domestic nonprofit June 13, 1997, identifying Ganga
as chief executive officer and Franklin as secretary. The
corporation lists an Atlanta address; Ganga provided an address in
Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've served as an unpaid consultant,'' Franklin said. ''I'm
not trying to make money on it, and I don't think they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin said the corporation is not up and running because the
Internal Revenue Service has not granted it tax-exempt status.
''There's no money or fund-raising yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   George Howell, who is handling the application, said the IRS has
asked the corporation to restructure the board of directors so its
majority is U.S. citizens. Young is currently the only American
director. Howell said the change will be made, but Ganga will be
retained.
</P>
<P>
   Howell said he hasn't heard from Ganga since last year on who he
wants on the board.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation will require ''millions of dollars'' to fund
what Ganga has in mind, Howell estimated. Sam Zamarripa is another
friend of Young who developed a relationship with Ganga. He was
employed by a telecommunications company that worked for Young's
unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign in 1990, and later contracted
to install a voice-mail system at the Atlanta Olympic headquarters.
Zamarripa was looking to strike up business deals with IOC members
he met in Atlanta. He went to the Congo at Ganga's invitation,
although the visit was fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were doing great things in building relationships with IOC
members to do business,'' Zamarripa said. ''I didn't have a bad
experience with Jean-Claude.''
</P>
<P>
   Young vows to stand by Ganga, who could be expelled from the IOC
in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jean-Claude Ganga is a friend, and I don't run out on my
friends when they're in trouble,'' Young said. ''I think
Jean-Claude Ganga is a man who genuinely loves people, loves sports
and loves the international community. But Jean-Claude Ganga's life
has been in turmoil because his country is in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the African National Olympic Committee, which he heads, to
produce as many athletes as they are producing...he is doing
something right. And he is getting little or no support from
anybody (within the IOC).''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less kind.
</P>
<P>
   In international sporting circles, Ganga, who lives most of the
time in Paris, is seen by some as seeking to take advantage of his
IOC status.
</P>
<P>
   Mal Whitfield, who spent 47 years in Africa as an official of
the U.S. Information Agency, said he helped arrange meetings in
Africa for the Atlanta bid team. A two-time Olympic gold medalist
in the 800 meters, Whitfield described Ganga as a ''leech.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hated to deal with him,'' Whitfield said. ''He wanted
scholarships from the American side. I'm on to this stuff. I don't
give bribes or do favors.''
</P>
<P>
   Young acknowledges that Ganga is an exceptional pitchman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll make you give out of your pocket,'' Young said,
``because he is so good.''

 &HT;    History of trying to gain favor of IOC now `implicity required'
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr. and Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the evenings before the big vote, the heavily laden
carts would begin rolling down the carpeted halls at Tokyo's New
Prince Takinawa Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The young Japanese porters would consult their lists, check the
room numbers and knock softly. When there was no answer, they would
enter the rooms with pass keys to place the offerings to await the
International Olympic Committee members who were residing there.
</P>
<P>
   The carts carried jewelry, handmade crystal knick-knacks, pewter
statuettes, kimonos and other more personalized items, like a rare
book for an IOC member who was a collector.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the 1990 vote to select a host city for the 1996
Centennial Games, some IOC members were joking that their rooms
looked like a cross between an airport duty-free store and a pawn
shop. Many left the trinkets behind when they checked out to return
to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, nearly nine years ago, the sheer excess of the
gift-giving _ let alone a few more unsavory allegations _ was
unsettling to some IOC members. There were calls for moderation,
even reform.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it has proven impossible _ or impractical _ for the IOC to
give up the heady delight of the bidding pageant, with its free
first-class travel, five-star hotels and endless supply of fine
goods and exotic novelties happily presented by willing cities
desperate to win their votes.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta was selected to stage the '96 Summer Games, the
idea of serving as host had become so attractive the six cities
seeking those Olympics spent at least $80 million campaigning for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta bidders said they spent far less than most _ about $7.4
million, primarily from private contributions _ and have always
argued that it was a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are so high that civic leaders who campaign for them
often must weigh the importance of winning against their own sense
of propriety, or at least good taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to trust your judgement and conscience,'' explained
Charlie Battle, a charter member of the volunteer Atlanta bid
committee and head of its international relations. ``Everything we
did I felt like was within the spirit of what was going on. That
was the world as we found it and we were playing by the rules. You
just hope they will think well of you, so they will vote for you.
But I will be the first to say the process needs to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Change may occur, beginning next weekend, when a six-man IOC
panel investigating allegations of bribery for votes that helped
earn Salt Lake City the 2002 Winter Games meets in Lausanne,
Switzerland. Thirteen IOC members accused of excessive gift-taking
are invited to plead their case before the commission Saturday, and
the board could recommend their expulsions along with reforming the
bid procedure next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The only goal of any bidding committee is to obtain a majority
of votes from the IOC, a self-perpetuating organization with 114
members. The IOC assembly has little if any official purpose other
than selecting host cities.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the campaigns tend to focus intensely on the
individual members and what it would take to curry their favor. It
is a targeted lobbying process, said Sir Bob Scott, who spent a
decade leading two unsuccessful bids for Manchester _ one of them
in competition with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You create this unbelievable intimacy with IOC members, which
meant that you got to know them, their hobbies, their passions,
their infidelities,'' Scott said. ``I used to put it in the terms
that you have to know the second daughter's shoe size. You did an
enormous amount of research, and having done all that research,
then the question was what did you do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you discovered that a man's passion was tennis, then you
made sure you found a way to invite him to go to Wimbledon with his
wife. And if he said, 'Can I bring my children with me?' then you
found a way around that, didn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Newton Thomas, one of seven paid staff members of
Atlanta's bid effort, was the international protocol expert. She
compiled dossiers on every voting member. ``We got to know them
personally. We took an interest in their families. Nothing warms
people up like asking about their children. We didn't just bring
them here and say, 'Vote for Atlanta.' ``
</P>
<P>
   And when an IOC member came to visit, his or her day was packed
with memorable experiences, from a tour of the venues accompanied
by a personal driver and hostess, to a private dinner in a Buckhead
or Dunwoody home. The visits were personalized to each IOC member's
passions. Outings to Augusta National for the golfing enthusiasts.
A visit with John Portman for the Mexican delegate who is an
architect. Nightclubbing in Midtown for Prince Albert of Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy's real interested in dog breeding, you take him to
see a dog breeding kennel,'' Battle said. ``If he's in charge of
telecommunications in his country and and wants to go see
BellSouth, you arrange to take him there and have them show him
some stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you measure what you do. I remember going
swimming in the Danube River when it was polluted and frozen, and
it was just because the granddaughter of the IOC member (from
Slovakia) wanted me to go swimming with her,'' Battle said. ``Oh
God, I thought I was going to die. But she was a nice girl and she
was my ticket to him. She spoke English.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Atlanta's bid came together in the late 1980s,
ambitious cities around the world were beginning to see hosting the
Olympics as a veritable panacea for civic needs. The Games are a
unique way to build stadiums, redevelop sagging neighborhoods and
accomplish countless other important projects. This was a
revelation from the 1984 Los Angeles Games.
</P>
<P>
   After the financial disaster of the 1976 Games in Montreal _
which generated $1 billion in debt _ there was genuine fear within
the IOC that no city would want to host the 1984 Games. Contingency
plans were drawn in case no one came forward.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a team from Atlanta in 1977 studied and dismissed the
idea of bidding as foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the basis of the Montreal experience, one might question
why any city would ever again seek to host the Olympic Games,'' a
Research Atlanta team wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Little changed the perception of the Games as a loser with the
debacle of the American boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games coupled
with the $11 million deficit left by the Winter Games in Lake
Placid, N.Y., that year.
</P>
<P>
   Only two cities informed the IOC they would bid for the 1984
Summer Games: Teheran and Los Angeles. Teheran eventually bowed
out, to the relief of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   In partnership with a weakened IOC, Los Angeles reinvented the
Games as a marketing event and generated a $235 million surplus.
More importantly, metro Los Angeles reported that the Games created
a $3.3 billion economic boost.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, bidding committees began springing up around the
globe. By 1987, three American cities were seriously pursuing the
'96 Games _ Minneapolis, San Francisco and a latecomer, Atlanta.
Their international competition was Athens, Toronto, Melbourne,
Manchester and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   As committed as they were to winning, the lawyers, volunteers
and city officials leading the bids tended to be unsophisticated
about the ways of the Olympic world. In short, it would be hard to
imagine an easier target if someone wanted to take advantage of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all dreadfully naive,'' said Scott of Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, members of bidding teams were approached by
Olympic insiders who said they could unlock the IOC's votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always told either genially or sinisterly by someone
that 'I can deliver x-votes for you, so you need to talk to me,' ``
Scott said. ``This is utter nonsense. I mean, how could any one
member of the IOC deliver another IOC member's vote in any
meaningful way?''
</P>
<P>
   Battle said he was never approached, but was aware ``these
so-called agents'' were sniffing around the bid cities. And there
was no doubt that some IOC members would use the bidder's eagerness
to please to their advantage. ``There's no doubt they try to get
opportunities, especially for their children,'' he said. ``I'm sure
that happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no malicious intent, no venal attempt to bribe
someone, as funny as that may sound. These are relationships and
you want to help people. You have a capacity to help them and you
do help them or their countries because they don't have anything.
You go over there and everyone is running around barefoot and poor,
and we think we ought to do something for these people and, yeah,
wouldn't it be great to educate some librarian in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to win the Games takes place primarily on two
fronts: visits to host cities by IOC members, and in the lobbies,
bars and suites at luxury hotels favored by the IOC for official
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   On the first front, bidding cities pick up the tab for IOC
members and a guest _ usually a spouse, but not always _ to travel
first class, stay in the finest hotel and experience the best a
city can offer in terms of food and entertainment. Unfortunately
for Atlanta, most of the IOC members didn't know where it was or
anything about it. Consequently, they weren't all that eager to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the bid cities at that time were working hard to get
the members just to come to their city,'' recalled Ginger Watkins,
a charter volunteer. ``It was not considered a junket by the IOC
members.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta bid committee was eager to entertain on its home
soil. ``The world didn't know a thing about Atlanta; they came
looking for gambling and Tara,'' Watkins said. ``We encouraged them
to please come and see our city because we knew they didn't have
the perspective we wanted them to have.'' When they came, Watkins
said, she scheduled every minute of their day with guided tours.
</P>
<P>
   At fine hotels where IOC members and reporters were put up,
bidding cities set up hospitality suites that were overflowing with
free liquor and canapes, and staffed by young, attractive and
ever-smiling volunteers. A sure-fire way to gain access to large
groups was hosting a dinner or lunch for IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Both practices have since been outlawed by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   At major meetings where dozens of IOC members attended, the
schtick here was to set up an ``Atlanta House,'' usually in a
private home near the center of official activity. It would be
staffed by volunteers and filled with Southern samplings, such as
Claxton fruit cakes and Vidalia onion relishes.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, who later became a top ACOG executive, organized the
Atlanta Houses. ``Everyone was drawn to the house and comfort of
going to someone's home and having a good time,'' she said. ``No
matter what culture you're from, your home is your most comfortable
place.''
</P>
<P>
   It's at these IOC meetings where the gift-giving gets out of
hand, Battle said. ``It gets to be comical. They end up with this
roomful of stuff. It's something you have to do out of a sense of
protocol. But there's so much gift-giving and there's so many
cities that you wonder how you are going to distinguish yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's why you end up doing things like scholarships
(for IOC members' children in American universities, which Salt
Lake City is accused of). Because you get into a syndrome of
searching for things you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of corruption were leveled almost immediately after
the IOC _ which always votes in secret _ picked Atlanta to host the
'96 Games. Representatives of five of the six bidding cities
traveled to Lausanne to review the process and discuss the
allegations. One city, for example, was suspected of stretching the
rules by handing out $3,000 diamond necklaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``(IOC President Juan Antonio) Samaranch used to say, 'Give me
evidence,' `` Scott said. ``For the top people at the IOC, nothing
would have suited them better than to have a ritual slaughter. They
begged for evidence, but none of us could produce any.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the ensuing years, allegations about the bidding process
would surface from time to time. In 1992, the German newsmagazine
Der Speigel reported that sources with the Melbourne and Athens
bidding committees had made a number of allegations about the
campaign for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said some IOC members met secretly at the King
David Hotel in Jerusalem to determine the price for their vote. The
meeting, the magazine said, was organized by an IOC delegate from
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said IOC members inspecting Atlanta were given gold
credit cards (which some retained for years); were offered free
heart surgery; took up to $120,000 in bribes (18 members); and
accepted large gifts (26 members).
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the IOC and Atlanta condemned the article as
groundless and irresponsible. Former Atlanta Olympics chief Billy
Payne threatened to sue for libel.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, the IOC official now investigating allegations
against Salt Lake City, at the time demanded proof of the
magazine's allegations, and when he didn't get it the committee
ceased to pursue the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it was becoming clear to many insiders that the
membership held some bad apples who were not above the kind of
behavior being alleged. Officially, the IOC said it would expel
anyone whose misdeeds could be verified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't like we just suddenly woke up now; we've been aware
of rumors for some time,'' said Michael Payne, the IOC marketing
director. ``Nobody was willing, or had the evidence and was
willing, to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the IOC has attempted to tighten the rules by
restricting visits to host cities to three days and limiting to
$150 the value of gifts offered to members. Still, the IOC today
finds itself embroiled in the biggest scandal in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake Olympic officials have admitted that six relatives of
IOC members were among those who benefited from nearly $400,000 in
scholarship aid from the bid committee. There is growing evidence
of other favors for IOC members, including free medical care and
gifts far in excess of the $150 limit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the IOC's own investigation, the allegations are
being probed by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   As a followup to next weekend's IOC ethics panel session in
Lausanne, all 114 IOC members will meet in mid-March to vote on
expelling members accused of corruption and possibly tightening
procedures for selecting host cities. It's the first time in its
105-year history that the committee has taken such drastic action.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal already has prompted Samaranch to suggest banning
visits by members to bidding cities, stripping the full IOC of the
vote and leaving the selection to the executive board or other
small ``electoral college.'' But some critics of the IOC and of
Samaranch believe this scandal could have been avoided if the
committee had reacted more decisively to past allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Helmick, the only IOC member ever to quit in an ethics
scandal, blames the current crisis on Samaranch, who he says failed
to pay enough attention when allegations of corruption first
surfaced a decade ago. He said Samaranch and other top IOC
officials ``in the know'' should resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very good people in the IOC, but the system has
gotten corrupt,'' Helmick said. ``I think what happened with Salt
Lake is that they were playing the game that the IOC implicitly
required.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott still believes that instances of bribery are rare. ``But
the accusation we could never get away from was that for the 2000
Games, maybe $80 million had been spent by the bidding cities,'' he
said. ``And where on earth did that benefit world sport?''

 &HT;    Commonly asked questions about Olympic crisis
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's been said that an International Olympic Committee member
has the world's greatest job, even though there is no salary. How
do I become a member? How long can I serve?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is no salary, but all travel expenses are paid.
Prospective members are nominated by IOC members when there's an
opening due to retirement, death or an expansion of the board. The
whole body votes on prospective members, and those who are approved
can serve until they turn 80.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the makeup of the IOC?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are 114 members. Not all Olympic countries are
represented. Countries that have hosted the Games usually have more
than one member.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there anybody or any body responsible for oversight of the
IOC?
</P>
<P>
   A: The IOC is governed by its executive board but there is no
outside oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the IOC subject to any laws?
</P>
<P>
   A: The organization is a nonprofit that is subject to the laws
any nonprofit must obey. In many countries, there are special laws
protecting the committee's marketing rights and exclusive rights to
stage the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were the Games always awarded to cities that offered gifts
and other goodies to IOC members?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Games always have been awarded to cities with the
majority of votes from IOC members. The gifts have long been part
of the campaign cities wage to lobby IOC voters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did the process evolve into the mess we're in today?
</P>
<P>
   A: Everything changed after the 1984 Los Angeles Games, which
were financially successful and made the Games attractive to cities
with lots of money to spend. There were concerns about excesses
with the bidding process in the contest for the 1988 Games, which
were awarded to Seoul, but the first widely reported allegations of
extravagant gift-giving and even bribery surfaced around the time
Atlanta was awarded the Games in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why has Atlanta been under suspicion in some areas?
</P>
<P>
   A: Perhaps because Atlanta won, and there are many people around
the world who can't accept that the city was chosen on its merits.
The city's connection to Coca-Cola _ the patron sponsor of the
Games _ also has raised questions. However, no one has provided any
evidence of wrongdoing with regard to the Atlanta bid, and Atlanta
officials insist they only gave IOC members relatively minor gifts
and small favors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do IOC members justify making repeated trips to bid
cities? Can't they pass judgment with fewer trips?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are supposed to make only one trip to each bidding city.
They argue _ and bidding cities agree _ that they can't fairly
judge a city's ability to host the Games without personal visits to
view the venues, speak to officials and get a first-hand sense of a
city. IOC members often lament that all cities look the same in the
slick brochures and video presentations they produce with their
bids. However, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said recently
the visits are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Much of the suspicion around Salt Lake, and perhaps Atlanta,
deals with an African bloc of votes. Is there such a thing?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's debatable. For one thing, no one knows how IOC members
vote because their ballots are secret. There is an assumption that
IOC members in some regions are motivated by similar factors and
therefore can be lobbied in a bloc. It has always been assumed that
Atlanta was appealing to Africans because of the city's standing as
a center for African-Americans in the United States. Former Mayor
Andrew Young, who co-chaired the bidding commitee with Billy Payne,
had deep ties in Africa, in part from his days as UN Ambassador
under President Carter. It has always been suspected, but never
proven, that the African IOC members favored Atlanta for the 1996
Games and provided the city its core of support.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is likely to result from the Salt Lake scandal?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's anybody's guess, but the most likely outcome is that the
IOC will ask the offending members to resign. It also is possible
that the organization will alter its host city selection procedure
and rules for bidding to minimize the chances of another scandal.
However, it is unlikely that the IOC will end the right of its
members to cast the final vote for host cities _ which is, for all
practical matters, the only function IOC members perform.

 &HT;    Defense Tech's top priority
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech appears to have addressed its defensive
concerns, particularly in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets have five commitments from defensive backs
and additional help coming from redshirt freshman Marvious Hester.
</P>
<P>
   Coach George O'Leary will have between 25-27 scholarships to
give on Feb. 3, National Signing Day, and they look as if they will
be able to recruit to fill all of their needs.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 other commitments include four offensive linemen, two
quarterbacks, three running backs, one linebacker, three defensive
linemen, two receivers and two kickers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Camp of Dublin, Ohio, was the state's player of the year
as a linebacker and quarterback. Running back Sidney Ford from
Pepperell was an Atlanta Journal-Constitution Super 11 player, and
running back Mike Kitchens of Lebanon, Pa., was a SuperPrep
All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Other top commitments include wide receiver Anthony Lawston, a
6-foot-4, 215-pounder from Baltimore who also was a SuperPrep
All-American, and Jeremy Muyres, who played free safety at
Parkview. Muyres is the younger brother of Tech wide receiver Jon
Muyres.
</P>
<P>
   Roderick Middleton, a 6-2 receiver from St. Stephens, S.C., is
the first cousin of quarterback Joe Hamilton, but is not related to
former record-setting receiver Harvey Middleton.
</P>
<P>
   Both Camp and Middleton are planning to enroll in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets think they have a good chance of landing quarterback
Willie Simmons (6-1, 190) of Quincy, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   They, however, are still looking for a fullback, a tight end and
an H-back type of player to help replace Charlie Rogers.

 &HT;    Middle Georgia players go Div. I
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Middle Georgia Junior College football coach Randy
Pittman couldn't have asked for much more success during his first
season. Middle Georgia finished 11-1 and blasted Northwest
Mississippi 41-3 in the Mineral Water Bowl in Excelsior Springs,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But Pittman has set some pretty lofty goals for the offseason _
landing scholarships for all 15 of his seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is for 100 percent of our sophomores to get
scholarships to NCAA schools,'' Pittman said. ``By the time we're
finished, we'll probably get to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittman expects four players to sign letters of intent with
Division I programs, including quarterback Jason Vaughn, a graduate
of North Springs High. Vaughn, a 6-foot-4, 205-pound transfer from
Ole Miss, already has committed to UNLV coach John Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Middle Georgia linebacker Kendrell Bell (6-2, 250), a first-team
JUCO All-American, visited Mississippi State this weekend. He
probably will decide between Georgia and Mississippi State this
week, Pittman said. Nose guard Nakia Adderson (6-3, 270) chose
Houston, while free safety Will Pettis (6-4, 200), a former Georgia
Tech signee from Bradwell Institute, is considering Houston and
Mississippi State.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton kept a studied distance Saturday
from his impeachment trial in the Senate, focusing not on the
charges laid out against him by Republican prosecutors, aides said,
but on the next big event on his political calendar: the State of
the Union speech on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the morning reviewing the lengthy draft of his
seventh State of the Union speech with a small group of aides, in
preparation for a more formal run-through Saturday afternoon in the
White House family theater. In his customary preparation for the
speech, Clinton was expected to speak from a lectern before a small
invited audience of speech writers, political aides, policy
advisers and friends.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said that Clinton _ who
does not have a television in the Oval Office _ had not watched any
of the presentations on Capitol Hill on Saturday. However, the
President's lawyers and his advisers were preparing to brief him on
the impeachment sessions when the Senate adjourned for the day.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what not what was highlighted on Clinton's public
schedule. At 10:06 a.m., speaking from the Oval Office, Clinton
delivered his weekly radio address, and the topic was the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday celebration on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this national holiday should be a day on, not
a day off, for as Dr. King once said, life's most persistent and
urgent question is, `What are you going to do for others?'''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Until all children of all backgrounds have the
chance to live up to their God-given potential, free from want in a
world of peace, Dr. King's work and our work will not be
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also spent the day monitoring the situation in Kosovo,
where a massacre of about 40 people was uncovered Saturday, said
State Department spokesman James Foley. The president later issued
a statement condemning the massacre in ``the strongest possible
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the State of the Union address took up most of the
president's day. Clinton had rejected the suggestion of some
Republicans that he delay the speech, and the timing of the address
appeared to play somewhat to his advantage this weekend, his aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the impeachment proceedings, Clinton has portrayed
himself as tending to the duties of his presidency. The demands of
speech preparation Saturday allowed him to fill up with work what
otherwise might have been a relatively eventless winter Saturday in
Washington.

 &HT;    Harrison adds Dogs to his list
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia Bulldogs are making a late push for
quarterback Latrez Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, a Super 11 selection from Atlanta's Booker T.
Washington High School, originally did not consider Georgia one of
the major players in his recruitment. But the exodus of two of
Quincy Carter's backups and the possible defection of a third has
rekindled both Harrison's and the Bulldogs' interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Nate) Hybl leaves, I'd definitely consider coming to
Georgia,'' the 6-3, 190-pound Harrison said. ``I'd love to back up
Quincy Carter, but I want to go somewhere I'd be able to play
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Georgia quarterbacks, Daniel Cobb, a redshirt freshman, and
Mike Usry, a sophomore, already have announced that they are
transferring. Hybl, a redshirt freshman, said he is considering
``all my options'' and could transfer as well. However, Georgia
coach Jim Donnan maintains that Hybl ``isn't going anywhere,'' and
the quarterback is enrolled for winter semester and recently
announced plans to join the Bulldogs golf team.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison already has visited Auburn, Georgia Tech, Syracuse and
Maryland and was scheduled to visit Central Florida this weekend.
He has a press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday at
Washington High but said that could ``get pushed back'' depending
on what happens over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, record-setting quarterback J.R. House of Nitro,
W.Va., might be leaning toward signing a pro baseball contract,
with the possibility of returning to college football later. House,
who set the national high school career and single-season passing
records in the fall, visited Georgia two weekends ago. He's
considered a major-league prospect as a catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bulldogs' standing with Carrollton wide receiver
Reggie Brown and other in-state recruits could only have improved
with the hiring of former Tennessee secondary coach Kevin Ramsey as
defensive coordinator. Ramsey was recruiting Brown, the No. 1 wide
receiver prospect in the South, for the Vols, as well as LaGrange
running back Bruce Thornton, Creekside defensive lineman Charles
Roberson and Dunwoody defensive lineman Jeff Womble.

GOVERNOR ON GUARD OVER NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Last month, Gov. George Pataki quietly switched
lawyers defending him in a lawsuit. The change drew little notice,
but it could be a sign of a tense relationship to come between him
and New York's new attorney general, Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Democrats in the State Assembly sued the
Republican governor over his budget vetoes, Pataki's response was
routine: He turned to Attorney General Dennis Vacco to defend him.
But in November, Vacco, a Republican closely allied with the
governor, was unseated by Spitzer, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Pataki hired a private team of lawyers to take over
his defense. Spitzer had not even taken office yet, and he had
given no hint of where he stood on the case. But the message from
the governor was unmistakable: The new Attorney General could not
be trusted to represent Pataki in a politically charged, partisan
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer may present a range of problems for the Republican
governor, most small, but some of considerable weight. The attorney
general has the power to set the state's official position in court
cases _ even if that means defying the governor's wishes _ and in
some instances, he can hinder Pataki's ability to direct state
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general can also conduct potentially damaging
investigations into the administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the most frequent area of conflict between Spitzer and
Pataki is likely to be in the attorney general's primary job,
defending the state in the thousands of lawsuits filed against it
each year. The attorney general's defense of the administration is
expected and routine in most of these cases, which usually involve
mundane matters like injuries on state property or tax disputes.
But disputes between governors and attorneys general have occurred,
even when both officials were from the same party.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when the attorney general sides with a plaintiff,
rather than the governor? What happens when the state loses a case
at trial and the governor wants to appeal, but the attorney general
says no? Pataki was apparently unwilling to find out in the case of
the budget lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this would pose a conflict for Spitzer,'' said
Zenia Mucha, Pataki's communications director, though she would not
elaborate. As evidence of a conflict, other Pataki aides pointed to
Spitzer's listing of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the plaintiff
in the suit _ along with every other leading Democratic state
official _ as a member of his transition advisory team.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sign that Spitzer, who declined to be interviewed
for this article, will play the antagonist. But state officials in
both parties say he does not have to be combative for confrontation
to arise; merely being politically independent of the governor is
enough.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his first term, Pataki had the advantage of working with
Vacco, who barely won office in 1994 on the governor's coattails.
Vacco could be counted on to throw the weight of the state's top
law enforcement official behind the governor, or at least to avoid
public disagreements with Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has promised repeatedly to be a different kind of
attorney general, more aggressive than Vacco in enforcing laws on
the environment, governmental ethics, voting rights, state
contracting and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the governor, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
conceded that they feared the new attorney general might look for
ways to cause trouble for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``An aggressive guy, looking to make a name for himself on the
governor's back, could be a real problem,'' said one Pataki aide.
``The A.G. has to sign off on a lot of state contracts. On that
level alone, he could be a real pain, but it would backfire on him
if he looked too partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   One policy area in which Spitzer and the governor are likely to
clash is the environment. Under Pataki, the State Department of
Environmental Conservation has taken a more business-friendly
approach to law enforcement, cutting back on fines for corporate
polluters and reducing the number of polluters who are referred to
the attorney general's office for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But Spitzer says he will not wait for referrals from the
department before taking polluters to court, an approach that will
put him directly at odds with administration policy.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Mario Cuomo said that even when there was no
political motivation, conflict was ``inevitable when the two people
have different philosophies of the role of government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to have a member of my own party than a member
of the opposing party,'' he added, ``because there's always the
temptation for the opposing party to try make political mileage out
of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many examples of officials of opposite parties working
together without rancor. In the late 1970s, Gov. Hugh Carey, a
Democrat, had a fine relationship with Attorney General Louis
Lefkowitz, a Republican. And for the last four years, Connecticut
has had a Democratic attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, and a
Republican governor, John Rowland, without any serious friction.
</P>
<P>
   But Spitzer's youth _ he is 39 _ and obvious ambition could
sharpen the potential for confrontation. ``The administration can't
help but look at him as a potential future political adversary,''
said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public
Interest Research Group.

 STATEN ISLAND AND BROOKLYN GETTING INTO THE MINORS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bronx has the Yankees, Queens has the Mets and
Manhattan may be getting a domed stadium to lure the Jets. And now
Brooklyn and Staten Island are also getting new city ballparks, to
house new farm teams for the Yankees and Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proposal for the Manhattan stadium drew
most of the attention in his State of the City speech on Thursday,
and both Yankee and Shea stadiums may be rebuilt. But the mayor
also announced that agreements had been reached to build two minor
league baseball parks at a cost of about $20 million each.
</P>
<P>
   The city ballpark in the St. George section of Staten Island
will be home to the Indians, a newly affiliated Yankees farm team
that is moving from Watertown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this summer, they will play at a field at the College
of Staten Island at Willowbrook as a temporary site until the new
park's completion, projected for a couple of years from now.
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark in Brooklyn will be part of a long-planned sports
complex on Coney Island. Mets officials say they are looking at
several minor league teams and will choose one to affiliate with
and move to Coney Island.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We are confident we will reach an agreement fairly soon,''
said David Howard, a Mets senior vice president. The farm team will
start playing in Coney Island by 2001 if not before, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Yankees and Mets plan contests for fans to name the new
teams. They are legally precluded from reviving the Brooklyn
Dodgers name.
</P>
<P>
   The Watertown Indians, previously the Pirates, are owned by
Sandlot Sports, a company held by a Manhattan family, Stanley and
Phyllis Getzler and their son Joshua.
</P>
<P>
   Watertown Mayor Jeffrey Graham said he was sorry to see the team
go. But considering the sparse attendance it drew in that city of
30,000, he said the departure was ``not a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The two new farm teams would compete in the Class A New
York-Pennsylvania league, which has 14 teams.
</P>
<P>
   The two ballparks will be conveniently close for fans when the
two teams play against each other. Howard envisions a new New York
baseball rivalry, ``not a subway series, but a Verrazano-Narrows
Bridge Series.''

NEW YORK MEDICAL CENTERS UNITE TO GAIN DRUG RESEARCH FUNDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Underscoring a new trend toward cooperation in the
New York region's intensely competitive health industry, five major
academic medical centers quietly have joined forces to pursue a
larger share of the billions of dollars that drug companies now
lavish on other parts of the country to test new products.
</P>
<P>
   Their new consortium, the Biomedical Research Alliance of New
York, is one of several new projects intended to help restore New
York's pre-eminence in biomedical research, generate thousands of
jobs in the region and bolster efforts to recruit top scientists.
Its members are Montefiore Medical Center, Mount Sinai School of
Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, Saint Vincents
Hospital and Medical Center and the North Shore-Long Island Jewish
Health System.
</P>
<P>
   Working with manufacturers on drug trials is nothing new for
these academic institutions. But, hobbled by cumbersome and
antiquated practices, New York medical centers have been able to
capture only a minuscule portion of what is now a $5 billion-a-year
business, said Dr. Eileen Hilton, a specialist in infectious
diseases who is now the chief executive of the new consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The academic medical centers were interested in the business
of research for the sake of research, not business,'' Hilton said.
``They were not fast enough or cost-effective enough for
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of new drugs, manufacturers have demanded
speedier clinical trials in the hope of getting their products to
market before the competition. At the same time, the U. S. Food and
Drug Administration has set higher minimum levels for the number of
subjects required for testing the safety and effectiveness of new
drugs, and has insisted that a range of ages and ethnic groups be
represented.
</P>
<P>
   Because of what she described as ``bureaucratic delays,'' like
difficulty arranging meetings with the appropriate departments, it
could take as long as five months for a clinical-trial project to
be approved at one of the members of the alliance _ compared with a
week or two at a private company, Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   To simplify procedures, the new consortium has one review board
and one standard contract covering all five institutions.
</P>
<P>
   If most academic institutions were slow to respond to the
explosion in the clinical-trials business, private industry was
not. Increasingly, drug companies began farming out their
large-scale clinical tests to companies known as contract research
organizations, which have sprung up in the Research Triangle of
North Carolina and elsewhere across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The new alliance is seeking contracts from these private
organizations, as well as from the drug companies, said Dr. John W.
Rowe, the chairman of the biomedical alliance and the president of
the Mount Sinai-N.Y.U. Medical Center and Health System. These
private companies will gain access to more than 7,000 doctors and
2.4 million patients, Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   No one connected with the biomedical alliance can estimate just
how many jobs will be created. But since much of the data from
clinical trials is entered manually, the business is very labor
intensive, said Raymond G. Falci, a health care analyst with Bear
Stearns. The project received a $1 million loan from the New York
City Investment Fund, a private fund that tries to stimulate job
development.
</P>
<P>
   One labor pool for the alliance is likely to be immigrant health
professionals who have been unable to get licenses to practice
medicine but can be trained as clinical research coordinators, Rowe
said. Hilton said that coordinators were also being recruited from
among the many health care professionals who have lost their jobs
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the alliance was begun in September at North Shore Medical
Center, it has received $3 million in contracts, exceeding its
initial expectations, Hilton said. Yet more than half of the
proposals have been rejected on ethical grounds, or because doctors
felt a particular study was poorly designed or would not adequately
protect the patients being tested, she said. In addition, she said,
the alliance will not accept trials for competing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Trials are under way for more than two dozen drugs for treating
everything from AIDS to impotence, she said. The alliance recently
opened its first New York City office in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   One company that has contracted with the alliance is Pfizer
Inc., which is based in New York City. Joseph M. Feczko, a senior
vice president for medical and regulatory operations, said that
with several academic centers to draw from, it would be easier to
recruit the appropriate patients for a particular clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   He added that companies would benefit from the abundance of
highly skilled doctors in New York's prestigious institutions. The
doctors would also benefit by acquiring access to new drugs, Rowe
said, and because profits earned by the consortium will be plowed
back into their institutions and medical groups.
</P>
<P>
   From 1983 to 1997, New York State's share of research funds from
the National Institutes of Health _ considered an important
barometer for measuring the decline _ fell to 10.7 percent from
15.2 percent, with a loss of $2.4 billion in grants.
</P>
<P>
   The first new initiative in the effort to reverse that decline
was announced in November, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said that
the city would commit $12 million to a major research study on
cancer involving 25 of the region's medical schools and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, 10 academic medical institutions said they were
joining together to create the New York Structural Biology Center,
which will house machines employing high-field magnets used to
study molecules. The center is to open next year on the City
College campus of the City University of New York.

   A STONE OF THE HEART
</P>
<P>
   By Tom Grimes. Southern Methodist University, $12.95. An
overweight 14-year-old boy, starved for affection and trying to
stay afloat in a dysfunctional Irish-American household in Queens
in 1961, seeks refuge in Roger Maris' pursuit of the home-run
record. In 1990 our reviewer, Hilma Wolitzer, called this a
``compact and affecting first novel.''
</P>
<P>
   BEHIND THE OVAL OFFICE: GETTING REELECTED AGAINST ALL ODDS
</P>
<P>
   By Dick Morris. Renaissance, $16.95. President Clinton's former
adviser tracks the arc of his own career, giving plenty of
attention to the mechanics of polling and policy-making, as well as
the overwhelming influence of money and television in presidential
politics. This curious artifact has been updated with a new
introduction and the weekly briefing papers given to the White
House by the author and other political consultants during the 1996
campaign (and later subpoenaed by the Justice Department). Morris
``has written an account that future historians of the Clinton
Presidency will not be able to ignore,'' James B. Stewart wrote
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   THE HEALING
</P>
<P>
   By Gayl Jones. Beacon, $12. Narrated by a faith healer and
former rock star manager, this funny novel leans on free
association to explore the power of faith to banish violence and
paranoia. Last year in these pages, Valerie Sayers praised the
``gradual building of connections and insights that culminates in a
giddy outpouring of language.''
</P>
<P>
   A PRAYER FOR THE CITY
</P>
<P>
   By Buzz Bissinger. Vintage, $15. A journalist with extraordinary
access tells the inside story of Philadelphia's remarkable mayor,
Ed Rendell, whose drive and honesty helped restore hope and fiscal
soundness to a city on the edge of collapse. Last year our
reviewer, Robert Fishman, said this ``full-scale portrait of a
struggling metropolis ... brings to mind such classics of urban
reportage and analysis as J. Anthony Lukas' `Common Ground.' '' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI, by Joan Didion (Vintage International, $12), is a more
impressionistic account of an American city, dwelling on the Cuban
exile community and the shadowy links between the Bay of Pigs
disaster and events like Watergate and the Kennedy assassination.
``The world Miss Didion describes in beautifully evocative prose is
... a world of menace and elliptical connections,'' James Chace
wrote here in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE: ASPECTS OF AN AMERICAN CITY, by
Warren Leslie (Southern Methodist University, $14.95), was first
published after President Kennedy's murder and seeks to explain a
city whose mix of extreme conservatism, religious expression and
political excess made it a place where nasty things were bound to
happen. This study, which includes a new foreword and preface, ``is
a good deal more than a revealing, a valuable and a careful book,''
George Fuermann said here in 1964. ``It is also a courageous one.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PERON NOVEL
</P>
<P>
   By Toms Eloy Martinez. Translated by Helen Lane. Vintage
International, $14. This Argentine novel imagines the life of the
strongman Juan Peron, particularly his 18 years in exile and his
ill-fated return to power in 1973. The book ``is a brilliant image
of a national psychosis,'' Jay Cantor wrote here in 1988. TALES
FROM THE BLUE ARCHIVES, by Lawrence Thornton (Bantam, $13.95), is
the last of three dream-driven novels by the author revolving
around Argentina's ``dirty war.'' It focuses on a woman's search
for her grandsons, who were among the ``disappeared,'' and on what
happens when she finally finds them. The tale ''blends the mundane
violence of recent Latin American politics with the high tragedy of
Elizabethan drama,'' Robert Houston wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   COUNT ME OUT
</P>
<P>
   By Russell James. Foul Play/Norton, $10. When one of the robbers
of an armored car takes off with all the loot, the mastermind of
the heist tries to track him down through the crook's ex-boxer
brother and his 8-year-old daughter. In 1997 our reviewer, Marilyn
Stasio, admired this British mystery for ``the depth, as well as
the darkness'' of its insights.
</P>
<P>
   THE HISTORY OF JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   By Ted Gioia. Oxford University, $15.95. This concise,
accessible overview covers jazz from its roots in slavery through
jazz-rock fusion and beyond. In 1997 our reviewer, Peter Keepnews,
said that despite its occasional omissions and lapses, ``the book
is peppered with pithy and thoughtful observations.''
</P>
<P>
   TRESPASSING: MY SOJOURN IN THE HALLS OF PRIVILEGE
</P>
<P>
   By Gwendolyn M. Parker. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $11. A
well-off black lawyer tells how she rode the fast track to success
in corporate America, and how the pressures of racial tokenism
finally caused her to hop off. In these pages in 1997, Deborah E.
McDowell called this an ``engagingly written and fluidly paced''
memoir.
</P>
<P>
   HOME AND AWAY
</P>
<P>
   By Joanne Meschery. University of California, $13.95. During the
Gulf War, a California woman struggles to balance her growing
political awareness with a troubled marriage and other personal
crises. The novel ``manages to deal sensitively with serious
issues,'' Constance Decker Thompson wrote here in 1994.

 &HT;    Vin-dication? Testaverde burning to show he can win a big game
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Twelve years after he was supposed to burn up the NFL
as the Heisman Trophy star with the kind of talent most
quarterbacks would kill for, Vinny Testaverde enters today's AFC
Championship Game with a raging inferno in his belly.
</P>
<P>
   His remaining skeptics _ those who regard his conference-best
101.6 passer rating in '98 as a fluke and will view this
afternoon's matchup against the Denver Broncos with a morbidly
curious anticipation of Testaverde falling on his face _ likely
will suggest the source of the unease is the quarterback's own
apprehension at playing in the biggest game of his professional
career.
</P>
<P>
   The bubble, they figure, is overdue to burst. And where better
for Testaverde's magical season to be transformed into a grim fairy
tale than at the cusp of the Super Bowl? To be honest, Testaverde
acknowledged Friday evening, he realizes that anyone beyond the New
York state border has handicapped today's game as the latest Vinny
pratfall.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is good reason, given that in past postseason
appearances Testaverde's windpipe was much tighter than his
spirals.
</P>
<P>
   Without rancor, though, he predicted the doubters will be sorely
disappointed. The journeyman quarterback who finally is living up
to the press clippings from a dozen years ago fully expects to look
back on this game as his Vin-dication Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident, but I'm not going to predict victory, because
the Broncos are a helluva team,'' Testaverde said. ``But I know
we'll play well and I know I'll play well. What's going on in my
stomach is a burning desire that hasn't been with me the past few
years. It's not nervousness, it's more like nervous energy ... and
that's different. Honestly, I can't wait for the game to be here.
Because, even as jacked up as I am, I've got this inner peace
that's telling me I'm going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   There now is a serenity about Testaverde, 35, that has been
lacking in the past. One can see it in his eyes, and Denver free
safety Steve Atwater said Testaverde's newfound confidence is
noticeable even on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Significant to the success Testaverde enjoyed in 1998 is that he
was able to share it with the people he most cares about. When Jets
assistant head coach Bill Belichick, who was head coach in
Cleveland when Testaverde played there, convinced Bill Parcells to
sign Testaverde as a free agent, he had no idea what effect the
quarterback's homecoming might have on his roller-coaster career.
</P>
<P>
   Having a tight-knit support group, however, has made a
difference in Testaverde's life on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Right down to the Joe Namath poster that still hangs on the wall
of what used to be his bedroom, Testaverde grew up a Jets fan in
Elmont, Long Island. His father, ``Big Al,'' and mother Josie long
ago gave up attending Testaverde's games as their son's career took
him from Tampa Bay to Cleveland and then to Baltimore. Because of
heart problems and his inability to keep himself sedate while
watching Vinny perform, ``Big Al'' has been ordered by doctors not
to attend the games.
</P>
<P>
   Not until he knows the final score, details of the game and
Vinny's statistics does Al Testaverde sit down and view the
videotape. He has vowed to attend the Super Bowl if the Jets win
today, noting: ``If I'm going to have the big one, where better
than in some 50-yard line seat at a Super Bowl, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually it is the seats around Al and Josie's dining room
table, now full every Tuesday night, that brings the most pleasure
to the Testaverde extended family.
</P>
<P>
   For years now, it has been a tradition that Josie cooks for the
entire family on Tuesdays, when huge vats of spaghetti sauce boil
over onto her new stove. The four Testaverde daughters and their
familes have made the trek ``since forever,'' Josie said. ``But
Vinny, when he played somewhere else, he could only make it in the
offseason once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the quarterback is in charge, not just of calling signals on
Sunday afternoons, but also calling the menu selection on Tuesday
nights. His favorite pass might be the post route, but his dinner
of choice is chicken parmigiana with pasta on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times this year,'' Testaverde said, ``when I've
looked around the dinner table after having been gone so long and
thought, `Man, how good is this?' The success we're having (on the
field) is like the stromboli after dinner, you know? To be playing
well in front of people who have known you all your life, to live
four miles away from a house I grew up in ... sure, it's great to
be back at home again.''
</P>
<P>
   Every morning at 7:30, Testaverde and daughter Alicia, 7, drive
to a bakery shop near their home. The two have bagels and cream
cheese, Alicia with a chocolate milk chaser and Vinny with orange
juice. Then on the way to school, Testaverde quizzes his oldest
child on the week's spelling words. Last week's thrill: When Alicia
got ``streetlight'' right after several days of stumbling on it.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bill Piner, the quarterback's coach at Sewanhaka High
School: ``It's amazing all the little things that mean so much to
Vinny now. He really is at peace. At this point in his career, he
appreciates all this so much more.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his NFL career, Testaverde is surrounded
by a balanced and skilled supporting cast and is working for a
coach who believes in him. In his weak moments, Parcells has
conceded he was initially as skeptical as the detractors who've
hounded Testaverde for 12 seasons. He had watched Testaverde throw
35 interceptions in 1988, the second-most in NFL history. And he
had seen examples of Testaverde wilting under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and the Jets players expect no shrinking violet today.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have judged Vinny on what happened in the past always was
unfair,'' said fullback Keith Byars. ``He always had to be the
whole show by himself and no man can do that in the NFL. But in
this offense, with the talent we have, he doesn't have to win every
game or make every play. All he has to do is drive the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   After 12 seasons, this is the day Testaverde tries to collect
the big fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that, just to be in the NFL, you have to
be in the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent,'' Testaverde said.
``This game can make it all worth the while.''

 &HT;    Elway's retirement all but official
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Although he has talked openly about perhaps playing
again next season if the Denver Broncos win Super Bowl XXXIII and
have a chance for a ``three-peat'' in 1999, all indications now are
that quarterback John Elway plans to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Elway missed four games this season with rib, hamstring and
shoulder injuries and has told friends he plans on stepping away
from the game. His father, Jack Elway, conceded on Friday night
that's likely the case. And when Juliana Elway, his youngest
daughter, hinted she might watch today's game at a friend's house,
the 16-year veteran strongly suggested she attend what figures to
be his final appearance in Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Steve Atwater, who also is considering retirement,
acknowledged there is ``a sense of urgency in our locker room to
win one more for (Elway).'' Added coach Mike Shanahan: ``The
chances are good this is John's final game at Mile High and I think
we all pretty much know that.'' Agent Marvin Demoff said late last
week he ``assumes'' this is his client's final NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   Elway wanted to retire after last year's Super Bowl but the
feeling is he played in '98 to help owner Pat Bowlen get a
referendum passed for a new stadium here. Elway told Miami
quarterback Dan Marino after last week's divisional game that his
body ``is just begging me (to quit).''
</P>
<P>
   When asked Friday night if he can walk away knowing he probably
still has a few good years in him, Elway said: ``I think I'll
always have a lot of football left in me. Whether I can play it or
not is another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan reiterated that if Elway retires, Bubby Brister will go
to training camp in '99 as the Broncos' No. 1 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Dawg day afternoon
</P>
<P>
   This might be a bad sign for the Jets: The only backs who had
100-yard performances against the New York defense in 1998 were Gar
of football development Gene Washington into the 49ers front
office. . . . Look for the Redskins to name all-time wideout Art
Monk to a post with the team. Also expected to join the Washington
front office is former Jaguars team president David Seldin. . . .
Several veterans in Jacksonville will test coach Tom Coughlin by
boycotting his offseason workouts this spring. . . . Giants GM
Ernie Accorsi, satisfied with the play of backup Conrad Hamilton,
will jettison veteran cornerback Carlton Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert stumbling
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to owner Jerry Richardson, who assembled much of the
offensive coaches, new Carolina coach George Seifert has at least
half a staff. But Seifert is having a problem landing a defensive
coordinator. His first choice, Ray Rhodes, went to Green Bay as the
head coach. His second pick was Emmitt Thomas but the former Eagles
defensive chief went with Rhodes. Third choice Wannstedt rejoined
Johnson in Miami. Now Seifert is courting Baltimore defensive
coordinator Marvin Lewis and Cunningham. Lewis turned down an offer
from new Eagles coach Andy Reid last week but still is keeping
options open because has a lot of irons in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing for freedom
</P>
<P>
   When agent Frank Bauer drew up the contract that enabled
restricted free agent Chad Cota to leave Carolina for New Orleans
last spring, he knew that the three-year, $5.4 million deal was a
masterstroke of structure. But not even Bauer could have foreseen
just how much the cleverly-constructed contract would work in favor
of the scrappy safety. The deal included six team-performance
clauses, any of which would trigger an opt-out decision for Cota
this spring. The only clause that had a shot entering the final
game of the season was one that would grant Cota his freedom if the
Saints improved eight spots over their 1997 rank in interceptions.
New Orleans was 13th in pickoffs in '97 and rated just No. 7 going
into the finale. By grabbing three interceptions of Buffalo
quarterback Rob Johnson in the final game, the Saints moved up to
No. 5. So Cota earned $2.5 million for his one season in New
Orleans and now gets his unrestricted freedom. The Saints are left
with an unexpected salary cap acceleration of $1 million. And the
Panthers, still scrambling for safeties, may pursue Cota.

FLOODED PLAZA COLLAPSES INTO UNDERGROUND GARAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a thunderous rumble and a rush of air, a
playground and a concrete plaza collapsed into an underground
parking garage at an apartment complex on Manhattan's Lower East
Side late Friday night, crushing dozens of cars and shaking nearby
buildings with the force of a small earthquake. No one was injured,
and there were no reports of missing people, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers, who used heat-seeking devices and search dogs to
comb the rubble, said they did not believe that anyone had been
trapped when the plaza collapsed shortly after 11 p.m., leaving a
150-foot-wide crater and a jumble of concrete in the middle of the
Seward Park cooperative apartment houses at Clinton and Grand
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But fire officials said they would have to excavate tons of
debris and wrecked vehicles before they could be certain no one had
been buried when the ground gave way and a four-feet-thick layer of
concrete and topsoil dropped, along with a swing set and park
benches, into the parking garage below.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who visited the scene shortly after the
collapse, said it appeared to have been caused by the wet weather.
Several residents said that much of the plaza had been flooded with
water about six inches deep Friday and that the water had leaked
into the garage. Officials at the complex's management office could
not be reached by phone Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents who live closest to the plaza, in the building
known as 413-415-417 Grand St., said they were asleep or had just
settled in to watch the 11 o'clock news when the floors and walls
began to tremble. There was a whoosh of air, a thundering noise and
the cable television service went out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there was an earthquake,'' Richard Chartoff said.
``I ran out in the hallway, and by the time I put it together, I
figured something either exploded in the garage or outside.'' His
wife, Margot, said, ``The floors shook, the walls shook, my
furniture shook.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Chartoffs rushed down into the garage to check on their
silver Toyota Camry. ``We saw our car crushed to pieces,'' Mr.
Chartoff said. ``It was gone, like an accordion. It seemed to have
been buried or sunk down. It seemed to have disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   They saw the garage ceiling buckling above them and ran out.
</P>
<P>
   As emergency vehicles surrounded the apartment complex, the
residents of about 40 apartments closest to the collapse were
evacuated. They were allowed to return about four hours later after
officials deemed the 21-story building to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the garage, which serves all four buildings in
the Seward Park complex, was almost always full, with as many as
500 cars. It can take years on a waiting list before a resident can
lay claim to one of the coveted spots, which cost from $100 to $220
a month, depending on the location.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that as many as 50 or more cars, parked at the
back of the garage, might have been destroyed. And even residents
whose cars had been spared said they were now facing the almost
equal nightmare of weeks or months without a place to park in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The residents, a middle-class mix of Orthodox Jews who are a
vestige of the old Lower East Side and newer Hispanic and Asian
immigrants, said they felt blessed that the collapse had occurred
late on a cold night, when few people were parking their cars or
sitting out on the benches in the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summertime, this would be crowded until 11 or 12
o'clock at night,'' said Rose Chen, whose 1997 Honda Accord was
parked at the front of the garage and was not damaged. ``The kids
play football. People sit on the benches. We are really lucky no
one got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the snowstorm on Thursday followed by ice,
freezing rain and flooding on Friday might have weakened the
ceiling of the garage. But they said the exact cause would not be
known until an engineer conducted a full investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a pancake collapse of the roof of this parking
garage,'' said Chief Jack Kelly of the Fire Department's 11th
Division. He said excavating the debris with a crane would take
three to four days. The garage was about 40 years old, he said, but
he did not know whether age had been a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know now, it's a mystery,'' he said. ``Until the
engineer takes a look at it, we won't know for sure.'' Kelly said
subway trains on the F line, which passes nearby, had been slowed
to reduce vibrations that could further weaken the structure.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, residents said they went through a
terrifying experience in which, for a few seconds, the Lower East
Side felt like San Francisco. ``I didn't hear anything, but I felt
the movement, the tremor,'' Shevi Stetansky said. ``It was like an
earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Cohen, 83, a school aide, said the evening newscast was
cut short. ``I was watching the news, and I heard an explosion,''
he said. ``I thought they bombed the building. We thought it was a
bomb. We heard a big bomb, and the cable went out.''
</P>
<P>
   Penina Mezei, 26, on her way to synagogue Saturday morning with
her three children, said the collapse had shaken her out of bed.
``I thought it was a gunshot, and I got scared,'' she said. Her
husband, her parents and her brother all had cars parked in the
garage, she said, but she did not know whether they had been
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's the Sabbath, so we'll worry about it after sundown,''
she said, adding that the plaza and playground lie between her
apartment building on Grand Street and her parents' building on
East Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   She said the scene from her apartment window _ jagged concrete
slabs, upended park benches and the playground swing set virtually
intact but dropped 12-feet below ground _ had captivated her
children all morning. ``They said, `The swings are in the garage,'
and I said, `We can't go into the garage to play on the swings,' ''
Mrs. Mezei said. ``The swings are no more.''

<P>
   For months, members of Congress have taken to quoting famous
historians to back up their own views on the impeachment of
President Clinton. Twice Saturday, for example, House Republicans
Steve Buyer of Indiana and Charles Canady of Florida quoted the
writings of Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to argue for Clinton's removal.
</P>
<P>
   Just one problem: Schlesinger, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author
who was an aide to President John F. Kennedy, has come out firmly
against Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Schlesinger appeared before the House Judiciary
Committee to argue that, though he had favored the impeachment of
President Richard M. Nixon, delivering the same punishment to
Clinton ``would permanently weaken the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the Senate on Saturday morning, Buyer quoted a
sentence from Schlesinger's book, ``The Imperial Presidency,'' a
study of the growth of presidential power over two centuries. ``The
continuation of a lawbreaker as chief magistrate,'' Buyer quoted
from the book, ``would be a strange way to exemplify law and order
at home or to demonstrate American probity before the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger, 81, did not offer an opinion about the Republican
appropriations of his views in responding to a phone call placed to
his home in Manhattan, but he said it was not the first time it had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Hyde actually on Dec. 8 made somewhat the same kind of
comment,'' Schlesinger said, referring to the House Judiciary
Committee's Republican chairman, ``claiming that I changed my views
about impeachment, that I advocated in the Nixon case and opposed
it in the Clinton case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I've not changed my view. As I faxed to Chairman
Hyde, when he made that charge on Dec. 8, if Clinton had done what
Nixon did, I would certainly favor his impeachment.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Summarizing the Republican case against President
Clinton in a speech evoking the shades of heroes past, Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., said Saturday afternoon that the presidency could be
``permanently damaged'' if the Senate failed to remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that a hundred years from today, people will look back
at what we have done and say, `They kept the faith,''' Hyde, the
chief prosecutor, declared in an emotion-laden presentation
accusing Clinton of fraying the bonds of trust between those who
govern the United States and those who are governed.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Hyde said one last time, is not about sex but about
``the rule of law'' _ ``one of the great achievements of our
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., told senators that the
president must be removed from office because he had ``made himself
a notorious example of lawlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the final day of the Republican presentation of the
impeachment case against the president, Canady, like Clinton a
graduate of Yale Law School, also argued that the Senate could not
set a lower standard for a president than for judges who have been
ousted in recent years for making false statements under oath.
Clinton is accused in one impeachment article of committing perjury
in his testimony to the grand jury investigating his sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared closing statement, Hyde told the Senate: ``Your
judgment should rise above politics, above partisanship, above
polling data. This case is a test of whether what the founding
fathers described as `sacred honor' still has meaning in our
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady and two colleagues on the panel of House managers, Reps.
Steve Buyer, R-Ind., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., sought to
pre-emptively rebut arguments of Clinton's defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Citing British and American authorities in a session that often
turned the Senate chamber into a constitutional history classroom,
they contended that the offenses Clinton is accused of, not only
perjury but obstruction of justice, meet the constitutional
standard of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' for impeachment; that
missteps in his private life had led to crimes in his public
capacity; that the Senate had convicted judges in recent years for
analogous offenses, and that if Clinton was guilty he must not be
allowed to remain in the White House, as Canady put it, ``in all
his infamy.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has argued from the start that even if Clinton
was guilty, nothing he did would justify the removal from office of
a popular president, twice endorsed by a national electorate. It
was that argument, which Buyer termed the ``so-what'' argument,
that the three sought to nail Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer (pronounced BOO-yer) attacked on several levels in a
passionate presentation, urging the senators not to give way to any
of several double standards.
</P>
<P>
   In response to those who note that perjury, unlike treason and
bribery, is not enumerated in the Constitution among ``high crimes
and misdemeanors,'' Buyer cited Sir William Blackstone, the great
18th-century English jurist whose book of legal commentaries, James
Madison wrote, was ``in every man's hand'' as the constitutional
draftsmen went about their labors.
</P>
<P>
   Blackstone, Buyer said, included perjury among his list of
public offenses, placing bribery and perjury side by side. From
there, he jumped to the assertion that ``there is no difference''
between ``sitting before a federal judge and perjuring oneself''
and offering that judge a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging widely, Buyer quoted Black's Legal Dictionary, Gen.
Douglas MacArthur, John Adams and, on the seriousness of perjury
and obstruction of justice, former Attorney General Griffin Bell, a
Democrat. Bell, he said, had reached the heart of the matter when
he declared, ``A president cannot faithfully execute the laws if he
himself is breaking them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now at least 115 persons serving sentences for
perjury in federal prisons,'' Buyer said. ``Where is the fairness
to these Americans, if they stay in jail and the president stays in
the Oval Office?''
</P>
<P>
   But Buyer laid special emphasis, of a kind that had not been
heard in the trial, on the impact of Clinton's alleged crimes on
the armed services and on women.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats continue to insist that the whole controversy
stems from a private sexual matter, and is therefore beneath
constitutional notice, Buyer demanded, does that mean that the
evidence-gathering process in federal sexual harassment cases, like
the one brought against Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones, which led to
the Lewinsky case, are unimportant?
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of The Citadel, the South Carolina military college,
and a veteran of the Persian Gulf war, Buyer argued that Clinton's
``diminished veracity'' had had an ``inherently corrosive'' effect
on his capacity to function effectively as commander in chief and
to carry out his foreign policy duties.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Buyer said, American military personnel all over
the world ``know that, if accused of the same offenses as their
commander in chief, they would no longer be deserving of the
privilege of serving in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, much the folksiest of the 13 managers, was assigned to
explore Senate precedent, and he did so. He dutifully noted that
Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada had been removed in 1986, for
filing a false income-tax return ``under penalties of perjury.'' He
noted that Judge Walter Nixon of Mississippi had been removed in
1989, for lying to a grand jury about his efforts to fix a friend's
son's case in state court. And he noted that Judge Alcee Hastings
of Florida had been removed, also in 1989, for perjury and
conspiracy to obtain a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All three cases set significant precedents for this case, Graham
said. But he laid special emphasis on a statement by former Sen.
Charles Mathias of Maryland in the Claiborne case. Mathias, one of
the prosecutors in that matter, said the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachable conduct does not have to occur in the performance
of an officer's official duties. Evidence of misconduct,
misbehavior, high crimes and misdemeanors can be justified upon
one's private dealings as well as one's exercise of public
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense is rooted to a considerable degree in the
argument that the offenses charged do not involve official
misconduct. On Saturday, his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the
final presentations constituted ``a clear concession and admission
that their case isn't strong enough without witnesses,'' whose
calling the White House and most Democrats oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Hastings had been acquitted in criminal court,
Graham drew the lesson that crime was not a prerequisite to
impeachment, because, he said: ``Impeachment is not punishment.
Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about
restoring honor and integrity to the office.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graham also made a broader point, much at variance with the
apocalyptic tone of most of his Republican colleagues' remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what you decide,'' he told the senators who sat
silently in judgment of a president whom all of them know, ``this
country will survive. If you acquit the president, we will survive.
If you convict him, it will be traumatic, but we will survive.
There is a calmness in the midst of something so important as this
that tells me we've done it right for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Canady's turn came, he gave perhaps the most lawyerly
speech of the whole three-day process _ tight, well-organized and
thoroughly documented. Whether he persuaded any senators remained
unfathomable, as has been the case throughout the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Canady argued that the purpose of the power to remove officials
granted to the Senate is ``to preserve, protect and strengthen our
Constitution by setting a standard of conduct for public
officials.'' Clinton, he said, had failed to meet that standard, as
construed in the light of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the claims of the president's lawyers,'' he said,
``there is not a bright line separating official misconduct by a
president from other misconduct of which the president is guilty.
It does violence to the English language to assert that a president
who has violated a duty entrusted to him by the Constitution is not
guilty of official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have been reminded repeatedly, the Constitution imposes
on the president the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed. A president who commits a calculated and sustained series
of criminal offenses has, by his personal violations of the law,
failed in the most immediate, direct and culpable manner to do his
duty under the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady reviewed at length the concept of impeachment as it
evolved in England, notably in the proceeding against Warren
Hastings, who was on trial during the Constitutional Convention.
Then he plunged into an example of the Framers' intent, one of the
most vexed questions in the whole debate.
</P>
<P>
   He relied heavily on comments by James Iredell, later a Supreme
Court justice, at the North Carolina ratifying convention.

RAPPER'S COUSIN TO TESTIFY AGAINST HIM, OFFICIALS SAY  
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Va.)   By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cousin of a well-known rap artist with the
Wu-Tang Clan has agreed to become a witness against the performer
in connection with a shootout with police officers, law enforcement
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The rap artist, Russell Jones, who alternately goes by the stage
names Ol' Dirty Bastard and Big Baby Jesus, was arrested in
Brooklyn about 8 p.m. Friday, shortly after the police said he
fired two shots at officers in an unmarked patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Jones faces charges of attempted murder of a police officer,
aggravated assault and criminal possession of a weapon, the
Brooklyn District Attorney's office said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick B. Clark, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said
Jones could face life in prison if convicted on the highest count
of the attempted-murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the shootout occurred after officers saw Jones,
29, driving his 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe erratically, with his
headlights off, after he left the United Kingdom Studios in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   When the officers neared the car, Jones fired two shots at them,
the police said, and they returned his fire.
</P>
<P>
   The car drove off, then stopped about a half-block away, where
Jones' cousin, Frederick Cuffie, the only other person in the
vehicle, jumped from the car and ran, the police said. Jones was
arrested as he got out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Cuffie, 37, was arrested about 11 p.m. after officers found him
in a nearby building. No weapon was recovered, the police said
</P>
<P>
   Although Cuffie also had faced attempted-murder charges, those
charges were dropped when he became a witness for the prosecution,
according to a law enforcement official who was speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``He is a material witness who we believe
was an uninvolved passenger in the car,'' and can connect Jones to
the shots that were fired, the official explained.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's shooting was the latest incident involving Jones,
who has survived two shootings and has often been accused of
exhibiting the lyrical aggression of the Wu-Tang Clan, a group
originally from Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Between September and November, he was arrested twice, for
allegedly threatening to kill his 27-year-old ex-girlfriend in Los
Angeles, and other time for allegedly threatening security guards
at a blues club there, according to the Associated Press. Last
July, he was charged with shoplifting in Virginia, the Associated
Press also reported.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also drew public attention when he stormed the stage of
the Grammy Awards at Radio City Music Hall last year, seizing a
microphone to complain about losing in the best rap-album category.

BOSTON COLLEGE: BIG UPSETS, BIG CROWDS AND TALL PLAYERS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ontario, Conn., N.J. Ind. ,  Vt. )  By JACK CAVANAUGH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ To most Boston College sports followers,
the biggest victory recorded by an Eagles team in the post World
War II era occurred in football. Boston College upset top-ranked
Notre Dame, 41-39, in South Bend on Nov. 30, 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Inglese would concede that a BC victory over the Irish may
have been the biggest upset, but she might differ on the sport. To
Coach Inglese, the 78-65 upset that her women's basketball team
registered at home on Dec. 30, 1998, over Notre Dame, then ranked
No. 7, was at least equally significant in Boston College sports
annals.
</P>
<P>
   While the Boston College men's team is enduring its worst season
in years, Inglese's Eagles have made it into the top 25 in the
national ranking for the first time since the women's varsity
basketball program began in 1972. Going into Saturday's Big East
game against Miami at the Conte Forum on the BC campus, the Eagles
_ ranked 21st by The Associated Press _ were 13-2 over all and 5-2
in the Big East, with the losses to the Hurricanes on Dec. 5 and at
Syracuse on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of their junior point guard and co-captain, Cal
Bouchard, was evident in the Eagles' loss to Syracuse. The 5-7
Bouchard, from Aurora, Ontario, injured her knee against Georgetown
last Sunday and is expected to miss at least a month. Bouchard, a
first-team all-Big East selection last season, is averaging 13
points a game.
</P>
<P>
   That 73-70 loss to Syracuse stopped a seven-game B.C. winning
streak. Considered with their 17-11 finish last season, the Eagles'
ability to win in bunches has established them as a formidable
force in the Big East, which also has Connecticut, Notre Dame and
Rutgers in the top 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great leadership and excellent teamwork have made us a much
better team,'' said Inglese, who knows something about establishing
a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Boston College in 1993, Inglese, a native of
Wallingford, Conn., spent seven seasons as the head coach at
Vermont, where her teams went unbeaten in 57 regular-season games
during the 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big East women's conference has gotten a lot better _ we
have four teams in the top 25,'' Inglese said, ``and we've reached
a higher level over the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Inglese has attracted three 6-foot-plus frontcourt players from
New York State high schools, and they have been instrumental in the
Eagles' success this season. There are two seniors from the
metropolitan area _ Whitney Steele, who was the career-leading
rebounder at Northern Valley Regional High School in Old Tappan,
N.J., and Paula Bacso, the 6-1 co-captain, who was a three-time
Long Island player of the year while attending Farmingdale High.
The freshman Becky Gottstein, also 6-1, was a two-time all-state
selection from Albany High School.
</P>
<P>
   Gottstein, who is averaging 8 rebounds and 8 points a game, has
supplanted Steele as the team's leading rebounder. The 6-4 Steele,
the tallest starter, is averaging 5 rebounds and 13 points a game,
a point behind the junior guard Alissa Murphy of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   On a campus where sports has always been a rallying point, the
Eagles draw relatively small crowds despite their success. But
attendance is growing: the Notre Dame game drew a women's record of
4,133 at the Conte Forum, even though it was played during the
Christmas break. A doubleheader that featured BC against Michigan
State at the Fleet Center in Boston last Nov. 22 attracted 6,834
fans. Through seven games at home, the Eagles have averaged 1,827.
</P>
<P>
   They will play in front of far more spectators when they meet
Connecticut on Feb. 6 at the Hartford Civic Center, where the
Huskies, both men and women, draw capacity crowds to practically
every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what you dream of _ playing one of the country's best
teams in front of more than 15,000 people,'' said Bacso, who was
also recruited by UConn, Syracuse and St. John's, among other
schools. ``You can't ask for any more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Except perhaps another major upset. &QL;

<P>
   SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, Brazil _ For 22 years and four months,
Luiz Porfirio Diniz reported daily to the bustling Ford do Brasil
automotive plant here, where three different car models are
manufactured. But then, just before Christmas, he got the bad news
he had been fearing ever since Brazilian interest rates shot to
nearly 50 percent four months ago: He was one of 2,800
assembly-line workers being laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Employees took over the plant on Jan. 5 to protest that move, so
Diniz still spends his day on the plant floor, playing dominos with
his fellow workers. The stoppage means that Ford is no longer
producing its daily quota of 1,000 cars, but the company has not
moved against the workers _ perhaps because car sales are declining
so dramatically in Brazil that Ford has the equivalent of nearly
two months of production stockpiled in storage areas here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to work, so all they have to do is give us the
word,'' said Valdecir Aparecido de Souza, another laid-off worker.
``But if nobody is spending any money, management is not going to
take us back, and we're not going to be able to find jobs anywhere
else. It's a real mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis that has shaken Brazil in recent months,
culminating last week in a 21 percent devaluation of the country's
currency, the real, is first and foremost a threat to workers and
their families. But for that very reason, it also represents a
growing danger for the hundreds of multinational companies that
have flocked to Brazil and invested billions of dollars in recent
years, lured by a market of 165 million people that seemed to be
enjoying sustained growth and stable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Though all of Brazil is now reeling, the once-flourishing
automobile industry centered here in the industrial suburbs south
of Sao Paulo, which produced as many as 2 million vehicles a year
at its peak, was hit early and particularly hard. Car sales in
Brazil, the world's seventh-largest auto market, slumped 27.5
percent last year, falling from 1.64 million to 1.19 million, with
Ford registering an even larger decline, 33.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   James Cain, a Ford spokesman in Detroit, said the elimination of
a shift at the factory here and the resulting layoffs were driven
by the conclusion that ``we did not believe there would be any
substantive improvement in the market in 1999.'' The company lost
money in Brazil in 1998, Cain said, and it indicated to Wall Street
analysts at a briefing on Jan. 7, even before the major devaluation
announced Friday, that it was unlikely to earn a profit in Brazil
this year either.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's top automaker, Volkswagen, is also suffering from a
sharp decline in demand, but last month negotiated an agreement
with its workers here to reduce pay by 15 percent rather than cut
jobs. On Friday, General Motors do Brasil reached a similar accord,
laying off 1,000 of its 8,700 workers for five months but
continuing to pay them 80 percent of their normal salaries.
</P>
<P>
   For Brazil's 275,000 autoworkers, once considered the elite of
the working class, that means hard times after years of hard-won
improvements in their standard of living. ``Yesterday, I was
dreaming,'' reads the bumper sticker on a car parked outside the
Ford factory here. ``Today I can't even sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Diniz, who is 44, married and has two children, is a typical
example. Born in the arid interior of the impoverished northeastern
state of Paraiba, he, like millions of other northeasterners hoping
for a better life, came to Sao Paulo as a teen-ager, and by working
hard and scrimping and saving, managed to buy his own house and
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Ford and think of it as family,'' he said as he and a
group of other workers congregated at the Bar do Pascual, just
outside the plant's main gate here. ``I grew up with this company,
so being in this situation is enough to make me cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent years had been especially good, he and other workers
said. The government's Real Plan, announced in 1994, tied the value
of Brazil's currency to the dollar, forcing a level of fiscal
discipline that quickly reduced inflation from more than 1,000
percent a year in the early 1990s to single digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing down inflation made it easier for people like us to
buy food, clothing and appliances,'' said Adailton Coelho dos
Santos, 55, who works on the same line as Diniz and also emigrated
from the northeast. ``For the first time in our lives, we were able
to figure out what our money was worth.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, millions of Brazilians could finally afford to buy
televisions, refrigerators, furniture and other consumer goods,
secure in the knowledge that their monthly payments would not
outstrip their wages. But measures taken by the government over the
past six months, especially the dramatic interest rate hike, have
driven the Brazilian economy into recession and forced consumers to
economize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of members who can no longer meet their rent or
mortgage payments, let alone think about buying appliances,'' said
Luiz Marinho, president of the metalworkers union of Sao Bernardo,
which represents the autoworkers here. ``We have guys who have had
to postpone their weddings because they don't have a cent to spend
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For American companies, the belt-tightening by working-class
Brazilians like those here is nothing but bad news. Brazil is the
United States' 15th-largest trading partner, and in recent years it
has been one of the fastest-growing markets for American-made
goods, ranging from equipment for heavy industry to potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   American banks also have a heavy exposure here. As of the middle
of 1998, they had about $16.7 billion in loans and other assets
outstanding in Brazil, with Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Bank and
BankAmerica each reporting more than $3 billion in assets here.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is especially alarming for the estimated 2,000
American businesses that are operating in Brazil, which has Latin
America's largest economy. American concerns have more than $27
billion invested here, giving them a higher profile here than in
other troubled areas like Russia or Southeast Asia, and weak
results this year, now expected to be the general rule as a result
of last week's economic turmoil, could affect their profit
statements back home.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the major car companies, for instance, Whirlpool
and General Electric manufacture appliances such as refrigerators,
stoves and microwave ovens. Companies like Johnson &AMP; Johnson and
Procter &AMP; Gamble make a wide variety of toiletries and cosmetics,
including soaps, shampoos and detergents.
</P>
<P>
   At their factories north of Sao Paulo, Motorola, Lucent,
Qualcomm and other companies turn out telecommunications equipment
such as cellular phones, whose availability has increased
dramatically as the result of the privatization of Brazil's
telephone system last year. With the market for computers here
having grown by as much as 30 percent a year recently, computer
makers such as Compaq and Dell have also installed themselves at
sites in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden and dramatic downturn here raises the question of
whether American, European and Japanese companies that have flocked
here in recent years may now have too much manufacturing capacity
installed in Brazil. Or as Pedro Reis Correa, a 39-year-old
assembly line worker, put it: ``If all of us are unemployed, who is
going to buy the products these companies make?''
</P>
<P>
   For Christmas, in fact, Correa, who earns a salary of about
$1,000 a month, had planned to buy a computer, mostly for use by
his two children, ages 8 and 11. He had even obtained a bargain
price through a nephew who works for a computer manufacturer and
saved up the down payment that would have allowed him to buy the
$1,600 machine on an installment plan.
</P>
<P>
   But when he received the layoff notice, he had to tell the
children that ``this is going to have to wait for some other
time,'' he recalled sorrowfully. ``I am trying to cut expenses as
much as I can, and that means no more car trips to the interior on
weekend or movies or candy bars for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Carlos Santos knows only too well the effects of
decisions like that. For the past four years, he has parked every
day outside the entrance to the Ford plant here, and from the back
of his beat-up station wagon, sold items such as kitchen knives,
watches, videocassettes and toys to the workers, with gross sales
of about $1,300 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sales are down 50 percent in the past month, so of course I
am very worried,'' he said on Friday morning, as a constant drizzle
added to his woes by driving his few potential customers indoors.
``If the money of the workers here dries up, then people like me
are going to go bust. This situation affects everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Santos said, his family too has begun economizing,
anticipating that the situation is going to get worse before it
begins to improve. ``We're eating less meat and more rice and
beans, buying cheaper brands of shampoo and soap and cutting back
on our consumption of soft drinks, doing everything we can to save
a penny here and there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is not what companies like Coca-Cola or Nabisco, which
derives about 17 percent of its worldwide sales from Brazil, want
to hear. Brazil is Coke's second-largest overseas market,
accounting for about 5 percent of the beverage giant's worldwide
profits.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1995, Coke's sales in Brazil expanded by a
spectacular 34 percent. But growth was estimated at only 1 percent
for last year, and with people like Santos and his family
determined to drink less, the most optimistic projection for this
year is flat sales.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the money Coca-Cola takes in here is earned in the
now drastically devalued local currency. ``They're not hedged on
the real,'' explained Emmanuel Goldman, a global consumer products
analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``Whatever happens to the real, happens
to Coke's earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how Friday's decision by the Brazilian
government to allow the real to float freely against the dollar
will affect other companies. In theory, the long-urged devaluation
of the real should make Brazilian exports cheaper across the board
and therefore more attractive than those of its competitors, while
also encouraging investment by making Brazilian companies available
at bargain prices to foreign purchasers who may be attracted to the
market.
</P>
<P>
   But economists have expressed concerns that the devaluation of
the real could set off a chain reaction across Latin America and
the rest of the developing world, with country after country trying
to gain a competitive advantage by lowering the value of its
currency. In addition, the price of the components, raw materials
and finished goods that Brazil buys will now go up, fueling
inflation here and cutting consumer purchasing power further.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, thousands of Brazilians who purchased cars on an
installment plan opted for financing terms that peg their monthly
payments to the exchange rate between the dollar and the real. Not
only will they now have to pay substantially more each month or try
to sell their vehicle before it is repossessed, but the devaluation
is expected to drive many potential buyers out of the market
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the population is frightened and stops consuming, things
can only get worse,'' Marinho said. ``That's what we are
confronting right now, a moment that threatens to erase all of the
gains we have made.''

POLICE INVESTIGATE PRISONER'S DEATH
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nassau County police are investigating how a man
serving a 90-day sentence in the county jail for traffic violations
died on Thursday night, covered in bruises, with a lacerated spleen
and broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Thomas Pizzuto, 38, of Hicksville died after suffering
multiple seizures at the Nassau County Medical Center, hospital
sources said. Mark Barber, president of the correction officers'
union, said that Pizzuto's injuries resulted from a seizure inside
a cell that was made of concrete and steel. But Pizzuto told his
father, two days before he died, that jail officers had beaten him,
the family's lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pizzuto's parents have filed a complaint with the police, said
the lawyer, Dennis Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy has not been completed on Pizzuto, a recovering
heroin user who had been in methadone treatment, and jail officials
would not comment Saturday. But Denis Dillon, Nassau County
district attorney, said the case was being investigated as a
possible homicide because of the family's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Pizzuto, the dead man's older brother, said in a
telephone interview that he was still in shock. ``I can't believe
that he went in for that little charge; a couple weeks he was
supposed to be out and that's it. It wasn't supposed to happen that
way. It just happened so quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that Thomas Pizzuto whispered to his father during a
hospital visit on Tuesday that jail guards had beaten him on
Friday, Jan. 8, the day after he entered the correctional facility.
Thomas Pizzuto had been taken to the hospital on Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The evidence is just overwhelming that he was beaten,'' Kelly
said. ``There's just no other explanation for the trauma he
suffered. The explanation that the family had gotten was that he
fell. That's the standard explanation when somebody gets beat at
the Nassau County Jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County police officials refused to discuss the case
Saturday. According to Newsday, which reported the case on
Saturday, police are trying to find out why Pizzuto was kept in a
cell in the admission section instead of being released into the
general jail population after one or two days.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, president of the union representing the 1,000 sheriff's
deputies who work at the jail, said there was no documentation of
any incident involving Pizzuto, and that his bruises were easily
explained by seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has had a seizure before, the first thing you do
is you move the furniture out of the way,'' Barber said. ``The jail
cell is made of concrete and steel. If you have a seizure inside of
a cell, what do you have to bounce against? You have a steel bed
and concrete floor, concrete ceiling, concrete walls.''
</P>

   Pizzuto, who was married and had a 14-year-old son with Down
syndrome, was sentenced to 90 days for driving while under the
influence of drugs, leaving the scene of an accident and aggravated
unlicensed operation of a vehicle. Anthony Pizzuto said his brother
was taking methadone, a drug used to curb cravings for heroin, and
that he worked as a janitor and delivery man for the New York City
school district.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend in jail, Pizzuto was taken to the hospital
Monday, apparently after suffering a seizure. A source at the
Nassau County Medical Center who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said Pizzuto had at least two seizures while at the
hospital, one in the emergency room when he was first admitted and
another in the prison ward in the hours before his death.

HOUSE PROSECUTORS URGE SENATE TO REMOVE CLINTON AND TURN TO GORE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL and JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors urged the Senate Saturday to
remove President Clinton from office and sought to reassure
lawmakers that Vice President Al Gore would be ``waiting outside
the door'' to take over as president.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican prosecutors said the Senate should take the
unprecedented action because of Clinton's ``willful, premeditated
deliberate corruption'' of the nation's legal system during the
cover-up of his sexual dalliance with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The House last month impeached Clinton for perjury and
obstruction of justice. If the 100-member Senate convicts him by a
two-thirds vote, Clinton is automatically removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, argued that if the Senate fails to convict Clinton, the
presidency will have been ``deeply, and perhaps permanently
damaged'' in ``an unprecedented and unacceptable way.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors acknowledged for the first time that the
Senate faces a stiff political challenge as it weighs whether to
oust a popular president who has been elected twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking you to remove a popular president,'' conceded
Rep. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C. ``To set aside an election is a very
scary thought in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graham insisted the Senate can remove Clinton immediately to
``cleanse'' the presidency without provoking a constitutional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president will be waiting outside the doors of this
chamber,'' Graham said. ``If that vice president is asked to come
in and assume the mantle of chief executive officer of the land,
chief law enforcement officer of the land, it will be tough, it
will be painful, but we will survive and we will be better for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., also cited Gore, for a different
purpose. Canady reminded senators that Gore, a Senate veteran when
he joined Clinton on the Democratic ticket in 1992, voted to
impeach federal Judge Claiborne for tax evasion in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Canady quoted Gore's statement at the time: ``It is incumbent
upon the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibility and
strip this man of his title.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican prosecutors also raised questions about Clinton's
ability to lead the nation's armed forces and to represent the
nation abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen E. Buyer, R-Ind., a former Army lawyer called to
active duty during the Persian Gulf War who later ran for Congress,
said the nation's armed forces look to the commander-in-chief to
``exhibit the traits that inspire those who must risk their lives
at his command.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyer added that Clinton's ``own self-inflicted wounds have
called his credibility into question.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, in his summation, said Clinton's breach of ``trust'' with
the American people jeopardizes the ability of nations around the
world to trust the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental trust between America and the world can be
broken if a presidential perjurer represents our country in world
affairs,'' Hyde warned the Senate. ``And, because the executive
plays so large a role in representing the country to the world,
America can no longer be trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also invoked the sacrifice of American GIs buried in
Arlington Cemetery, in the U.S. cemetery overlooking the D-Day
beaches in Normandy and the names of the dead etched into the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we keep faith with them?'' Hyde asked, urging the
Senate to remove Clinton. ``We work to make this country the kind
of America they were willing to die for ... an America where the
idea of sacred honor still has the power to stir men's souls.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense begins in earnest in the Senate on Tuesday
with his team of lawyers opening the first of three days of counter
arguments. The next dramatic showdown in the struggle between the
GOP Congress and the Democratic chief executive takes place Tuesday
evening at 9 p.m., when Clinton is scheduled to deliver his annual
State of the Union address to a joint meeting of the House and
Senate on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican senators indicated their awareness of the
historical dimensions surrounding the question of whether to remove
a president from office for the first time in American history.
President Richard M. Nixon resigned in 1974 before a Senate trial
on House impeachment charges. President Andrew Johnson avoided
ouster by a single vote in his impeachment trial in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said the Senate would only move to
remove the president ``if the case holds together'' and a
bipartisan consensus builds to a ``vote way beyond any partisan
calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith added: ``Knowing the popular will, I'd be very relieved if
the president's lawyers could present reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., said he was not sure ``if the
country is ever ready for that sort of thing,'' adding: ``That is
``why this is such a gritty, difficult process for us all.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House sought to fuel such concerns. Gregory Craig, the
White House lawyer leading Clinton's battle against impeachment,
emerged from Saturday's proceedings to insist that House
prosecutors failed to make the case for ``nullifying the results of
a national election.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig added: ``The House Republicans' case ends as it began _ an
unsubstantiated circumstantial case that does not meet the
constitutional standard to remove the president from office.''

</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., remain at odds over fast-forwarding
Senate preparations to hear the witnesses sought by House
prosecutors. Lott suggested a bipartisan panel of senators to
``resolve in advance'' arrangements for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle countered, in the leaders' exchange of letters, that
creating such a panel now would ``violate the bipartisan
agreement'' on the timetable for consideration of witnesses that
was reached on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle added: ``It is my hope that such arrangements will
ultimately prove unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled to take up the question of witnesses on
Jan. 25, with a majority vote of 51 senators required to call a
witness. Republicans hold 55 seats; Democrats hold 45 seats.
</P>
<P>
   To muster the 67 votes needed to remove Clinton from office,
Republicans would have to remain unified and enlist 12 Democratic
defectors.

 &HT;    The continuing ``Dan and John'' soap opera
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Just call it ``Dan and John.'' It is a soap opera that
sits only two victories away today from creating the most awkward
Super Bowl moments in 18 years. That's when NFL boss Pete Rozelle
nearly held his nose while handing the Vince Lombardi Trophy to foe
Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're bracing for that soap opera, but only if coach Dan
Reeves' Falcons survive in Minnesota during the NFC Championship
Game and quarterback John Elway's Broncos ground the Jets for the
AFC title.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for the next two weeks along the way to that little game
in Miami, we'll have Dan and John, Dan and John, Dan and John. They
aren't bosom buddies, but there is something interesting here.
</P>
<P>
   Since these are supposedly the final days of Elway as the
Broncos' designated savior, his career is in full review throughout
the Rocky Mountains. Local TV stations have evolved into Elway
Central, and most of the highlights featuring Elway's 16 seasons
with the Broncos are from that opening decade of Dan and John.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is prospering in his second season with the Falcons after
four years with the New York Giants. Before that, Reeves spent a
dozen years through 1992 leading the Broncos to four AFC
Championship Games, three Super Bowl trips and five AFC West
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Elway likes to think that he was responsible for most of
the Broncos' goodness back then. Plus, since Reeves' firing by the
Broncos after the 1992 season, Elway has suggested that working for
Reeves was like shoving an upright down your throat.
</P>
<P>
   Elway sits behind Dan Marino in many of the NFL's all-time
records for quarterbacks. Still, to hear Elway tell it, Marino
would be chasing Elway in those categories if Elway hadn't spent
all of those seasons under the run-oriented Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   There also was Reeves' ousting of Mike Shanahan, the Broncos'
offensive coordinator and Elway's buddy, after the 1991 season.
Among other things, the coach said his trusted assistant for seven
years and his ungrateful quarterback forever were scripting plays
behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, this soap opera could be ``Dan, John and
Mike,'' since Shanahan is in his fourth season as the Broncos' head
coach. While Reeves is a three-time loser in Super Bowls, Shanahan
won his first and only try at a world championship last season.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Elway's glee. Thus the possibility of this soap opera
making Rozelle and Davis resemble Laurel and Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to Super Bowl XV, Davis battled Rozelle over the
right to move the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. Then the
Raiders did the unthinkable by winning it all as a wild-card team
to force that face-to-face meeting between Rozelle and Davis on the
victory stand.
</P>
<P>
   That was tension. This could be worse. After the Broncos handled
the Falcons at the Georgia Dome last season, Reeves shook hands
with each of his former players but one.
</P>
<P>
   You've guessed it. So we held our breath this weekend after we
asked Elway if he'd talked with Reeves since his former coach
underwent quadruple heart surgery last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I haven't,'' said Elway, quickly, before we asked him
about Reeves' success with the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done great,'' Elway said, smiling, before moving toward
his car in the distance. ``You have to give him credit for what
he's accomplished with them after just two years.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe ``Dan and John'' wouldn't be a soap opera. Then again,
maybe it will never snow again in Colorado.

<P>
   FBN-NFC-REEVES _ When Dan Reeves took the Falcons job two years
ago, he knew he would be coming back to his home state of Georgia.
But he didn't realize the true impact of ``home'' until he was
forced five weeks ago to undergo heart bypass surgery. Because of
the Falcons' success, Reeves had a good number of Georgians in his
corner. But his emotional press conference post-surgery galvanized
the entire state. Reeves said the experience changed his outlook
because he never could imagine how many Georgians genuinely cared.
As he uses all his postseason experience to prepare for the biggest
game in Falcons history, he's living an unusual love story.

   w/FBN-NFC-SOUND _ The Falcons spent much of the week practicing
in front of huge speakers that were shaking with the vibes of a
747. It's still no match for what the team can expect in the
Metrodome, the loudest venue in sports. The Braves dealt with it
once; the Falcons deal with it on Sunday. (Stinson, Atlanta

   FBN-NFC-BESTSEAT _ The best seat in the house for a pro football
game is ... in your living room. TV coverage has become so

day. Whether its a shot between the legs of the center on a fumbled
snap, or a player kicking a water cooler on the sidelines, they
catch it all. A look at the technology that brings the game to you.

   FBN-NFC-BIGKICK _ For 14 years, Falcons place-kicker Morten
Anderson has dreamed of making the game-winning kick and sending
the Saints or Falcons to the Super Bowl. For 13 years, he never

results often hinge on the final kick. Anderson is aware of that

Summer and Winter Games to bid cities got to the mess it's in
today. It wasn't always this way, with Los Angeles getting the '84
Summer Games almost by default because no other city wanted it. But
when LA showed cities can profit in many ways from the Games, the
floodgates opened and IOC members took advantage by profiting from
the new era. Atlanta played the game in the mid-1980s, with
southern hospitality that included plenty of gift-giving and
privileges. And apparently Salt Lake took it to unprecedented
heights with what would be considered bribes. It remains to be seen
if some of Salt Lake's predecessors also crossed the line. Story
will offer new details on how Atlanta played the game, such as
first-class airline tickets that members cahsed in, and point out
that Atlanta apparently is not the focus on any investigation yet.

   w/OLY-GANGA _ ATLANTA _ Jean-Claude Ganga, in the firing line of

Atlanta land the '96 Games by delivering the African nations vote.
He is a friend of former mayor Andy Young and has had relationships
with several people close to Young. He received a marketing deal
with ACOP for African products at the Games. Ganga was at the very
least a contact for an Atlanta company trying to do business in the
Congo, as a result of a relationship made during the bid process.
And he still has ties to Atlanta, with he and Shirley Franklin
having set up the non-profit USA/Africa Sports Development Fund in

   HOUSTON _ At first glance, it is hard to tell a baby is there.
</P>
<P>
   Then the clues come from following the tubes that blow air into
the baby's tiny nostrils. Another tube carries nutrients into a
vein. The boy has black hair. He is barely a foot long. He is
curled up on a pillow and strapped in a cloth bumper, dotted with
hearts, to keep his arms and legs in the same flexed position they
were in in the womb. As he sleeps beneath a radiant warmer in the
dark and quiet room, machines track his skin temperature, heart
rate, blood pressure, oxygen level and other vital measurements.
Two Beanie Babies lie nearby. One toy serves an extra function: the
Beanie's weight holds the air tubes in place.
</P>
<P>
   Above, a cardboard sign identifies him as Baby F, or Ikem. At 1
pound 7 ounces, he is the smallest of the seven surviving octuplets
born here last month. On Friday night, when Ikem developed signs of
an infection, doctors began administering antibiotics and stopped
his feeding. When the infection subsides, in two to three days,
feeding will resume. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The strongest and largest, at 2 pounds 10 ounces, is his only
brother, Jioke. He rests in a similar warmer in the same room. The
five surviving sisters are in nearby rooms. The babies are turned
from time to time. As a nurse starts the task, she playfully offers
a finger, and the baby's hand grasps it.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving octuplets look and sound like babies, just
miniature ones. Sometimes they open their eyes and look around.
When bothered, they cry.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the eight babies, Ebuka, a girl, was born on Dec.
8, nearly four months earlier than the mother's due date of April
1. The mother, Nkem Chukwu had been treated at the MacGregor
Fertility Clinic in Houston and because of religious beliefs had
rejected the idea of destroying any of the fetuses to give the
others a greater chance of survival. The seven others were born on
Dec. 20, making them the world's first set of octuplets to be born
alive. The largest weighed less than 2 pounds. The smallest, a girl
named Odera, weighed 10.3 ounces and died on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The births made the octuplets an immediate sensation in the news
and renewed the debate about fertility drugs and their enormous
medical and human costs, but here in the neonatal intensive care
unit on the fourth floor of Texas Children's Hospital, the glare of
world attention fades away next to the blip of the infant monitors.
Now, although two babies remain under a pound and a half, all are
gaining weight, ounce by ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chukwu, 27, has visited regularly since her discharge from
the hospital on Dec. 30. When she can hold one of the infants, she
sits in a chair, unbuttons her blouse and touches the baby against
her chest. She does not try to nurse them; the babies cannot yet
suck and swallow well enough. It takes about 20 minutes for the
nurses, who must keep the tubes and wires connected, to get a baby
into her arms.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Iyke Louis Udobi, a respiratory therapist, also
visits and touches the infants. The parents, American citizens born
in Nigeria, gave the babies Nigerian names based on the
characteristics of God.
</P>
<P>
   The babies have a 95 percent chance of surviving to their
expected discharge in late March, said Dr. Leonard E. Weisman, the
head of the neonatal unit. As he led a visiting doctor through the
unit, Weisman said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' that the
babies, all listed in critical condition, would turn out normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a 10 percent or so risk of some long-term
problems, but I hope we are not going to see anything like
blindness, deafness, mental retardation or severe cerebral palsy,''
Weisman said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his 25-year experience as a pediatrician, Weisman
added: ``You learn in this business that things can turn on a
dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisman based his prediction on his study of 1,925 premature
infants the Texas Children's Hospital treated from 1986 through
1994, and reported last June in Pediatrics, a scientific journal.
Texas Children's describes itself as the largest pediatric hospital
in the United States. Of the hospital's 456 beds, 120 are for those
needing the most intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patti M. Savrick, the pediatrician who will care for the
babies after their discharge, said: ``By the time they are 2 to 3
years old, they are going to be good, normal kids, barring any
unforeseen disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Savrick said her optimism was based in part on an ultrasound
test of each baby's head that was performed about a week after
their birth. The test is a strong predictor of serious neurological
problems. When no baby showed evidence of bleeding or cysts, ``that
was dramatically good news,'' Dr. Savrick said. Her practice
includes five surviving sextuplets, two sets of quadruplets and
many sets of triplets and twins.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman credited a drug, surfactant, that supplies a missing
component to premature infants with underdeveloped lungs, as
``certainly the No. 1 reason that these kids are doing as well as
they are.'' Surfactant, which was first marketed in 1990, was given
in the first day of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Two octuplets have had general anesthesia for surgery. Eboka had
heart surgery as a 3-day-old to close a blood vessel (patent ductus
arteriosus) in her heart that failed to do so on its own. The other
was to repair a hole in Gorom's small intestine that was recognized
when her belly swelled and an X-ray showed air present where it was
not supposed to be. Both operations were performed at the bedside,
as is often the case for premature infants.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven surviving octuplets, six had good scores on the
10-point Apgar scale of a newborn's health, 8s or 9s at five
minutes; Gorom was rated at 6.
</P>
<P>
   All received antibiotics for the first two days after birth
because the doctors did not know whether an infection caused the
mother to go into labor. Two babies developed infections later.
</P>
<P>
   All are fed intravenously. In addition, the mother brings in
breast milk to the hospital. For now, the milk is given through a
tube into the stomach of each infant. In about a month the babies
will start feeding by mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, all the babies breathed with the aid of mechanical
ventilators. Now the surviving octuplets breathe on their own. A
pump blows air through the tubing to help keep their chest walls
from collapsing. The babies also receive caffeine to prevent apnea
and stimulate their breathing. As the babies grow and strengthen
their underdeveloped chest muscles in the next few weeks, the air
tubes will be removed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-OCTUPLETS-SURVIVE-ART-2NDTAKE-1STLD-WRITETHRU-NYT &QL; 
HOUSTON: be removed. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In less than a month, Dr. David K. Coats, a pediatric
ophthalmologist, will start dilating the infants' eyes each week or
two to check for a potentially blinding condition, retinopathy of
prematurity.
</P>
<P>
   A mild form of the condition develops in most premature babies.
But in about 9 percent it is severe enough to require treatment
with either a laser or freezing technique. The aim is to prevent
detachment of the retina. But treatment fails in about 10 percent
of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Some premature babies who do not develop the retinopathy
condition later develop weak eye muscles as young children.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors also will test the babies' hearing by putting sounds
in their ears and then measuring brain wave responses in a
technique known as brain stem auditory evoked response. The risk of
deafness and severe hearing problems is about 4 percent, Weisman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheezing from a chronic lung disease resembling asthma is among
the babies' other potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the octuplets' problems, like immature lungs, a
perforated intestine and the heart vessel condition, are those
faced by any premature infant. Some problems were compounded by
their numbers. Multiple fetuses create a crowded womb, which
increases the risk of growth retardation. Multiple fetuses also
increase the likelihood that the babies will be born prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman estimated the total cost for the octuplets at about $2
million. It will be covered by the health insurance that the father
receives through his work as a respiratory therapist for a local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the costs are almost irrelevant. ``The expense, as
large as it is,'' Weisman said, ``has to be measured over the
babies' lifetimes.''

EMERGING STANDARD CAN HELP HOUSE IN FUTURE IMPEACHMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds: Sub to include updated material) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When 100 senators vote on President Clinton's fate,
perhaps by the end of the month, they will fashion their own
definitions of high crimes and misdemeanors, the constitutional
standard for removing a president.
</P>
<P>
   And, in so doing, a standard will emerge that the House can
weigh the next time it considers impeaching a president and sending
the case to trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Described by late 19th-century historian James Bryce as ``the
heaviest piece of artillery in the congressional arsenal,''
impeachment has never before been fully employed against an elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon short-circuited the process by resigning in 1974
and Andrew Johnson, who survived the only other Senate trial by one
vote in 1868, took power after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't visit an issue once every century and a half and
feel that you are comfortable with it,'' said Sen. Dick Durbin,
D-Illinois. ``We have some guidance but certainly not a body of law
to turn to. I hope we don't have another impeachment trial for
another century, at least.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors, who finished their opening presentation
Saturday, argue that the presidency has been weakened by Clinton's
acknowledged misbehavior in the wake of his consensual extramarital
affair and that not removing him from office will make future
presidents untouchable by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar will be so high that only a convicted felon or a
traitor will need to be concerned,'' the prosecutors said. ``If
this is not enough, what is?''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which begins making its case Tuesday, contends
that removing Clinton on the evidence outlined by the House would
``substantially alter the delicate constitutional balance'' between
the Congress and the nation's chief executive. It would lower the
bar to a point where presidents could remain in office ``only at
the pleasure of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional experts dismiss these arguments as hyperbole
largely because of how the impeachment process is structured and
because there are never any assurances that whatever standard
emerges from Senate deliberations will be used by the House the
next time it calls for removal of the nation's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``While comity certainly is something we encourage and expect in
relations between the House and Senate, there is no constitutional
obligation for one to follow the expressed wishes of the other,''
said Victor Rosenblum, a law professor at Northwestern University.
``Each case is new as it arises.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment was written into the Constitution more than two
centuries ago as a way of reining in corrupt chief executives,
Cabinet members and federal judges. The Senate was picked by the
founding fathers to try impeachment cases because it was believed
to be less susceptible to popular passions than the House.
</P>
<P>
   The two-step process _ impeachment by a House majority, trial by
the Senate with a two-thirds vote required for conviction _ has
been used 14 times in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ the nation's 42nd president _ faces two articles of
impeachment, which were approved in close to a party-line vote by
the House four weeks ago. The articles allege that Clinton
committed perjury and obstructed justice in trying to hide his
White House affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already we've seen a lowering of the standard for
impeachment,'' said Bruce J. Schulman, a history professor at
Boston University. ``If Clinton is removed, then we will have
established a precedent for removing a president from office for
misconduct, which we've never done before. It will alter the
balance between the branches'' of government.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Bond, a political science professor at Texas A&AMP;M University,
said the bar for impeachment ``has been lowered by the House, but
by how much depends on how you weigh the other two cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was impeached largely because of disagreements with
radical House Republicans over reconstruction policies toward the
states of the former confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Nixon grew out of hearings pushed by
congressional Democrats that unearthed presidential misuse of
federal agencies and a conspiracy to cover up administration
involvement in the Watergate burglary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scales are imprecise. ... The Clinton case is between
those two types, but closer to the Johnson end in terms of
partisanship,'' Bond said. ``If we want to preserve this system of
government with its separation of powers, it's equal branches of
government, what we can hope for is that the Senate will dismiss
this case fairly quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although conventional wisdom holds that the Senate will come up
short of the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton and terminate his
presidency, no one expected his sexual misbehavior with a woman
half his age to snowball into a Senate trial while two-thirds of
the public approves of his job performance.
</P>
<P>
   While some pundits call the Clinton scandal and impeachment a
constitutional crisis, Ross Baker of Rutgers University dismisses
the characterization. ``A constitutional crisis occurs when the 2nd
Infantry shows up on the west lawn of the Capitol,'' Baker said.
``What we have going on in Washington is the normal functioning of
a process proscribed in the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the Senate's decision on Clinton's fate cannot be
appealed, the entire imbroglio ``has its costs,'' said Baker, a
political science professor. ``If the Republicans are determined
that the president must be removed from office, and he's as popular
as Clinton is, and people remember that in 2000, Congress will be
punished in the elections. It's one of the checks and balances
built into our system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of the checks against abuse of power is the requirement
that both the House and Senate vote to remove a president.
``Presumably, the two-part system of impeachment (by the House) and
Senate trial is designed to winnow out the frivolous
impeachments,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The first chance the 55 Republican and 45 Democratic senators
have to signal their intentions on Clinton's case will come Jan.
25, when they will consider motions to dismiss the case or to
proceed and summon witnesses, which are to be decided by majority
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and most Senate Democrats fear live testimony
will drag out the trial and could dredge up more damaging evidence
against Clinton. Some Republicans insist, however, that only a
full-scale trial with witnesses such as Lewinsky will do. &QL;

BRAZIL LOOKS TO IMF FOR MORE RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BRAZIL-ECON) 
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Brazil's Finance Minister began talks here
Saturday with the International Monetary Fund and said he might ask
for early release of the next round of international assistance to
the country to help stabilize its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Minister, Pedro Malan, spoke a day after Brazil
dropped efforts to defend the value of its currency, raising fears
of another bout of global financial turmoil and economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials said they had no comment on the meetings Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Malan and other members of Brazil's delegation will also meet on
Sunday with Clinton administration officials, including Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, to review plans for
addressing Brazil's economic problems and carrying out a strategy
for managing its currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
   Malan said Brazil would unveil a new approach to stabilizing the
currency on Monday. Options range from allowing the real to float
in response to market forces, creating a range of values that the
government would try to maintain, to fixing the currency at a
specified level.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the United States and the fund have made clear
that they will press Brazil to take rapid steps to reduce its huge
budget deficit through tax increases and spending cuts as a first
step toward restoring international confidence. The faltering pace
of efforts to improve the country's fiscal condition was behind the
intense market pressure to devalue the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Malan reiterated that President Fernando Enrique Cardoso
remained committed to the fiscal program Brazil agreed on with the
fund, despite intense political opposition at home. Doubts about
Cardoso's ability to carry out the program came to a head this
month when the new governor of Brazil's second-largest state, Minas
Gerais, imposed a moratorium on his state's payments to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   About $9 billion of the $41.5 billion aid package to Brazil has
been disbursed, and $9 billion more could be released next month if
the fund and donor nations, including the United States, agree that
Brazil is making progress toward its fiscal goals.

had put the final flourishes on their three-day presentation
accusing President Clinton of high crimes and misdemeanors, several
prominent Senate Democrats were already asserting they had heard
nothing new. But while the Republican prosecutors may not have
changed many Democratic minds about the allegations against
Clinton, they appear to have made great strides toward achieving
their most crucial short-term goal: convincing enough Senate
Republicans that they must hear from live witnesses to reach a
verdict. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

Georgia's welfare program. (Oglesby, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

will address human rights, poverty and the economy, religious
competition, abortion -- or even drug trafficking -- during his
visit. The visit marks the closure of a bishops' conference on
challenges to the Catholic church in the Americas. In addition to
church business, however, the frail Catholic leader often comments
on broader questions of social policy. A Catholic Diocese in
Mexico's Southern Chiapas state, is hoping the Pope will take on
the Mexican government and the long-simmering Chiapas conflict,
which has led to the expulsion and imprisonment of Catholic
priests. The Diocese may present a report to the Pope claiming that
Chiapas' poor and Indian populations are victims of human rights
violations, haphazard free-market economic policies and the
corruption of drug traffickers. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   w/CUBA-POPE _ HAVANA, Cuba _ It's been one year since Pope John
Paul II made his historic visit to Cuba. The visit brought a new
atmosphere of openness and reform to Cuba's one-party Marxist
society. But the church and the state are still in a tug-of-war
over just how much religious freedom should be allowed on the
island. While Cuba has released some political prisoners and has
granted visas for some foreign priests, the church remains closely
restricted by the state. We'll talk to church officials in Cuba and
in the United States to examine the events of the last year.

This slump is psychological, physical, and seasonal, industrial
psychologists say. Cold temperatures and shorter days, less
sullight, aren't helping. How do you get back into the swing of

   COLLEGE-TAXES _ Interest is growing in a first-class way to save

Hundreds of thousands of families now pour their money into the

anything in life. But it has some uncommonly attractive features,

   SAVINGS _ U.S. Savings Bonds, an old-fashioned investment, have
gone electronic. Although they pay rates of return below most
private investments, millions have been purchased over the years
because of their simplicity as an investment and because of their
Uncle Sam-guaranteed safety. But for many would-be investors in the
past, there was a problem: How to buy Savings Bonds. They could buy
them through a bank or broker, or through payroll deduction at
work. But about 120 million Americans worked for companies without
payroll deduction for the bonds. Last month, the U.S. Treasury
initiated the EasySaver Plan for Savings Bonds, which allows
investors to buy the bonds by authorizing the agency to deduct a
set amount each month from their checking account to pay for them.

THIS TIME, PITTSBURGH IS NO THREAT TO UCONN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ This time, there was no need for dramatics, no
cause for scoring 5 points in the final 10 seconds and almost no
point in watching the second half at all.
</P>
<P>
   Just one month after Pittsburgh gave No. 1 Connecticut its
toughest test of the undefeated season, the Panthers lost to the
Huskies on Saturday the way most of the others have this season:
without much of a fight and looking befuddled. The final score was
81-58, but this game was over long before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Those who watched as Connecticut (15-0, 7-0) pulled out an
emotional, nail-biting 1-point victory before hostile fans at
Pittsburgh on Dec. 12 perhaps thought Saturday's game would have be
a classic rematch, full of running and gunning by two of the Big
East's fastest teams.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the first game's dramatics were such that they were
punctuated by a chest-thumping victory dance atop the scorer's
table by the Huskies' Khalid El-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh, which beat Kentucky early in the season, has never
recovered its confidence since the devastating loss to UConn and
has dropped to 9-7 with just one victory in six Big East games. The
16,294 fans at the Hartford Civic Center saw a deflated Pittsburgh
team , its tentativeness showing almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, who did not arrive until 1:15 a.m. Saturday
because of weather-related travel difficulties, never got into an
offensive rhythm. Under Connecticut's pressure defense, the
Panthers struggled to keep a handle on the ball and rarely got a
good look at the basket from close in, putting up terrible shots
and shooting just 29.4 percent from the field and 1 of 8 from the
3-point arc in the first half. They did not break the 20-point mark
until 2 minutes 55 seconds were left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun praised his team's defensive
effort, particularly center Jake Voskuhl.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to the rim and he is in the game, you're going
to have to go through him,'' Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies were slowed from establishing their fleet-footed
game by Pitt's foul-laden first half. The Panthers had 10 fouls by
7:32 of the game and the Huskies went to the line 20 times to
Pitt's 4 in the first half, Connecticut shot just 41.9 percent from
the field and showed just enough of its dominating game to put
together a 14-0 run that sank Pitt into a 20-point hole with 4
minutes left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Connecticut's early highlight reel plays came back to
back when Richard Hamilton, who was shut out in the first half,
sent a perfect bounce pass into Voskuhl for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, after Pittsburgh failed on two awful shots,
Hamilton grabbed the rebound and launched an outlet pass to
El-Amin, already running for the fast break. He sent a pass back to
Kevin Freeman in the lane for a monstrous dunk that opened the lead
to 25-11 with 7:51 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team can beat you in a lot of different ways,''
Pittsburgh Coach Ralph Willard said.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any link between the games these teams played this
season against each other, it was sophomore guard Albert Mouring.
In the first game, he hit the 3-pointer with 9seconds left to close
Pittsburgh's lead to 1 point.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he was the leading scorer in the first half with 13
points, including three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   How inept was Pittsburgh? Even after it quickly scored 6 points
in 25 seconds with 2:55 left in the first half, the Panthers still
trailed by 14. Calhoun had pre-game concerns that his team was
perhaps being lulled into overconfidence by the ease of its
victories. But that seemed to be the sign of coach struggling to
find something to worry about in what has all the marks of being a
magical season.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Connecticut was able to use play its
wide-open offense more to inflate the lead to 28 points. So
multifaceted is Connecticut's attack that even when Hamilton, a
player of the year candidate, is held to only 5 points, there is no
reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl had 14 points and 12 rebounds, El-Amin had 17 points and
Mouring had a career-high 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies led in every statistical category: free throws
attempted (an astounding 35 to 6 margin), second-chance points (21
to 12) and points in the paint (40 to 32).
</P>
<P>
   There were no dramatics this time. The only concern was Calhoun
fretting that his team appeared to be running up the score.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Summarizing the Republican case against President
Clinton in a speech evoking the shades of heroes past, Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., said Saturday afternoon that the presidency could be
``permanently damaged'' if the Senate failed to remove Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``My solitary, solitary hope is that a hundred years from today,
people will look back at what we have done and say, `They kept the
faith,''' Hyde, the chief prosecutor, declared in an
emotion-drenched peroration.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over impeachment, Hyde said one last time, was not
about sex but about ``the rule of law'' _ ``one of the great
achievements of our civilization.'' He accused Clinton of fraying
the essential bonds of trust between those who govern the United
States and those who are governed. And he asserted that having ``a
presidential perjurer'' in the White House meant that ``America can
no longer be trusted'' in the world's councils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your judgment should rise above politics, above partisanship,
above polling data,'' Hyde told the Senate. ``This case is a test
of whether what the Founding Fathers described as `sacred honor'
still has meaning in our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., brought the Republican case to a
crescendo Saturday morning with the declaration that the president
must be removed because he had ``made himself a notorious example
of lawlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening the last of three days of the Republican presentation of
the impeachment case against Clinton, Canady, like Clinton a
graduate of Yale Law School, also argued that the Senate could not
set a lower standard for a president than for judges who have been
ousted in recent years for making false statements under oath.
Clinton is accused in one impeachment article of committing perjury
in his testimony to the grand jury investigating his sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, it will be Clinton's turn to make his case through
his lawyers, starting on Tuesday, hours before his State of the
Union Message.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's speech was a stemwinder from another era, a florid
20-minute throwback to the days of perfervid orators like William
Jennings Bryan _ moving to some in the chamber and no doubt outside
it, banal to others. Stocky and silver-haired, sometimes seemingly
on the verge of choking up, Hyde pulled out every stop on the
rhetorical organ, recalling Bunker Hill and Flanders Field and
Normandy, Saigon and Desert Storm, the Ten Commandments and Magna
Carta, Mosaic law and Roman law, the Gettysburg address and the
Spirit of '76.
</P>
<P>
   He complained about what he called ``massive and relentless
efforts to change the subject'' by the president's lawyers, and he
said it was a disservice to the House to suggest, as some Democrats
have, that ``it has brought these articles of impeachment before
you in a frivolous, mean-spirited or irresponsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Hyde read a letter from William Summers, a 13-year-old
third-grader in Room 304 at Chase Elementary School in Chicago, who
asked him, ``If you cannot believe the president, who can you
believe? If you have no one to believe in, then how do you run your
life?''
</P>
<P>
   Canady and two colleagues on the panel of House managers, Reps.
Steve Buyer, R-Ind., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., sought to
pre-emptively rebut arguments of Clinton's defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Citing British and American authorities in a session that often
turned the Senate chamber into a constitutional history classroom,
they contended that the offenses Clinton is accused of, perjury and
obstruction of justice, met the constitutional standard of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' for impeachment; that missteps in
Clinton's private life had led to crimes in his public capacity;
that the Senate had convicted judges in recent years for analogous
offenses, and that if Clinton was guilty he must not be allowed to
remain in the White House, as Canady put it, ``in all his infamy.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has argued from the start that even if guilty,
nothing Clinton did justified the removal from office of a popular
president, twice endorsed by a national electorate. It was that
argument, which Buyer termed the ``so-what'' argument, that the
three sought to nail today.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer (pronounced BOO-yer) attacked on a number of levels at
once, urging the senators not to give way to any of several double
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In response to those who note that perjury, unlike treason and
bribery, is not enumerated in the Constitution among ``high crimes
and misdemeanors,'' Buyer cited Sir William Blackstone, the great
18th-century English jurist whose book of legal commentaries, James
Madison wrote, was ``in every man's hand'' as the constitutional
draftsmen went about their labors.
</P>
<P>
   Blackstone, Buyer said, included perjury among his list of
public offenses, placing bribery and perjury side by side. From
there, he jumped to the assertion that ``there is no difference''
between ``sitting before a federal judge and perjuring oneself''
and offering that judge a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging widely, Buyer quoted Black's Legal Dictionary, Gen.
Douglas MacArthur, John Adams and, on the seriousness of perjury
and obstruction of justice, former Attorney General Griffin Bell, a
Democrat. Bell, he said, had reached the heart of the matter when
he declared, ``A president cannot faithfully execute the laws if he
himself is breaking them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now at least 115 persons serving sentences for
perjury in federal prisons,'' Buyer said. ``Where is the fairness
to these Americans, if they stay in jail and the president stays in
the Oval Office?''
</P>
<P>
   But Buyer laid special emphasis, of a kind that had not been
heard in the trial before, on the impact of Clinton's alleged
crimes on the armed services and women.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats continued to insist that the whole controversy
stemmed from a private sexual matter, and was therefore beneath
constitutional notice, Buyer demanded, did that mean that the
evidence-gathering process in federal sexual harassment cases, like
the one brought against Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones, which led to
the Lewinsky case, was unimportant?
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of The Citadel, the South Carolina military college,
and a veteran of the Persian Gulf war, Buyer argued that Clinton's
``diminished veracity'' had had an ``inherently corrosive'' effect
on his capacity to function effectively as commander in chief and
to carry out his foreign policy duties.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Buyer said, American military personnel everywhere
``know that, if accused of the same offenses as their commander in
chief, they would no longer be deserving of the privilege of
serving in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, much the folksiest of the 13 managers, was assigned to
explore Senate precedent, and he did so. He dutifully noted that
Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada had been removed in 1986, for
filing a false income-tax return ``under penalties of perjury.'' He
noted that Judge Walter Nixon of Mississippi had been removed in
1989, for lying to a grand jury about his efforts to fix a friend's
son's case in state court. And he noted that Judge Alcee Hastings
of Florida had been removed, also in 1989, for perjury and
conspiracy to obtain a bribe.

 WASHINGTON: a bribe.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All three cases set significant precedents for this case, Graham
said. But he laid special emphasis on a statement by former Sen.
Charles Mathias of Maryland in the Claiborne case. Mathias, one of
the prosecutors in that matter, said the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachable conduct does not have to occur in the performance
of an officer's official duties. Evidence of misconduct,
misbehavior, high crimes and misdemeanors can be justified upon
one's private dealings as well as one's exercise of public
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense is rooted to a considerable degree in the
argument that the offenses charged do not involve official
misconduct. Today, his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the final
presentations constituted ``a clear concession and admission that
their case isn't strong enough without witnesses.'' The White House
and most Democrats oppose calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Hastings had been acquitted in criminal court,
Graham drew the lesson that crime was not a prerequisite to
impeachment, because, he said: ``Impeachment is not punishment.
Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about
restoring honor and integrity to the office.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graham also made a broader point, much at variance with the
apocalyptic tone of most of his Republican colleagues' remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what you decide,'' he told the senators who sat
silently in judgment of a president whom all of them knew, ``this
country will survive. If you acquit the president, we will survive.
If you convict him, it will be traumatic, but we will survive.
There is a calmness in the midst of something so important as this
that tells me we've done it right for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Canady's turn came, he gave perhaps the most lawyerly
speech of the whole three-day process _ tight, well-organized and
thoroughly documented. Whether he changed senatorial minds remained
unfathomable, as has been the case throughout the trial. One
Democrat, Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, said he thought
``the unpersuaded mostly remain unpersuaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady argued that the purpose of the power to remove officials
granted to the Senate is ``to preserve, protect and strengthen our
Constitution by setting a standard of conduct for public
officials.'' Clinton, he said, had failed to meet that standard, as
construed in the light of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the claims of the president's lawyers,'' he said,
``there is not a bright line separating official misconduct by a
president from other misconduct of which the president is guilty.
It does violence to the English language to assert that a president
who has violated a duty entrusted to him by the Constitution is not
guilty of official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have been reminded repeatedly, the Constitution imposes
on the president the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed. A president who commits a calculated and sustained series
of criminal offenses has, by his personal violations of the law,
failed in the most immediate, direct and culpable manner to do his
duty under the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady reviewed at length the concept of impeachment as it
evolved in England, notably in proceedings against Warren Hastings,
who was on trial during the Constitutional Convention. Then he
plunged into an example of the Framers' intent, one of the most
vexed questions in the whole debate.
</P>
<P>
   He relied heavily on comments by James Iredell, later a Supreme
Court justice, at the North Carolina ratifying convention. Iredell
argued that if a president ``commits any misdemeanor in office, he
is impeachable'' and that ``if a man be a villain and willfully
abuse his trust, he is to be held up as a public offender and
ignominiously punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady cited Alexander Hamilton, often invoked for opposite
reasons by the Clinton supporters, to the effect that the
impeachment power focused on ``the misconduct of public men,''
which, Canady said, ``encompasses a whole range of wrongful deeds
committed by those who hold office when those offenses were
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding what standard of behavior would be applied to
Clinton, Canady said, ``The choice the Senate makes will have
consequences reverberating far into the future of our republic.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one senator was absent from Saturday's proceedings.
Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, returned to Hawaii for the funeral of
an aunt, said a spokeswoman for the senator. Inouye will be in
Washington when the Senate trial resumes on Tuesday.

COMMENTARY: SOFT-PORN NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 13th graf, The House managers ..., to restore first
reference for McCollum.) 
 (JT) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the time we got to Bob Barr, I had become a
desperate woman. I felt trapped, panicky, short of breath.
</P>
<P>
   I could only imagine how the senators felt about having to sit
silently through these excruciating recitations of the obvious and
the irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is an undeniable appeal to the notion of
enforced silence on the usually prolix senators _ the equivalent of
a national mute button _ the Trial of the Century is proving less
than scintillating.
</P>
<P>
   It suddenly seems essential that we figure out a way never, ever
to have to go through such a ludicrous, stupefying display again.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican House managers were acting like ugly Americans
abroad who think that if they talk loudly and slowly, foreigners
will understand them.
</P>
<P>
   We expected the GOP congressmen to explain themselves. But they
just kept repeating themselves, waving expanding pointer pens,
brandishing charts and helpfully pointing out to 100 of the top
elected officials in our land that the list on the first two pages
of the House impeachment report was called ``The Table of
Contents.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did we learn after these two ``historic'' days?
President Clinton lied. He was alone with Monica Lewinsky and
played with her sexually. He coached Betty Currie and enlisted
Vernon Jordan in a job search for his playmate. He has a
complicated understanding of the word ``is.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Republicans have not pointed out that the earth is
round, but the proceedings are young.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr and the rabid Republicans keep trying to present
the president's behavior as a deep, dark plot. But the more you
hear them tell it, the more it sounds like what it was: a powerful
but weak-willed guy scrambling not to get caught in a deeply
humiliating mess.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a conspiracy. It's a cliche.
</P>
<P>
   They have made the case that Bill Clinton is selfish and
promiscuous. They have not made the case that two elections should
be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The senators have been sworn in as jurors, but the country has
already nullified the jury. Americans think Starr's investigation
was ugly and the House Republicans' impeachment was mean.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have been prattling about how no man should
be above the law, as they try to cloak politics in the sanctity of
a judicial proceeding. Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida even aimed his
pointer at a chart of federal sentencing guidelines for bribery,
witness tampering, obstruction of justice and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   But any pretense of judiciousness was lost when Republican
senators acting as jurors and Republican House members acting as
prosecutors met privately to plot trial strategy. (Too bad this is
a jury with no alternates.)
</P>
<P>
   Listening to McCollum say ``genitalia'' three times, ``oral
sex'' three times and ``breasts'' four times in the well of the
Senate, seeing the cascading confessions of Republicans about
illegitimate children and affairs, actually made me nostalgic for
what the good old boys keep telling me were the good old days, when
journalists looked the other way as politicians frolicked.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, those journalists were delinquent. But we're no better off
now that we get all the gory details, and no real perspective. Our
sexual auto-da-fe, in which every revelation about a politician's
private life becomes ammunition in the sulfurous partisan wars, is
enough to make the benign neglect of yesteryear look like a
democratic kind of discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a soft-porn nation, where New York hotels feature an
adult movie spoof of the Clinton White House called ``White House
Interns'' that competes with the somewhat less racy ``White House
Interns'' show on C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   The surfeit of sex comes with a surfeit of sanctimonious
pseudo-oratory, as when McCollum rhapsodized about ``a beautiful
panorama'' he saw on his drive to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before I got to the 14th Street Bridge,'' he told the
senators at the trial, ``I saw this incredible number of geese, I
guess in the hundreds, that were lined up ... They looked like they
were an invading army. And I thought of the awe of this, the beauty
of it, the awe of Mother Nature, the awe of God. And I thought also
of the awe of the responsibility to our children and our
grandchildren about what we are commencing today. This is an
awesome undertaking for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had better beware: What's good for the goose is
good for the gander, and besides, those geese might come home to
roost.

 &HT;    House sums up case for conviction
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has so damaged the presidency and
broken faith with the public that the Senate must convict him,
House Republican prosecutors said Saturday as they wrapped up their
case in the nation's second presidential impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Clinton a ``presidential perjurer,'' Rep. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.) warned that acquitting Clinton of charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice could permanently injure the presidency and
damage the nation's reputation abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency is an office of trust,'' said Hyde, chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, which evaluated the evidence amassed
against Clinton. ``To break that covenant of trust is to dissolve
the mortar that binds the foundation stones of our freedom into a
secure and solid edifice.''
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of presenting their case, the prosecutors
focused on morality and the Senate's duty to carry out the
impeachment process, rather than on the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not tolerate one law for the ruler and one for the
ruled,'' Hyde said in arguing for convicting the president of lying
under oath and obstructing justice in an effort to conceal his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinksy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us be clear: The vote you are asked to cast is, in the
final analysis, a vote about the rule of law,'' Hyde said. ``For
the alternative to the rule of law is the rule of raw power.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, and some Democrats, in the Senate said they were
impressed by the case put on by the House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tied all the bits and pieces systematically together,''
said Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.). But he added that he expected an
``ardent defense'' of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors put on a ``strong case and raised some
very serious issues,'' said Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) ``When you
see it unrebutted, it has a force to it, but I think we have to
wait and hear from the other side before making a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) was among several Democrats who were
unimpressed by the final day of argument from the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I thought was tedious and, ultimately, it got
defensive,'' Cleland said. He described Hyde's statement as ``a
good Rotary Club speech, but a weak argument for impeaching the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers will begin their presentation on
Tuesday, the same day Clinton is scheduled to give the State of the
Union address to a joint session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Once the defense finishes its presentations, senators will get
to question both sides, most likely next weekend. The White House
is then expected to move to dismiss the charges. At that point, the
Senate will decide whether to move forward by calling witnesses or
end the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 senators on Saturday appeared no closer to resolving the
contentious issue of whether to call witnesses. It is a divide that
appears to split mostly along partisan lines, with Democratic
senators opposing it and Republican senators saying it would
clarify disputed facts.
</P>
<P>
   The big question of the day was whether Clinton would be invited
to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a country we should invite the president,'' said
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
``There are significant contradictions that must be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has the right to require the president to appear, but
it would not likely do so, said Hatch and other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And invitation or no invitation, the president still can invoke
his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer (R-Ind.) led off the day's orations, saying the
president's offenses ``assault the administration of justice.'' And
upholding justice, Buyer argued, is an essential element of the
prosecution's case because without confidence in the judicial
system society cannot avoid the abuse of power by politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer told senators that viewing the Clinton sex scandal and
cover up as merely an illicit affair, ``demeans our civil rights
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What message does that send to the women in America?'' Buyer
said, raising the specter that Clinton's acquittal also would
threaten protections for minorities and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The senators began to visibly relax when Rep. Lindsey Graham
(R-S.C.) began his presentation. In a folksy manner, reminiscent of
Clinton's own way of reaching out to audiences, Graham left the
podium to speak to the senators, often looking at them eye to eye.
He spoke without notes and told stories about his own upbringing in
the South during the Civil Rights era.
</P>
<P>
   Graham recalled how blacks were banned from walking inside his
parents' ``beer joint'' for no reason other than that was ``the way
it is.'' It would be a ``travesty,'' Graham said, if that same
reason were used to excuse the president's action toward Paula
Jones, the former Arkansas employee who alleged the president
sexually harassed her. It was Jones' lawsuit that touched off a
chain of events that brought forth the impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   In making his case, Graham drew out the details of the
impeachment of three federal judges who were removed from the
bench, in part for lying under oath. He said the American people
would be well served by removing the president, and that the
country would survive if that happened.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady of Florida spent most of his time quoting
historians and politicians such as Alexander Hamilton to back up
his allegation that high crimes and misdemeanors have been
committed.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting John Jay, the first chief justice of the United States
Supreme Court, Canady said there is ``no crime more extensively
pernicious to society'' than perjury because it undermines the
faith the public has in the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The president should be removed from office, Canady asserted,
and the senate should not be influenced by Clinton's popularity and
the argument made by several prominent historians that the
institution of the presidency would be damaged if Clinton is forced
out.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the presentation was left to Hyde, whose 27-minute
speech about trust, honor and duty took senators to three military
cemeteries and included a letter from a Chicago third-grader who
suggested that Clinton write a 100-word essay as punishment for
telling lies.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde and Rep. George Gekas (R-Pa.), who preceded the
white-haired chairman, also took issue with those who have branded
the House Republicans ``Clinton-haters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said, ``I must tell you, distinguished senators, that this
impeachment is not...a question of hating anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House was unmoved by the impassioned plea for
removing Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three uninterrupted days...they have failed to meet
their burden,'' White House lawyer Gregory Craig said following
Hyde's summation.

 &HT;    Push for live witnesses grows stronger
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before House prosecutors had put the final
flourishes on their three-day presentation accusing President
Clinton of high crimes and misdemeanors, several prominent Senate
Democrats were already asserting they had heard nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Republican prosecutors may not have changed many
Democratic minds about the allegations against Clinton, they appear
to have made great strides toward achieving their most crucial
short-term goal: convincing enough Senate Republicans that they
must hear from live witnesses to reach a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Several wavering Republican senators, who had previously said
they were dubious about the prospect of witnesses, said they are
now convinced that they are a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now increasingly of the view that if the president's
lawyers don't' stipulate to the facts, live witnesses are the only
way to proceed,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one who was skeptical about witnesses,'' said Sen.
Robert Bennett (R-Utah). ``As I go through this, I'm moving towards
being in favor of the calling of witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though most Democrats have come out against witnesses,
a few, such as Sens. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), and Max Baucus (D-Mont.),
still refuse to rule out that witnesses will have to be called.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reluctance against witnesses, generally, in the
caucus,'' said Baucus. ``But I would also guess that there are some
senators who are reserving judgment on that issue, waiting to see
how things stack up and what the lay of the land is when we come to
that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors also appear to have succeeded in
ratcheting up the pressure on Clinton and his defense team, who
will open their case on behalf of the president Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who believes that a formidable case hasn't been made
just hasn't been listening,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the
influential chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``It's
incumbent on the president to show where these facts are wrong.
They are going to have to explain why this isn't perjury. They are
going to have to explain why this isn't obstruction of justice.
They are going to have to explain why this isn't witness
tampering.'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) said she wants the
White House to argue ``the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than just arguing what is impeachable, arguing the facts
on what was the perjury, what was the obstruction of justice is
important,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to have a point by point presentation and rebuttal
on the facts and the interpretation of the facts,'' said Graham,
who added that he was most troubled by the allegations that Clinton
may have sought to influence his personal secretary, Betty Currie,
to lie about Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their three days of presentations, the 13 House
prosecutors followed a two-track strategy. First, they sought to
make a compelling case that the president perjured himself and
obstructed justice in his efforts to conceal his relationship with
Lewinsky from Paula Jones in her federal sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Second, they sought to show that there were enough discrepancies
between Clinton's grand jury testimony and that of Lewinsky,
Currie, and friend Vernon Jordan, that live testimony was the only
way find the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a normal criminal trial, the House prosecution does not
have the discretion to call witnesses. Under the Senate impeachment
rules, the Senate must vote to call witnesses by a simple majority
of 51 senators. Each witness will be voted on separately.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats number only 45 in the Senate, so they need at least
six Republicans to vote against witnesses _ assuming that no
Democrats vote to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one Republican moderate is still undecided. ``I'm
not there yet,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine). ``I want to
hear the complete testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers have warned that calling witnesses will force
them to construct a far more extensive defense and drag out the
trial for months, an outcome that neither Republicans or Democrats
want.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett noted that under the Senate rules adopted before the
trial the calling of witnesses is actually a two-step process. The
Senate first votes to depose witnesses and then votes whether to
have them appear to give their testimony on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said that while he may vote for the first step, he may
not then find the need for the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm inclined to allow them to take depositions on those
witnesses, but I will reserve the right as to whether or not we
actually call them until after I have read the depositions,''
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding factor for many Republicans on the question of
witnesses appears to be how much of the factual record presented by
House prosecutors will be disputed by Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton's lawyers accept the factual interpretation of the
case laid out by the prosecutors _ which appears unlikely _ then
some senators believe there will be no need for witnesses. But if
the lawyers' dispute the facts, then they only way to resolve the
differences will be through witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the president contests _ or his lawyers
contest facts in the case, argue that there are conflicts in the
testimony or that there is confusion in the testimony, the House
will have a stronger case in arguing the need for witnesses to
clarify those confusions,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), one of
three Senate Republicans who have met with House prosecutors to
discuss the parameters for calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Republicans and Democrats won't begin discussing the
witness issue until at least Jan. 25, after senators have had an
opportunity to pose questions to House prosecutors and White House
defense attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Senate minority leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) on Friday again
rebuffed an invitation by majority leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) to
form a bi-partisan ``witness group'' to start negotiating the
parameters of witness testimony, saying such discussions should
only ocurr after the White House has presented its case and
senators have posed questions to both sides.

 &HT;    The crucial balance between politics and perfection
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Notable for their stateliness, among the various
actors who took their place this week on the stage of impeachment,
were the Official Reporters of Debate.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't a term for the tribe of journalists who have spent
the week chasing senators through the marble halls of the Capitol
and down to the congressional subway, hoping to coax something
off-the-cuff from senators and House members grimly determined to
avoid the unguarded remark.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it refers to the federal employees who stand in the
middle aisle of the Senate, steno machines slung around their necks
like xylophone players in a high school band, recording every word
of the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Every 10 minutes, with storklike grace, a fresh stenographer
would step quietly into place beside his or her colleague in a
seamless pass-off, the thousands upon thousands of words spent on
this matter unrolling on narrow spools of white paper.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters of debate were the physical embodiment of a
concept invoked over and over again by the House managers who made
their case against Bill Clinton: history, and the tremendous
responsibility of those whose deliberations will become a part of
the historical record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has a serious problem,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham of
South Carolina told the senators Saturday. ``I don't want my
country to be the country of equivocators and compartmentalizers
for the next century. And that's what this is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the House managers who presented the case this week was
given a specific legal assignment. It seemed clear that when Graham
addressed the Senate he was fulfilling a political assignment as
well, one that is crucial to the Republicans' case.
</P>
<P>
   In a confiding, Southern voice which invited comparison to
Clinton himself, Graham acknowledged that this is a popular
president, one who has gained particular recognition for advancing
the cause of civil rights. Graham said he didn't know if he agreed
with the Supreme Court's decision to let the Paula Jones case go
forward while the president was in office, and that he might have
told the same lies Clinton did if he'd been caught in an
embarrassing affair.
</P>
<P>
   But by lying to a grand jury eight months later, Graham said,
Clinton placed his personal interests above the rule of law, so
that to protect the historical record from corruption, the
presidency must be ``cleansed.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's words bespoke an uneasy dance between distaste and
detachment that was evident in all the speakers who brought the
first phase of the impeachment trial to its conclusion Saturday.
They aggressively sought to paint the president's alleged offenses
as bad enough to merit his removal, while being aware the
appearance of spite would make that outcome unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania assured the senators that when
the president comes to Congress on Tuesday night to give the State
of the Union address, he would honor the office Clinton holds by
standing to applaud. Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois, who
has seen his own embarrassing personal history dredged up as a
byproduct of this long scandal, admitted that no one in Congress is
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the way of this world: flawed human beings must,
according to the rule of law, judge other flawed human beings,''
Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde employs a high rhetorical style well suited to the Senate
floor, and his speech Saturday won a lot of praise without much
mention that a big chunk of it was lifted straight from the speech
he gave in the House a few weeks ago. In a week which has seen so
much repetition, it only seemed natural.
</P>
<P>
   In a way the repetition worked as a code to conclude a long
process that has gone much farther than many thought it would. Next
week the high rhetoric of the King holiday _ certain to include
many defenses of the president _ and the high-wire act which under
Clinton the State of the Union has become will begin the last-ditch
effort to end it.

   &UR;  &LR; Here's a summary of the impeachment trial stories that have moved
for Sunday's paper:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TRIAL (Washington) _ Summarizing the Republican case
against President Clinton in a speech evoking the shades of heroes
past, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said Saturday afternoon that the
presidency could be ``permanently damaged'' if the Senate failed to
remove Clinton from office. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SCENE (Washington) _ In theory, the Paula Jones lawsuit
has been settled. But it continues to haunt the president. His
defense lawyers complained that the House Republican prosecutors
had been referring ``again and again'' to Clinton's deposition in
the Jones suit, despite the fact that the full House rejected
perjury charges built around that testimony. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-NOTEBOOK (Washington) _ A certain sloppiness has
infected the trial of President Clinton, at least when it comes to
spelling. The first big mistake came on the first day, when
senators signed their oaths to be impartial with pens whose
inscriptions scrambled the letters in the country's name: the
``Untied States.'' By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-EAGLES (Palm Beach, Fla.) _ Most of the Republicans who
gathered here at this sunny resort last week were less then eager
to draw attention to their presence as Washington is overcome not
only by frosty weather but by the impeachment trial of President
Clinton. But the fact that contributors traveled here _ and
politicians from Capitol Hill flew in to hobnob with them _ is
testament to how nothing gets in the way of Republicans courting,
wooing and hitting up the party's most reliable donors. By Richard
L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REPUBS (Washington) _ It was a strange sight. Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., was offering a compromise plan that would have
abbreviated President Clinton's impeachment trial and avoided
witnesses. His proposal was shot down by his fellow Republicans in
the Senate, but it infuriated conservatives in his state, who have
vowed to field a candidate against him. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ROSS (Washington) _ With President Clinton on trial for
his political life, the name of Sen. Edmund G. Ross of Kansas is
apt to come up whenever people talk about courage, honor and duty.
According to American political legend, he chose personal ruin
rather than betray his principles, defying his party leadership in
voting to acquit President Andrew Johnson during the last
presidential impeachment, in 1868. If he had voted the other way,
Johnson would have been removed and American history might have
been much different. By David Stout.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-RDP (Washington) _ As the duel over impeachment
witnesses intensified, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority
leader, has suggested to Democrats that a bipartisan group of
senators deal with the issue, but the Democratic leader rebuffed
his offer and called it premature. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   DOWD-COLUMN (Washington) _ While there is an undeniable appeal
to the notion of enforced silence on usually prolix senators _ the
equivalent of a national mute button _ the Trial of the Century is
proving less than scintillating. By Maureen Dowd.
</P>
<P>
   EDIT-IMPEACH (Undated) _ Removing President Clinton from office
for the offenses presented by House impeachment managers sacrifices
something too important _ the orderly transfer of power on a
four-year schedule _ to accomplish a condemnation that can be
delivered through other means.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-HOWLONG?-REVIEW (Washington) _ Whether they want to see
President Clinton driven from office or whether they have
completely tuned out the Senate impeachment trial, Americans, on
the first anniversary of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, do agree on
one thing: They want it to be over. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-QUIXOTE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A friend recently gave Rep.
Henry Hyde the original Broadway cast recording of the ``Man of La
Mancha,'' and when in odd moments he listens to its hummable tunes
about the Spanish Inquisition, he also hears Quixote sing:
``Heathens and wizards and serpents of sin, all your dastardly
doings are past. For a holy endeavor is now to begin and virtue
shall triumph at last!'' By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CLINTON (Washington) _ President Clinton kept a studied
distance Saturday from his impeachment trial in the Senate,
focusing not on the charges laid out against him by Republican
prosecutors, aides said, but on the next big event on his political
calendar: the State of the Union speech on Tuesday. By Adam
Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-JUDGES (Washington) _ Three House managers on Saturday
drew a parallel between the accusation that President Clinton lied
before the grand jury about his relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky and the Senate's perjury convictions of three federal
judges. By Don Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SCHLESINGER (Undated) _ For months, members of Congress
have taken to quoting famous historians to back up their own views
on the impeachment of President Clinton. Twice Saturday, for
example, House Republicans Steve Buyer of Indiana and Charles
Canady of Florida quoted the writings of Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to
argue for Clinton's removal. Just one problem: Schlesinger, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning author who was an aide to President John F.
Kennedy, has come out firmly against Clinton's impeachment. By Paul
Zielbauer.

 &HT;    Austin's biggest party . . . where and how to join in
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush will be inaugurated Tuesday
with all the glitter and grandeur Texas displays each time a
governor begins a new term.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the parties, dinners, ceremonies and parade
have a special luster. That's because Bush is an early favorite in
the race for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, even
though he hasn't officially entered the contest. With that in mind,
Texans _ and the rest of the country _ are paying extra attention.
To give you a head start, we've put together an inaugural guide
with facts about previous inaugurations and information about
tickets, parking and events. Enjoy yourself _ after all, it's the
biggest party in Austin in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   I'll have Texas Inaugurations for $100, Alex
</P>
<P>
   While you're waiting for the parade to start, here's some trivia
about past inaugurations to test your companions: In January 1955,
Marialice Shary Shivers, the wife of Gov. Allan Shivers, wore an
inaugural ball gown created by the famous Hollywood costume
designer Edith Head. Head designed clothes for many films,
including ``To Catch a Thief,'' ``Sabrina,'' ``Roman Holiday'' and
``The Ten Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   The dress was a reproduction of a gown worn in a Paramount
movie, ``Lucy Gallant.'' The movie starred Jane Wyman and Charlton
Heston; Gov. Shivers played _ big stretch for him _ a Texas
governor. When Gov. and Mrs. Shivers went to the set, she saw the
gown and wanted one just like it, so the crew made her one. It was
made of white lace embroidered with iridescent thread, worn with a
white fox cape and white satin shoes trimmed with rhinestones. At
the ball, she carried a white lace fan, also given to her by the
movie crew.
</P>
<P>
   During the inaugural galas for Gov. Bill Clements' first term in
1979, a rumor went around that the Department of Public Safety
squad assigned to escort the governor had been reassigned to guard
the cloakroom. After all, the joke went, Clements only spent $7
million on his election. The minks _ and the foxes, lambs and
chinchillas _ in the coatrooms were worth considerably more than
that.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. James Stephen Hogg was inaugurated in 1891 there was a
torchlight parade up Congress Avenue. People in the parade wore
oilcloth coats to protect themselves from falling sparks and oil
drippings.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Sam Houston was inaugurated in 1859, the invitation
announced that there would be ``two bands of music in attendance,''
and ``supper by J.K. Johnston.'' Nowadays, hundreds of musicians
are employed at inaugural events, and dozens of dinners take place
to mark it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular events during Gov. Beauford H. Jester's
inauguration in 1947 was square dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most austere inauguration in Texas was that of Gov.
Pendleton Murrah in 1863. It was held during the last months of the
Confederacy (his administration was terminated when the Confederacy
fell). The state dinner featured simple cornmeal cakes. There was
no inauguration ball.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an inauguration theme?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and it's in both English and Spanish: ``Together, We Can,''
or ``Juntos Podemos.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents of Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Know someone who thinks they are an expert in Texas history?
Give them this quiz: Before we had governors of Texas, we had
presidents of the Republic, for five terms. Can you name them? You
get bonus points if you know the dates they were in office. Answer:
David G. Burnet, March 16, 1836-Oct. 22, 1836; Sam Houston, Oct.
22, 1836- Dec. 10, 1838; Mirabeau B. Lamar, Dec. 10, 1838- Dec. 13,
1841; Sam Houston, Dec. 13, 1841-Dec. 9, 1844; Anson Jones, Dec. 9,
1844-Feb. 19, 1846.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the inaugural ball gowns. What are the men going to wear?
</P>
<P>
   Many of them will don Texas Tuxes in the coming days, as
inaugural parties and balls light up the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Tux consists of a tuxedo coat, boots, hat and khaki
pants or blue jeans. Traditionally a tux shirt and all that goes
with it _ black bow tie, studs and cummerbund _ are worn. Remember
the cummerbund pleats go up. A regular white shirt and bolo tie are
acceptable on less formal occasions. Want to practice for the day
you'll be governor?
</P>
<P>
   Here is the official oath of office used by the state of Texas,
the one that George W. Bush will utter on Tuesday: ``I, (your name
goes here), do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the
duties of the office of Governor of the State of Texas, and will to
the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the
Constitution and laws of the United States and of this State, so
help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   How much does the governor earn?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's annual salary is $99,122. He refused his last
raise.
</P>
<P>
   Should I bring an umbrella?
</P>
<P>
   Governors generally have had good luck with the weather on
inauguration day _ not too rainy, not too cold. The average high
temperature for the last five inauguration days (going back to
1979) was 58; the average low, 44. It's been foggy and gray for
some of those ceremonies, but the most precipitation Austin
received on those five dates was .71 inches, when Mark White was
sworn in on Jan. 18, 1983. The best weather was enjoyed by Gov. Ann
Richards, whose inauguration day had 10 hours and 36 minutes of
sunshine. The forecast for Tuesday is partly cloudy with a high in
the low 70s.
</P>
<P>
   What is there to do the day before the inauguration?
</P>
<P>
   There's a big Martin Luther King Jr. birthday celebration and
youth concert Monday morning in Houston. It's at 10 a.m. at the
George R. Brown Convention Center. Gov. Bush will be attending.
It's free and open to the public. Here in Austin, there's an
invitation-only children's program at 2 p.m. at the Paramount
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening on the big day?
</P>
<P>
   Prayer service
</P>
<P>
   A traditional inaugural event at First United Methodist Church,
1201 Lavaca, near the Capitol, the prayer service is a private,
invitation-only gathering for the governor, his family and close
associates. The Bushes are Methodist, so having the service here is
particularly appropriate. Time: 10 a.m. Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   Inaugural ceremony
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Phillips, chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court, will
administer the oath to Bush, who will have his hand placed on Sam
Houston's Bible. This Bible is a treasured book that rarely sees
daylight, except during gubernatorial inaugurations. Time: Noon
Location: Capitol's south steps Parking: Where you can find it.
There is no reserved parking for the public. Street closings:
Colorado will be closed between 11th and 13th streets from 7 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Tickets: None necessary. The audience will stand.
Organizers expect 15,000 to 20,000 people Special guests: The
governor's parents, former President George Bush and former first
lady Barbara Bush, and former Texas governors will be there.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Barbecue and Celebration
</P>
<P>
   A successful tradition carried over from previous inaugurations,
the barbecue will provide Texas foods for Texas folks _ turkey,
brisket, sausage and pie. Time: 1 p.m. Where: South Lawn of the
Capitol. Tickets: $3. These may already be sold out. Call 494-1999
to check.
</P>
<P>
   Inaugural parade
</P>
<P>
   There are 81 entries in this parade. Gov. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry will ride near the front of the parade, then review the
remainder of it. Plenty of music and color will fill Congress
Avenue, as a slew of marching bands and color guards entertain
parade-watchers. Time: 2:30 p.m. Where: Starts at Third and
Congress; goes up to Capitol When you should get there to get a
good seat: By 11 a.m. Bring a lawn chair. Parking: No reserved
parking for public; no free parking downtown. Find parking where
you can. Street closings: See accompanying map Who will be in the
parade?: Thirty-three marching bands will strut their stuff,
including the University of Texas Longhorn Band, the Fightin' Texas
Aggie Band and high school bands from Haskell, Cuero, Hillsboro,
Harlingen, Dumas, Center, Del Valle, McAllen, Mansfield, Arlington,
Aledo, Austin, Midland, Fort Worth, Sugar Land, El Paso, Humble,
Corpus Christi, Burnet, Hamilton, Allen, Houston, Blanco and other
cities. The Kilgore Rangerettes will be there, as will the Texas
Buffalo Soldiers Regiment, the Texas A&AMP;M Corps of Cadets, the UT
cheerleaders, the comptroller, the railroad commissioners, the land
commissioner, the commissioner of agriculture and an M1 tank.
Floats include a ``Texas Technology'' float, a ``Natural
Resources'' float, and a ``Read to Succeed'' float.
</P>
<P>
   Inaugural balls
</P>
<P>
   In an old Texas inaugural tradition, the governor, lieutenant
governor, their families and various other officials and
dignitaries make a tour of the inaugural balls in ``The Grand
Entrance March.'' This means that as long as you're at one of the
balls, if you stay there long enough you're bound to see the Bushes
in their inaugural finery. Time: All balls begin at 7:30 p.m.
Where: Frank Erwin Center Who's playing: Emilio, Mr. Fabulous,
Rotel &AMP; The Hot Tomatoes, The Big Time Where: Austin Convention
Center Who's playing: Rick Trevino, Dallas Brass &AMP; Electric, Johnny
Dee &AMP; the Rocket 88's, The Pictures Where: Palmer Auditorium Who's

to mark it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular events during Gov. Beauford H. Jester's
inauguration in 1947 was square dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most austere inauguration in Texas was that of Gov.
Pendleton Murrah in 1863. It was held during the last months of the
Confederacy (his administration was terminated when the Confederacy
fell). The state dinner featured simple cornmeal cakes. There was
no inauguration ball.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an inauguration theme?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and it's in both English and Spanish: ``Together, We Can,''
or ``Juntos Podemos.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents of Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Know someone who thinks they are an expert in Texas history?
Give them this quiz: Before we had governors of Texas, we had
presidents of the Republic, for five terms. Can you name them? You
get bonus points if you know the dates they were in office. Answer:
David G. Burnet, March 16, 1836-Oct. 22, 1836; Sam Houston, Oct.
22, 1836- Dec. 10, 1838; Mirabeau B. Lamar, Dec. 10, 1838- Dec. 13,
1841; Sam Houston, Dec. 13, 1841-Dec. 9, 1844; Anson Jones, Dec. 9,
1844-Feb. 19, 1846.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the inaugural ball gowns. What are the men going to wear?
</P>
<P>
   Many of them will don Texas Tuxes in the coming days, as
inaugural parties and balls light up the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Tux consists of a tuxedo coat, boots, hat and khaki
pants or blue jeans. Traditionally a tux shirt and all that goes
with it _ black bow tie, studs and cummerbund _ are worn. Remember
the cummerbund pleats go up. A regular white shirt and bolo tie are
acceptable on less formal occasions. Want to practice for the day
you'll be governor?
</P>
<P>
   Here is the official oath of office used by the state of Texas,
the one that George W. Bush will utter on Tuesday: ``I, (your name
goes here), do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the
duties of the office of Governor of the State of Texas, and will to
the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the
Constitution and laws of the United States and of this State, so
help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   How much does the governor earn?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's annual salary is $99,122. He refused his last
raise.
</P>
<P>
   Should I bring an umbrella?
</P>
<P>
   Governors generally have had good luck with the weather on
inauguration day _ not too rainy, not too cold. The average high
temperature for the last five inauguration days (going back to
1979) was 58; the average low, 44. It's been foggy and gray for
some of those ceremonies, but the most precipitation Austin
received on those five dates was .71 inches, when Mark White was
sworn in on Jan. 18, 1983. The best weather was enjoyed by Gov. Ann
Richards, whose inauguration day had 10 hours and 36 minutes of
sunshine. The forecast for Tuesday is partly cloudy with a high in
the low 70s.
</P>
<P>
   What is there to do the day before the inauguration?
</P>
<P>
   There's a big Martin Luther King Jr. birthday celebration and
youth concert Monday morning in Houston. It's at 10 a.m. at the
George R. Brown Convention Center. Gov. Bush will be attending.
It's free and open to the public. Here in Austin, there's an
invitation-only children's program at 2 p.m. at the Paramount
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening on the big day?
</P>
<P>
   Prayer service
</P>
<P>
   A traditional inaugural event at First United Methodist Church,
1201 Lavaca, near the Capitol, the prayer service is a private,
invitation-only gathering for the governor, his family and close
associates. The Bushes are Methodist, so having the service here is
particularly appropriate. Time: 10 a.m. Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   Inaugural ceremony
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Phillips, chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court, will
administer the oath to Bush, who will have his hand placed on Sam
Houston's Bible. This Bible is a treasured book that rarely sees
daylight, except during gubernatorial inaugurations. Time: Noon
Location: Capitol's south steps Parking: Where you can find it.
There is no reserved parking for the public. Street closings:
Colorado will be closed between 11th and 13th streets from 7 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Tickets: None necessary. The audience will stand.
Organizers expect 15,000 to 20,000 people Special guests: The
governor's parents, former President George Bush and former first
lady Barbara Bush, and former Texas governors will be there.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Barbecue and Celebration
</P>
<P>
   A successful tradition carried over from previous inaugurations,
the barbecue will provide Texas foods for Texas folks _ turkey,
brisket, sausage and pie. Time: 1 p.m. Where: South Lawn of the
Capitol. Tickets: $3. These may already be sold out. Call 494-1999
to check.
</P>
<P>
   Inaugural parade
</P>
<P>
   There are 81 entries in this parade. Gov. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry will ride near the front of the parade, then review the
remainder of it. Plenty of music and color will fill Congress
Avenue, as a slew of marching bands and color guards entertain
parade-watchers. Time: 2:30 p.m. Where: Starts at Third and
Congress; goes up to Capitol When you should get there to get a
good seat: By 11 a.m. Bring a lawn chair. Parking: No reserved
parking for public; no free parking downtown. Find parking where
you can. Street closings: See accompanying map Who will be in the
parade?: Thirty-three marching bands will strut their stuff,
including the University of Texas Longhorn Band, the Fightin' Texas
Aggie Band and high school bands from Haskell, Cuero, Hillsboro,
Harlingen, Dumas, Center, Del Valle, McAllen, Mansfield, Arlington,
Aledo, Austin, Midland, Fort Worth, Sugar Land, El Paso, Humble,

Resources'' float, and a ``Read to Succeed'' float.
</P>
<P>
   Inaugural balls
</P>
<P>
   In an old Texas inaugural tradition, the governor, lieutenant
governor, their families and various other officials and
dignitaries make a tour of the inaugural balls in ``The Grand
Entrance March.'' This means that as long as you're at one of the
balls, if you stay there long enough you're bound to see the Bushes

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like the other Republican congressmen appointed to
prosecute President Clinton, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina went
before the Senate on Saturday as a lawyer, entwining evidence and
precedents to argue for the president's expulsion from office.
</P>
<P>
   But in an evocative and sometimes provocative twist, Graham also
cast himself as ``a child of the South'' whose exposure to racial
discrimination had made him appreciate the importance of civil
rights, not just for blacks but for women.
</P>
<P>
   Those comments clearly sought to refocus attention on
Republicans' assertions that the president, by concealing his
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, subverted the civil rights of Paula
Jones, whose sexual misconduct lawsuit against him triggered the
initial questions about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham also stole a favorite oratorical trick from Clinton's
bag, invoking the same racial bearings and weaving the same
autobiographical flourishes that Clinton, who grew up in Arkansas,
employed so often in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my lifetime,'' Graham told senators, ``I started school
with no black person in my class, and by the sixth grade _ I think
it was the sixth grade _ integration hit my area, and I can
remember my mom and dad being scared to death about what it would
do and what it would mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father and mother owned a restaurant _ a beer joint, I
guess, is what we'd say in South Carolina,'' Graham recalled. ``I
can remember that if you were black, you came, and you had to buy
the beer, and you had to go because you couldn't drink it there.
`That's just the way it was' is what my dad said. I always never
quite understood that.''
</P>
<P>
   Folksy, confessional and shrewd, Graham's address stood out
among the more technical presentations of the other 12 Republicans
appointed as trial managers, or prosecutors. Graham said that that
was just what he intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was time to make the concepts we were talking
about real,'' Graham said in an interview after his presentation.
``I tried to talk to the Senate. They'd been lectured to a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all the senators appreciated what he had to say. Sen.
Tim Johnson, D-S.D., said there was ``a bit of eye rolling'' among
members of his party as Graham allied himself and the Republican
Party with civil rights and concern for women.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., also complained that
Republicans like Graham had not always acted in the best interests
of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Lindsey Graham,'' Schumer said. ``He's a nice guy. I
would just like the general concern for civil rights to spread
beyond today.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time in the impeachment debate that
Graham, 43, who was swept into Congress in the so-called Republican
revolution of 1994, drew special notice.
</P>
<P>
   On the House Judiciary Committee, he parted ranks with fellow
Republicans to vote against one of the four articles of impeachment
it was considering. That article charged Clinton with perjury in
the deposition he gave to Ms. Jones' lawyers, and Graham said at
the time that he did not think Congress had the right to judge
those remarks because a judge ultimately deemed the deposition
immaterial and Clinton was speaking about matters that were then
private.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Jones was very much on Graham's thoughts, and in his
words, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that people needed to treat sexual harassment as
seriously as they came to treat racial discrimination, Graham told
senators: ``It used to be in this country, not long ago, there was
really no recourse if you were sexually harassed. We have changed
things for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said later that he had decided to speak about his own
life ``literally five minutes before I stood up,'' because he
sensed that the senators needed a change of pace.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was well aware that Clinton had often given
speeches in a similar vein. ``He's very eloquent, but he's not the
only one to have experienced these things,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good spokesman for civil rights,'' Graham said of
the president. ``But what does civil rights mean if you just talk
about it and don't apply it in your own life?''

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For two days House Republican prosecutors played
the short game, trying to win the right to call witnesses. Saturday
they turned to their ultimate challenge: to convince senators,
particularly Democrats, that President Clinton's misdeeds are grave
enough to warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   For on this Saturday, the third and final day of their opening
arguments, the House managers tackled the most fundamental question
underlying the nation's second presidential impeachment trial. Do
Clinton's efforts to cover up his relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky amount to the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' the
nation's founders had in mind for removal of an elected president?
</P>
<P>
   Some of their appeals stood on law and precedent and
interpretation of the Constitution, such as Rep. Charles B.
Canady's assertion that ``a president who commits a calculated and
sustained series of criminal offenses has _ by his personal
violations of the law _ failed in the most direct, immediate and
culpable manner to do his duty under the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Other managers played more to emotion than to law. Rep. Henry J.
Hyde wrapped up the three days by reading a letter from a schoolboy
asking ``if you cannot believe the president, who can you
believe?'' as well as appealing grandiloquently for Clinton to be
removed from office to keep faith with those who died on the
beaches of Normandy and in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   What is critical is how Democrats react to these arguments. For
with the Senate composed of 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats, the
House prosecutors are thought to have only a very slight chance of
gaining the 67 votes necessary to secure the president's
conviction. To do so, they must pull over at least 12 Democrats and
most likely even more, since the Republicans will probably not vote
as a solid bloc.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats in particular, while acknowledging that Clinton
lied in several legal proceedings and should be censured, have long
expressed doubts over whether such actions to cover up an
extra-marital affair amount to rise to the constitutional level to
remove a twice-elected president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad behavior,'' Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., said
Saturday, even after listening to the House managers. ``But the
standard for removing a president is not bad behavior. It is high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no fixed definition of what constitutes a high crime
and misdemeanor. And throughout the five months that Congress has
been grappling with impeachment, the White House has staked much of
its defense of the president on the grounds that his offenses do
not amount to an abuse of power that warrants his removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   As the president's lawyers wrote in a pretrial brief,
``impeachment was never intended to be a remedy for private wrongs.
It was intended to be a method of removing a president whose
continued presence in the office would cause grave danger to the
nation and our constitutional system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has also pointed to a letter circulated by 400
historians and legal scholars _ prominent among them Arthur
Schlesinger Jr. _ saying that removal of Clinton because of the
case before Congress would ``mangle the system of checks and
balances that is our chief safeguard against abuses of power.''
</P>
<P>
   So Saturday, two of the House managers, Canady and Rep. Steve
Buyer of Indiana, sought to undermine the credibility of
Schlesinger, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author who was an aide to
John F. Kennedy, by using some of his own writings against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting a passage from ``The Imperial Presidency,''
Schlesinger's study of the growth of presidential power, Buyer
read, ``The continuation of a lawbreaker as chief magistrate would
be a strange way to exemplify law and order at home or to
demonstrate American probity before the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey O. Graham made an appeal to emotion. As a child of
the segregated south, he extolled the civil rights laws that Paula
Jones ultimately used to sue Clinton for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a high crime?'' the folksy South Carolina Republican
asked, before making a populist appeal on behalf of Ms. Jones'
right to sue and get truthful answers from Clinton. ``How about if
an important person hurts somebody of low means? It's not very
scholarly, but I think it's the truth. I think that's what they
mean by high crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Canady to be the scholarly one. He reminded
senators they have impeached and removed federal judges for
perjury. ``The Senate should not establish a lower standard of
integrity for the president,'' he argued. He also took on Clinton's
defense that he has not committed the same kind of abuses that
Richard M. Nixon did during the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no principled basis for contending that a president
who interferes with the proper exercise of governmental power _ as
he clearly does when he commits perjury and obstruction of justice
_ is constitutionally less blameworthy than a president who misuses
the power of his office,'' Canady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president who lies to a federal grand jury in order to
impede the investigation of crimes is no less culpable than a
president who wrongfully orders a prosecutor to suspend an
investigation of crimes that have been committed,'' he said in
reference to the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' in 1973, when Nixon
ordered his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, to fire special
prosecutor Archibald Cox. Richardson resigned instead.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a long time before the Senate holds votes that will
show how much headway the prosecutors made Saturday in persuading
the necessary number of Democrats that Clinton's offenses rise to
the level of high crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But there were some clues. Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.,
said Saturday he had not been convinced. Nor was Sen. Charles E.
Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Graham, D-Fla., said: ``They made a good case for that.
The presentations the House managers have made have caused you to
do exactly what this process is supposed to: maintain an open
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said, ``I think that's an uphill
climb still, but I think they pushed perhaps some in the Senate or
some in the country a little further up that hill than was the case
yesterday.''

 &HT;    Campaign corps awaits the word
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXETER, N.H. _ In the photographs that line his living room and
the memories alive in his mind, 82-year-old Michael Dagostino sees
a political past that he hopes will be part of the political
future.
</P>
<P>
   Two generations back, a younger Dagostino delighted in driving
Connecticut Sen. Prescott Bush around when he visited New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   One generation back, Dagostino became a go-to guy for George
Bush during his frequent campaigns up here.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush became president, Dagostino was at the airport to
greet him every time he visited.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are my loyal, dear friend and I would like to have been on
hand to give you a big birthday abrazo (hug),'' Bush said in an
August 1996 note sending regrets for missing Dagostino's 80th
birthday bash.
</P>
<P>
   Dagostino also has a more-recent letter from a more-current
Bush. The New Hampshire presidential primary is a year away _ which
means it is already near full speed _ and Dagostino again is
excited about a Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be making up my mind on the year 2000 in the next
couple of months,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush told Dagostino in a
Dec. 4 letter. ``Please tell your friends to keep their powder
dry.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a message that has been heeded around this state among Bush
family loyalists who have resisted entreaties from GOP presidential
candidates already on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As in many other states, Bush backers from campaigns gone by are
excited about getting involved in another one.
</P>
<P>
   In this historically pivotal state _ only twice since 1948 have
the Republicans nominated someone other than the winner of the New
Hampshire primary _ and elsewhere, Bush has a machine-in-waiting
cultivated for years by a famous dad who claimed any number of home
states.
</P>
<P>
   It means people to play host at coffees. It means people to hang
signs. It means money. It means votes.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, it adds up to a potentially powerful combination in
New Hampshire, a state that probably will remain significant even
if it does not succeed in defending its first- in-the-nation
primary against a wave of bigger states that have moved up on the
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   For Dagostino, it's difficult not to smile when he thinks about
another Bush candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always figured he would run for president,'' Dagostino said.
``I think he will make a hell of a president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists his only immediate goal is being a hell of a
governor. On Tuesday, he will take the oath of office for a second
term that family friends here hope he never completes.
</P>
<P>
   While other potential and probable 2000 presidential candidates
have organizations in place in the Granite State, Bush's is
bubbling just below the surface, awaiting word from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the ``keep the power dry'' message and the
quarterly ``Bush News'' publication that recently hit their mail
boxes (and the boxes of all of Bush's 97,000 donors nationwide) to
tout his November re-election, his backers here have little doubt
that Bush will run.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous corps of Bush family loyalists here just
waiting for the signal or the word,'' New Hampshire GOP Chairman
Steve Duprey said.
</P>
<P>
   Duprey is officially neutral but on-the-record excited about
what it would mean to add Bush to the field.
</P>
<P>
   The other 2000 presidential contenders are already here in body
and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Some are here so often they might qualify to vote in the New
Hampshire pri- mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Steve Forbes. Let's start the 21st century right,'' Forbes
says in a TV ad now running.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander never really left. Last summer, he drew a good
crowd for what has become his annual New Hampshire clam- bake.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle is gathering a team. The man heading the effort to
draft Elizabeth Dole was here last week. Gary Bauer planned to
spend Saturday in the state, including a speech at an anti-abortion
rally at the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he won't be anywhere near here any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I doubt there will be any visits to Iowa or New
Hampshire,'' he said recently, ``although I never say never. ... I
intend to be home doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   But family friends here expect to see him soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how he can not run, because everybody is after him
to run,'' said former GOP national committeewoman Victoria Zachos
of Concord, a Bush backer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a governor of a big state like Texas and everybody
is clamoring for you to run, wouldn't that turn your head?''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush brigade
</P>
<P>
   Dagostino, legendary for his ability to put together a political
crowd, is typical of the Bush organization-in-waiting here.
</P>
<P>
   It includes veteran grass-roots activists who understand that
politics is handshake-to-handshake combat in New Hampshire. It also
includes well-placed officials, some so well-placed that it would
be impolitic for them to declare allegiance to Bush more than a
year before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The years of New Hampshire handshaking by the elder Bush are
documented on the back of the ex-president's trading card, included
in a set published by the State Library's Archives of New
Hampshire's Political Tradition, a permanent exhibit chronicling
the state's role in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He campaigned tediously long hours and came to recognize more
New Hampshire voters by their names than any other presidential
candidate in the history of the primary,'' the card claims.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush won the New Hampshire primaries in 1988 and 1992,
though he failed here in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Family friends also got to know the Bush kids during those
campaigns. Though they'd rather see him here sooner than later,
George W. Bush supporters in New Hampshire say he would start out
on a first-name basis with many key folks.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Hugh Gregg, officially neutral at this point despite
long-standing ties to the Bush family, has been hearing from these
people in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has lots of people,'' Gregg said of the Texas governor. ``I
used to be his father's chairman. They call me. There are a lot of
people out there anxious to work for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than polls that show him running at the top among
Republicans here (a dead heat with Elizabeth Dole, according to a
recent television-station poll), nobody knows how many Bush
supporters there are in New Hampshire. But the list includes
political pros who know how the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   They are people such as Ed Du Pont, a well-connected lobbyist,
former president of the state Senate and former gubernatorial
candidate; Robb Thomson, a former governor's son and a rumored 2000
gubernatorial candidate; and Zachos, a former GOP national
committee member who has dined with the Bushes at the family summer
home at Kennebunkport in neighboring Maine.
</P>
<P>
   They may be people such as former Gov. Steve Merrill, publicly
uncommitted but believed to be loyal to Bush, and former state Sen.
David Currier, a key Forbes campaigner in 1996 who now says he
could wind up as a Bush backer.
</P>
<P>
   Currier, owner of a $21 million-a-year emergency-medical-supply
business in Henniker, still works for Forbes' Americans for Hope,
Growth and Opportunity PAC, but he is beginning to doubt Forbes'
electability.
</P>
<P>
   And, like many New Hampshire Republicans, Currier has Bush
family ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neal Bush (one of the former president's sons) used to live
with us when he was here during the campaign days,'' Currier said.
``Neal was the guy at the time doing a lot of the grunt work in New
Hampshire. He was doing so much grunt work that he found a bride
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In an office lined with political photos _ including former
President Bush _ Currier can pull a Forbes' PAC button from his
desk drawer but said his support might be available for the asking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to somebody a while ago that if George H.W. Bush called
me and asked me to support (his son), I'd have a hell of a time
saying no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Concord, not far from the Statehouse, Zachos, too,
is awaiting word from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known the family for years,'' said Zachos, Bob Dole's
1996 state finance chairwoman. ``We are just waiting for the
signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyist Du Pont, a Forbes backer in 1996, is eager to change
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, he has experience as a governor and a
name that looks pretty good on a national ticket,'' Du Pont said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vs. Quayle
</P>
<P>
   Not all New Hampshire politicos with Bush family ties are
heeding the call to keep their powder dry.
</P>
<P>
   The state offers the clearest example of the politically
incestuous weirdness that would develop if Bush-Quayle _ a ticket
in 1988 and 1992 _ becomes a battle between former Vice President
Quayle and his old ticketmate's kid.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. John Sununu, chief of staff in the Bush White House,
is a Quayle man. A Quayle source in Phoenix said look for Sununu to
wind up as a ``very, very senior official'' in the former vice
president's nationwide campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sununu is symptomatic of the peculiar flow chart inherent in the
GOP shaping up for 2000. Many candidates have Bush links.
Alexander, Elizabeth Dole and Jack Kemp served in the Bush cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But there might never have been a Bush cabinet without Sununu,
who quarterbacked the Bush campaign to victory here over Bob Dole
in 1988. When Sununu's star fell in the White House, George W.
Bush, then working as a top, if unofficial, White House aide for
his dad, fired him.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire GOP Chairman Duprey said that as far as he knows,
Sununu's decision to go with Quayle is ``nothing personal'' against
the younger Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Sununu factor _ and how New Hampshire intramural politics
can affect leadership of the free world _ caught Barbara Bush's eye
during her husband's 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire had some real problems for us,'' she wrote in
her book, recalling ``personal animosities'' between the Sununus
and the Greggs, two of the state's leading political families.
``John is a hero of mine. He's such a bright man, such a funny man.
Unfortunately, John does not suffer fools gladly and is sometimes
his own worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is personal, intramural battles such as the Sununus vs. the
Greggs that highlight how politics differs in New Hampshire. In
states such as Texas and California, big-money TV campaigns are
what counts. In New Hampshire _ which has long wielded clout beyond
its size _ handshaking and allegiance from key operatives can go a
long, long way.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, thanks to his dad, can sit it out longer than most,
according to Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is probably the only one who can, other than maybe
Elizabeth Dole or Colin Powell,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   While potential contender Bush is staying away, there has been
no shortage of sightings of the other potentials. The primary is
about a year away, but the campaigning here never dies down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Alexander ran third here (behind Pat Buchanan and Bob
Dole) with 23 percent of the vote. Since then, he's become part of
the New Hampshire landscape. His political-action committee has
been running ads here for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Lamar has been here the most. He never really left,''
state chairman Duprey said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle and Forbes also have been regular visitors, keeping their
names out there and raising money for local candidates, a favor
that goes a long way in New Hampshire. Candidates who have all but
announced _ Forbes, Bauer and Alan Keyes, and probably Quayle _
will be here next month for a New Hampshire Christian Coalition
event. Bush will not be here.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a new face in the race _ New Hampshire Sen. Bob
Smith. But some top Republicans say he is on his way to becoming
the least-favored favorite-son candidate in recent memory. He
chalked up only 4 percent in a recent TV-station poll.
</P>
<P>
   Dagostino, from his living room/political hall of fame, is among
those scoffing at Smith's quixotic effort. Dagostino says he might
scoff at the entire GOP field if his old friend's son is not in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who the hell runs then,'' he said. ``They are the
same old faces.''

FALCONS SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF FIGHT IN THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Falcons arrived in the Twin Cities Friday,
toting their footballs and pads and helmets, but also one certain
heavyweight inspiration, Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited by the Falcons,'' said Holyfield, the
heavyweight champion and a proud native son of Atlanta. ``When I
was a kid I used to work in their football stadium and I was there
a lot at their games.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not always watching. That's because the Falcons then
seldom were mediocre, let alone good, and nothing like the Falcons
who will take on the Minnesota Vikings for the NFC championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd never seemed to be into it at their games,''
Holyfield said. ``That's because the team wasn't always doing a lot
on the field to get them going.''
</P>
<P>
   The symbolism of Holyfield's presence can't be escaped.
Holyfield was a huge underdog when he took on Mike Tyson for the
heavyweight title, just as the Falcons are a huge underdog against
the flashy Vikings, possessors of the NFL's most explosive offense.
Holyfield upset Tyson, just as the Falcons are confident they can
upset the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time for the Falcons,'' said Holyfield. ``It's
about time.''
</P>
<P>
   Never has a conference title game been contested between teams
with records this good, the 16-1 Vikings and the 15-2 Falcons.
Another first will be that a team that plays inside a dome will
make it to the Super Bowl for the first time, refuting the myth
that domes make teams too soft to win a championship when wills of
steel are mandatory for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get to the stadium,'' said Cris Carter, the
Vikings' superb wide receiver and the absolute leader of this team.
``I can't wait to look into my locker and see my uniform and the
whole thing. That's because since I was a little boy, I've always
dreamed of being a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Vikings get to the Metrodome, they will be without
Jake Reed, one of their outstanding trio of receivers, with Carter
and rookie Randy Moss. Reed was scratched from the game because of
a balky hamstring. Another question involves defensive lineman John
Randle, the All-Pro and well-nigh indispensable pillar of a defense
that already is average at best. Randle has a sore knee, did not
practice Wednesday, and said he is not sure how much he'll be able
to play.
</P>
<P>
   If Randle's words are to be believed _ and words seldom are
believable before games of this magnitude _ he may be too hurt to
play his usual role as a dominant pass-rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Stalin Colinet will play probably the first quarter,
and the second quarter, and maybe I'll just try to work myself into
the game,'' said Randle. ``I may play some nickel situations in the
first quarter. It just depends on the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Randle's status is far from the only worry for the Minnesota
defense. Free safety Orlando Thomas is still bothered by a strained
hamstring and missed many team drills in practice. If Thomas is
forced to sit, rookie Anthony Bass may start, either at free safety
or strong safety, with strong safety Robert Griffith possibly
moving to free safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the Vikings' only loss of the season, a 27-24 defeat in Tampa
Bay Nov. 1, the Bucs were able to win primarily because of a strong
running game, particularly on the part of Mike Alstott. The
Falcons, of course, have a strong running game with Jamal Anderson,
and the strategy is obvious: keep the Minnesota offense off the
field by dominating the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one good thing is that we're not playing outside in this
weather,'' said Atlanta coach Dan Reeves, a star for the Cowboys in
the famous Ice Bowl game in Green Bay for the NFL title 31 years
ago. ``When I look outside and see this weather, well, I'll take
the noise over the weather. After playing in Green Bay, there's no
question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Metrodome will be very noisy, even if the NFL
directed the Vikings to move a set of speakers from behind the
visiting team's bench farther toward the end zone. But noise will
not win or lose this game.
</P>
<P>
   Neither quarterback, the veteran Randall Cunningham of the
Vikings or the well-traveled Chris Chandler for Atlanta, has played
in a game of this magnitude. Which quarterback is more immune to
the pressure will be a key factor.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Atlanta defense, which was fourth in the league in
points allowed per game (18) and first in takeaways (44), has been
ignored in the publicity for the Minnesota offense. But the
Falcons' defense, sprinkled with such veterans as safety Eugene
Robinson, a veteran of Green Bay's Super Bowl wars, and corner Ray
Buchanan, may be a surprising match for the Vikings' offense.
</P>
<P>
   And the deciding factor just may be the receivers. No, not the
heralded duo of Moss and Carter for the Vikings, but Atlanta's Tony
Martin and Terance Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right up there with those guys,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   And the difference is that Martin and Mathis will be going
against a defense that may not be right up there with Atlanta's.

<P>
   They're the fashionable pick now that Michael Jordan has
departed and the Avis crowd can finally talk without a laugh track
about winning a title. Yup, it's your Indiana Pacers, who nearly
dethroned Jordan last spring. They're back, determined, hungry, and
everyone's favorite in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks boss Dave Checketts anointed them the team to beat. Coach
of the Year Larry Bird is now, officially, on the hot seat.
``That's all right,'' said former coach Bill Fitch. ``Larry has
asbestos pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird says he welcomes the attention, pressure, and scrutiny.
Last year, we all figured that Bird's return home was a hoop
Hallmark card. We also figured that Indiana would make the playoffs
after taking a sabbatical the year before. Few envisioned them
taking the Bulls down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope they remember how they got there and how disappointed
they felt after Game 7. If they don't, the coach will be there to
remind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work their butts off,'' Bird said. ``I think
all this is good for us. They worked hard last year and hopefully
they'll do the same and come back and work even harder because they
know what's at stake. We still have to be better. And we still have
to be tougher in certain situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers figure to have everyone back _ Rik Smits is a lock to
re-sign. They've been working out in Indianapolis as a group and
are, like everyone else, awaiting the starter's gun from NBA
headquarters. Many teams are expecting to open camp Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   What Bird is not looking forward to is the schedule. The NBA
sent out a note last week saying it would brief teams Tuesday as to
when they might get the real thing. Market Square Arena is booked
for much of February and Bird fears his team may have to spend an
inordinate amount of time on the road. That makes it even more
important that the team start strongly.
</P>
<P>
   But historically, the Pacers have been a slow-starting team.
They were 5-6 in their first 11 last season and really didn't get
rolling until mid-December. They were 5-8 through November the year
before and 1-6 in one of the two years they made it to the
conference finals under Larry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough,'' Bird said. ``We may open at home and
then go out to the West Coast. I don't know. But these guys are
veterans and they should understand what it takes and how important
it is to get off to a good start. Our time is running out here. We
want to do it now.''
</P>

   The Celtics will have some competition for  &UR; Popeye Jones &LR; .
 &UR; Jimmy Sexton &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who represents the rebound machine (he's usually
near the top in boards-per-minute), said he received 17 calls
regarding Jones. Most were offers that started at the new veteran
exception figure ($1.75 million), but some were better. The
Celtics' offer reportedly was underwhelming, but they could use
Jones and he is not averse to staying. ``We like him. We're fans,''
said Boston general manager  &UR; Chris Wallace &LR; . The Pacers also
wouldn't mind having him around, although they are more interested
in a serviceable backup center in the event that something happens
to Smits ...  &UR; Chauncey Billups  &LR; is available, in case anyone is
interested. One rumor had the Knicks talking to the Raptors in a
deal involving a re-signed  &UR; Charlie Ward  &LR; ... Speaking of the
Raptors, they are penciled in as Boston's opponent for the
home-and-home exhibition games.  &UR; Dee Brown  &LR; is psyched ... Reports
from overseas indicate that  &UR; Vlade Divac  &LR; looked a little  &UR; Shawn
Kemp &LR; ish in his debut for Belgrade Red Star. A much-anticipated
duel with  &UR; Arvydas Sabonis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; however, did not materialize as
Sabonis decided to sit out the game, fearing injury. Both are free
agents. We also hear that  &UR; Dino Radja's  &LR; team briefly considered
approaching Smits when Radja's knees started to bother him ...
Guess who's working out with Utah?  &UR; Thurl Bailey &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who last played
for the Jazz in 1991-92 (he was traded to Minnesota for  &UR; Ty
Corbin &LR; ). He has spent the last couple of years in Europe and would
be looking for a spot at the end of the bench. He knows the staff,
system, and players. He also turns 38 in April. The Jazz seem
disinclined to bring back  &UR; Antoine Carr  &LR; and may have some interest
in local boy  &UR; Travis Knight  &LR; ... Speaking of grizzled vets,  &UR; John
Salley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; last seen on NBC, also is hoping to reenter the league.
After Salley collected a championship ring from the 1995-96 Bulls,
Chicago went out and signed  &UR; Robert Parish &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and Big John retired
at the tender age of 32 ... If you're wondering how the Lakers are
going to fare without  &UR; Nick Van Exel  &LR; running the point, you're not
alone. The latest name to surface for the job is  &UR; Kevin
Johnson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who supposedly retired from the Suns but is still
interested if the situation is right. The Lakers also are looking
for a way to pry  &UR; Horace Grant  &LR; from Orlando.

   Fitch is home in the Houston area, cranking up his satellite
dish and waiting for the right call. Sacramento called before
offering the job to  &UR; Rick Adelman &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but Fitch passed. ``I'm going
to stay interested,'' he said. ``For me, this (lockout) helped. I
haven't had all these games to watch.'' We asked him about his old
team, the Clippers, now in the hands of  &UR; Chris Ford &LR; . ``I wish
Chris well,'' Fitch said. ``It's not as bad as it looks. We got
killed last year because we lost ( &UR; Bo &LR; )  &UR; Outlaw  &LR; and ( &UR; Loy &LR; )
 &UR; Vaught &LR; . But the situation there is a lot better than it was when
I first got there.'' The big problem, other than the obligatory
Clipper shortcomings (read: ownership/man-agement), is the lack of
guards. Fitch loves the young forwards. ``I really like  &UR; Lorenzen
Wright &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and ( &UR; Rodney &LR; )  &UR; Rogers &LR; , &UR;  &LR; on his good nights, is
terrific,'' said Fitch. ``He just needs to have more of them. And I
love ( &UR; Maurice &LR; ) &UR; Taylor &LR; . He's got great potential. They just need
to address the situation in the backcourt.'' Fitch had to use
 &UR; Darrick Martin  &LR; and  &UR; Pooh Richardson  &LR; at point guard last year,
which may be one reason the Clippers are interested in  &UR; Sherman
Douglas  &LR; (who certainly knows Ford). Fitch also is high on  &UR; Eric
Piatowski &LR; , &UR;  &LR; although he said, ``He's more of a 30-minute-a-game
shooting guard.'' Fitch had two years left on his contract when the
Clippers let him go. Let's hope he doesn't have to jump through
hoops to get what's his; some of his predecessors have had to do
that and more ... Ford, meanwhile, is at his third NBA post. He has
plenty of company, however, including  &UR; Pat Riley &LR; , &UR; Mike
Dunleavy &LR; , &UR; Don Nelson &LR; , &UR; Bernie Bickerstaff &LR; , &UR; Del
Harris &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and &UR; Lenny Wilkens &LR; . The clubhouse leader, however, is
Larry Brown. He's on his sixth NBA gig ... We hear that  &UR; Jayson
Williams's  &LR; dissent movement in the union got some covert oomph
from the NBA. Williams had more than a few people in his pocket
when he descended on the players meeting the day an agreement was
hatched. He was preparing to ask for a vote. It's interesting to
read the comments of  &UR; Antoine  &LR; ``Captain''  &UR; Walker  &LR; and  &UR; Keith Van
Horn  &LR; in the wake of the settlement. Both said they thought they
could find a way to make ends meet making $85 million-plus. That
must make  &UR; David Falk  &LR; happy.
</P>

   The status of the Big Three _  &UR; Scottie Pippen &LR; , &UR; Antonio
McDyess &LR; , and &UR; Tom Gugliotta  &LR; _ is still the hot topic. Sexton said
Pippen is leaning toward the Rockets, no big surprise. Asked about
doing a sign-and-trade, Sexton said, ``We're not going to do one
without knowing where we're going.'' In other words, forget that
big deal with the Grizzlies. McDyess? Who knows? His new agent also
represents Van Exel, which could point to a return to Denver.
(Somewhere,  &UR; Allan Bristow  &LR; is chuckling over that possibility.)
Houston is another possibility, although it would not be if Pippen
got there first. Houston's four returnees account for about $17
million in salary and their three first-rounders eat up another $2
million-$3 million. That leaves about $10 million for Pippen or
McDyess if the Rockets jettison their other guys. It's a mystery
why McDyess isn't a lock to stay in Phoenix, although the Suns were
not as enamored with him, especially early on, as others were. He's
still a work in progress, but there aren't many better places to
play. The Suns are somewhat handicapped in the free agent market
because of the rule that makes them keep some free agents on their
cap for 300 percent of what they made last year ( &UR; Rex
Chapman &LR; , &UR; Cliff Robinson &LR; ). Still, they look to be the
front-runners for  &UR; Luc Longley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; which at least gives them a
widebody to play against Shaq, Hakeem, David, and the rest. He's no
 &UR; Jim McIlvaine &LR; , &UR;  &LR; though. Googs is another tough one to peg.
Minnesota can pay him the most and wants him. In most instances,
that would be sufficient, and he probably will end up there. We've
also heard a couple sign-and-trade rumors involving him ...  &UR; Thomas
Hamilton  &LR; may resurface this week in, of all places, Miami. Maybe
Riley will do an  &UR; Ike Austin  &LR; with the perpetually overweight
Hamilton, who never seemed to understand the picture when he was
with the Celtics. The Heat also plan to re-sign  &UR; Mark
Strickland &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a very active 6-foot-9-inch guy who is another one of
those run-through-the-wall types that Riley likes ... The Celtics'
search for a big man won't include dipping Down Under for 1997
draft pick  &UR; Ben Pepper &LR; . ``I can't see it happening this season,''
Wallace said of the 7-footer, who is playing for the Victoria
Titans in Australia. Pepper is averaging about 15 points and 10
rebounds in 25 minutes a game. His coach is  &UR; Brian Goorjian &LR; , &UR;  &LR; an
American who used to be with  &UR; Jerry Tarkanian  &LR; in Las Vegas ...
Vaunted agent  &UR; Steve Kauffman  &LR; reports that a handful of teams have
called expressing interest in  &UR; Dominique Wilkins &LR; . The Rockets are
one, and can you envision him with Pippen, Hakeem, and Charles? ``I
don't know what's going to happen,'' said Kauffman, adding that
Wilkins would sign for the $1 million minimum now available for
veterans. ``He may have deficiencies, but he can score points.
 &UR; Eddie Johnson  &LR; is still in the league. Why not 'Nique?'' Kauffman
said Wilkins understands that he may be a utility player at best.
``He might not have been able to do that a year or two ago,''
Kauffman said. ``But he just wants to be in the league.''

KEY FOR JETS IS GROUND CONTROL

<P>
   DENVER _ Terrell Davis is the best football player in the
National Football League this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just may be as good as any running back I have ever seen,''
said Jets head coach Bill Parcells, whose team will take on Davis
and the Denver Broncos in Sunday's AFC Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   In a year of offensive wonders, the slashing Denver runner
outdid the great performances of quarterback Vinny Testaverde with
the Jets, Randall Cunningham and Randy Moss in Minnesota, plus
Jamal Anderson in Atlanta _ not to slight what Doug Flutie
accomplished in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the Jets' high command of Parcells and defensive
coordinator Bill Belichick can figure out how to take the
opponents' best player out of the offense and make them try to win
with lesser players.
</P>
<P>
   But, frankly, Davis scares Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Few teams have been able to even slow Davis down. In a Monday
night game a month ago, the Miami Dolphins handled Davis and beat
Denver. Last week, he came back to haunt them here in Mile High
Stadium with a 199-yard performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to stop this guy with seven defensive players
in the box,'' cautioned Jacksonville head coach Tom Coughlin, who
has been burned twice in the last year by Davis's sizzling running.
``You bring the eighth guy (a safety) up to help stop the run, and
then (John) Elway goes to work in the passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   This, then, will be the test. Can the Jets get lucky with seven?
Can their defensive front stop Davis and force Denver into strictly
a passing game? If they can, they think they can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has tremendous power,'' said Parcells, who spoke with
both respect and fear in his voice. ``He sees the play. He makes
great cuts. And he can run through people. We will have our hands
full.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they don't say it publicly, the Jets expect to score a
lot of points. This offense might be working better than any unit
Parcells has ever coached in the NFL. The talent may not be equal
to what he has had on some other teams, but the schemes and the
efficiency have been exceptional in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   A critical factor for the Jets will be how they handle the noise
factor in Mile High Stadium. It is one of the toughest venues for a
visiting team. With all of the success that Denver teams have had
over the years, the home crowd has become as sharp as any in
raising the decibel level when the opposing quarterback comes to
the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The tackles and wide receivers, who are farthest from the
quarterback, will have a difficult time hearing Vinny Testaverde.
In each Denver home game, the crowd noise undoubtedly produces
``motion'' penalties, and, in turn, long-yardage passing situations
for visiting teams.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the Broncos want it. They have a complicated set of
blitzes and will be coming after Testaverde, hoping to force him to
throw the ball prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver defense is not great. It is helped by the fact that
the offense scores a lot of points and generally gives it a lead.
</P>
<P>
   The key for the Jets is all packaged in the run. If they somehow
can slow down Davis, and also get a big game out of Curtis Martin _
as they did in beating Jacksonville last week _ they could be on
their way to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If not, it will be Davis heading to Florida and looking for his
third straight Most Valuable Player award, to go with last year's
Super Bowl and this year's regular season.

UMASS SHOWS KU IT'S READY FOR PRIME TIME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AMHERST _ On the eve of Saturday's University of
Massachusetts-Kansas game, Minuteman junior forward Chris Kirkland
was asked if he was ready to face Jayhawks standout forward Kenny
Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Kirkland fired back. ``Is he ready for me?''
</P>
<P>
   No, he wasn't. Neither were the other members of the 15th-ranked
Jayhawks. They faced a Minutemen team that showed as much
aggression and determination as it had all season. UMass made big
shots when needed, came up with practically every loose ball,
dominated the offensive glass, and played suffocating defense.
</P>
<P>
   And when the final buzzer sounded, the same team that suffered
lopsided defeats to Iona and Marshall this season had scored a
64-60 upset over the Jayhawks before a sellout crowd (9,493), some
of whom stormed the court in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   UMass guard Monty Mack had 20 points, center Lari Ketner had 15
points and 3 blocks, and Kirkland finished with 10 points, 8 boards
and 3 steals for UMass (7-8), which beat Kansas for the first time
in the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one up on Cal now,'' said UMass coach Bruiser Flint,
referring to former head man John Calipari (now coach of the New
Jersey Nets), whose teams reached the Elite Eight and Final Four of
the NCAA tournament but failed to beat Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling him tonight. (Calipari) couldn't beat Roy
(Williams, Kansas coach) and I got him. I'm calling him. He always
gets on me about (Connecticut coach Jim) Calhoun: `You know if I
was there, you know I'd beat Calhoun, right?' I got this one.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Minutemen had given Saturday's effort all season, there
is no telling what their record would be. Instead it was their
first consecutive wins of the season (UMass beat Duquesne Wednesday
night). They also battled back from a 33-30 halftime deficit,
marking their first win of the season when trailing at the break.
It marks the closest UMass has been to .500 since it was 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the type of games we live for. We know if we don't
play in these type of games, we'll get blown out,'' said UMass
guard Charlton Clarke (9 points, 6 assists), who, along with other
players, said the team was primed to avenge last season's 73-71
loss at Allen Field House.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot 10-inch senior widebody had arguably his best game of
the season, leading a UMass attack that outscored Kansas 42-2 in
the paint and outrebounded the Jayhawks, 46-33. Leading the way for
UMass on the boards was junior forward Mike Babul, who finished
with a career-high 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the difference in the game was that they annihilated
us on the boards in the second half, and when we got good shots, we
couldn't convert,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman guard Jeff Boschee had 16 points to lead Kansas (12-4)
and senior guard Ryan Robertson had 13. Sophomore center Eric
Chenowith had 11 points and 10 rebounds, but he was contained by
Ketner throughout and played his best when Ketner was on the bench
with foul trouble. Gregory, hawked by Babul much of the game,
finished with 6 points, 7 below his average.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its sluggish play, Kansas battled back several times
from as many as 8 points down in the second half. Trailing, 58-52,
with 5:56 left, Boschee hit consecutive treys to tie it at 58 with
3:35 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago,'' said Flint, ``it would have been through for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But UMass held, getting two free throws by Ketner and a basket
by Kirkland to take a 62-58 lead with 2:33 left.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson cut the lead to 62-60 on a jumper with 2:12 left, and
UMass failed to convert with a minute to go, but Boschee, dribbling
in the backcourt, had the ball batted off his foot by Kirkland and
Babul came up with it.
</P>
<P>
   With 18.9 seconds left, Clarke missed the front end of a
one-and-one, but Boschee misfired on a trey attempt as Ketner ran
out on the wing to alter the shot. Clarke rebounded, was fouled,
and sank two free throws with eight seconds left for the final
margin.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Minutemen the signature win they have looked for
much of the season, but neither they nor Flint were surprised with
the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we have been playing better since last week,'' said
Flint. ``We made mistakes against them like we did last year, but
the thing we did tonight, the thing we haven't done all season, is
that we played through it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Here's a summary of the impeachment trial stories that have moved
for Sunday's paper:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TRIAL (Washington) _ Summarizing the Republican case
against President Clinton in a speech evoking the shades of heroes
past, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said Saturday afternoon that the
presidency could be ``permanently damaged'' if the Senate failed to
remove Clinton from office. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ASSESS (Washington) _ On Saturday, the third and final
day of their opening arguments, House managers tackled the most
fundamental question underlying the nation's second presidential
impeachment trial. Do Clinton's efforts to cover up his
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky amount to the ``high crimes
and misdemeanors'' the nation's founders had in mind for removal of
an elected president? By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SCENE (Washington) _ In theory, the Paula Jones lawsuit
has been settled. But it continues to haunt the president. His
defense lawyers complained that the House Republican prosecutors
had been referring ``again and again'' to Clinton's deposition in
the Jones suit, despite the fact that the full House rejected
perjury charges built around that testimony. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-NOTEBOOK (Washington) _ A certain sloppiness has
infected the trial of President Clinton, at least when it comes to
spelling. The first big mistake came on the first day, when
senators signed their oaths to be impartial with pens whose
inscriptions scrambled the letters in the country's name: the
``Untied States.'' By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-EAGLES (Palm Beach, Fla.) _ Most of the Republicans who
gathered here at this sunny resort last week were less then eager
to draw attention to their presence as Washington is overcome not
only by frosty weather but by the impeachment trial of President
Clinton. But the fact that contributors traveled here _ and
politicians from Capitol Hill flew in to hobnob with them _ is
testament to how nothing gets in the way of Republicans courting,
wooing and hitting up the party's most reliable donors. By Richard
L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REPUBS (Washington) _ It was a strange sight. Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., was offering a compromise plan that would have
abbreviated President Clinton's impeachment trial and avoided
witnesses. His proposal was shot down by his fellow Republicans in
the Senate, but it infuriated conservatives in his state, who have
vowed to field a candidate against him. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ROSS (Washington) _ With President Clinton on trial for
his political life, the name of Sen. Edmund G. Ross of Kansas is
apt to come up whenever people talk about courage, honor and duty.
According to American political legend, he chose personal ruin
rather than betray his principles, defying his party leadership in
voting to acquit President Andrew Johnson during the last
presidential impeachment, in 1868. If he had voted the other way,
Johnson would have been removed and American history might have
been much different. By David Stout.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-RDP (Washington) _ As the duel over impeachment
witnesses intensified, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority
leader, has suggested to Democrats that a bipartisan group of
senators deal with the issue, but the Democratic leader rebuffed
his offer and called it premature. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   DOWD-COLUMN (Washington) _ While there is an undeniable appeal
to the notion of enforced silence on usually prolix senators _ the
equivalent of a national mute button _ the Trial of the Century is
proving less than scintillating. By Maureen Dowd.
</P>
<P>
   EDIT-IMPEACH (Undated) _ Removing President Clinton from office
for the offenses presented by House impeachment managers sacrifices
something too important _ the orderly transfer of power on a
four-year schedule _ to accomplish a condemnation that can be
delivered through other means.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-HOWLONG?-REVIEW (Washington) _ Whether they want to see
President Clinton driven from office or whether they have
completely tuned out the Senate impeachment trial, Americans, on
the first anniversary of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, do agree on
one thing: They want it to be over. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-QUIXOTE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A friend recently gave Rep.
Henry Hyde the original Broadway cast recording of the ``Man of La
Mancha,'' and when in odd moments he listens to its hummable tunes
about the Spanish Inquisition, he also hears Quixote sing:
``Heathens and wizards and serpents of sin, all your dastardly
doings are past. For a holy endeavor is now to begin and virtue
shall triumph at last!'' By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CLINTON (Washington) _ President Clinton kept a studied
distance Saturday from his impeachment trial in the Senate,
focusing not on the charges laid out against him by Republican
prosecutors, aides said, but on the next big event on his political
calendar: the State of the Union speech on Tuesday. By Adam
Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-JUDGES (Washington) _ Three House managers on Saturday
drew a parallel between the accusation that President Clinton lied
before the grand jury about his relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky and the Senate's perjury convictions of three federal
judges. By Don Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SCHLESINGER (Undated) _ For months, members of Congress
have taken to quoting famous historians to back up their own views
on the impeachment of President Clinton. Twice Saturday, for
example, House Republicans Steve Buyer of Indiana and Charles
Canady of Florida quoted the writings of Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to
argue for Clinton's removal. Just one problem: Schlesinger, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning author who was an aide to President John F.
Kennedy, has come out firmly against Clinton's impeachment. By Paul
Zielbauer.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-GRAHAM (Washington) _ Like the other Republican
congressmen appointed to prosecute President Clinton, Lindsey
Graham of South Carolina went before the Senate on Saturday as a
lawyer, entwining evidence and precedents to argue for the
president's expulsion from office. In an evocative and sometimes
provocative twist, Graham cast himself as ``a child of the South''
whose exposure to racial discrimination had made him appreciate the
importance of civil rights, not just for blacks but for women. By
Frank Bruni.

NO HYPE: THIS IS ONE SUPERIOR SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ If your pigskin juices aren't flowing Sunday, stop
trying to lay any jive on someone about being a football fan.
You're a 1,000-percent fraud.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the day I circle on my annual Gotta Be There list is the
Saturday afternoon of the Final Four. For any legit hoop fan, it
doesn't get any better than being a part of the buzz about a
half-hour before the first game of the doubleheader. At that time,
all four teams share an equal belief, no matter how far-fetched,
that it clearly is their year, that destiny is on their side, and
that the only curious part of the whole affair is why the other
teams have even bothered to show up. If you're wearing the colors
of a competing school, you actually feel sorry for all those other
fans, since you know how disappointed they're going to feel when
the trophy is handed over to your team around 11:30 EST on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   I would have to think the only comparable day for the serious
football fan is this particular Sunday. It's the beginning of
football's Final Four, even if it's not all played out in one site
and the actual in-person attentions are split. For the televiewer,
it is pre-Super Sunday, only twice as good. You don't have to sit
around all damn afternoon and wade through the endless pregame
stuff, either. I mean, hey, the game here starts at 12:30 Eastern,
a fabulous 11:30 Central. Can't beat that.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all pre-Super Sundays are not created equal, which is
why there is such general interest in today's. I'd have to say this
is about as good as it's been in a long time. You've got four teams
with a combined record of 59-9. The team with the most losses, the
Jets, has lost just once in their last 11 games, so they are as hot
as those other juggernauts.
</P>
<P>
   The scenarios in both the NFC and AFC are about the same, in
that each conference final headlines a team that has had auras of
both invincibility and inevitability for most of the season against
a team that may not completely stack up on paper but is plenty good
enough to pull off the so-called upset and is coached by someone
who has been there (as well as here and everywhere).
</P>
<P>
   The fact that one of the favorites is also the defending
champion spices the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing making the Broncos-Jets and Vikings-Falcons
matchups so intriguing is the unarguable fact that each favorite is
acknowledged to be better on offense than defense. No one is saying
the defenses are crummy or anything, but they're both better at
outscoring you than shutting you down. When I was in Denver last
week, for example, people were all over the Broncos' secondary,
which had been toasted by Dan Marino during that much-discussed
31-21 loss in Week 16. As an outsider, I thought, ``Gee, so they
were lit up by Dan Marino. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to
me that's happened on one or two occasions to other teams over the
past 14 years.'' Anyway, the secondary took the heat and its
response, in conjunction with the rest of the Denver defense, was
to hold Miami to 3 points last Saturday. That, as an aside, is a
good way to make sure you cover.
</P>
<P>
   But Denver generally wins by outscoring you. They're an ``over''
kind of team. The lowest point total in any of their 17 contests
this season has been 37 (a 21-16 victory at Seattle in Week 6).
Since then, the fewest they've scored in victory is 27. Meanwhile,
they have allowed more than 30 twice.
</P>
<P>
   So logic tells you the Jets might very well be able to move the
ball. The only other thing I want to say about them is that
Keyshawn Johnson is a strange phenomenon. In contrast to Randy
Moss, whose basic image consists of making an over-the-shoulder
grab on a sideline about 40 yards downfield, Johnson is very much a
hard-hat receiver. He's big and strong and not afraid of nuthin'.
I'm not saying Moss is, just that Keyshawn is not what you'd
expect, given his mouth and all. No pretty boy, he. He will run the
sideline and he will also run across the middle, where danger
lurks. He will stick his nose in there. Who'd have believed that?
</P>
<P>
   Denver ought to win, sure, but the Jets absolutely, positively
have a shot _ if Bill Belichick &AMP; Co. can slow Terrell Davis a
little. You're saying, ``Oh, gee, I really need this guy to tell me
that?'' Well, sometimes life's all about restating the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   This game they're paying me to watch has fascination because
people are still wondering what the 15-2 Falcons are really all
about. We know what the Vikings are all about: They score points.
They are the highest-scoring team in NFL history, and they even
have a placekicker who is perfect on the season. This has never
happened before, and if I were the Vikes, I'd be worrying. I'm not
saying they're going to lose, Sunday, or two weeks from now, but if
and when they do lose, isn't it obvious how it would come down?
</P>
<P>
   The Vikes are trailing by 2 points in the final minute. They
drive down the field and position Gary Anderson for, oh, let's say,
a 29-yarder. The snap, ball down, kick is up . . . Omigod! He
hooked it!
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with this scenario is that the Vikings haven't
really had a close game since they lost at Tampa Bay nine
devastating victories ago. But if they do . . .
</P>
<P>
   Understand that the Falcons have had the best record in football
since the middle of last season. They must be taken seriously. It's
a macho team with a major running back in Jamal Anderson and a
front seven that led the league with a plus-20 turnover margin and
44 takeaways. On top of everything else, they're even trying to win
one for the Reever.
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure: Football doesn't always float my boat
completely. Sunday is the exception. My only regret is the fact
that Da Boss has me working, which means I've got to miss some of
the AFC game. I'm not complaining. I'm whining. For Sunday is pro
football's High Holy Day, and on this occasion I'm as much a
worshipper as the next guy.

   It was announced last week that Arum would be among the newest
inductees into the Boxing Hall of Fame in June, joining rival
promoters Don King and Lou Duva, who have already been enshrined.
King was the first of the modern-day Three Muskeeters of boxing to
be elected, followed by Duva last year and now Arum, but the latest
honoree said Friday that he doesn't belong there, and neither do
the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first inclination was to turn the thing down, but several
people told me not to,'' Arum said. ``They said it was better not
to embarrass the Hall of Fame, which I think is a great thing
that's good for boxing. So I'll go to the induction and say what I
have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   What Arum has to say is the truth, which, frankly, isn't always
what comes out of a boxing promoter's mouth. The proof of that came
at a press conference years ago when Arum was asked about an
apparent contradiction in a position he was taking. He replied,
``Yesterday I was lying. Today I'm telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be an anthem for boxing promoters, but it is Arum's
honest position today that rather than being sent to a Hall of
Fame, modern promoters like himself and King should have a special
wing in the Hall of Shame for what they did to boxing over the past
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the current promoters should be in because when boxing
was rising high in the '70s and early '80s with Ali and Frazier and
Foreman and Hagler and Hearns and Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran and
all those other great fighters, it was no thanks to us,'' Arum
said. ``We had an opportunity to keep it riding high and we screwed
it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of our greed and our backbiting and our double
dealing, what inevitably happened was that we lost the networks and
boxing fell out of favor with the public. To a large extent it was
our fault. Not solely, but to a large extent. We could have
prevented it. At the least, we allowed it to happen. That's why we
don't belong in the Hall of Fame. None of us. Including Bob Arum.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard Law School and a former Justice Department
attorney under Bobby Kennedy, Arum is a highly intelligent man who
stumbled into sport's red light district with Muhammad Ali and
never left. He has become a millionaire many times over from boxing
and staged some of his era's biggest fights yet, in the end, he is
right about what the big promoters have done to the sport that fed
them.
</P>
<P>
   But how could quick-witted men like Arum and King allow such rot
to eat away the game's foundation _ the small shows and free
network exposure that remains the key for any sport's long-term
growth?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're blinded by greed and competition,'' Arum said. ``The
greater good was always put on the back burner by all of us. I'm
ashamed to say that but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Shame is seldom associated with boxing promoters, who, as a
fraternity, will say just about anything to justify a fight or make
a buck. They are promoters in the P.T. Barnum sense, hustlers who
too often operate on the shady side of sport's streets.
</P>
<P>
   But they also have made many fighters millions and provided some
of the most glorious sporting events in history. The list of Arum's
big fights is a long one and over the years he has worked with
nearly every major gate attraction in the sport and done well by
them and for them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the final analysis, Arum is right about the collective
guilt he shares _ with King, in particular _ for the sorry state of
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Although boxing is undergoing a bit of a renaissance _ with
King, Arum, and Duva working together to book bouts such as the
Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight unification, the Oscar
De La Hoya-Ike Quartey welterweight showdown, and a Pernell
Whitaker-Felix Trinidad title fight _ Arum believes this may not be
quite the good sign some see it as. Rather, he fears it could be a
final death knell, a last gasp that will eventually be snuffed out
by the forces of greed and revenge that have battered boxing for 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What boxing needs is for all the elements to get together and
form a national commission to hear disputes,'' Arum said. ``Someone
who can iron things out and has the power to make us all behave the
way we should.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be the government, but the US Senate will enact
legislation that enables that to happen, I think. Someone like a
Mills Lane would be a perfect choice because no one has ever
questioned his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's not the only one. A Mike Trainer would be OK. He
knows the business but is long out of it.'' (Trainer is Leonard's
former adviser.) ``He's been removed from the combat. Or maybe some
retired federal judge with an interest in boxing. We need someone
to come in like Judge Landis did in baseball after the Black Sox
scandal and give it all credibility again.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even the recent rash of big fights has convinced Arum that
things have changed, because what he sees is not a decision to
suddenly begin doing the right thing but a desperate attempt to
revive the industry with a short-term burst of clear thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were made because boxing is in such a deplorable state
that there is no other alternative,'' Arum said. ``If you don't put
A in against B, neither one can earn a living today because we're
down to a situation where there's HBO and pay-per-view so if HBO
says they won't do a fight except Whitaker-Trinidad, then it's
going to happen because there's no alternative for the promoters to
take the fighters anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, even the return of (Mike) Tyson is
counterproductive for the sport because he takes the focus away
from boxing. It becomes a circus that reflects badly on boxing.
Personally, I think time may be running out on boxing. We're
beginning to see our fan base erode and our corporate sponsorship
erode. Either we get a national commission with clout or we've got
no shot.''
</P>

   You see some odd things at the fights. Here's one of them. Early
last week, a young Japanese man appeared at the MGM Grand in Las
Vegas with a huge ``Team Tyson'' tattoo on his forearm, complete
with tiger, and Tyson's likeness on his biceps. He spoke no English
but had come from Osaka to see Tyson fight, as he had many times
before. Tyson's manager, Shelly Finkel, met him in the lobby and
asked why he was such a fanatical Tyson supporter. The young man
told Finkel that on her death bed, his grandmother had told him to
follow Tyson and to be like him. When Finkel related the story to
Tyson, the former heavyweight champion replied, ``What the
(expletive) was wrong with his grandmother?'' . . . Here's another
story that will go basically unnoticed. While Tyson earned $10
million Saturday night and reportedly had another $13 million
advanced to him from future purses by Showtime to pay off IRS
liens, and while Francois Botha grossed $1.8 million, veteran
boxing judge Art Lurie had to turn down a $4,000 payday to work the
fight because he is a frequent golfing partner of Botha's at the
Las Vegas Country Club. Lurie had to settle for $500 for judging
one of the undercard fights . . . Already scrambling to replace a
canceled March appearance by Prince Naseem Hamed with a title shot
for former Olympic gold medalist David Reid, HBO Sports senior vice
president for programming Lou DiBella also had to scurry to flesh
out his Feb. 27 card after Shannon Briggs pulled out of a main
event with Lou Savarese at Madison Square Garden. HBO urged
Briggs's manager, Marc Roberts, to persuade Briggs to go through
with the bout, otherwise he might have seen the last of his fighter
on HBO because this is not the first problem he's caused the
network. Briggs did not relent, though, and the bout has been
replaced with a better fight: World Boxing Council lightweight
champion Cesar Bazan (34-2-1, 23 KOs) in a rematch with the man he
took the title from, Stevie Johnston (25-1, 14 KOs). The co-feature
remains International Boxing Federation light heavyweight champion
Reggie Johnson vs. Will Taylor, with HBO hoping to get Johnson to
fight Roy Jones Jr. next . . . Speaking of problems, HBO's
contractual ones with Hamed have been ironed out and he will fight
on the network April 10 in London. No opponent has yet been
scheduled but several are under discussion. The sides reached
agreement on a contract extension that increased Hamed's share of
the take while extending HBO's exclusive rights to his fights in
the US. HBO also will put Marco Antonio Barrera on the next two
Hamed undercards, trying to build him up for a potential November
pay-per-view fight with Hamed in the US . . . Meanwhile, Hamed's
former promoter, Frank Warren, just signed a $12 million check over
to King to end their contractual relationship after King beat him
in a lawsuit in England. Coincidentally, their relationship began
because King wanted to get his hands on Hamed and bring him to
Showtime. ``Best $12 million I ever spent,'' Warren said . . . King
may be out of Tyson's life but he wasn't out of Saturday night's
Tyson-Botha fight. His son, Carl King, still holds a contract with
Botha that gives him 16.7 percent of this purse. Botha's manager,
Sterling McPherson, gets the same percentage and is trying to
challenge King's claim with the Nevada Athletic Commission, saying,
``The difference is, I've helped Botha's career and helped him get
this fight with Tyson while Carl hasn't done anything. I've got the
feeling he thinks he's going to just come in the day of the fight
and collect $300,000.'' The commission will put the manager's end
of Botha's purse in escrow pending a postfight hearing . . . WBC
super featherweight champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. (19-0) returns
home to Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Mich., Feb. 17 to make his
second title defense vs. Carlos Rios (44-2-1). He will receive the
key to the city that week as well as a relatively easy title
defense on TNT network. On the same card, ageless Jorge Paez
(62-12-4) faces former world champion Tom ``Boom Boom'' Johnson
(47-5-1) . . . Word is Mayweather's father, Floyd Sr., was irate to
learn that his son sat at Tyson's side during Tyson's
obscenity-laden meeting with a group of media last Monday.
Believing that kind of publicity is not good for young Mayweather
and fearing what the 21-year-old champion might conclude from
watching Tyson, the father reportedly told friends, ``I'm a ghetto
man myself, but there's something severely wrong with that man.''

LPGA'S HALL MANAGES TO RELAX A LITTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are about to change the lock, but you can't say they are
swinging open the door to the LPGA Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   It is universally regarded as the sports shrine with the
toughest standards for entrance, and that won't change, even if, as
expected, the player membership of the LPGA votes for the new
criteria. For more than 10 years, there has been talk of relaxing
the requirements, and there are those who feel they aren't going
far enough.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, players must meet one of these rigid standards:
(1) at least 30 wins, two of them majors; (2) 35 wins, one of them
a major; or (3) 40 wins. Talk about the bar being high. It is so
high that only 13 players have been inducted, a very exclusive club
indeed. (The other women who make up the 15-member Hall of Fame are
Dinah Shore, an honorary inductee for basically putting the game as
we know it on the map, and Betty Jameson, winner of 10 events
between 1947-55. The first Hall of Fame class, in 1951, was voted
in by members of the media and included Jameson.)
</P>
<P>
   The roll call includes no-brainers such as Patty Berg, Babe
Didrikson Zaharias, Kathy Whitworth, and Nancy Lopez, but there are
glaring omissions, such as Donna Caponi (24 wins, four majors),
Judy Rankin (26, 0), Sandra Palmer (19, 1), and Marlene Hagge (25,
1).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's abominable that they aren't in,'' says Jane Blalock, who
gives way to modesty in not adding her name to that list. She, too,
belongs, if for no other reason than her remarkable accomplishment
of making the cut in every tournament she entered from 1969-80.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have a Hall of Fame?'' asks Blalock, the former New
Hampshire and New England Amateur champion who won 27 times (no
majors) in her 19 years on Tour. ``For what purpose? It should be
to honor people for great contributions to the sport, but they have
made it so sacred, with so few in it, that it's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you think this is simply the view of a bitter woman on
the outside looking in, consider what Patty Sheehan said after
qualifying for the Hall of Fame in 1993: ``They better change the
criteria or they are going to have a Hall of Fame with nothing but
dead players in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the bar is about to be lowered, ever so slightly, and two
current players will reap immediate fame. Amy Alcott and Beth
Daniel will meet the new four standards: (1) a major championship;
(2) at least one Player of the Year honor; (3) at least one Vare
Trophy for low scoring average; (4) 27 career points, with 1 point
for each victory, 2 for a major.
</P>
<P>
   This is great news for Alcott (29 victories, five of them
majors) and Daniel (32 wins, one major), two quality acts for a
long time, but what of those aforementioned stars? Those who helped
keep the Tour afloat all those years when few were watching? They
are left on the outside because the new criteria will not be
retroactive; they will apply only to those active in 1998 and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   A veterans committee will be created to review the
accomplishments of players such as Rankin and Caponi, but it seems
a slight to players who contributed so much to the game. Blalock
said she was introduced as a Hall of Famer at a recent dinner and
felt embarrassed. ``I feel as if our self-respect is being
attacked,'' says Blalock, who runs a sports management agency in
Boston, ``that we must defend ourselves for not having achieved
something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Hall of Fame should reward excellence, longevity, great
play,'' she says. ``But the Tour is different than it was in the
'50s and '60s. It is just so much harder to win now.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcott has been looking for that one painfully elusive win, her
first since the 1991 Dinah Shore, and while she thinks she still
has it in her (``I would like to win my way in''), her honor could
come via the ballot, not a march into the winner's circle. If
that's the case, Alcott need not apologize, for she earned her way
into the Hall of Fame a long time ago, requirements
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standards are tough,'' says Alcott. ``But they should be
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   No argument here, but they shouldn't be as tough as they are,
not when you consider that a win today is so much harder to achieve
than it was when these standards were established. There is a place
for subjectivity, for giving weight to personality and credit to
those players who truly left the game better than it was.

   Say Jack Nicklaus, think George Archer? Not usually, which is
not to show disrespect to Archer, the former Masters champ and one
of the most underrated players of his era. But Archer came to mind
when it was announced last week that Nicklaus, who turns 59
Thursday, will have hip replacement surgery, thus ending a string
of Masters appearances that began in 1959. He will need 4-6 months
to recuperate and there is no timetable for his return to
competition. A few years ago, Archer walked away from competition,
had the same kind of surgery, and last summer the tall, quiet man
from Northern California returned to cash a winner's check on the
Senior Tour. Can Nicklaus return as dramatically? Why not? He is
the most celebrated player in the sport's history, and if you need
a reminder of his greatness, think back to only April 1998, when he
battled kids half his age and became the oldest player to record a
top 10 finish in the Masters, finishing just three shots off the
lead. But what fuels Nicklaus's desire to get healthy and live
without the pain in his hip is not so much a thirst for more glory;
it is more celebratory, for in 2000 he would like to play all four
majors. The venues are special to him: Augusta National needs no
introduction, as he has won the green jacket six times; Pebble
Beach is where he won the US Open in 1972; St. Andrews was home for
two of his three Claret Jug triumphs; Valhalla in Louisville is a
course he designed, one in which he takes great pride. It seems
fitting to welcome in a new century of golf with the most
significant player from the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   So you say it's hard to fathom a Masters without Nicklaus? Does
the return of Seve Ballesteros to The Players Championship help?
Probably not, since you probably didn't realize that the Spaniard
had not been invited to the annual March gala since 1995. His game
certainly has not reminded anyone of vintage Ballesteros, so why
the change of heart? Perhaps it's hard to say no to a guy whose
career accomplishments are being hailed with the ultimate honor. A
few days before TPC _ and a short drive up the road _ Ballesteros
will be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame, so it seemed
natural to extend an invitation and help soothe bad feelings.
Ballesteros reportedly was angered at not being invited to last
year's TPC . . . He is ranked 52d in the world, but little is known
about Frankie Minoza of the Philippines, other than the fact he is
39 and a regular on the Japanese PGA Tour. Those who scoff at the
world rankings will be interested to see how Minoza fares in early
February when he tees it up in the Benson &AMP; Hedges Malaysian Open,
an event sanctioned jointly by the European PGA Tour. With Ryder
Cup points available, some iron has already committed, namely Lee
Westwood and Darren Clarke . . . During the never-ending coverage
of Michael Jordan's second retirement from the NBA, he noted that
he wanted to spend more time with his children _ or was it more
time with his golf clubs? Jordan will play in the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic Pro-Am, which begins Wednesday, and has been invited to
play in the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am two weeks later. Be
ready for more TV time devoted to Jordan (and the nauseating
Charles Barkley) than to those at the top of the leaderboard . . .
Nick Faldo ended 1998 on the upswing, with a strong effort at the
World Cup, and he talked of a renewed commitment to the European
Tour in hopes of qualifying for the Ryder Cup. Two rounds do not a
season make, but 1999 is off to a rocky start for the 41-year-old
Englishman. He opened with a 77 at the South African PGA Thursday
and, when asked if he were surprised, he told reporters: ``There
are no surprises anymore, just disappointments.'' Faldo didn't have
to wait long to prove himself correct, for he shot 76 Saturday and
was off to pack his bags, perhaps sharing a ride with countryman
Justin Rose, last summer's teen-age wonder who continues to hack it
around as a pro. He shot 78-74 . . . Packing bags is part of Fran
Quinn's lifestyle. The pride of Northborough was in Florida last
week, missing the cut at the first Nike Tour stop of the year.
Sunday he's playing in the final round of the South African PGA
championship, having shot 68-73 to make the cut . . . Another Bay
Stater, Geoff Sisk, started bogey-bogey-bogey at the Sony Open in
Hawaii, which is no way to embark upon a rookie campaign. Sisk
finished with a 77 Thursday and came back with a 72 Friday, but
missed the cut and was off to his next stop, the Hope Chrysler
Classic . . . Tough break for Retief Goosen. Literally, that is. He
fractured an arm skiing during the Christmas holiday and had to
withdraw from the South African PGA, just three months after
helping that country to a second straight Dunhill Cup victory . . .
What has been rumored for months may be made official this week:
The 2005 Ryder Cup in Ireland will be held at the K Club in
Straffan, County Kildaire . . . Ivan Lendl was awarded a sponsor's
exemption into this past week's Nike Tour stop and shot 79-77.
Please, find the man a senior tennis circuit.

   News that the LPGA has embraced the Futures Tour as its official
developmental circuit is wonderful for players such as Pam
Kerrigan. The Franklin native is an instructor at the Mike Adams
Academy of Golf at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., but at
34 she still has aspirations of playing professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be huge,'' says Kerrigan. ``Hopefully, if they take
it under their wing, it will be as great as the Nike Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The Futures Tour has been around for 19 years, and Kerrigan gave
it a shot a few years ago. But it was ``not up to par'' so she
began teaching. Last summer, Kerrigan played in a few Futures
events, and found that things had improved. Better venues. Better
fields. Better competition. Now that it is to the LPGA what the
Nike is to the PGA Tour, Kerrigan is seriously thinking about
joining full-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I didn't play any events until June and played
catch-up all summer,'' says Kerrigan. ``I would think about playing
it all year. It's a better measure than Tour School for getting
your card.''
</P>
<P>
   At her annual trip to Tour School last fall, Kerrigan fell one
shot shy. ``Very disappointing, to say the least,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The top three on the Futures money list will automatically get
cards for the next LPGA Tour season, and while Kerrigan and others
had hoped that figure would be five or 10, it is still a more
inviting option than Tour School.
</P>
<P>
   There will be 19 Futures events in 1999, and while the money is
small (total purses will be in the vicinity of $1 million), it is a
link to the LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the growing number of women worldwide entering the game,
it was evident to me there was a growing chasm between amateur or
collegiate golf and the LPGA Tour,'' says LPGA commissioner Jim
Ritts. ``This continues to ensure that potential stars are not
being lost in that chasm.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour will make its annual stop in Vermont, at Green Mountain
National GC at Killington July 22-24, and a second New England date
_ at Blue Run GC in Avon, Conn., July 15-17 _ has been added.

   Smoke-free restaurants are part of our culture. But smoke-free
golf courses? Don't choke on those cigars, gentlemen, but last
weekend on the PGA Tour of Australia they played the SmokeFree
Victorian Open in Melbourne. A gent by the name of Kenny Druce won,
but what got more press Down Under was the sponsor's request that
holes 1, 10, and 17 (and the clubhouse) be smoke-free. In one
newspaper, defending champion Brad King was pictured with a
cigarette, and the accompanying story detailed little about his
golf, but lots about his grip on the butts. King missed the cut,
then criticized the journalists, claiming he had honored the
smoke-free holes. Smoke-free golf courses? Geeesh. And some think
equipment makers have gone too far . . . Just so you don't think
you have cornered the market on inconsistency, take note: In that
Melbourne event, Matthew Millar shot 66 to share the first-round
lead _ then put up an 81 and missed the cut. Justin McKenzie opened
with a 68 before going home early with an 80. Feel better about
that 80-96 now? . . . No surprise to those who know or have taken
lessons from her, but Holly Ridge GC head professional Jane Frost
was cited as one of America's top 100 teachers by Golf magazine.
Also honored: Kevin Walker of Nantucket GC and Keith Lyford of the
Cranwell Golf School in Lenox . . . On these cold winter days, no
doubt Frank Leist can still manage a warm smile looking back on his
summer accomplishment. The longtime member at Brae Burn CC in West
Newton proved quite efficient at the fourth hole of the club's
nine-hole ``Highland Course.'' In consecutive rounds, Leist
recorded three birdies and an ace, all with a 4-iron.

FANS SHOULD BE SKY-HIGH FOR ELWAY'S HOME FINALE 
</HEADLINE>

   DENVER _ Sixteen seasons. Almost 30 miles of passing yardage.
More than 3,000 yards rushing. Three hundred touchdown passes.
Twenty playoff games. A couple dozen impossible comebacks.
Seventeen car dealerships. One Super Bowl championship.
</P>
<P>
   . . . so far.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway, who hit .318 for one of George Steinbrenner's farm
clubs a couple of lifetimes ago, Sunday will take the field at Mile
High Stadium for the last time. The defending Super Bowl champion
Broncos play Bill Parcells's upstart Jets for the AFC Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Elway isn't saying for sure that this is the
last roundup, but even his coach, the maniacal Mike Shanahan,
conceded Friday, ``Chances are, this will be John's last game at
Mile High. Everyone knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows, just as we all knew Michael Jordan was done in
Salt Lake City last June when he won his sixth and final NBA
championship. Jordan made it official last week, and his retirement
did not go unnoticed in the Elway household. There were many who
felt Stanford John should stop last January when he finally won a
Super Bowl, but he came back for one more ride.
</P>
<P>
   Elway on Jordan: ``I just looked at him and realized what he had
done, even though I didn't want to see him retire. He walked away
even though he still had a lot of basketball in him. No, I didn't
compare it to my situation. I think I'll always have a lot of
football in me _ whether I can play or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks here in the Rockies are preparing for a big sendoff. The
local CBS-TV affiliate is orchestrating a postgame ``El-way'' chant
and asking fans to linger for a lengthy tribute. Shanahan said he
expects the loudest crowd in the history of Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be great, but I guess I'm not going to look at it that
way,'' Elway said of the proposed farewell kiss. ``The fans have
always been great here. They were before I got here and they have
been in my 16 seasons. They're there when we win and they've been
there when we've lost. They are the best fans of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway said there is no timetable for his decision (sounding a
lot like Mike), and that there will be no family vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He did say, ``I don't know how I'm going to handle being away
from football. Maybe after six months, I'll break out in hives.
Right now, I'm thinking about the Jets. They're at the top of the
list. I haven't gone past Sunday. That's my total focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said, ``Certainly, he is the prototype NFL quarterback.
You think of a guy you'd like to have play for your team. I've had
the opportunity to witness first-hand and he's right up there with
the very best that ever played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway said his favorite conference championship memory was the
15-play, 98-yard drive against the Cleveland Browns that led to an
overtime victory (``It was my fourth year and kind of put me on the
map. It was a nostalgic old stadium. That's probably the highlight
of all my championship games.'') Asked about his favorite Mile High
moment, he cited a similar playoff drive against the Houston Oilers
in 1991 that led to a game-winning field goal. No one has to ask
about his career highlight: It's the Super Bowl victory over the
Packers in San Diego last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Elway has always been a team player,'' said Shanahan.
``He never wanted the focus on John Elway, and in my opinion, that
makes him the greatest ever to play.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be another Super Bowl before he hangs up his helmet.
But first, the Broncos have to get past the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience helps,'' said Elway. ``We come into this game a
little different. We've won a Super Bowl and we're over that hump.
I think we're pretty balanced. But even though we're home, we still
have to go out and play a good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway's premier weapon is running back Terrell Davis, who
shredded the Dolphins with 199 yards in last week's 38-3 blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, when the game is over, the crowd will roar one last
time for John Elway as he makes his final trek toward the south
stands and disappears from view for the final time at Mile High
Stadium.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Flip open the phone book for Minneapolis-St. Paul
and start counting the ``Andersons.'' Page after page after page of
them, nearly 16 pages of ``Andersons.''
</P>
<P>
   Scandinavians apparently found the chill of this icebox very
familiar, so reminiscent of their homes in Sweden, Norway, and
Denmark that many settled here in the upper Midwest. And there were
many ``Andersons'' among them.
</P>
<P>
   Start counting. Begin with the 53 ``A. Andersons'' on the first
page, then count ``Aaron Anderson'' and keep going, page after page
after page, and finally, 16 pages of minute type later, end the
long count with ``Yvonne Anderson.'' All told, there are 7,684
``Andersons'' just in this rather modest section of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   And there are several variations of the name, with one of the
most numerous being ``Andersen.'' Start counting the ``Andersens,''
nearly a full page of them, one ``Andersen'' after another
``Andersen,'' all told some 382 of them.
</P>
<P>
   It is no different with football. Rest assured of this: An
``Anderson'' or an ``Andersen'' or yet another ``Anderson'' will
have a marked impact on Sunday's NFC Championship game in the
Metrodome between the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons. And
the Minneapolis phone book notwithstanding, it is the Falcons who
have the Anderson advantage, with one ``Anderson'' (Jamal) and one
``Andersen'' (Morten) while the hometown Vikings must make do with
a solitary ``Anderson'' (Gary).
</P>
<P>
   But the Minnesota ``Anderson'' is perfect this season _ and who,
in any occupation, can say that? _ while the Falcons' ``Anderson''
is merely glittering like a gem and Atlanta's ``Andersen'' has to
be content with just being very good. It could be confusing if it
weren't so fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in football knows about the Falcons' superior runner,
Jamal Anderson. But a fascinating subplot could develop if Sunday's
game is close _ and it figures to be _ between Gary Anderson of the
Minnesota and Morten Andersen of Atlanta. Each is the placekicker
for his team, but that is far from the only similarity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the fact their last names are nearly identical,
consider these head-scratchers for the kickers:
</P>
<P>
   Each has played 17 seasons in the NFL; they were the first two
kickers taken in the 1982 draft. Morten Andersen broke in with New
Orleans just as Archie Manning was winding up his career and Gary
Anderson began in Pittsburgh as Terry Bradshaw was winding down
there.
</P>
<P>
   Each was born outside the United States, Andersen in Struer,
Denmark, and Anderson in Durban, South Africa. Each came to the US
when he was 17 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen has kicked in 260 NFL games; Anderson has kicked in
261.
</P>
<P>
   Each has made 99 percent of his point-after attempts. Andersen
has made 401 of 510 field goal attempts, while Anderson has been
successful on 420 of 525 attempts. The percentage for each is right
around 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Each stayed with his first team for 13 years. Andersen moved to
Atlanta from New Orleans, Anderson went to Philadelphia after the
Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is second in career scoring (1,845 points), Andersen is
third (1,761). Anderson is first in career field goals with 420,
Andersen is second with 401.
</P>
<P>
   And they are, arguably, the two best pure kickers ever. Both of
them, Anderson and Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody, but nobody comes close to us,'' said the Vikings'
Anderson. ``There are some good kickers in the league but, until
they've done it for 17 years, they're in a different category.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made for the last 15 years about the quarterback
Class of '83, with Dan Marino, John Elway, Jim Kelly, Tony Eason,
and Ken O'Brien, but how about the kicker Class of '82?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're the only ones from the Class of '82 still
around,'' said the Falcons' Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Andersen kicks the ball farther than Anderson
(Andersen has made as many 50-yard-plus field goals _ 35 _ as
Anderson has attempted). But Anderson is absolutely rhythmic in his
kicking. Anderson's field goals not only are always good _ at least
this season _ but they usually seem to split the uprights perfectly
in two. Few close calls with Anderson's field goals.
</P>
<P>
   And this year Anderson was perfect in his kicking, 35 of 35
field goals and 59 of 59 extra points. Anderson's perfect season
was the first in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good part of it is that I kick indoors now,'' said Anderson,
who played for a dome team for the first time this season. Still,
Anderson is not the first kicker ever to kick in a dome and, as he
good-naturedly points out, Andersen has played for a dome team his
entire career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not taking anything away from Morten, because he's a
tremendous kicker,'' said Anderson. ``He's a tremendous
long-distance kicker. But when you kick indoors, you're going to
try longer kicks. You don't have to worry about the wind or cold or
rain or snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the evidence, Anderson and Andersen are not twins.
The Falcons' Andersen has a shoe size of 12, while Minnesota's
Anderson has a more petite shoe, size 8.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Andersen kicks with his left foot, Anderson kicks with his
right.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Andersen already has a twin, a brother by the name of
Jakob.
</P>
<P>
   That said, though, in a state full of ``Andersons'' and
``Andersens,'' Gary and Morten may be the most noticeable of them
all Sunday.

PATTERSON NO PURPLE PATRIOT EATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The media love Jimmy Hitchcock, the former Patriot who tells us
how lousy everything was in New England.
</P>
<P>
   He is a player scorned, and now he has the right to gloat as a
member of the Minnesota Vikings, who will be in the Super Bowl if
they can get past the Atlanta Falcons Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of the Vikings' defense _ from 29th in the
league last season to 13th _ seems to have come about without major
personnel changes. Hitchcock was added at cornerback, and the only
other change was on the coaching staff, where Andre Patterson, also
a former Patriot (he assisted line coach Ray Hamilton), seems to
have had quite an effect on the aggressive Minnesota front line.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hitchcock, Patterson left the Patriots on good terms and
has no ax to grind. In fact, while he was grooming his players in
Minnesota this season, he also kept an eye on his former Patriot
players, particularly Chad Eaton, whom he also coached at
Washington State. Patterson, in fact, was the guy who saved Drew
Bledsoe's backside. Eaton would often get overanxious in practice
at Washington State and try to sack Bledsoe, who was off limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny,'' said Patterson. ``Chad was so excited in
practice. He gave everything in the games and everything in
practice. I'd have to say, `Don't touch Drew or you'll sit!' And he
finally got the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Chad develop into the player he is now is a great
sense of joy for me. I knew when I had him at Washington State that
he had a chance to be a dominating defensive lineman in the NFL.
And we're seeing now that he's on his way to being that. All he
ever needed was a chance and for someone to believe in him, and
those coaches in New England _ Ray, Sid (defensive coordinator
Steve Sidwell) and Pete (Carroll) _ have given him the chance and
now he's delivering for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson certainly provides a different perspective on the
Patriots than Hitchcock. Hitchcock hated Bill Parcells and got his
chance to be a starter under Carroll, but turned on Carroll after
he was traded to the Vikings during last year's draft. Hitchcock
claims that Carroll promised him he'd be a starter and wouldn't be
traded. Problem is, personnel man Bobby Grier made the deal after
the Patriots decided to take Tebucky Jones with their second pick
in the first round; with Steve Israel and Chris Canty already
aboard, they felt Hitchcock was expendable.
</P>
<P>
   We know how Hitchcock feels about Carroll; how does Patterson
feel about him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a terrific football coach,'' said Patterson. ``I've taken
a lot of the things that Pete and Steve Sidwell and Ray Hamilton
taught me here to the Vikings. I enjoyed my time in New England. I
enjoyed all of the people, the players, everyone around the
organization. I went from a very good situation to a great
situation. I couldn't have asked for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was asked about the offseason conditioning programs in
New England and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised when I left New England _ where the
program, I thought, was very well attended _ to come here where
guys are just scattered all over the place,'' he said. ``There are
guys who stay here and take part, but for the most part guys go off
to other places and condition themselves. I know that I don't see
my guys until the minicamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Denny Green does is, when you leave after the season he
tells each and every one of them that if they're not in shape when
they show up here for training camp, they're in jeopardy of losing
their jobs. Of course, you have guys like Cris Carter and Jake Reed
who just head down to Florida and work out like crazy. We have
players with a lot of pride when it comes to conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to conclude that the importance of offseason
conditioning programs is greatly exaggerated. The Vikings are 16-1.
</P>
<P>
   Around the league, attendance at strength and conditioning
programs is improving, as workout bonuses are added to contracts,
but the majority of teams have poorer attendance than the Patriots.
Tampa Bay and Denver seem to lead the pack. Players like living
year-around in Florida, where there is no state income tax, and in
Denver, because of the rich-and-famous lifestyle in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The best-attended program in the Northeast is the Jets', on Long
Island, where the fear that Bill Parcells instills in players has
made the program there as successful as it once was in New England.
</P>
<P>
   But who would want to stay in Minneapolis in winter?
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Viking Henry Thomas does not take part in the Patriots'
program and never took part in Minnesota's program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too cold,'' said Thomas. ``Players want to go somewhere
to work out where it's hot and where they feel they're getting a
better workout. I stay in Houston. I understand I have to be in the
best shape I can be in when training camp starts. I understand the
consequences. Maybe some players don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that Patriots strength coach Johnny Parker, one of
the best in the business, might just be one of those guys who would
think 99.9 percent attendance was too low? Probably. And that
attitude is a great one to have.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson also said it's not Willie McGinest's fault that he's
injured so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see a better-conditioned athlete,'' said Patterson.
``He works out all winter. If he didn't work out, if he didn't take
care of himself, OK, you'd say that's the reason he gets hurt. But
Willie is someone who enjoys working out. It's not torturous work
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, you just have to say that it's bad luck. Maybe
people don't want to hear that. But I had the same situation here
with Derrick Alexander. Everybody kept telling me he was going to
be a good player but they couldn't keep him on the field. This
year, we kept him on the field and he's blossomed into a pretty big
force on our defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's going to happen to Willie. He's already been to
a Pro Bowl, and those guys are usually motivated to get the status
back. He's a great athlete. What people have to understand is that
Willie plays a very violent position.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson also shed some light on Green. Don't forget, when
Green returned to the Vikings at the start of training camp, he had
a lot to prove. After the publication of a controversial book, in
which he talked about buying part of the team, nearly got him
fired, Green returned stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first day of camp, Denny outlined to the team the
goals that he wanted to accomplish,'' said Patterson. ``And
everybody was with him. Each day, each week, the team tried to meet
those expectations. It's been a beautiful thing to watch as we've
gone through the season. Denny is the ultimate motivator and he has
a team that believes in everything he says and will go through a
wall for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and the other Minnesota coaches have been awarded
contract extensions, though offensive coordinator Brian Billick may
leave to take a head job.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the NFC Championship game, Patterson said he
almost fell into the trap that most Falcons opponents have this
season: concentrating solely on Jamal Anderson and forgetting the
passing game. ``We have to be disciplined in our gaps,'' said
Patterson. ``What I have seen on Jamal is that he'll get his 3 or 4
yards for the first three quarters and then he'll start busting it
loose in the fourth quarter for 10-, 20-yard gains. What teams do
is they're so conscious of him they'll bring their safeties up to
stop him; meanwhile the two receivers are killing you. (Chris)
Chandler can hit you deep, and you have to be conscious of that and
conscious of the fact you need to have help in coverage of Tony
Martin and Terance Mathis.'' . . . The Patriots did the right thing
in the end by allowing Carroll to return as head coach. Give Bob
Kraft credit for not buckling under the pressure of the media and
talk-show blowhards. He did what a fair man would do, retaining a
coach that had taken the team to the playoffs despite injuries to
16 starters. Kraft expects Carroll to improve on some of his
shortcomings and will give him more authority to rule with a
stricter hand and leave no doubt that he is in charge. Kudos also
to Grier for recognizing that the locker room bickering was just a
case of players being players. They were the same players who
bickered when Parcells was here because he was too strict. They
wanted to be treated as adults, to motivate themselves, but when
they got their chance, they dropped the ball. Next year will be
different . . . Right before last year's draft, Irving Fryar was
asked by this reporter whether teams should stay away from players
who draw questions about their character, such as Randy Moss. His
response: ``When I see Randy Moss, I see myself. He has the talent,
the speed, and the love of the game. He might have taken a wrong
turn or two. But I got my life together because there were enough
people out there who showed me a little love and direction. If you
can surround him with the right players and coaches to show him the
right way to do things and act, it would be crazy to pass on a
talent like that.'' Fryar was a prophet. Moss may be the one
receiver in the league that nobody can cover. Speaking of Fryar, he
hasn't necessarily retired from football, just the Philadelphia
Eagles. His agent, Michael George, said Fryar ``would return to the
NFL with a Super Bowl contender.'' The leader in the clubhouse
right now is Green Bay, where Fryar could be reunited with Ray
Rhodes, his coach in Philadelphia. Fryar also would not be opposed
to returning to New England as a secondary receiver . . . The
Patriots have received more than 30 proposals to move their
training camp from Smithfield, R.I. One of them is from
Springfield, where the political machine thinks it can capitalize
on the Patriots' need for a Western Massachusetts season-ticket
base; but team officials say they already have one. The Patriots
have contracted with the state of Connecticut to build a $15
million facility somewhere in the state . . . Billick appears to be
the top choice in Cleveland, with Jacksonville offensive
coordinator Chris Palmer a close second. Palmer is also getting
serious consideration in Baltimore. It appears that Browns boss
Carmen Policy doesn't want a big-name coach after having personal
problems with Bill Walsh in San Francisco, which is why Policy
never made a bid for Mike Holmgren. One man the Cleveland media and
fans don't want back is Bill Belichick, who had four losing seasons
in five years of coaching the old Browns; despite his obvious skill
on defense, he was a complete bust handling the offense . . . Dom
Capers, fired in Carolina, appears to be the front-runner in Kansas
City . . . Speaking of Palmer, there were several reports around
the country that the Patriots were calling a press conference last
week to announce him as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Why not take some ex-Patriots out of their roles as critics,
commentators, and businessmen and let them coach the team? Here's
our suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   Assistant head coach: Andre Tippett.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach: Steve Grogan.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line coach: John Hannah.
</P>
<P>
   Tight ends coach: Don Hasselbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers coach: Randy Vataha.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs coach: Mosi Tatupu.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive assistant coach: Jim Rourke (never a Patriot, but a
personal favorite).
</P>
<P>
   Special teams/long snapping coach: Steve DeOssie.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking coaches: Gino Cappelletti, John Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator: Steve Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach: Fred Smerlas.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant defensive line coach: Mike Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers coach: Vincent Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs coach: Tim Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive assistant coaches: Roland James, Ronnie Lippett, Jim
Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   The head coach would be Hamilton, the current defensive line
coach, because he has the most experience.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Look for Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams, who has selected
Woolf Associates in Boston to represent him, to go to spring
training with the Texas Rangers but not make the squad. He'll
likely reject a demotion to the minors and be ready for the NFL
draft. The Redskins, who have the fifth and 11th picks, may trade
up to get Williams . . . Don't bet the ranch that Terry Glenn will
spend any more time in Parker's strength program. His agent, Jimmy
Gould, said, ``Terry will do what he thinks is best for himself. I
think there's a misconception out there that Terry wasn't in good
shape. He showed up to camp in very good shape. In addition to
taking part in some of the workouts in Foxborough, Terry did his
own and he also spent a week at Cris Carter's camp in Minnesota.
For Terry, it's been more a case of bad luck than lack of
conditioning.'' . . . Scituate's Jim Campbell was selected as the
all-time Patriots fan in a promotion run by the NFL in conjunction
with Visa. One fan was selected from each NFL city to be inducted
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, in ceremonies
Sunday. Campbell has been a Patriot season ticket-holder for all 39
years of the team's existence and once put off heart surgery to
attend a game . . . Some organizations are getting away from the
old boy network and taking chances on young, inexperienced head
coaches. One is clearly the Chargers, who hired young Mike Riley
from Oregon State, where he accumulated an 8-14 record. Riley was
once offensive coordinator at Southern Cal, a position that often
brings great exposure, and it didn't hurt that the son of San Diego
general manager Bobby Beathard played for Riley. Beathard wanted a
young, offensive-type coach who could help quarterback Ryan Leaf
develop and mature. Andy Reid, the quarterbacks coach for the
Packers, was selected for the same reasons by the Eagles, who have
the second pick in the draft and will likely take Williams or trade
down to get a quarterback. Reid is well-respected and could
probably make a living as a motivational speaker. In his interview
with the Eagles, Reid was extremely positive about a pretty bleak
situation and very detailed; he even explained how to execute an
effective screen pass, something the Eagles haven't been able to do
in four years. Whether he can run an entire team is another story.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It's increasingly clear how weighty the job of head coach can
be. Marty Schottenheimer had to resign after 10 years and take time
away from the game. Jimmy Johnson almost quit last week, only to be
talked out of it by Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga, who allowed
Johnson to hire Dave Wannstedt as assistant head coach. June Jones
left San Diego for the University of Hawaii, hoping to provide a
better lifestyle for his family, which includes a sick wife. Dennis
Erickson took Riley's job at Oregon State rather than try for
another pro job. Owners are becoming more unrealistic with their
demands on coaches, demands they would never make on CEOs of major
corporations. In some places _ including New England _ anything
short of the Super Bowl is considered failure. Fans and
front-office types are forgetting that providing entertainment and
building competitive teams for the long term are just as important
as winning one Super Bowl. The Patriots played some of the most
entertaining games in the league this season, but that seemed to be
forgotten when they lost in the wild-card game _ without their
starting quarterback, their best receiver, and other key players.
And because of that, people actually called for the coach's head.
Amazing . . . Former Patriots offensive coordinator Larry Kennan
could have had the Hawaii job before Jones came into the picture
but held off. Kennan could land on another NFL staff. Here is his
assessment of the remaining teams. The Vikings: ``Nobody throws the
deep ball better than Randall Cunningham, and I'm not sure that
anyone can cover Randy Moss. They have an explosive offense, an
explosive passing game that can't be rivaled.'' The Jets: ``I'm
amazed that Bill Parcells is still labeled as a guy who likes to
run the ball. He hasn't had a running team in the last eight years.
The Jets have been fun to watch. Because I coached Curtis (Martin),
I root for him. He's benefitted from a very good offensive line. I
think the difference there is Kevin Mawae. I coached Kevin in
Seattle and the Seahwaks made a huge mistake letting him go. He's a
very athletic center and he's very instrumental in the running
game.'' The Falcons: ``Chris Chandler has come a long way. He
throws the deep ball very well and teams have to respect that.''
The Broncos: ``They are the complete football team. They're
ferocious on defense, and Terrell Davis just controls the clock so
well.'' . . . The broken ankle of defensive lineman Brandon
Mitchell has healed, and the Patriots expect him to start at tackle
or end next season, which is one reason they exposed Ferric Collons
in the expansion draft. Mitchell, who lives in Louisiana, is
dealing with the recent death of his grandfather, who raised him .
. . Ty Law and Lawyer Milloy, both of whom may break the bank this
offseason, worked out at Foxborough all week in preparation for the
Pro Bowl Feb. 7 in Honolulu . . . Carroll is expected to choose an
offensive line coach and receivers coach this week. One offensive
line coach who may become available is Kansas City's Mike Solari,
who worked with Carroll in San Francisco . . . Another publicist
entered the world last week: David Samuel James, at 7 pounds 8
ounces and 19 1/2 inches, is the new son of Patriots director of
public relations Stacey James and his wife Beth. A belated
congratulations.

   Notice how quiet, how stable it is these days behind NHL
benches? A week before the All-Star Game, not a single head coach
has been fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said Boston's Pat Burns, now in his 10th year as an
NHL head coach, ``these things go in cycles _ maybe it's football's
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL hasn't gone this long into a season without seeing a
coach dismissed since 1993-94, when Jim Schoenfeld replaced Terry
Murray in Washington (Jan. 27).
</P>
<P>
   ``A great business, isn't it?'' said Lindy Ruff, now in his
second season as Sabres coach. ``Sooner or later, you have to
realize that every year 10 or 11 teams are going to be under .500,
and a couple of teams are going to do very poorly. And it's just
not always the coach's fault. The prime example is New Jersey; one
year they win the Stanley Cup (1995) and the next year they don't
make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The end came voluntarily for Burns in Montreal. After four
years, he wanted a change of venue and switched to Toronto.
Reluctantly, former Leafs GM Cliff Fletcher dumped Burns 65 games
into the 1995-96 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, all of a sudden is Pat Burns not a good coach?'' said
Ruff. ``Is Roger Neilson (now leading the Flyers) not a good
coach?''
</P>
<P>
   The stability this season can be traced in part to all of the
turnover among coaches last year. During the season, Wayne Cashman
was dumped in Philadelphia, ditto for Terry Crisp in Tampa Bay and
Doug MacLean in Florida. Not to forget, either, that Ted Nolan,
Coach of the Year in 1996-97, wasn't brought back in Buffalo. Then
came the offseason purge: Pierre Page in Anaheim, Craig Hartsburg
in Chicago, Marc Crawford in Colorado, Jacques Lemaire (his choice)
in New Jersey, and Mike Murphy in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about a third of the league's coaches were given the
heave-ho.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm sure there'll be someone whacked again,'' said Burns,
``because there always is.''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious candidate is Dirk Graham, the ex-Blackhawk who
is clearly out of his depth behind the Chicago bench. The Hawks
missed the playoffs last season for the first time since 1969,
leading owner Bill Wirtz to can Hartsburg not long after extending
his contract by three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing the best he can with what he has,'' said Chicago
general manager Bob Murray.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't always matter.
</P>

   Word out of Vancouver early last week was that the Canucks
finally were set to deal  &UR; Pavel Bure  &LR; and general manager  &UR; Brian
Burke  &LR; hoped to have it done no later than Thursday. Come Friday
morning, still no white smoke. The place that makes the most sense
for Bure to land: Chicago, in a swap for  &UR; Tony Amonte  &LR; _ which, of
course, would mean the Canucks handing coach  &UR; Mike Keenan  &LR; the pink
slip at the same time, because it was Keenan who greased the skids
for Amonte in New York. Bure could play on a line with  &UR; Alexei
Zhamnov  &LR; _ undoubtedly enhancing Zhamnov's worth _ and Amonte could
bring some real life, along with maybe 40 or 50 goals, to the
moribund Canucks. And what better time for the Hawks to bring in a
legitimate marquee player, with  &UR; Michael Jordan  &LR; gone from the
Bulls? With no deal made, Burke figures he'll now wait until the
March trading deadline, when, he says, ``clubs are desperate.'' ...
Keenan, by the way, has abandoned his trademark forechecking
blueprint and has the Canucks playing a version of Detroit's
left-wing lock. One more team, short on talent, dumbing it down
with defense. ``We're the ones that are desperate,'' said Keenan
when apprised of Burke's remark. ``This team's got to make the
playoffs.'' ... Former Bruin  &UR; Mike Gillis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now Bure's agent,
reports that the Russian Rocket is in Moscow, ``hanging around with
the president of Belarus.'' Last week, according to Gillis, Bure
zipped through five laps at the Russian Red Army rink, timed in 79
seconds. The man holding the stopwatch: legendary coach  &UR; Viktor
Tikhonov &LR;  ... The Lightning officially gave up on ex-Bruin  &UR; Craig
Janney  &LR; last week, which is why he wasn't with the Bolts at the
Fleet last night. He's free to look around and try to make a deal,
but ultimately they could waive him, sending the 31-year-old former
Boston College Eagle to the minors for the first time. Janney: ``My
job is to create big plays and help us win games, and right now I'm
not doing it. I'm to blame for it.'' If someone will take his
salary (what remains of $1.7 million), the Bolts would let Janney
go for nothing ... Belmont Hill's  &UR; Paul Mara  &LR; didn't impress
Lightning brass at the World Junior Championships in Winnipeg. He
still figures to be the future of the Tampa blue line, but that
future could be a couple of years down the road. The seventh pick
overall in the '97 draft, the 19-year-old Mara is now in his third
season of junior hockey ...  &UR; Dave Andrews &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ex- of the IHL and the
Hartford front office, is expected to become top aide to  &UR; Craig
Patrick &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is now the Penguins' president and CEO as well as
general manager. Andrews will help with some of the dicey
bankruptcy issues confronting the team. Word around Pittsburgh is
that co-owner  &UR; Roger Marino &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ex- of Revere High, Northeastern,
and Hopkinton-based EMC, would be happy to find a buyer for his
portion of the troubled franchise, cut his losses, and walk away
from the financial nightmare ... Former Bruin  &UR; Sheldon Kennedy
 &LR; left the Manitoba Moose (IHL) last week and will play the rest of
the season in the German Elite League. True, it's another step back
from the NHL, but remember,  &UR; Brian Bellows  &LR; finished up in Germany
last year, then signed on for a ride to the Cup finals with the
Capitals.

   In case you missed it, goalie-in-exile  &UR; Jim Carey  &LR; has
resurrected his game in Providence and will play in the AHL
All-Star Game next weekend at Philadelphia. Unwanted by the Bruins,
Carey now serves one purpose on the roster _ to be made available
for the expansion drafts this summer (Atlanta) and next (Minnesota
and Columbus) ... Does it make your heart warm to know that  &UR; Claude
Lemieux  &LR; leads all Colorado goal scorers with 17? Renews your sense
of fairness and good sportsmanship, doesn't it? ...  &UR; Grant Fuhr
 &LR; had the league buzzing 10 days ago when he said his playing days
will come to an end when his contract runs out after next season.
``I called him the next day and said, `Grant, did you mean it?'''
said  &UR; Jay Fee &LR; , &UR;  &LR; his Boston-based agent. ``I think it was a case of
his having a few aches and pains, he wasn't playing. Let's just say
he it's not a lead-pipe guarantee that it's over after next year.
He's just the kind of guy who wants to play every single game, and
when that's not happening, he gets frustrated.'' Fuhr's deal pays
$3.1 million this year and $3 million next season. He would be 38
entering the 2000-01 season, and don't be surprised if the Oilers
bring him back for a sunset tour ... Not many tears were shed
around the league when Sharks defenseman  &UR; Bryan  &LR; ``Mush''
 &UR; Marchment  &LR; separated his shoulder 10 days ago _ in a collision
with Nashville's  &UR; Sebastien Bordeleau &LR;  _ and had to go under the
knife (out a minimum of six weeks). Marchment's dirty hits have
kept emergency rooms hopping all over North America for years. It's
a tough loss for  &UR; Darryl Sutter's  &LR; defensive corps, already minus
 &UR; Gary Suter  &LR; (surgery to repair torn triceps) ... Last week, we
told you Devils defenseman  &UR; Scott Stevens  &LR; told the Sharks'  &UR; Brantt
Myhres &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a recovering alcoholic, to ``go have another drink''
during a game at New Jersey. Four days later, after tangling with
him in a fight, Buffalo's  &UR; Paul Kruse  &LR; rotated his wrist in a
drinking gesture _ meant to taunt Myhres _ as he departed for the
penalty box. There must be some interesting times when the Players'
Association calls everyone together for one of those union
brotherhood meetings. A guy tries to face up to his problems and
then his union brothers rub his face in it. Disgraceful ... LA's
 &UR; Luc Robitaille  &LR; recommitted himself to a weightlifting-to-go
program last summer and it has helped renew his scoring touch (24
goals, heading into the weekend). While he drove around the country
in a mobile home with family, he'd pull out his weights at
campsites. ``It was a little embarrassing sometimes, with people
looking at me,'' said Robitaille, who connected for his 500th
career goal a couple of weeks ago. Robitaille's regimen includes
doing situps while holding 75-pound weights.

   The Oilers had some interest in acquiring  &UR; Felix Potvin  &LR; before
the Leafs dished him to Islanders last Saturday for  &UR; Bryan Berard &LR; .
But when Potvin refused to talk about a long-term deal _ his
current pact, paying $2.7 million, runs out this season _ Oiler
boss  &UR; Glen Sather  &LR; stopped talks with Leafs boss  &UR; Mike Smith &LR; . Not
hard to understand, considering the Oilers lost  &UR; Curtis Joseph  &LR; as
an unrestricted free agent to the Leafs last summer. Sather wanted
to tie up Potvin for at least four years, which would have meant
the netminder surrendering his first year of unrestricted free
agency. Smith likely would have wanted either  &UR; Roman Hamrlik  &LR; or
 &UR; Boris Mironov  &LR; off the Oiler roster ... The Leafs are figuring
that Berard, the key to revving their bankrupt power play, can
blossom under the tutelage of ex-defenseman  &UR; Pat Quinn &LR; . They could
be right. Quinn was a tough customer in his playing days, one of
the few who dared to run at  &UR; Bobby Orr &LR;  _ one time kicking No. 4
after he'd fallen in the crease in a game late in the '68-69
season. Ah, but who remembers that kind of thing, right? ... Smith
on the Berard acquisition: ``We didn't hit a home run, but we
wanted an asset.'' The other shoe to fall could be the Leafs
dealing blue liner  &UR; Jason Smith &LR; , &UR;  &LR; once a first-round New Jersey
selection (No. 18 overall), but they'll wait to see how Berard
blends into the mix before making another move. The 6-foot-3-inch
Smith could be interesting under the watch of  &UR; Jacques Laperriere
 &LR; here in Boston ... Now that he's bought into the Washington
Redskins,  &UR; Howard Milstein  &LR; will have to sell his 45 percent
interest in the Islanders _ in keeping with NFL ownership
regulations. His Islander partner,  &UR; Steve Gluckstern &LR; , &UR;  &LR; doesn't
have the dough to go it alone, but one scenario has him finding
limited partners. Another interested party is  &UR; Bob
Gutkowski &LR; , &UR;  &LR; former president of Madison Square Garden. And a third
possibility is former Islander  &UR; Clark Gillies &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now a stockbroker
on the Island, cobbling together a group and possibly taking over
as general manager. The latter move would mean buying out the
remainder of  &UR; Mike Milbury's  &LR; recently-inked five-year deal ... The
Islanders are expected to deal  &UR; Tommy Salo  &LR; now that Potvin is
their No. 1. Tampa has poked around on a deal, hoping to stop the
hemorrhaging in net that neither  &UR; Bill Ranford  &LR; nor  &UR; Corey Schwab
 &LR; can stem.  &UR; Daren Puppa &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 34 in April, remains out of the Tampa
lineup with a chronic groin injury ... Don't be surprised to see
the Blues unload the Bay State's  &UR; Jim Campbell  &LR; before the trade
deadline. Back in '91, when the Bruins made  &UR; Glen Murray  &LR; their
first-round pick, then-Boston scout  &UR; Joe Lyons  &LR; made a big pitch to
pick Campbell, who was chosen in the second round by Montreal.
Campbell has done next to nothing in his third year with the Blues,
after back-to-back 20-goal seasons ... Murray, by the way, will be
down for a few weeks after tearing up a knee while racing back on a
touch-up icing call a couple of weeks ago. When he exited, he was
LA's top performer (28 points/37 games), playing with the zip and
nastiness that the Bruins saw in him as a junior. Murray avoided
surgery, but by the time he gets back, the Kings' season could be
finished. Last week, he overexerted the knee in the weight room.
``He's an impatient patient,'' said Kings coach  &UR; Larry Robinson &LR; .

Rheaume's agent,  &UR; Steve Bartlett &LR; , &UR;  &LR; says she hasn't given up the
thought of trying to play net for Canada in the 2002 Olympic Games
at Salt Lake City. Meanwhile, some endorsement deals still come her
way. ``Not in the numbers she saw before,'' reported Bartlett, from
his office near Rochester, N.Y. ``But she's beginning to hear from
manufacturers who might be interested in some crossover

Sorry to see the passing of  &UR; Doug Wickenheiser &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who died of lung

 &UR; Denis Savard  &LR; (No. 3 to Chicago). A malignant cyst was removed
from Wickenheiser's left wrist in '94, and he was believed to be in
remission until a tumor was found in his right lung in '97.  &UR; Guy
Carbonneau &LR; , who &UR;  &LR; was in Montreal with Wickenheiser at the start of
the '80s, said, ``He was always happy. He never brought his misery
to his work.'' ...  &UR; Cam Neely  &LR; played in a celebrity game last
weekend at Madison Square Garden, a fund-raiser for paralyzed actor
 &UR; Christopher Reeve &LR;  that brought in about $100,000. Some of the
Rangers' wives participated, and _ we are not making this up _  &UR; Ulf
Samuelsson's  &LR; wife requested to play on Neely's team ... Edmonton's

lineup early next month. Limbering up on skates just after
Christmas, he lost his two front teeth when fitness expert  &UR; Daryl

   WASHINGTON _ In 1989, the Senate removed Judge Walter L. Nixon
Jr. of Mississippi from the bench for lying before a federal grand
jury. ``A single, discreet false statement,'' Sen &UR; . &LR;  Herb Kohl,
D-Wis., called it. But it was enough for the Senate to convict him,
89-8.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the Senate removed Judge Alcee L. Hastings of
Florida from office. A Miami jury had acquitted him of bribery
charges, but the Senate convicted him of lying when he testified in
his own defense at his trial. The Senate found him guilty of eight
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the House managers cited both impeachment trials, the
most recent to be held by the Senate, as they challenged the
senators to hold President Clinton to the same standards when they
judged him. The prosecutors implored the Senate to be guided by its
most recent precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate should not establish a lower standard for integrity
for the president than the standard it has already established for
federal judges,'' Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' message was clearly intended for the Democrats
who voted a decade ago to remove both judges. They include Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts, John B. Breaux
of Louisiana, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   But two Republicans voted to acquit Nixon: Connie Mack of
Florida and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are striking similarities between the articles of
impeachment against the judges and those against the president,
there are also some differences, which the president's lawyers plan
to highlight in their opening argument next week.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against the judges involved lying about acts related
to their official duties. The presidents' lawyers argue that the
lies Clinton is accused of telling about his affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky involved a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team also argues that the Senate should
apply a more rigid standard when it considers removing a popularly
elected president. A section of the Constitution says federal
judges ``shall hold their offices during good behavior.'' There is
no similar language about presidents.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in Congress, Gerald R. Ford noted the distinction in
a 1970 debate over an effort to impeach Associate Justice William
O. Douglas. He said there was a clear difference between judges,
who enjoy life tenure and are accountable for their misdeeds only
by impeachment, and presidents, who can be removed by the
electorate. The removal of a president in midterm ``would indeed
require crimes of the magnitude of treason and bribery,'' Ford
said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was removed from office, Nixon was in prison, serving a
five-year term. He had been convicted of lying to a grand jury when
he denied that he had influenced a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy oil man, Wiley Fairchild, had asked Nixon to intervene
in a drug case against Fairchild's son. Nixon persuaded the
prosecutor, an old friend, to dismiss the charges. In an interview
with federal agents, Nixon denied that he had had any involvement.
And he repeated those denials before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   After the conviction on two counts of perjury, the House passed
three articles of impeachment, charging the judge with making false
and misleading statements to the grand jury and to federal agents.
The vote was 417 to 0. And in 1989, the Senate convicted Nixon of
perjury on two articles.
</P>
<P>
   When Judge Hastings was impeached and convicted, he had already
been acquitted by a jury in Miami of bribery charges. But the House
voted 413 to 3 to impeach him in 1988, approving 17 articles of
impeachment. Fourteen of them accused Judge Hastings of lying under
oath at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, 62, returned to the public stage, winning a Florida
seat in the House of Representatives. A Democrat, he voted last
month against impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also invoked the case of a Nevada federal judge,
Harry E. Claiborne, who was convicted of three articles of
impeachment and removed by the Senate in 1986 for filing false
income tax returns. Like Clinton's lawyers, the lawyers for
Claiborne argued that his actions had nothing to do with his public
duties and should not cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying, `Cheating on your taxes has nothing to do
with being a judge,' '' Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of
the House managers, said Saturday. ``Do you know what the Senate
said? `It has everything to do with being a judge.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Clinton's lawyers plan to argue that his grand jury
testimony about the details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
had nothing to do with his job as president.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For two days House Republican prosecutors played
the short game, trying to win the right to call witnesses. Saturday
they turned to their ultimate challenge: to convince senators,
particularly Democrats, that President Clinton's misdeeds are grave
enough to warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   For on this Saturday, the third and final day of their opening
arguments, the House managers tackled the most fundamental question
underlying the nation's second presidential impeachment trial. Do
Clinton's efforts to cover up his relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky amount to the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' the
nation's founders had in mind for removal of an elected president?
</P>
<P>
   Some of their appeals stood on law and precedent and
interpretation of the Constitution, such as Rep. Charles B.
Canady's assertion that ``a president who commits a calculated and
sustained series of criminal offenses has _ by his personal
violations of the law _ failed in the most direct, immediate and
culpable manner to do his duty under the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Other managers played more to emotion than to law. Rep. Henry J.
Hyde wrapped up the three days by reading a letter from a schoolboy
asking ``if you cannot believe the president, who can you
believe?'' as well as appealing grandiloquently for Clinton to be
removed from office to keep faith with those who died on the
beaches of Normandy and in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   What is critical is how Democrats react to these arguments. For
with the Senate composed of 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats, the
House prosecutors are thought to have only a very slight chance of
gaining the 67 votes necessary to secure the president's
conviction. To do so, they must pull over at least 12 Democrats and
most likely even more, since the Republicans will probably not vote
as a solid bloc.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats in particular, while acknowledging that Clinton
lied in several legal proceedings and should be censured, have long
expressed doubts over whether such actions to cover up an
extra-marital affair amount to rise to the constitutional level to
remove a twice-elected president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad behavior,'' Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., said
Saturday, even after listening to the House managers. ``But the
standard for removing a president is not bad behavior. It is high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no fixed definition of what constitutes a high crime
and misdemeanor. And throughout the five months that Congress has
been grappling with impeachment, the White House has staked much of
its defense of the president on the grounds that his offenses do
not amount to an abuse of power that warrants his removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   As the president's lawyers wrote in a pretrial brief,
``impeachment was never intended to be a remedy for private wrongs.
It was intended to be a method of removing a president whose
continued presence in the office would cause grave danger to the
nation and our constitutional system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has also pointed to a letter circulated by 400
historians and legal scholars _ prominent among them Arthur
Schlesinger Jr. _ saying that removal of Clinton because of the
case before Congress would ``mangle the system of checks and
balances that is our chief safeguard against abuses of power.''
</P>
<P>
   So Saturday, two of the House managers, Canady and Rep. Steve
Buyer of Indiana, sought to undermine the credibility of
Schlesinger, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author who was an aide to
John F. Kennedy, by using some of his own writings against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting a passage from ``The Imperial Presidency,''
Schlesinger's study of the growth of presidential power, Buyer
read, ``The continuation of a lawbreaker as chief magistrate would
be a strange way to exemplify law and order at home or to
demonstrate American probity before the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey O. Graham made an appeal to emotion. As a child of
the segregated south, he extolled the civil rights laws that Paula
Jones ultimately used to sue Clinton for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a high crime?'' the folksy South Carolina Republican
asked, before making a populist appeal on behalf of Ms. Jones'
right to sue and get truthful answers from Clinton. ``How about if
an important person hurts somebody of low means? It's not very
scholarly, but I think it's the truth. I think that's what they
mean by high crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Canady to be the scholarly one. He reminded
senators they have impeached and removed federal judges for
perjury. ``The Senate should not establish a lower standard of
integrity for the president,'' he argued. He also took on Clinton's
defense that he has not committed the same kind of abuses that
Richard M. Nixon did during the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no principled basis for contending that a president
who interferes with the proper exercise of governmental power _ as
he clearly does when he commits perjury and obstruction of justice
_ is constitutionally less blameworthy than a president who misuses
the power of his office,'' Canady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president who lies to a federal grand jury in order to
impede the investigation of crimes is no less culpable than a
president who wrongfully orders a prosecutor to suspend an
investigation of crimes that have been committed,'' he said in
reference to the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' in 1973, when Nixon
ordered his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, to fire special
prosecutor Archibald Cox. Richardson resigned instead.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a long time before the Senate holds votes that will
show how much headway the prosecutors made Saturday in persuading
the necessary number of Democrats that Clinton's offenses rise to
the level of high crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But there were some clues. Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.,
said Saturday he had not been convinced. Nor was Sen. Charles E.
Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Graham, D-Fla., said: ``They made a good case for that.
The presentations the House managers have made have caused you to
do exactly what this process is supposed to: maintain an open
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said, ``I think that's an uphill
climb still, but I think they pushed perhaps some in the Senate or
some in the country a little further up that hill than was the case
yesterday.''

   WASHINGTON _ With the House managers' opening statements now
behind them, senators from the two parties spilled out of the
chamber Saturday afternoon with sharply divided opinions about the
strength of the prosecutors' case and where the trial should go
from here.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most blatant signs of the widening partisan gulf came
this weekend, when Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, suggested
to Democrats that a bipartisan group deal with the question of
witnesses. But the Democratic leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, quickly rebuffed him and called the idea premature.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by several Senate Republicans who are concerned about
the near party-line split over witnesses, Lott of Mississippi sent
a letter to Daschle on Friday evening, in the hope of reviving a
bipartisan discussion group. Lott has argued that the Senate should
begin talking about which witnesses it may want to call and how
they should be questioned before the Senate vote on the matter
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote this month on whether to take
depositions from witnesses, once the White House completes its
presentation and senators query both sides. If 51 senators choose
to move forward with the depositions, votes would be taken at some
point on which witnesses to summon before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe that a bipartisan group of senators could
anticipate and help resolve in advance any complications that may
be presented by our hearing the testimony of witnesses,'' Lott
wrote. ``Forming a bipartisan group to consider witness issues now
may save us time and trouble in the days ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daschle, who does not want to make it easier for Republicans
to win a vote on witnesses, turned Lott down. . Daschle responded
that discussions about witnesses should wait until the full Senate
vote on depositions. Daschle added that preliminary talks ``would
violate the bipartisan agreement that now governs our process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope that such arrangements will ultimately prove
unnecessary,'' Daschle wrote, ``regarding the many complicated
issues that will result if the Senate votes to call witnesses in
the impeachment proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon, after the House managers concluded their
presentation, the division in the Senate between the two parties
became increasingly obvious: Many Republicans, while stressing that
they are keeping an open mind, spoke highly of the House's case
against President Clinton. Many Democrats said outright that
Clinton's behavior, as described by the managers, does not merit
conviction and removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House has made a prima facie case of great power,'' said
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, who chairs the Judiciary Committee.
``I don't think anybody doubts that. I've heard some of the
president's attorneys say that, `you've done a really good job' to
the House members. They've presented a great case of great power.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the opposite view, Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said
that House managers ``did not tie these details to high crimes and
misdemeanors. The two questions were like ships passing in the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gregory Craig, special counsel to Clinton, said the House
prosecutors failed to meet their constitutional burden. ``The House
Republicans' case ends as it began, an unsubstantiated,
circumstantial case that does not meet the constitutional standard
to remove the president from office.''
</P>
<P>
   There were exceptions to the predictable assessments offered by
each side, however. Sen. James M. Jeffords, a Republican moderate
from Vermont, questioned whether the Senate may wind up setting the
conviction bar too low.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say lying about a noncrime can be converted into a high
crime by the way you handle it, that sets a pretty low standard,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, once again, it is the sticking point of witnesses that best
illustrated the party divide.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's exchange of letters was only the latest partisan volley
in the debate over the trial's second phase: whether the Senate
needs to hear from Monica S. Lewinsky, Betty Currie, Clinton's
secretary, and Vernon E. Jordan Jr., his friend, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In a war of words that is beginning to echo the verbal crossfire
in the House, some Democrats said they are growing increasingly
convinced that Senate Republicans want to call witnesses simply to
embarrass Clinton and draw out the trial. Republicans countered
that they must take seriously their mandate as jurors and judges,
and that means trying to clarify the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Now each side is pointing a finger at the other for the
breakdown in partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed because it just suggests it's almost
like someone wants to pick a fight and have a tempest, instead of
getting on with the major issue,'' said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said the witness issue is ``becoming
politically charged.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is divided up, and there are a lot of people in the
country who want the president removed from office, who didn't want
the president to be in office to begin with, who are saying we
ought to call witnesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Daschle expressed anger and surprise when he
learned that three Republicans had met secretly with House
prosecutors to discuss witnesses. Republicans invited Democrats to
attend the second meeting, but Daschle declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the Senate took its bipartisan vote on Jan. 8, and
decided to postpone some votes on witnesses until later this month,
Lott had announced that a bipartisan group would look at the issue
during the beginning of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the group never materialized, and instead Lott appointed
three Republican senators to meet with House managers on the
question, sensing that negotiating a narrow list of witnesses would
help persuade senators to vote to consider some testimony.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican prosecutors have argued forcefully and
repeatedly during their presentations this week that the Senate
must hear from witnesses in order to deliver an informed verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Just Saturday, Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., who chairs the House
Judiciary Committee, said bluntly that getting witnesses to appear
before the Senate is ``our purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We try,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Hyde said chances were ``50-50'' that House
managers would ask the Senate to invite Clinton to testify, adding
that the decision would be put off until next week.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' strategy has worked, for now. Many Republicans,
even those who were disinclined to hear from witnesses last week,
have said that prosecutors persuaded them to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sen. Richard G. Lugar, a moderate Republican from
Indiana, announced he would support calling relevant witnesses and
would vote against a ``motion to end the trial prematurely.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, a Republican leader from Florida, said ``there
are more and more people who believe we will end up with
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, also a Republican leader,
put pressure on the White House on Saturday by raising the
possibility that if Clinton were to acknowledge some of the
allegations presented by House prosecutors, the Senate may not have
to summon witnesses at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made a rather strong case on that point,'' McConnell
said referring to the House push for witnesses. ``Maybe the
president will stipulate to the facts and it won't be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House is not likely to bend on the question of
stipulations. ``We already have stipulated to the record,'' White
House spokesman James Kennedy said. ``And, as we will demonstrate
next week, the House managers have ignored and misstated many of
the relevant facts contained in that record.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats remain opposed to witnesses and argued that the
time for preliminary meetings has passed. The next critical moment,
they say, will come when the Senate decides whether to dismiss the
case, a vote that is anticipated on Jan. 25. The vote requires a
simple majority, and will likely fail, but Democrats are painting
it as a decisive predictor of the trial's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is clear that significantly more than 34 senators
support dismissing the case, then the dynamics are altered,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., ``because then it becomes a
question of what value these witnesses would provide if more than
one-third of the Senate believes the case should be dismissed.''

HOUSE MANAGERS WRAP UP ARGUMENTS, CALL FOR CLINTON'S REMOVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Invoking a panaroma of the American experience
ranging from the revolution to the enduring struggle for civil
rights, House managers Saturday cast President Clinton as a threat
to the nation's ``sacred honor,'' in the last act of their
three-day plea for the Senate to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The drama unfolded amid an escalating dispute over the merits of
prolonging the trial by summoning witnesses and inviting Clinton to
explain why he should not suffer the infamy of being the first
president convicted of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a rapt Senate, the lead manager, House Judiciary
Committee chairman Henry J. Hyde, argued that equal justice demands
Clinton's ouster for allegedly violating the law by committing
perjury and obstructing justice to cover up his sexual affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot tolerate one law for the ruler, and another for the
ruled,'' Hyde said. ``If we do, we break faith with our ancestors
from Bunker Hill, Lexington, and Concord to . . . Saigon and Desert
Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's summation cleared the way for Clinton's lawyers to launch
a three-day rebuttal to the House case, beginning Tuesday at 1 p.m.
_ the same day Clinton will deliver his State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple truth is that the House Republican prosecutors
failed to demonstrate that the will and interests of the American
people would be served by nullifying the results of a national
election,'' said Gregory B. Craig, White House special counsel.
``We will present a strong, vigorous defense based on the facts,
the law, and the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican-controlled Senate nearly split along party
lines on whether to call witnesses, the White House faces an uphill
struggle to reverse the momentum and persuade senators to dismiss
the charges without permitting witnesses in this historic trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword,'' Senator John F. Kerry said of the
challenge confronting Clinton's lawyers. ``It's entirely possible
that their presentation can itself beg for further elucidation'' by
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bipartisan blueprint for the trial, votes on whether to
dismiss the charges and call witnesses are scheduled for Jan. 25,
after the Senate has spent two days questioning the House managers
and Clinton's lawyers about their competing presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the growing divide, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott
of Mississippi, Saturday released a letter he sent Friday night to
the Democratic leader, Senator Thomas A. Daschle, asking to create
a bipartisan coalition ``to resolve in advance any complications
that may be presented by our hearing the testimony of witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, who lashed out at Senate Republicans last week for
holding private meetings with House managers over potential
witnesses, acknowledged in a written reply to Lott that the witness
controversy ``poses a number of troubling considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daschle said the blueprint for the trial required the Senate
to defer action on witnesses until next week. He added: ``It is my
hope that such arrangements will ultimately prove unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Senate's GOP majority indicated Daschle's hope is
unlikely to be fulfilled. ``I think there is a presumption there
will be witnesses,'' said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the
Republican chief deputy whip.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican, added, ``It's almost
reached a point of inevitability.''
</P>
<P>
   But a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, is required to remove a
president, and most senators believe Clinton ultimately will be
acquitted, barring a dramatic turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the current record, they are not going to win this
trial,'' said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat,
of the House managers. ``They need somebody to come before the
Senate and give unexpected testimony or to commit a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, who continue to investigate allegations
against Clinton and interview prospective witnesses, have said they
want to compel testimony from Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon E.
Jordan Jr., and several White House aides, including his personal
secretary, Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Although several managers have called for Clinton to appear, the
House team has yet to decide whether to request his testimony. They
also remain undecided over seeking other witnesses, including
Kathleen E. Willey, a former White House volunteer who accused
Clinton of groping her near the Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Completing a 15-hour, three-day presentation, Hyde and three
other House managers tried to make the case that Clinton's alleged
offenses warranted his removal from office. Their speeches ranged
in tone from Hyde's solemn eloquence to the stirring, folksy
delivery of Representative Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, declaring himself ``a child of the South'' like Clinton,
praised the president for his promoting civil rights. But he
excoriated Clinton for allegedly failing to practice the principles
he espouses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton allegedly launched an elaborate scheme to obtruct
justice to thwart a sexual-harassment lawsuit that Paula Corbin
Jones, a former Arkansas state worker, filed against him and
settled last year for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Clinton's support for equal rights, Graham said, ``I'm
here to tell you that when it was his case, when those rights had
to be applied to him, he failed miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Clinton's alleged assault on Jones's quest for
justice warranted his removal from office. ``What's a high crime?''
he said. ``How about when an important person hurts a person of low
means?''
</P>
<P>
   If a final vote is cast on the articles of impeachment, Graham
said, ``The vice president will be waiting outside the doors of
this chamber. If that vice president is asked to come in to assume
the mantle of chief executive officer of the land, it will be
tough, it will be painful, but we will survive and we will be
better for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde concluded the House case by reading a letter about lying
from a Chicago third-grader, William Preston Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe the president tells the truth anymore right
now,'' Sanders wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats, who generally called the speeches by Graham
and Hyde highly effective, urged the White House to exploit what
they described as a serious flaw in the House case: the reliance on
evidence stemming from the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The House last month rejected an article of impeachment charging
Clinton with lying under oath in the Jones case. ``They built their
case on the thin reed of the Paula Jones case, which was dismissed
by the House,'' said Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. ``That has to be
reemphasized and hammered home again.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers said the impeachment charges directly relate
to the Jones case. They said Clinton allegedly lied before a
federal grand jury about his deposition in the Jones case and
committed several elements of the obstruction charge to stymie the
Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Senate Republicans said the House presentation
supported the charges. ``The managers made an overwhelming case
that these facts are important and that perjury and obstruction of
justice, if proven, are impeachable offenses,'' said Senator Orrin
G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few Republicans who continued to voice skepticism was
Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont. Although Jeffords has
indicated he will support GOP leaders in conducting a thorough
trial, which might include witnesses, he said he remains wary of
removing Clinton over charges stemming from a sexual affair. ``If
you say lying about a non-crime can be converted into a high crime
by the way you handle it, that sets a pretty low standard for me,''
Jeffords said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said the House managers, despite
``some pretty good rhetoric,'' presented ``a thin argument'' to
support the charges. He argued that they did not adequately rebut
hundreds of constitutional scholars who have said the charges fall
short of the standard for impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure to cite thoughtful authority on this, I thought,
was a missing link,'' Kennedy said.

MAKING THE CASE FOR WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the end, it seems clear that the House managers
weren't really trying to nail down 67 votes in just three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been a very high mountain to climb,'' said
David Steward, a defense attorney who represented US District Judge
Walter L. Nixon Jr. during his impeachment trial in 1989. ``So they
chose to take a different route . . . that lets them present their
case the best they can.''
</P>
<P>
   That route all but guarantees that President Clinton's
impeachment trial could continue for many more weeks, if not
months. The way the GOP prosecutors structured their case made it
evident their overriding _ and perhaps singular _ goal was to pave
the way for the calling of witnesses, several lawyers and legal
scholars said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And most of those interviewed said the Republicans did an
effective job attaining that objective.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' three-day presentation, which ended Saturday,
cannot be described as stunning or as having filled the Senate
chamber with soaring rhetoric. But the analysts said that by
weaving a solid story line with threads of persuasive evidence, the
House managers almost certainly convinced enough Republicans, and
perhaps some Democrats, that the truth cannot be evaluated without
live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds majority in the Senate is required to convict
Clinton and make him the first president to be removed from office.
But only 51 votes are needed to approve the calling of witnesses _
and that's the target most observers believe the House managers
were aiming for from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they recognized the evidence they had wasn't enough to
get 67 votes or to change public opinion,'' said Colin Diver, dean
of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. ``So it's pretty
apparent that the strategy was to take a legalistic referral from
the special prosecutor and reshape it into a compelling saga that
would convince enough senators to get to the next stage. . . . and
I think they've done a pretty good job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as each day of the prosecution's presentation passed,
more moderate Republicans publicly stated they were persuaded to
call witnesses. Minds could change after Clinton's lawyers offer
their defense beginning on Tuesday, but senators in both parties
believe at least 51 of the 55 Republicans would now vote to hear
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The divide over calling witnesses reveals how starkly partisan
the sentiment about Clinton's impeachment remains, notwithstanding
senators' efforts to appear above party considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in and out of Congress agree that a majority, if not
all, of the Republicans at the end of the month will approve the
calling of witnesses, regardless of what the president's lawyers
say in their three days of defense. Conversely, all or most
Democrats are expected to cast their ballots against live
testimony, irrespective of the strength of any arguments the House
managers might have made.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: Without a damaging surprise from Monica S.
Lewinsky or another key witness, the effort to oust Clinton from
office seems sure to fail.
</P>
<P>
   So, even though many Democrats think witnesses could offer
testimony favorable to the president, they share the White House
view that calling them is not worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican prosecutors, meanwhile, want to call witnesses
and take their chances with unpredictable testimony because they're
unlikely to hit their mark of 67 senators without some new
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you're going to get is an entirely partisan vote
here,'' said Robert Dallek, a history professor and presidential
scholar at Boston University, about the effort to call witnesses.
He said the GOP strategy probably wouldn't succeed in removing
Clinton, but added: ``Everything else they have, no matter how well
presented, is so repetitious . . . so what else can they do?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Flaherty, a professor at Fordham University Law School,
said he had gleaned a three-part agenda from the House managers'
case.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ``essential and most important'' priority was
winning enough support to move the trial into a witness phase,
while ``a nominal item'' was to present their evidence as strongly
as possible on the chance they might persuade two-thirds of the
Senate. The problem with simultaneously pursuing those two goals,
Flaherty said, is that they conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go up and formally argue that there's enough here to
convict and then assert that you need more evidence through
witnesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican objective, according to Flaherty and the
other analysts interviewed, was to win voters to their side. On
that count, they agreed that the House prosecutors probably failed
_ and therefore would need compelling testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this has been a predicate for the larger goal of swaying
public opinion,'' said Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that would be difficult because most Americans
believe they know all they want to about the Clinton drama and have
already formed strong opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Dallek made the same point, saying the GOP task will be
particularly tough because ``most people aren't even watching.''

IN THE SENATE, REALIZING THE GRAVITY OF TASK

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ When the final charges were fully heaped upon
President Clinton as a man of ``subversive and dangerous conduct''
who must not ``remain in office with all his infamy,'' the Senate
seemed a stunned court gravely taken with its task of judgment.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment of absolute silence as the chief House
prosecutor, Rep. Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, announced that he was
done. Senators stared from their chairs, as if realizing the task
before them was indeed momentous, not to be avoided and far from
over.
</P>
<P>
   Some lingered in the chamber, simply absorbing the day. Others
went out to the waiting reporters, with little new to say but their
moods deadly serious as they still faced crucial parts of the trial
extending into February.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to compare this to,'' said Sen. George V.
Voinovich, R-Ohio, a freshman heading out from a relentless three
days of denunciation of the president. ``After all is said and
done, each individual in that body will reach inside themselves and
try and make the right decision. I have faith that the higher
instincts in each of us will prevail rather than fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seemed to have an undertone of grimness as they now
have to await the president's rebuttal to the Republicans'
punishing impeachment charges. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, openly
impatient to get beyond the trial to the agenda issues of his
constituents, spotted a Democratic colleague, Rep. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts, by a Senate doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see Barbara Mikulski's quote where she said she had a
dream last night?'' the senator asked his friend, referring to the
Democratic senator from Maryland. ``She dreamt that she was living
in the Colonial era,'' the senator said, grinning and moving on
through the Senate as if through the Twilight Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, one of the president's stalwarts in the House in arguing
against approval of the impeachment resolution, said he was spent
on the subject and was visiting a Senate office on an unrelated
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave at the office,'' he said sardonically. To Kerrey, he
offered a heartfelt, ``Better you than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most emphatic stipulation in Hyde's summary of the
case was his insistence that the impeachment charges brought by the
Republican-controlled House were not the work of
``Clinton-haters.'' ``This is a question of what we love,'' he
declared, citing the rule of law in a patriotism-steeped peroration
that ranged from Bunker Hill to Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting nearby to Hyde's left, David E. Kendall, the president's
personal counsel, listened quite intently and politely. He smiled
briefly, almost wistfully, when Hyde read a third-grader's
recommended punishment for the president: ``He should write a
100-word essay by hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Far less did Kendall smile at two of the day's main prosecutors,
Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina and Charles T. Canady of
Florida, who mixed Southern folksiness and lengthy scholarship,
respectively, in excoriating the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chose to cheat in in every manner you can cheat in a
lawsuit,'' Graham laconically told the senators, straying from the
lectern a bit like a lawyer trying to relax his jury.
</P>
<P>
   Canady packed his address with legal citations ranging from the
British Parliament to Alexander Hamilton in arguing for banishing
Clinton from office. ``His harmful example as president must not
stand,'' he said, anticipating a range of defense
counter-arguments, even Clinton's resilient standing in public
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The president's misdeeds ``pose a far greater danger to the
well-being of our government'' precisely because of his popularity,
Canady contended, saluting senators of 131 years ago for having the
courage to defend the unpopular President Andrew Johnson in his
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   A third prosecutor, Stephen E. Buyer of Indiana, even skewered
the president for his now famous testimony about the multiple
meanings of ``is.'' ``He murdered the plain-spoken English
language,'' Buyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery audience seemed no less engrossed than the Senate
court as they looked down upon the scene of an American president
being so thoroughly denounced before the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into the Senate chamber and seeing this process at this
moment in history is awe-inspiring,'' said Ethan Gluck, an
architect, who brought his young son, Adam, to the trial,
explaining it as a once-in-a-life-time event but one far from
complete with the president's defenders only beginning their
arguments next week.
</P>
<P>
   Senators departed with much the same cautionary notion in mind,
that the court and the nation were still far from the final verdict
tally. ``My household is 2-to-2,''James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said in
gently making this point as he left the Senate after three long
days of listening.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords and his colleagues gratefully streamed out for a
weekend break, facing another week of impeachment argumentation
that will be relieved only by the president himself on Tuesday
night when his State of the Union address follows upon his lawyers'
opening argument that he should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone has said, we'll just have to compartmentalize,''
said Voinovich, heading off from the impeachment courtroom.

HOUSE MANAGERS WRAP UP ARGUMENTS, CALL FOR CLINTON'S REMOVAL 
</HEADLINE>
 - 1ST-LEDE-WRITETHROUGH  
 (EDS: Corrects spelling of panorama in first paragraph)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Invoking a panorama of the American experience
ranging from the revolution to the enduring struggle for civil
rights, House managers Saturday cast President Clinton as a threat
to the nation's ``sacred honor,'' in the last act of their
three-day plea for the Senate to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The drama unfolded amid an escalating dispute over the merits of
prolonging the trial by summoning witnesses and inviting Clinton to
explain why he should not suffer the infamy of being the first
president convicted of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a rapt Senate, the lead manager, House Judiciary
Committee chairman Henry J. Hyde, argued that equal justice demands
Clinton's ouster for allegedly violating the law by committing
perjury and obstructing justice to cover up his sexual affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot tolerate one law for the ruler, and another for the
ruled,'' Hyde said. ``If we do, we break faith with our ancestors
from Bunker Hill, Lexington, and Concord to . . . Saigon and Desert
Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's summation cleared the way for Clinton's lawyers to launch
a three-day rebuttal to the House case, beginning Tuesday at 1 p.m.
_ the same day Clinton will deliver his State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple truth is that the House Republican prosecutors
failed to demonstrate that the will and interests of the American
people would be served by nullifying the results of a national
election,'' said Gregory B. Craig, White House special counsel.
``We will present a strong, vigorous defense based on the facts,
the law, and the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican-controlled Senate nearly split along party
lines on whether to call witnesses, the White House faces an uphill
struggle to reverse the momentum and persuade senators to dismiss
the charges without permitting witnesses in this historic trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword,'' Senator John F. Kerry said of the
challenge confronting Clinton's lawyers. ``It's entirely possible
that their presentation can itself beg for further elucidation'' by
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bipartisan blueprint for the trial, votes on whether to
dismiss the charges and call witnesses are scheduled for Jan. 25,
after the Senate has spent two days questioning the House managers
and Clinton's lawyers about their competing presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the growing divide, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott
of Mississippi, Saturday released a letter he sent Friday night to
the Democratic leader, Senator Thomas A. Daschle, asking to create
a bipartisan coalition ``to resolve in advance any complications
that may be presented by our hearing the testimony of witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, who lashed out at Senate Republicans last week for
holding private meetings with House managers over potential
witnesses, acknowledged in a written reply to Lott that the witness
controversy ``poses a number of troubling considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daschle said the blueprint for the trial required the Senate
to defer action on witnesses until next week. He added: ``It is my
hope that such arrangements will ultimately prove unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Senate's GOP majority indicated Daschle's hope is
unlikely to be fulfilled. ``I think there is a presumption there
will be witnesses,'' said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the
Republican chief deputy whip.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican, added, ``It's almost
reached a point of inevitability.''
</P>
<P>
   But a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, is required to remove a
president, and most senators believe Clinton ultimately will be
acquitted, barring a dramatic turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the current record, they are not going to win this
trial,'' said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat,
of the House managers. ``They need somebody to come before the
Senate and give unexpected testimony or to commit a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, who continue to investigate allegations
against Clinton and interview prospective witnesses, have said they
want to compel testimony from Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon E.
Jordan Jr., and several White House aides, including his personal
secretary, Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Although several managers have called for Clinton to appear, the
House team has yet to decide whether to request his testimony. They
also remain undecided over seeking other witnesses, including
Kathleen E. Willey, a former White House volunteer who accused
Clinton of groping her near the Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Completing a 15-hour, three-day presentation, Hyde and three
other House managers tried to make the case that Clinton's alleged
offenses warranted his removal from office. Their speeches ranged
in tone from Hyde's solemn eloquence to the stirring, folksy
delivery of Representative Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, declaring himself ``a child of the South'' like Clinton,
praised the president for his promoting civil rights. But he
excoriated Clinton for allegedly failing to practice the principles
he espouses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton allegedly launched an elaborate scheme to obtruct
justice to thwart a sexual-harassment lawsuit that Paula Corbin
Jones, a former Arkansas state worker, filed against him and
settled last year for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Clinton's support for equal rights, Graham said, ``I'm
here to tell you that when it was his case, when those rights had
to be applied to him, he failed miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Clinton's alleged assault on Jones's quest for
justice warranted his removal from office. ``What's a high crime?''
he said. ``How about when an important person hurts a person of low
means?''
</P>
<P>
   If a final vote is cast on the articles of impeachment, Graham
said, ``The vice president will be waiting outside the doors of
this chamber. If that vice president is asked to come in to assume
the mantle of chief executive officer of the land, it will be
tough, it will be painful, but we will survive and we will be
better for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde concluded the House case by reading a letter about lying
from a Chicago third-grader, William Preston Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe the president tells the truth anymore right
now,'' Sanders wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats, who generally called the speeches by Graham
and Hyde highly effective, urged the White House to exploit what
they described as a serious flaw in the House case: the reliance on
evidence stemming from the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The House last month rejected an article of impeachment charging
Clinton with lying under oath in the Jones case. ``They built their
case on the thin reed of the Paula Jones case, which was dismissed
by the House,'' said Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. ``That has to be
reemphasized and hammered home again.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers said the impeachment charges directly relate
to the Jones case. They said Clinton allegedly lied before a
federal grand jury about his deposition in the Jones case and
committed several elements of the obstruction charge to stymie the
Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Senate Republicans said the House presentation
supported the charges. ``The managers made an overwhelming case
that these facts are important and that perjury and obstruction of
justice, if proven, are impeachable offenses,'' said Senator Orrin
G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few Republicans who continued to voice skepticism was
Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont. Although Jeffords has
indicated he will support GOP leaders in conducting a thorough
trial, which might include witnesses, he said he remains wary of
removing Clinton over charges stemming from a sexual affair. ``If
you say lying about a non-crime can be converted into a high crime
by the way you handle it, that sets a pretty low standard for me,''
Jeffords said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said the House managers, despite
``some pretty good rhetoric,'' presented ``a thin argument'' to
support the charges. He argued that they did not adequately rebut
hundreds of constitutional scholars who have said the charges fall
short of the standard for impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure to cite thoughtful authority on this, I thought,
was a missing link,'' Kennedy said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Summarizing the Republican case against President
Clinton in a speech evoking the shades of heroes past, Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., said Saturday afternoon that the presidency could be
``permanently damaged'' if the Senate failed to remove Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``My solitary, solitary hope is that a hundred years from today,
people will look back at what we have done and say, `They kept the
faith,''' Hyde, the chief prosecutor, declared in an
emotion-drenched peroration.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over impeachment, Hyde said one last time, was not
about sex but about ``the rule of law'' _ ``one of the great
achievements of our civilization.'' He accused Clinton of fraying
the essential bonds of trust between those who govern the United
States and those who are governed. And he asserted that having ``a
presidential perjurer'' in the White House meant that ``America can
no longer be trusted'' in the world's councils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your judgment should rise above politics, above partisanship,
above polling data,'' Hyde told the Senate. ``This case is a test
of whether what the Founding Fathers described as `sacred honor'
still has meaning in our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., brought the Republican case to a
crescendo Saturday morning with the declaration that the president
must be removed because he had ``made himself a notorious example
of lawlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening the last of three days of the Republican presentation of
the impeachment case against Clinton, Canady, like Clinton a
graduate of Yale Law School, also argued that the Senate could not
set a lower standard for a president than for judges who have been
ousted in recent years for making false statements under oath.
Clinton is accused in one impeachment article of committing perjury
in his testimony to the grand jury investigating his sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, it will be Clinton's turn to make his case through
his lawyers, starting on Tuesday, hours before his State of the
Union Message.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's speech was a stemwinder from another era, a florid
20-minute throwback to the days of perfervid orators like William
Jennings Bryan _ moving to some in the chamber and no doubt outside
it, banal to others. Stocky and silver-haired, sometimes seemingly
on the verge of choking up, Hyde pulled out every stop on the
rhetorical organ, recalling Bunker Hill and Flanders Field and
Normandy, Saigon and Desert Storm, the Ten Commandments and Magna
Carta, Mosaic law and Roman law, the Gettysburg address and the
Spirit of '76.
</P>
<P>
   He complained about what he called ``massive and relentless
efforts to change the subject'' by the president's lawyers, and he
said it was a disservice to the House to suggest, as some Democrats
have, that ``it has brought these articles of impeachment before
you in a frivolous, mean-spirited or irresponsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Hyde read a letter from William Summers, a third-grader
in Room 304 at Chase Elementary School in Chicago, who asked him,
``If you cannot believe the president, who can you believe? If you
have no one to believe in, then how do you run your life?''
</P>
<P>
   Canady and two colleagues on the panel of House managers, Reps.
Steve Buyer, R-Ind., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., sought to
pre-emptively rebut arguments of Clinton's defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Citing British and American authorities in a session that often
turned the Senate chamber into a constitutional history classroom,
they contended that the offenses Clinton is accused of, perjury and
obstruction of justice, met the constitutional standard of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' for impeachment; that missteps in
Clinton's private life had led to crimes in his public capacity;
that the Senate had convicted judges in recent years for analogous
offenses, and that if Clinton was guilty he must not be allowed to
remain in the White House, as Canady put it, ``in all his infamy.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has argued from the start that even if guilty,
nothing Clinton did justified the removal from office of a popular
president, twice endorsed by a national electorate. It was that
argument, which Buyer termed the ``so-what'' argument, that the
three sought to nail today.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer (pronounced BOO-yer) attacked on a number of levels at
once, urging the senators not to give way to any of several double
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In response to those who note that perjury, unlike treason and
bribery, is not enumerated in the Constitution among ``high crimes
and misdemeanors,'' Buyer cited Sir William Blackstone, the great
18th-century English jurist whose book of legal commentaries, James
Madison wrote, was ``in every man's hand'' as the constitutional
draftsmen went about their labors.
</P>
<P>
   Blackstone, Buyer said, included perjury among his list of
public offenses, placing bribery and perjury side by side. From
there, he jumped to the assertion that ``there is no difference''
between ``sitting before a federal judge and perjuring oneself''
and offering that judge a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging widely, Buyer quoted Black's Legal Dictionary, Gen.
Douglas MacArthur, John Adams and, on the seriousness of perjury
and obstruction of justice, former Attorney General Griffin Bell, a
Democrat. Bell, he said, had reached the heart of the matter when
he declared, ``A president cannot faithfully execute the laws if he
himself is breaking them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now at least 115 persons serving sentences for
perjury in federal prisons,'' Buyer said. ``Where is the fairness
to these Americans, if they stay in jail and the president stays in
the Oval Office?''
</P>
<P>
   But Buyer laid special emphasis, of a kind that had not been
heard in the trial before, on the impact of Clinton's alleged
crimes on the armed services and women.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats continued to insist that the whole controversy
stemmed from a private sexual matter, and was therefore beneath
constitutional notice, Buyer demanded, did that mean that the
evidence-gathering process in federal sexual harassment cases, like
the one brought against Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones, which led to
the Lewinsky case, was unimportant?
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of The Citadel, the South Carolina military college,
and a veteran of the Persian Gulf war, Buyer argued that Clinton's
``diminished veracity'' had had an ``inherently corrosive'' effect
on his capacity to function effectively as commander in chief and
to carry out his foreign policy duties.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Buyer said, American military personnel everywhere
``know that, if accused of the same offenses as their commander in
chief, they would no longer be deserving of the privilege of
serving in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, much the folksiest of the 13 managers, was assigned to
explore Senate precedent, and he did so. He dutifully noted that
Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada had been removed in 1986, for
filing a false income-tax return ``under penalties of perjury.'' He
noted that Judge Walter Nixon of Mississippi had been removed in
1989, for lying to a grand jury about his efforts to fix a friend's
son's case in state court. And he noted that Judge Alcee Hastings
of Florida had been removed, also in 1989, for perjury and
conspiracy to obtain a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All three cases set significant precedents for this case, Graham
said. But he laid special emphasis on a statement by former Sen.
Charles Mathias of Maryland in the Claiborne case. Mathias, one of
the prosecutors in that matter, said the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachable conduct does not have to occur in the performance
of an officer's official duties. Evidence of misconduct,
misbehavior, high crimes and misdemeanors can be justified upon
one's private dealings as well as one's exercise of public
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense is rooted to a considerable degree in the
argument that the offenses charged do not involve official
misconduct. Today, his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the final
presentations constituted ``a clear concession and admission that
their case isn't strong enough without witnesses.'' The White House
and most Democrats oppose calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Hastings had been acquitted in criminal court,
Graham drew the lesson that crime was not a prerequisite to
impeachment, because, he said: ``Impeachment is not punishment.
Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about
restoring honor and integrity to the office.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graham also made a broader point, much at variance with the
apocalyptic tone of most of his Republican colleagues' remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what you decide,'' he told the senators who sat
silently in judgment of a president whom all of them knew, ``this
country will survive. If you acquit the president, we will survive.
If you convict him, it will be traumatic, but we will survive.
There is a calmness in the midst of something so important as this
that tells me we've done it right for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Canady's turn came, he gave perhaps the most lawyerly
speech of the whole three-day process _ tight, well-organized and
thoroughly documented. Whether he changed senatorial minds remained
unfathomable, as has been the case throughout the trial. One
Democrat, Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, said he thought
``the unpersuaded mostly remain unpersuaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady argued that the purpose of the power to remove officials
granted to the Senate is ``to preserve, protect and strengthen our
Constitution by setting a standard of conduct for public
officials.'' Clinton, he said, had failed to meet that standard, as
construed in the light of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the claims of the president's lawyers,'' he said,
``there is not a bright line separating official misconduct by a
president from other misconduct of which the president is guilty.
It does violence to the English language to assert that a president
who has violated a duty entrusted to him by the Constitution is not
guilty of official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have been reminded repeatedly, the Constitution imposes
on the president the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed. A president who commits a calculated and sustained series
of criminal offenses has, by his personal violations of the law,
failed in the most immediate, direct and culpable manner to do his
duty under the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady reviewed at length the concept of impeachment as it
evolved in England, notably in proceedings against Warren Hastings,
who was on trial during the Constitutional Convention. Then he
plunged into an example of the Framers' intent, one of the most
vexed questions in the whole debate.
</P>
<P>
   He relied heavily on comments by James Iredell, later a Supreme
Court justice, at the North Carolina ratifying convention. Iredell
argued that if a president ``commits any misdemeanor in office, he
is impeachable'' and that ``if a man be a villain and willfully
abuse his trust, he is to be held up as a public offender and
ignominiously punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady cited Alexander Hamilton, often invoked for opposite
reasons by the Clinton supporters, to the effect that the
impeachment power focused on ``the misconduct of public men,''
which, Canady said, ``encompasses a whole range of wrongful deeds
committed by those who hold office when those offenses were
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding what standard of behavior would be applied to
Clinton, Canady said, ``The choice the Senate makes will have
consequences reverberating far into the future of our republic.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one senator was absent from Saturday's proceedings.
Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, returned to Hawaii for the funeral of
an aunt, said a spokeswoman for the senator. Inouye will be in
Washington when the Senate trial resumes on Tuesday.

IN CLOSING, THE WORDS OF A CHILD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the text of a letter from a
third-grade student in Chicago that was read by Rep. Henry J. Hyde
on Saturday during his closing remarks at the Senate impeachment
trial. Hyde's remarks were recorded by the Federal News Service, a
private transcription agency.
</P>
<P>
   My name is William Preston Summers. How are you doing? I am a
third-grader in room 504 at Chase Elementary School in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   I am writing this letter because I have something to tell you. I
have thought of a punishment for the president of the United States
of America. The punishment should be that he should write a
100-word essay by hand.
</P>
<P>
   I have to write an essay when I lie. It is bad to lie because it
just gets you in more trouble. I hate getting in trouble. It's just
like the boy who cried ``wolf'' and the wolf ate the boy.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to tell the truth. I like to tell the truth
because it gets you in less trouble. If you do not tell the truth,
people do not believe you.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to believe the president because he is a
important person. If you cannot believe the president, who can you
believe? If you have no one to believe in, then how do you run your
life?
</P>
<P>
   I do not believe the president tells the truth any more right
now. After he writes the essay and tells the truth, I will believe
him again.''

   BOSTON _ The snow finally fell last week, just in time for what
the region's ski businesses hoped would be a successful weekend on
the slopes after a long wait through an unusually warm winter.
</P>
<P>
   But some skiers were deterred by the combination of news reports
about messy, icy roads making for poor driving conditions, and the
rain that capped the snow with a crunchy cover. They shouldn't have
been, according to reports from the mountains Saturday at the start
of what is a long weekend for many.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the groomers can do with this stuff is make a nice packed
powder,'' said David Anderson, marketing director of Loon Mountain
in New Hampshire. ``We had a nice crowd Sunday, but we didn't sell
out. I think some people probably stayed away because of the
roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 25 miles away from Boston, Nashoba Valley ski instructor
Cindy Liming said she was skiing on her day off because the good
conditions surprised her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a lot worse than this,'' said Liming,
who had been worried about rain melting the trails. ``We have more
snow now than we did two days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said better ski conditions were likely to be
found farther north. Friday night's rain turned to snow early
Saturday in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   At Vermont's Jay Peak ski resort, anxious travelers from far
away canceled reservations, but their spots were filled by
diehards, many from Massachusetts. ``There's a lot more license
plates from Massachusetts than usual,'' said marketing vice
president Conrad Klefos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a packed powder surface,'' Klefos said. ``We're in great
shape.'' He said Saturday was the busiest day of the season for Jay
Peak.
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard operator Shelley Martin said people who traveled to
the mountain from New York had a tough time, with trips lasting
twice as long as they would normally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people arriving through the night,'' she said. ``And
some people canceled because of the icy roads. But I guess it
didn't discourage everyone. We have a full mountain.''

(15-1) Can Randall Cunningham and Dennis Green exorcise their
demons?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NFC Championship Game is unfamiliar territory for
quarterback Randall Cunningham and coach Dennis Green. As a matter
of fact, so is winning in the playoffs. Both have been maligned
throughout their careers because of their postseason failures.
Things seem to be falling their way this time. They have the
home-field advantage and they have best team. They also have had
each other for a full season and should put the past to rest with a
Super Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
   Can they run to pass?
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' passing attack has received all the headlines.
However, running backs Robert Smith and Leroy Hoard have played a
big part in their offensive success. If the Falcons line up in a
nickel defense on regular downs, as most teams have, look for the
Vikings to attack with Smith and Hoard. Smith is the speedster, who
can take it the distance. Hoard is the plow horse who runs through
tacklers. FALCONS (14-2) Can they handle the noise?
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves has done everything he can do to
prepare his team for the Metrodome's acoustic atmosphere. He has
called the league to make sure the Vikings abide by league noise
rules. He has piped in music at practice to simulate game
conditions. The task for the Falcons is to not let the noise
distract them during the game. The Falcons have simplified their
blocking schemes and will use hand signals to cut down on
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Can they make it a low-scoring game?
</P>
<P>
   What the Falcons don't want is for the game to turn into a track
meet. That takes away their strength, running the ball and
controlling the clock. The Falcons led the league in time of
possession this season and hope to continue that trend. A game in
the 20s will be more to the Falcons' liking. Anything over that
will be bad news.
MATCHUPS VIKINGS DEFENSE vs. JAMAL ANDERSON The Vikings' goal on
defense is simple _ stop Falcons running back Jamal Anderson. There
is no question the Falcons will try to control the ball and the
game with Anderson. The Vikings have had trouble stopping the run
at times this season. The key against Anderson is to get to him in
the backfield before he gets started; the Falcons runner has proven
to be brutal once he gets in the secondary. The Vikings also must
get Anderson to run wide where they can use their speed to contain
him and not let him pound away at the middle of the defense. RANDY
MOSS vs. RAY BUCHANAN The Falcons are wary about the Vikings' pass
offense, especially 6-foot-5 receiver Randy Moss going against 5-9
cornerback Ray Buchanan. Buchanan has been the Falcons' best
defender all season, but he will be hard-pressed to handle Moss by
himself. The Falcons haven't done a lot of double-teaming, but they
might change that strategy against the Vikings and give Buchanan
some help. Of course, double-covering Moss means Vikings receiver
Cris Carter will get single coverage. However, it's a matter of
pick your poison. The Falcons would rather give up the plays
underneath than the big plays on top.
KEYS TO VICTORY VIKINGS Score fast and often to turn the game into
track meet.
</P>
<P>
   Stop Falcons running back Jamal Anderson and keep him from doing
the Dirty Bird touchdown dance.
</P>
<P>
   Establish the run with Robert Smith to keep the Falcons' pass
defense honest. FALCONS Play ball-control football to keep the
Vikings' offense off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Attack the middle of the Vikings' defense with running back
Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid giving up the big play on defense and force the Vikings to
work for their points.
THE EDGE Vikings run offense (121.0 ypg) vs. Falcons run defense
(75.2) Edge: Falcons
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The Falcons ranked second in the league in run defense,
but the Vikings should be able to loosen them up with their pass
offense.
Vikings run defense (100.9) vs. Falcons run offense (131.3) Edge:
Falcons
</P>
<P>
   Comment: If the Vikings have a soft spot, it's stopping the run.
The Falcons have the weapon in running back Jamal Anderson to take
advantage of this weakness.
Vikings pass offense (270.5) vs. Falcons pass defense (220.7) Edge:
Vikings
</P>
<P>
   Comment: No one has stopped the Vikings' passing game all season
and this time shouldn't be different. Receiver Randy Moss is too
fast. Receiver Cris Carter is too good. Quarterback Randall
Cunningham is too accurate.
Vikings pass defense (215.8) vs. Falcons pass offense (211.6) Edge:
Falcons
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Quarterback Chris Chandler and receivers Terance Mathis
and Tony Martin have been overshadowed by the Vikings' success.
However, they are quite lethal themselves. Mathis and Martin ranked
second in the league in combined receiving yardage _ behind Moss
and Carter.
Special teams Edge: Vikings
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Vikings kicker Gary Anderson has had a perfect season.
He hasn't missed a field-goal attempt or an extra-point try. Kick
returner David Palmer is as dangerous as anyone in the league.
Besides, he also plays quarterback.
Coaching Edge: Vikings
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Atlanta coach Dan Reeves has done a great job turning
around the Falcons. However, Dennis Green hasn't gotten enough
credit for the Vikings' success. Make no mistake about, the Vikings
were the best team in the NFL this year because Green created them.
Bottom line Vikings 31, Falcons 17 (Clarence E. Hill Jr. is a

U.S. WEIGHS ITS REACTION TO MASSACRE IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After increased military buildups and violence by
the warring sides in Kosovo in the last three weeks, the Clinton
administration struggled Saturday to explain how it would react to
the execution-style massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians by Serbian
forces under the control of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a written statement condemning the
killings in the ``strongest possible terms'' and calling them a
``clear violation'' of the Serbs' cease-fire agreement with NATO
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior official, who likened the methods of the killings
to those used by Serbs against Muslim civilians during the 1992-95
Bosnian war, said the administration was stopping short of calling
the Serbs in ``substantial noncompliance'' with the NATO agreement.
Such a judgment, he said, would require NATO to reconsider the air
strikes that were readied but not carried out last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the State Department said NATO would hold an emergency
session in Brussels on Sunday to consider a response, The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The department also asked Milosevic to remove the extra security
forces he has sent into Kosovo in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Milosevic
was being asked to identify and ``take action'' against those who
had ordered the massacre and to allow the International War Crimes
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, sitting at The Hague, into
Kosovo to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has consistently refused visas to the tribunal and has
refused to recognize its jurisdiction. The tribunal's chief
prosecutor, Louise Arbour, announced Saturday she was planning to
go to Kosovo within 48 hours, but it was not clear how she would
reach the massacre site without permission from the Serbian
authorities who control Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre was carried out on Friday after Serbian forces
entered the village of Racak, 16 miles southwest of the capital
Pristina, and according to witnesses, separated men from women,
then shot them.
</P>
<P>
   The top international official in Kosovo, William Walker, a
seasoned American diplomat who heads the monitoring mission there,
said at the massacre site that he had no hesitation in accusing
Serbian government forces of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, a senior NATO diplomat said, ``Once again, it takes
a massacre to put this back to the top of the international
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   With a note of some urgency, the NATO diplomat said the
massacre, which followed the hostage-taking and eventual release of
eight Serbian soldiers last week and renewed fighting on Friday,
had brought the province to the brink of outright war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The onus is going to be on NATO,'' the diplomat said. ``Do we
tolerate this and hope this is not going to spread like wildfire,
or do we go back to the drawing board? Obviously, we need a tougher
stance.''
</P>
<P>
   If war erupts, the diplomat said, it would be almost impossible
to stop without an outside military presence to enforce a
settlement. The willingness of any alliance governments to commit
thousands of troops to such a mission, however, is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The situation on the ground in Kosovo _ where the Kosovo
Liberation Army, supported by the majority ethnic Albanian
population, is pitted against the Yugoslav Army and the Serbian
police _ has been degenerating for more than a month. The rebels
are fighting for the independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, a cease-fire has been in place since the October
agreement brokered by the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke. But
instead of marking time over the winter, as Western diplomats
hoped, both sides have been upping the ante. The Kosovo Liberation
Army has been flaunting its new weapons, boasting of its renewed
fighting vigor and striking at the Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian security forces under the control of Milosevic have
defied the pact with NATO by increasing their presence in Kosovo
above agreed levels, Western officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO meets in Brussels, its diplomats will face far more
difficult questions about how to solve the situation than they did
last fall when they threatened NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   About 800 unarmed civilians who are in the Kosovo monitoring
mission headed by Walker would have to be removed before any air
strikes were staged. Second, a Clinton administration official
acknowledged, there was great uncertainty about what to do after
air strikes. ``What then?'' the official asked.
</P>
<P>
   But the NATO diplomat, apparently reflecting some of the
thinking of Secretary General Javier Solana, said that ``it's not a
realistic policy to leave it up to William Walker and his merry
men'' _ unarmed monitors working under the auspices of the
54-nation Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe.

KURDISH REBEL LEADER, WHO IS WANTED BY TURKEY, LEAVES ITALY
</HEADLINE>
   ( nk)  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ A Kurdish rebel leader wanted by the Turkish government
for terrorism left Italy on Saturday night, the Italian government
announced. The destination of the Kurd, Abdullah Ocalan, was not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that Ocalan, whose presence in Rome caused
relations between Italy and Turkey to plummet, had worn out his
welcome in Italy. ``Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, having decided
to leave Italy, has been accompanied to the border,'' a government
statement said tersely.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, who fled Moscow for Italy in November, was arrested by
Italian law enforcement officials as he arrived at the airport
here. But the government refused to turn him over to Turkey, citing
an Italian law that prohibits the extradition of prisoners to
countries that have a death penalty. He was kept under house arrest
for part of his time here.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which also views Ocalan, as a terrorist,
spoke out in favor of his extradition. Italy hoped to rid itself of
the problem by extraditing him to Germany, which had issued a
warrant for Ocalan's arrest in 1990 on homicide charges.
</P>
<P>
   The German government, however, eventually decided not to seek
extradition, fearing that such an act would rekindle violence among
the three million Turks and Kurds in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, which for the
last 14 years has been waging a war for autonomy from Turkey. The
conflict between Turkish troops and rebels has killed as many as
37,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish government was infuriated by Italy's refusal to
extradite Ocalan. While Kurdish protesters held vigils in Rome in
support of Ocalan, demonstrators in Ankara and Istanbul held
impassioned rallies, burning Italian flags and Armani ties. The
Turkish ambassador here left in protest after an Italian appeals
court ruled that without an extradition request from Germany, Italy
had no grounds to detain Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, who requested political asylum, remained in Rome, but he
came under pressure to find another country. The Italian news
service ANSA reported that he was believed to be headed for Moscow,
but neither the Italian or Russian governments confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
   After being forced to leave Syria and Russia, Ocalan apparently
chose Italy because he felt he would get support from Italian
Communists and even from the leftist government.
</P>
<P>
   When he first arrived, Italy's prime minister, Massimo D'Alema,
a former Communist, had initially sounded supportive of him, saying
shortly after his arrest that Italy would consider Ocalan's request
for political asylum. But as relations with Turkey deteriorated and
D'Alema failed to garner support from other European allies, his
stance grew firmer.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, D'Alema warned that if Ocalan chose to remain in
Italy, he might be put on trial on terrorism charges.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has not yet been any official ruling on Ocalan's
request for political asylum, D'Alema has said on several occasions
that Ocalan's chances of qualifying for political asylum were not
good.
</P>
<P>
   ANSA quoted one of Ocalan's lawyers, Luigi Saraceni, as saying,
``Let us hope that those who have shown sensitivity for the Kurdish
people will continue their effort even the chief protagonist has
left the stage.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ At first glance, it is hard to tell a baby is there.
</P>
<P>
   Then the clues come from following the tubes that blow air into
the baby's tiny nostrils. Another tube carries nutrients into a
vein. The boy has black hair. He is barely a foot long. He is
curled up on a pillow and strapped in a cloth bumper, dotted with
hearts, to keep his arms and legs in the same flexed position they
were in in the womb. As he sleeps beneath a radiant warmer in the
dark and quiet room, machines track his skin temperature, heart
rate, blood pressure, oxygen level and other vital measurements.
Two Beanie Babies lie nearby. One toy serves an extra function: the
Beanie's weight holds the air tubes in place.
</P>
<P>
   Above, a cardboard sign identifies him as Baby F, or Ikem. At 1
pound 7 ounces, he is the smallest of the seven surviving octuplets
born here last month. On Friday night, when Ikem developed signs of
an infection, doctors began administering antibiotics and stopped
his feeding. When the infection subsides, in two to three days,
feeding will resume. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The strongest and largest, at 2 pounds 10 ounces, is his only
brother, Jioke. He rests in a similar warmer in the same room. The
five surviving sisters are in nearby rooms. The babies are turned
from time to time. As a nurse starts the task, she playfully offers
a finger, and the baby's hand grasps it.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving octuplets look and sound like babies, just
miniature ones. Sometimes they open their eyes and look around.
When bothered, they cry.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the eight babies, Ebuka, a girl, was born on Dec.
8, nearly four months earlier than the mother's due date of April
1. The mother, Nkem Chukwu had been treated at the MacGregor
Fertility Clinic in Houston and because of religious beliefs had
rejected the idea of destroying any of the fetuses to give the
others a greater chance of survival. The seven others were born on
Dec. 20, making them the world's first set of octuplets to be born
alive. The largest weighed less than 2 pounds. The smallest, a girl
named Odera, weighed 10.3 ounces and died on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The births made the octuplets an immediate sensation in the news
and renewed the debate about fertility drugs and their enormous
medical and human costs, but here in the neonatal intensive care
unit on the fourth floor of Texas Children's Hospital, the glare of
world attention fades away next to the blip of the infant monitors.
Now, although two babies remain under a pound and a half, all are
gaining weight, ounce by ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chukwu, 27, has visited regularly since her discharge from
the hospital on Dec. 30. When she can hold one of the infants, she
sits in a chair, unbuttons her blouse and touches the baby against
her chest. She does not try to nurse them; the babies cannot yet
suck and swallow well enough. It takes about 20 minutes for the
nurses, who must keep the tubes and wires connected, to get a baby
into her arms.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Iyke Louis Udobi, a respiratory therapist, also
visits and touches the infants. The parents, American citizens born
in Nigeria, gave the babies Nigerian names based on the
characteristics of God.
</P>
<P>
   The babies have a 95 percent chance of surviving to their
expected discharge in late March, said Dr. Leonard E. Weisman, the
head of the neonatal unit. As he led a visiting doctor through the
unit, Weisman said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' that the
babies, all listed in critical condition, would turn out normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a 10 percent or so risk of some long-term
problems, but I hope we are not going to see anything like
blindness, deafness, mental retardation or severe cerebral palsy,''
Weisman said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his 25-year experience as a pediatrician, Weisman
added: ``You learn in this business that things can turn on a
dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisman based his prediction on his study of 1,925 premature
infants the Texas Children's Hospital treated from 1986 through
1994, and reported last June in Pediatrics, a scientific journal.
Texas Children's describes itself as the largest pediatric hospital
in the United States. Of the hospital's 456 beds, 120 are for those
needing the most intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patti M. Savrick, the pediatrician who will care for the
babies after their discharge, said: ``By the time they are 2 to 3
years old, they are going to be good, normal kids, barring any
unforeseen disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Savrick said her optimism was based in part on an ultrasound
test of each baby's head that was performed about a week after
their birth. The test is a strong predictor of serious neurological
problems. When no baby showed evidence of bleeding or cysts, ``that
was dramatically good news,'' Dr. Savrick said. Her practice
includes five surviving sextuplets, two sets of quadruplets and
many sets of triplets and twins.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman credited a drug, surfactant, that supplies a missing
component to premature infants with underdeveloped lungs, as
``certainly the No. 1 reason that these kids are doing as well as
they are.'' Surfactant, which was first marketed in 1990, was given
in the first day of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Two octuplets have had general anesthesia for surgery. Eboka had
heart surgery as a 3-day-old to close a blood vessel (patent ductus
arteriosus) in her heart that failed to do so on its own. The other
was to repair a hole in Gorom's small intestine that was recognized
when her belly swelled and an X-ray showed air present where it was
not supposed to be. Both operations were performed at the bedside,
as is often the case for premature infants.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven surviving octuplets, six had good scores on the
10-point Apgar scale of a newborn's health, 8s or 9s at five
minutes; Gorom was rated at 6.
</P>
<P>
   All received antibiotics for the first two days after birth
because the doctors did not know whether an infection caused the
mother to go into labor. Two babies developed infections later.
</P>
<P>
   All are fed intravenously. In addition, the mother brings in
breast milk to the hospital. For now, the milk is given through a
tube into the stomach of each infant. In about a month the babies
will start feeding by mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, all the babies breathed with the aid of mechanical
ventilators. Now the surviving octuplets breathe on their own. A
pump blows air through the tubing to help keep their chest walls
from collapsing. The babies also receive caffeine to prevent apnea
and stimulate their breathing. As the babies grow and strengthen
their underdeveloped chest muscles in the next few weeks, the air
tubes will be removed.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a month, Dr. David K. Coats, a pediatric
ophthalmologist, will start dilating the infants' eyes each week or
two to check for a potentially blinding condition, retinopathy of
prematurity.
</P>
<P>
   A mild form of the condition develops in most premature babies.
But in about 9 percent it is severe enough to require treatment
with either a laser or freezing technique. The aim is to prevent
detachment of the retina. But treatment fails in about 10 percent
of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Some premature babies who do not develop the retinopathy
condition later develop weak eye muscles as young children.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors also will test the babies' hearing by putting sounds
in their ears and then measuring brain wave responses in a
technique known as brain stem auditory evoked response. The risk of
deafness and severe hearing problems is about 4 percent, Weisman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheezing from a chronic lung disease resembling asthma is among
the babies' other potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the octuplets' problems, like immature lungs, a
perforated intestine and the heart vessel condition, are those
faced by any premature infant. Some problems were compounded by
their numbers. Multiple fetuses create a crowded womb, which
increases the risk of growth retardation. Multiple fetuses also
increase the likelihood that the babies will be born prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman estimated the total cost for the octuplets at about $2
million. It will be covered by the health insurance that the father
receives through his work as a respiratory therapist for a local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the costs are almost irrelevant. ``The expense, as
large as it is,'' Weisman said, ``has to be measured over the
babies' lifetimes.''

HOUSE MANAGERS SEE GOAL WITHIN REACH; WITNESSES MAY YET BE CALLED
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By BENNETT ROTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After three days of making exhaustive arguments
about why President Clinton should be ousted from office, House
Republicans did not appear to have changed many minds.
</P>
<P>
   But they may have achieved one of their short-term tactical
goals _ to persuade Senate Republicans to at least keep the trial
moving forward by calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   With White House attorneys set to argue their case against
conviction next week, the situation remains fluid.
</P>
<P>
   But as of Saturday, when Republican House managers completed
their opening arguments before the Senate, the chance of persuading
two-thirds of the upper chamber to remove the president remained
remote.
</P>
<P>
   To convict the president, a dozen Democrats would have to join
all 55 Republicans. So far no senator from the president's party
has indicated a willingness to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And a number of them said they did not hear anything new in the
House managers' presentation that would cause them to alter their
stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the dynamics have changed from where we began,''
said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. ``Those of us who are
unconvinced remain unconvinced.''
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg also complained that the 13 Republican House members,
acting as prosecutors, may have erroneously believed that by
repeating the same arguments for more than 17 hours they would win
converts.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that one colleague related how a preacher once told
him, ``If you ain't saved a soul in 20 minutes, you ain't saved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers' major short-term goal was to convince a
majority of senators that the case warrants the calling of key
witnesses, including former White House intern Monica Lewinsky;
Clinton's personal secretary, Betty Currie; and presidential
confidant Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster that case, the House managers hammered on the
inconsistencies between Lewinsky's testimony about her affair with
the president and Clinton's denial of the sexual relationship in
the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A number of GOP senators said they needed to hear from a host of
characters in the Clinton-Lewinsky saga to determine who was
telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense developing that there will probably be
witnesses called,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla. ``It's almost
reached the point of inevitability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are contradictions that are significant. Anybody with a
brain would want to have these contradictions resolved,'' said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is expected to cause the first major partisan showdown
in the Senate. Many Democrats and the White House are opposed to
calling witnesses, claiming it will unnecessarily prolong the trial
and create a circus atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said that the evidence provided by the
House managers was sufficient for him to judge the case. He said
parading a series of witnesses before the Senate would take too
much time and prevent lawmakers from taking care of the business of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   In their opening presentation, the House members built a
detailed circumstantial case that Clinton not only lied under oath
about his affair with Lewinsky but also concocted an elaborate
scheme to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have said that even if Clinton did commit the
alleged offenses, they are not sure the charges rise to the
standard of high crimes and misdemeanors outlined in the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still the threshold issue of what is an impeachable
offense,'' said Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., who added the Republicans
had ``a very very difficult case to make.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday three Republican House members tried to address that
issue, claiming that the Senate has convicted judges for offenses
similar to those charged against the president.
</P>
<P>
   They also argued that perjury accusations against Clinton were
equivalent to bribery, which the Constitution does define as a high
crime.
</P>
<P>
   These arguments resonated with a number of Republican senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never understood the argument that perjury and
obstruction of justice do not rise to the constitutional level
(required for impeachment),'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats complained that the Republicans had
overstated their case.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that his Democratic colleagues began ``rolling
their eyes'' when managers Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Steve Buyer,
R-Ind., claimed that Clinton had undercut civil rights laws by his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom. Harkin, D-Iowa, said he was unimpressed when Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., invoked American war efforts from Bunker Hill
to Desert Storm as reasons to oust the president. ``Mr. Hyde's
summation indicated the overkill in this case,'' said Harkin.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the reaction broke down along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, a Democrat from Florida, praised the House
presentation. ``I think if we were in a court of law and a motion
was to be made to today to dismiss the case because of lack of the
prosecution having carried out its responsibilities, I would reject
that motion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sen. James Jeffords, a Republican from
Vermont _ which Clinton carried twice _ was skeptical of the House
managers' case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say lying about a noncrime can be converted into a high
crime by the way you handle it, that sets a pretty low standard for
me,'' Jeffords said.

ELWAY DESERVES PROPER SENDOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We want to see Denver quarterback John Elway go
out the way Michael Jordan did, with his right wrist frozen in a
follow through after one final strike in a closing frame for the
archives and maybe even the ages.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be a shame for the future Hall of Famer's NFL career to end
on a sour note like his college career at Stanford did. Of course,
nobody expects a repeat today _ or ever _ of the 1982 ``Big Game,''
when the Stanford band spilled onto the field after the clock had
run out but before Cal's Kevin Moen had finished his sprint into
the end zone for the winning points on a lateral-laden kickoff
return.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's phenomenal professional career promises to play out more
melodiously, even if it should end today with a loss to the New
York Jets in the AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Understand: Elway hasn't exhausted his eligibility; this time
it's his body that's pooped. That's why no one will be surprised if
Elway's 16th season is his last.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever today's outcome, it'll be an awesome sight when the
game ends and 70,000-plus fans rise like an orange sun to offer a
Mile High salute to the player who gave this frontier city a face
(and finally, this past January a Super Bowl title).
</P>
<P>
   A standing ovation would seem an inadequate acknowledgement of
Elway's legacy. At the very least, the fans should flick on
lighters for the man who has been an incandescent figure in their
midst since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Elway didn't turn Mile High Stadium into Colorado's
eighth-largest city every autumn Sunday, he just put it on the map.
There was a waiting list for season tickets 13 years before Elway
slipped on a Broncos jersey. What he did was take that rabid
following and deliver it to the Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Elway,'' Broncos receiver Shannon Sharpe has said, ``led
Denver out of obscurity and into the land of milk and honey.''
</P>
<P>
   The Prince of Pike's Peak arrived on the scene after escaping
the clutches of a Baltimore franchise that had stubbornly insisted
on drafting him against his will. The moves that forced the Colts
to trade him to Denver for Mark Hermann, Chris Hinton and a
first-round draft pick in 1984 would go down as Elway's first
memorable scramble under duress.
</P>
<P>
   We claim Elway because he came out of Granada Hills High. Our
transplanted son, in turn, owns Denver. It has been an enduring
partnership but not always an enjoyable one.
</P>
<P>
   Elway signed what was then the league's wealthiest contract long
before his career had any context. With his five-year, $5 million
deal he hit paydirt, the likes of which had not been seen in
Colorado since cowboy Robert Womack's strike at Cripple Creek in
the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The money and the attendant media build-up created expectations
that William ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody would have had a hard time
overtaking. Early in his career, the two largest newspapers in the
city ran daily reports on Elway that sometimes bordered on the
absurd, covering everything from what he did (or didn't) eat at
training table to what kind of candy he gave out at Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, 2-7 in the strike-shortened season before Elway's
arrival, went 33-15 in his first three years. Winning games proved
easier than winning over the fans. They seemed more inclined to boo
him than embrace him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Elway said in November of 1984
after throwing for five scores in a 42-21 win over visiting
Minnesota. ``I think some people expected me to walk this high off
the water. I feel the coolness from the fans, from the whole city
of Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   The chill Elway spoke of settled in the bones of his wife Janet,
and one day she cracked. In December of 1985, less than two months
after the birth of the couple's first child, Elway was intercepted
five times in a game against Kansas City and the Mile High fans
began piling on him.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually pulled out a 14-13 victory with a scoring drive in
the final minute, but not before Janet slapped a fan who had
screamed loud enough for practically the whole stadium to hear,
``You can get your . . . wife pregnant, but you can't . . . do
anything else, you bum.''
</P>
<P>
   All that's stiff about Elway are his joints, as Broncos fans
gradually came to realize after giving him enough space (barely) to
finish growing up.
</P>
<P>
   His 45 game-winning drives and 11 winning seasons and and six
AFC Championship Game appearances and four Super Bowl berths are
sublime and his 75 percent winning percentage at Mile High,
something else altogether. But it is scenes like these two that
mark the man:
</P>
<P>
   _In the first game of the 1991 season, Elway orchestrated a
45-14 win over Cincinnati and, for an encore, tossed a football to
a Mile High fan in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   The league promptly fined him $1,000, which didn't even begin to
cover the value of the ball in the eyes of its beholder. How many
zeroes, after all, are in priceless?
</P>
<P>
   _On the first Sunday of December in 1996, the Broncos beat
Seattle 34-7 to clinch their sixth AFC West title of the Elway era.
After changing out of his cape and tights, Elway limped out into
the murky Mile High night, observed a dozen kids playing football
on the field and, to their amazement, fell in with them for a few
downs.
</P>
<P>
   Elway calls himself ``a big kid at heart,'' but he also is a
proud parent. After every home game he makes it a point to wave to
his four kids as he walks off the field. Sometimes they're even
there to wave back.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many in their hometown _ Barrel Man quickly comes to
mind _ the Elway children aren't obsessed with the Broncos. They
have outside interests, such as soccer and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Elway lately has had to persuade 13-year-old Jessica,
11-year-old Jordan, 9-year-old Jack and 7-year-old Juliana to come
watch him play. He makes a pretty convincing argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he tells them, ``dad's not going to be playing
football forever. You ought to come and watch while you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the city ought to heed his words and not spare any
sentimentality in saying so long. &QL;

LOOKING FIT, STRAWBERRY LOOKS FORWARD TO NEW SEASON

<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ The gaunt figure who rode down the Canyon of
Heroes after the Yankees won their 24th World Series is now back up
to his playing weight of 215.
</P>
<P>
   A robust-looking Darryl Strawberry made his first public
appearance Saturday since the victory parade. Filling out a red
sweat shirt as if he were in midseason form, he drew cheers upon
his arrival at the Roosevelt Field Mall. Some waited as long as two
hours for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Just 12 days ago, Strawberry underwent an operation to remove
scar tissue, an aftereffect from surgery to remove a malignant
tumor from his colon last October.
</P>
<P>
   `'I feel pretty good for just having surgery again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, 36, was cautiously optimistic about his return to
baseball this year and about remaining with the Yankees. The
pitchers and catchers report to the Yankees' training camp on Feb.
15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season could happen, and it may not happen,'' said
Strawberry, who hit 24 home runs in 1998. ``With my luck, it always
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is scheduled to receive weekly chemotherapy through
April. He has been lifting weights, even on days when he receives
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't affected my daily living performance,'' he said. ``I
don't think it's going to have any major effect on me playing. I
feel great. Being that I'm such a young age, and you face something
like that, your body has a tendency of being a little stronger than
it normally would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's weight had dipped to 185 pounds, the lowest since
he played at Crenshaw High School in South Central Los Angeles. But
through diet and lifting, he looks like the Strawberry of old. Both
the Yankees and Strawberry are waiting to see if he performs like
the Strawberry of old.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, has said he
wants the left-handed slugger back. The team still plans to sign
Strawberry to a minor league contract so that a $2.5 million option
on his contract will not be subject to major league baseball's
luxury tax.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has not swung a bat since doctors excised a a
three-inch tumor from his intestine on Oct. 3. He faces plenty of
competition in the outfield and at designated hitter, with Chad
Curtis, Ricky Ledee and Chili Davis all returning. These are among
the same Yankees who produced 114 regular-season victories and a
sweep of the San Diego Padres in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said that if the Yankees decide to go with those
players instead of him, ``There are other opportunities for me.''
</P>
<P>
   His greatest moment on the field last season was hitting a grand
slam to bring the Yankees back from a four-run deficit against
Oakland on Aug. 4. The Yankees won the game. The low point came
Oct. 1 when his cancer was diagnosed while the team was in
Arlington, Texas, completing a three-game sweep of the Rangers in
the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, heavily favored to muscle through the post-season,
rode Strawberry's inspiration to the American League championship
against Cleveland and their second World Series title in three
years. Steinbrenner and Manager Joe Torre wept for Strawberry in
dedicating the Series to him. Pitcher David Wells led a toast to
him in the clubhouse at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego after the
clinching victory.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have found no additional cancer, but the initial
pathology report indicated that the cancer had spread to one of 36
lymph nodes removed in the operation. Chances for his long-term
survival range widely, doctors said.

OPENING ARGUMENTS CONCLUDED IN SENATE; HYDE SAYS CLINTON `DEBASED'
OVAL OFFICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
c.1999
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
By JOHN C. HENRY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors wrapped up their opening
arguments against President Clinton on Saturday with a plea for his
ouster to keep the presidency from being ``deeply and permanently
damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a crowded Senate chamber and national television
audience, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. _ the chief House prosecutor _
urged senators to ``rise above politics, above partisanship, above
polling data'' and convict Clinton on charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations _ outlined in two articles of impeachment _ grew
out of the president's effort to conceal a sexual relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, a deception that took
root a year ago today (1/17) when he testified under oath in Paula
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hyde maintained that the case is ``not a question of
lying about sex,'' he alluded to Clinton's effort to keep his
affair secret as an indication of how the presidency ``has been
debased and the justice system jeopardized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Morally serious men and women can imagine circumstances at the
far edge of the morally permissible'' in which a president could
shade the truth for the good of the nation, Hyde said. ``But under
oath, for a private pleasure?''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee chairman urged senators not to
shrink from removing Clinton if they believe, as some Democrats
have suggested, that his behavior violated the public's trust. If
senators believe Clinton violated the law yet vote to acquit him,
``the office of the presidency has been deeply and perhaps
permanently damaged,'' said Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate trial _ only the second of a president _ recessed
until Tuesday when a team of private attorneys and White House
lawyers will begin mounting a defense. Next weekend, senators will
be allowed to raise questions, then cast a series of votes on
whether to continue the trial and whether to begin summoning
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Senate chamber, skirmishing continued through the
weekend on the witness issue as partisan lines began hardening over
seeking more testimony. Democrats rejected a Republican invitation
to form a bipartisan working group of senators to work out details
for questioning witnesses, if a majority of the Senate wants them
called.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in a letter to
Democratic leader Tom Daschle, suggested that the working group
``could anticipate and help resolve in advance any complications''
brought about by witness testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle rejected Lott's proposal saying issues related to
witnesses should only be addressed if the Senate votes to compel
such testimony. ``It is my hope that such arrangements will
ultimately prove unnecessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To convict Clinton, two-thirds of the Senate _ or 67 of the 100
members _ would have to vote for at least one of the articles of
impeachment. Republicans hold a 55-45 majority, so even if all GOP
senators vote against Clinton, a dozen Democratic votes would be
needed to terminate his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In the only previous trial of a president, Andrew Johnson
escaped conviction by one vote in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the current trial recessed for the weekend, White
House Special Counsel Greg Craig told reporters that the case
presented by House Republicans ``ends as it began _ an
unsubstantiated circumstantial case that does not meet the
constitutional standard to remove the president from office.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton revised sections of his State of the
Union address and practiced it in the Family Theater. He is to
deliver the speech _ an outline of his agenda for the coming year _
Tuesday night in the House of Representatives, about eight hours
after lawyers begin his defense in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the president did not watch any of Saturday's Senate
session.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hyde's final remarks, other House prosecutors anticipated
Clinton's likely impeachment defense and cautioned senators against
buying into arguments that the president's behavior was not bad
enough to remove him from office. Perjury and obstruction of
justice, the prosecutors said, warrant terminating a presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will hear next week ... that the offenses charged by the
House are not impeachable. In other words, that even if the
allegations as set forth in the articles of impeachment are true,
so what?'' said Rep. Steven Buyer, R-Ind. ``I'm not offended by the
`so what?' defense, because if that's all you have, then try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyer characterized Clinton's effort to conceal his relationship
with Lewinsky as a ``premeditated assault on the administration of
justice (which) must be interpreted as a threat to our system of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham rarely referred to his notes and paced the
area behind the podium, his soft South Carolina drawl amplified by
a lapel microphone as he pleaded for ``cleansing'' the presidency
by removing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``President Clinton chose to cheat in every manner you can
cheat in a lawsuit,'' Graham said, referring to allegations that
the president lied in his deposition in the Jones case. ``If you
put him in jail after he leaves office, that would not solve the
constitutional problem.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Impeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about
cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and
integrity to the office,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In his summary of the House case, Hyde defended the approval
last month _ largely along party lines _ of the two articles of
impeachment. Those in the Republican-controlled House who voted to
impeach are not, as some have suggested, ``Clinton-haters,'' Hyde
said. ``It is a disservice to the House to suggest that it has
brought these articles of impeachment before you in a mean-spirited
or irresponsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's five-hour session capped presentations over three
days by the 13 House managers. They detailed a case alleging abroad
conspiracy by Clinton to illegally conceal the Lewinsky affair from
the Jones lawyers, and then to hide the relationship from a federal
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The managers listed a half-dozen alleged lies by Clinton to the
grand jury and another eight in his Jan. 17, 1998, deposition in
the Jones case. And they identified several other acts they said
the president committed to hide evidence or influence the testimony
of other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   To make their case, the House prosecutors asserted that the
grand jury testimony of Lewinsky and presidential secretary Betty
Currie, which conflicts with testimony of the president, was more
believable. They repeatedly tried to bolster the former intern's
version of the affair, calling her ``very credible'' and her
assertions in past testimony ``common sense.''

DIXIE DOT COM GETS HIS DUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ The San Francisco-area tracks rarely produce one good
3-year-old a season, let alone two good ones, as they did last
winter. The only thing stranger than Dixie Dot Com and Event of the
Year showing up in the same generation is the fact they never raced
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   First one got hurt and then the other, so Dixie Dot Com had to
wait for the $316,000 San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita on
Saturday to take a shot at the better-publicized Event of the Year
and stomp him by 4{ lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Event of the Year, ridden by Corey Nakatani, was a heavy
favorite in the field of eight 4-year-olds. Dixie Dot Com, with
leading jockey David Flores, was the fans' fourth choice.
</P>
<P>
   Old reputations die hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at Event of the Year in the paddock,'' said Dixie Dot
Com trainer Bill Morey Jr., ``and if I can say anything, I'd say we
grew a little bit more than he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Dot Com, a son of Dixie Brass who was 3 for 4 at Bay
Meadows and Golden Gate Fields before fracturing his right foreleg
in February, has improved since coming back in September at
Fairplex Park. But he'd finished second three times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great way to break our seconditis,'' said Morey, 59,
who brought six horses to Southern California and has been living
in a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Dot Com ran the 1 1/16-mile race in 1:41.06, a sharp time
on a track that acted dull most of the day. Morey said he'll aim
for the Feb. 6 Strub Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   For Event of the Year, who was unbeaten and favored for the
Kentucky Derby before he fractured a knee last April, it was the
second straight defeat since his return. He was third in the Malibu
Stakes on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran well,'' said Richard Mandella, who trains Event of the
Year. ``The winner ran a hell of a race.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Event of the Year looked best of the Malibu grads.
Malibu winner Run Man Run finished fourth. Artax was seventh after
holding a contested early lead. Mail Coach was fifth, Old Topper
third, Yarrow Brae sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Dot Com had to race wide on both turns but got the lead at
the top of the stretch and drew off. He paid $12.40 for a $2 win
bet.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco exacta, the reverse what most fans up there
would have predicted, returned $17.50 for $1.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Eddie Delahoussaye's turf win aboard Self Feeder put the
jockey within six of the 6,000 mark. He's on six horses today,
including Tranquility Lake in the El Encino, in which Manistique is
2-5.... Pick-six carryover: $192,476.... The San Gorgonio Handicap
boiled down to a two-mare race as expected before See You Soon
($4.80) and Kent Desormeaux wore down Sonja's Faith to win by a
neck.... Upsets in early-season 3-year-old stakes: Grits'n Hard
Toast ($31.20) and Robbie Davis caught Donerail Court to win the
Holy Bull Stakes at Gulfstream Park. Vicar was fifth. Epic Honor
($9) and Lonnie Meche beat entrymate Blue Tune in the Golden Gate
Derby. The favored Golden Eagle Farm entry was off the board.

NBA READY TO PLAY `LET'S MAKE A DEAL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Begin ital) Warning: The following column may include a
reference to the salary cap. Reader indiscretion is advised. (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is on the cusp of a talent-acquisition riot the likes of
which won't be duplicated until a tractor-trailer jammed with
Furbies flips over a curb next to a hair salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be madness,'' said player agent Eric Fleisher.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not going to happen until the league's new collective
bargaining agreement is written. It's been 10 days since the deal
between the players' union and owners was ratified, but a lawyer
from the O.J. Simpson trial would have hammered out this
contentious tome in four.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say any true stories about Bulls in Detroit, the
scattered plague of mediocre point guards, and sightings of a
misunderstood coach-choker in Florida won't occur until, well,
early this week. And anything that sounds like a fine deal probably
will be murdered by the ... salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the player movement will be mostly centered around
trades,'' said agent Bill Duffy , the representative for Michael
Stewart, a Sacramento Kings free agent who through the blindness of
strangers (also known as NBA general managers) managed to go
undrafted in 1997 after completing his eligibility at Cal. Who has
the inside track on the 6-foot-10 shot-blocker? ``Until something
happens,'' said Duffy, ``you'll hear a million stories.''
</P>
<P>
   We're only offering a few:
</P>
<P>
   How about Sherman Douglas choosing to pick up a pen and sign
with the Clippers? It makes dollars and a little sense. The
veteran, free-agent point guard should be affordable; he also
played for new Clips coach Chris Ford in Boston and Milwaukee.
Douglas, entering his 10th NBA campaign, spent last season with New
Jersey, averaging 8 points and 4 assists in his 21 minutes per
game.
</P>
<P>
   But it should be noted that Douglas was part of the package Ford
and the Bucks shipped to Cleveland in exchange for superior point
guard Terrell Brandon
</P>
<P>
   . Another problem with liberating Douglas from Jersey swamp land
could be defense. The Clippers want a point guard who is guilty of
playing a little.
</P>
<P>
   And now ... the departing lineup for your world champion Chicago
Bulls! Starting on the first tee is Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   . Reportedly shooting the curl over to the beaches of Phoenix is
center Luc Longley
</P>
<P>
   . Threatening to take his all-time, NBA-best 3-point percentage
to dreaded Detroit is former Palisades High hotshot Steve Kerr
</P>
<P>
   . At small-change forward, a disgruntled, below-market-value
free agent who may sign with Houston or San Antonio if he's not
traded to the Lakers is free agent Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Chicago Tribune, a deal sending a
signed-to-be-traded Pippen to Shaq Nation for Eddie Jonesand other
concerns may be sabotaged by the greediness of Bulls general
manager Jerry Krause
</P>
<P>
   . At the risk of blowing a deal and getting nothing for Pippen,
Krause reportedly wants draft picks, and any Lakers picks figure to
come toward the end of any upcoming drafts.
</P>
<P>
   We would have had the lowdown on their power forward, but are
proud to admit having no connection with anyone (or thing) who
could provide information about Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The homecoming of Brent Barry could be imminent. Hold it. The
free agent ex-Clipper is not expected to be lured back into the
loving embrace of the Sports Arena; Barry, the son of Golden State
Hall of Famer Rick Barry.
</P>
<P>
   (Brent still has a fine crop of hair, thank you), grew up in the
Bay Area and soon may be a Warrior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's a rumor,'' said Barry after a recent workout at
Veterans Park Sports Complex in Carson, ``until something gets
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the rumor: Barry, who was traded to Miami last season,
could be packaged with two other Heaters in a deal that would bring
three Warriors to Florida. One of these Warriors would be Latrell
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Or Barry could sign with the Bulls and be the hair apparent at
the off-guard position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any preferences,'' Barry said. ``I'm just going
to sit and wait patiently. I expect a few of the early signings to
have a domino effect on what happens with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it a Domino's Pizza effect that has the 6-6 Barry weighing in
at 222 pounds an increase of 17 pounds from early last season?
</P>
<P>
   Nah, weight lifting and healthy food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (extra weight) feels great,'' said the former NBA slam-dunk
champion, who spent much of last week running circles around his
ex-Clipper cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Now is a good time to be rollin' with Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers fans remember this guy, which is why we should toss a
reminder at our readership's remaining 99 percent. McDyess was the
hot prospect the Clips selected with the second pick in the 1995
draft, then immediately traded to Denver for three fine players.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the bouncy, 6-9 McDyess who's averaged 15 points
and 7.5 rebounds in three NBA seasons (two in Denver, one in
Phoenix) the Clippers received Barry, Brian Williams and Rodney
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   You know about Barry. Williams bolted after one season, then
became a bargain-basement Bull, a champion, and a rich Piston. A
few months back, he visited Tibet and became Bison Dele.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, if you're scoring at home, is still a Clipper. McDyess,
if you're burning your Clippers' T-shirt may return to Denver or
stay in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Former Long Beach State coach Tex Winter will continue as
offensive coordinator for the Bulls and new coach Tim Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   But with only four Bulls under contract, teaching Winter's
complicated ``triangle offense'' during an abbreviated training
camp may lead to one alternative:
</P>
<P>
   Circling the wagons.

HERE'S A FIRE DRILL WAITING TO HAPPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some advice for the following 48 hours as the NBA
launches into an accelerated signing period with all the speed,
twists and turns of a Six Flags roller coaster: Remain seated, stay
calm and maybe swallow a couple dramamine.
</P>
<P>
   This ride promises to be bumpy, disorienting, even dizzying.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 free agents will find employment, and a couple dozen
more could be dealt in swap-meet fashion. All in a period that
should open Tuesday and end when the last general manager has
passed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league,'' notes Laker Kobe Bryant, ``might look completely
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The process began Saturday, as players and teams began
unofficially making deals that can't be signed until the NBA and
players union finalize the new labor deal in the next day or so.
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams, Matt Geiger and Derrick Coleman are off the
market, agreeing to sign with New Jersey, Philadelphia and
Charlotte, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still the matter of finding homes for the likes of
Scottie Pippen, Antonio McDyess, Damon Stoudamire and Tom
Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   Both L.A. teams will be active, the Lakers probably sending
Elden Campbell to a team in need of a center and the Clippers
searching for a point guard to complement Michael Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be some surprises,'' Shaquille O'Neal said slyly
of the Lakers' plans.
</P>
<P>
   We now know who probably isn't coming to the Lakers, but who is
remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, carrying 300 pounds and twice that amount in baggage,
is not. Charles Oakley, trapped in Toronto, isn't either.
Gugliotta's a 50-50 proposition, and Pippen is slightly below that.
Chris Webber's a longshot possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers would love to put Gugliotta in the frontcourt,
hustling for rebounds and drawing crowds away from O'Neal. Problem
is, to obtain Gugliotta in a sign-and-trade deal, the Lakers have
to match his salary with some combination of players in return.
</P>
<P>
   Same deal with Pippen, and both players figure to get contracts
averaging more than $10 million a year. Campbell, wanted by several
teams as a starting center, makes $7 million. The Lakers are loathe
to part with Eddie Jones, and adding his salary of about $2.5
million won't be enough to balance either of those deals anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters further is the NBA's new labor deal isn't
complete, and general managers aren't certain what the precise
rules are concerning sign-and-trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a good chance the Lakers will lose out on both
Pippen and Gugliotta. Nothing is final, but reports over the
weekend indicated Pippen was leaning toward signing with Houston
and Gugliotta was leaning toward staying in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   A deal sending Campbell to Orlando for Horace Grant has also
been rumored, but Grant's salary of about $15 million isn't a good
match, and the Magic will probably fill its center need with
ex-Clipper Ike Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the old Webber scenario. Sacramento had vowed not
to trade him under any circumstances, but Kings ownership is in
flux and anything could happen now as general manager Geoff Petrie
threatens to quit one minute and decides to stay the next.
</P>
<P>
   The Latrell Sprewell relocation project will also be completed
in the next couple of days, and his fate could be linked to former
Clipper Brent Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Barry is a free agent with interest from several teams,
including Chicago, but he could be re-signed by Miami and packaged
in a deal to Golden State for Sprewell. A Bay Area native, Barry is
one of the few NBA commodities actually interested in playing for
the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Various reports have San Antonio, Indiana and the New York
Knicks alternately pulling out of and re-entering the Sprewell
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen? Who the heck knows? Just take the
motion-sickness pills, turn on ESPN and if you're keeping score at
home, write in pencil and keep an eraser handy.
</P>
<P>
   Laker makeover: Just what will the 1999 Lakers look like?
</P>
<P>
   All that's certain is they won't look like the team currently on
paper. Three rookies _ guards Tyronn Lue and Sam Jacobson and
forward Ruben Patterson _ tentatively fill the three open roster
spots, but that's unlikely to become permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' self-described Achilles heel last season was youth,
and trading Nick Van Exel for Lue and Tony Battie only made them
younger. Count on an influx of at least two veterans, hopefully
with playoff experience. They've lacked that element since Byron
Scott and Jerome Kersey moved on after the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we need is obviously leadership, an old
veteran,'' Eddie Jones said. ``Not a guy that will come in and give
you 20 or 30 (points), but an older guy that will come in and give
you that leadership, that authoritative person on the court, a guy
that's not afraid to say anything. I think that's what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   An old O'Neal pal, Dennis Scott, remains a possibility. Point
guard Kevin Johnson has been talked about. And Rick Fox, though he
appeared to be out of the capped-out Lakers' price range, is still
an option, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Count point guard Derek Fisher among those who would welcome a
veteran presence _ even if it's a point guard like Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if they made some changes to solidify
the point guard position,'' said Fisher, who became the starter
last season and solidified his role when Van Exel was traded.
``Even though I feel I'm ready, as an organization I don't know if
I would feel comfortable with a guy that's only been in the league
for two years (himself) and a rookie (Lue) leading my team to the
NBA title.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he's heard talk of the Lakers signing Johnson, an
11-year vet with Finals experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have respect for him,'' Fisher said. ``He'll make our
team better, that's the way I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad move: The NBA players union, which already took a PR beating
_ and a loss at the bargaining table _ dealt its own credibility a
blow by decertifying agent Steve Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the dissident agent who filed a number of unfair labor
practice complaints against the union during the lockout, was
notified of the decision last week. Without union approval, Woods
would no longer be able to represent players. His current clients
are Kevin Willis and Willie Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Even Marc Fleisher, a union loyalist for most of the lockout,
was taken aback by the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all he did was express his opinion, I'm concerned about
taking this type of a measure without due process,'' Fleisher
said. &QL;

ATLANTA CAN BEAT MINNESOATA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - They have 15 wins, the most anonymous two-time
loser in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   They have a running back with tree-trunk thighs, the son of Mike
Tyson's security chief.
</P>
<P>
   They have a quarterback who has been tossed around like a rag
doll and the worst end-zone ritual this side of Ickey Woods.
</P>
<P>
   But, really, the remarkable transformation of the Atlanta
Falcons is all about one man, a coach who has finally found
unanimous respect, nearly dying in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves, the man who was run out of Denver and fired in New
York, has single-handedly put this thing together. A team with just
14 players that preceded his arrival in 1997. A team that is poised
to stun the Vikings and the world, and if they do, the menu will be
tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Not because of the batch of lutefisk Jesse Ventura must ship to
Georgia in the traditional governor's bet.
</P>
<P>
   More like Reeves vs. John Elway. In the Super Bowl. A match-up
that would have a staff of cardiologists on call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good week of practice,'' Reeves said. ``And I think
our football team is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons can beat the Vikings because they, too, play in a
dome. Because they have the speed on defense. Because they have a
workhorse named Jamal Anderson and a running game that can keep the
Vikings off the field. Because the Vikings are hurting with Jake
Reed inactive and John Randle questionable because of a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the presence of Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that cockiness that makes everyone around him
confident,'' Falcons receiver Terance Mathis said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, 54, is the reigning Coach of the Year, certainly the
sentimental choice after undergoing a quadruple coronary bypass in
mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   He had a tumultuous career in Denver, where he frequently
clashed with the golden child. Reeves thought Elway was a baby, and
he was right. Elway thought Reeves was stifling his creativity, and
he was right. They were both stubborn and headstrong, and in the
end, the owner wisely sided with the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   With a heavy drawl, he was somewhat miscast in New York, even
though he was Coach of the Year after guiding the Giants to an 11-5
record in 1993. Eventually, he was fired because he wanted more
power than ownership was willing to give.
</P>
<P>
   But he got his wish in Atlanta, full control of the team that
threw away Brett Favre, a team coming off a disastrous 3-13 season
under June Jones. His first priority was quarterback, and after
pondering Elvis Grbac, he stole Chris Chandler from Houston. His
next priority was defense, signing free-agent cornerback Ray
Buchanan, who will line up across from Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, there were 39 new faces in uniform and a team
that won its second NFC West title in 33 years. A team that has won
21 of its last 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Falcons won their first playoff game since 1991,
and they're hardly content. In their locker room back in Atlanta, a
Purple Pride towel is tacked to a bulletin board. So is a quote
from the Vikings' Andrew Glover, who said the Vikings are
``impossible to beat'' at home. So is a poster of a Super Bowl ring
with the caption: ``See something you like? Go out and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' best maneuver, however, was his attack on the noose of
noise. It is no consolation to Cardinals fans, but Reeves asked the
NFL to investigate the Metrodome's policy on sound, and the league
responded. Today, those ridiculous sideline speakers behind the
visitors' bench will be moved closer to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   If the hosts prevail, the league will be salivating. The Vikings
are the glamorous ratings choice for the Super Bowl, a team that is
0-4 in the big game. An outfit that will no doubt be hyped as
possibly the best team in history, from the state that elected a
wrestler as governor.
</P>
<P>
   But in this season of redemption, destiny smells like Reeves vs.
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if his heart can handle it. &QL;

OFFENSIVE, AND PROUD OF IT  
 VIKINGS RESHAPE FORMULA FOR SUCCESS IN NFL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ If defense wins championships, why are the
Minnesota Vikings one win away from claiming the NFC title today?
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Vikings' defense is bad, but it was their
record-setting scoring-machine offense that carried them to a
league-leading 15 regular-season wins, to 41 points in their
playoff opener against the Cardinals, and has positioned them as
the strongest threat to unseat defending Super Bowl champion Denver
in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But first, there is the matter of the NFC championship game at
the Metrodome against the Atlanta Falcons, and their defense that
was surpassed only by San Diego's against the run.
</P>
<P>
   A test, yes, but the Vikings have been built to score: two
quarterbacks who could start almost anywhere; the league's
strongest threesome of wide receivers; a breakaway running back;
three All-Pro linemen opening holes.
</P>
<P>
   In a league of imitators, the Vikings have created the latest
trend with their financial commitment to players who can put points
on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are going to be copying the way our team is put
together, where we've spent the money,'' Vikings receiver Cris
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   As important as having high-powered pieces on the field is
having an offensive coordinator who knows what to do with them.
Brian Billick, a candidate for head coaching vacancies in Cleveland
and Baltimore, has pushed all the right buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian has an amazing offensive mind,'' Vikings running back
Robert Smith said. ``The ways that he has attacked defenses has
been truly amazing. He is wrapping it up in so many different
packages that they feel like we are doing things that they haven't
prepared for. A moment's hesitation by the defense is all you need
when you have the kind of athletes that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly, Atlanta's only hope in the din of the Metrodome is to
score first and control the ball. If the Falcons fall behind, well,
one need look no further than last week when the youthful Cardinals
became rattled in the incredible noise and quickly fell behind,
17-0. The Falcons' offense is directed by a veteran quarterback,
Chris Chandler, who might not be as inclined as Jake Plummer was to
developing the yips.
</P>
<P>
   But a league-record 556 regular-season points followed by scores
on 7 of 10 possessions against the Cardinals says that stopping, or
even slowing, the Vikings is a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to have any chance against them, we have got to play as
well as we possibly can,'' said Falcons Coach Dan Reeves, who plans
to be on the sideline despite having had bypass surgery last month.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Falcons, with a pair of corners not much taller than
the pompon line and reinforced by safeties who are well into their
30s, can deal with the Vikings' corps of tall, speedy receivers is
the story of the day. The ball is delivered to them by 35-year-old
quarterback Randall Cunningham, whom the Vikings had to coax out of
retirement last year.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Johnson was the Vikings' quarterback until he opened the
door for Cunningham with an early season injury. Johnson has become
trade bait. The Vikings would want a top-eight draft pick in a
trade package for Johnson, creating the scary spectre of yet
another weapon being added to their arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randall came in and really played well,'' said Dennis Green,
the Vikings coach. ``If you look at what he's accomplished, he has
poise, confidence, a big, strong arm and a great feel for the game.
I think everyone's looking for players that have found peace and
want a second chance. I think a lot of guys leave the game and
leave many times before they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teams are interested in trading for Johnson, including
NFC teams Philadelphia and Washington. Imagine the Vikings with the
Eagles' second pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with what they have now is tall order enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tall quarterback (6 feet 4), we have tall receivers
(6-3, 6-4, 6-3). It's designed toward what we do,'' Green said.
``Cris Carter has been a great competitor for years. I think he's a
future Hall of Famer. Jake Reed is a player who developed for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Moss came to us as a polished, accomplished receiver. I
think most people think that Randy just has the ability to run
deep, but he can work all different routes and go one-on-one. His
best asset is probably that he's a great competitor. That's what he
brings to the football field when he goes against a defensive
back.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cunningham having so many receiving targets coupled with
the luxury of handing off to a game breaker like Smith, the Vikings
are changing thinking around the league: Defense might win
championships, but you can't beat what you can't catch. &QL;

THERE'S NO DENYING PARCELLS' SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER - He stood at a lectern decorated with the familiar NFL
logo, a red, white and blue shield picturing a football on a field
of five-pointed stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any questions?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Before New York magpies could reply, all at once he exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   A deep sigh into a live microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells looked and sounded tired. Tired from the long
flight from New York. Tired from the traveling media circus that
surrounds his team. Tired from staying up late trying to figure out
how to beat John Elway and Terrell Davis and the Denver Broncos,
who almost never lose at home, in today's AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching is a grindstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is never final,'' he once said. ``There's always more
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave it up once, or tried. Twenty years ago, after coaching
at Air Force, Parcells decided to spend more time with his family
and put down roots in Colorado Springs. He took a job with a land
development company.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife had Broncos season tickets. They attended every
home game. ``I could walk to those seats right now,'' Parcells
fondly recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But the self-imposed exile didn't last. Just as some are called
to preach, some are called to coach. Parcells was born for the job.
And no one in his profession is better.
</P>
<P>
   His resume is familiar to anyone who follows pro football.
Parcells won two championships with the New York Giants. Then he
moved to New England and took the Patriots to the title game. Now,
surprise, he is one win away from returning to the Super Bowl with
another team, the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who, in 1996 were 1-15.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year, Parcells led them to a 9-7 record. This year
they finished 12-4 and won their first AFC East title and now here
they are in Denver feeling as high as the altitude and thinking, so
what if they are the underdogs. Anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets beat Miami and Buffalo on the road. They won 11 of
their past 12 games. Led by Vinnie Testaverde _ cut by the
Baltimore Ravens _ the Jets believe in themselves and what they are
doing, which is a tribute to their coach. A charming grouch,
Parcells is the best in the business at motivating players.
</P>
<P>
   This is all you need to know about the man's confidence and his
outlook. On his first day of training camp, the new coach, who has
total control of football operations, was asked why anyone who had
been to three Super Bowls would take over the worst team in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells answered with a story. ``Two guys are sent to Australia
to sell shoes to the Aborigines. One guy calls his boss and says,
`There's no opportunity here. The natives don't wear shoes.' The
other guy calls and says, `There are a lot of opportunities here.
These people don't have any shoes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He is an opportunist. A salesman. The best at what he does, bar
none. What other coach could help Testaverde suddenly bloom at 35?
Who else could handle Bryan Cox, the temperamental and disruptive
ex-Dolphin/ex-Bear?
</P>
<P>
   Before the Jets played the Dolphins, Parcells placed a
half-empty gasoline can in Cox's locker. It was the coach's
needling way of questioning whether the veteran linebacker had
anything left in his tank. He did, and does.
</P>
<P>
   After an early season loss to the St. Louis Rams, Parcells
abruptly walked off the field during practice and took his
assistant coaches with him.
</P>
<P>
   Another day he wore one of his glittering Super Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   Like all great coaches, Parcells measures his players'
competitiveness against his own. He knows what buttons to push, and
not to push. He surrounds himself with ``his guys'' _ guys like
5-foot-7 return man Dave Meggett, who was out of football when
Parcells recently signed him. Meggett played for Parcells in New
York and New England. The Jets have nine former Giants and
ex-Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Today they will play in Mile High Stadium wearing the same style
of uniforms Joe Namath and his Jets wore when they won Super Bowl
III 30 years ago. Parcells made the decision to resurrect those
uniforms the day after he took the job.
</P>
<P>
   Clothes don't make the man. A coach can't make plays. But
Parcells is the person responsible for bringing the Jets this far,
this fast. His team may not win. But I would never bet against
him. &QL;

A FINAL HOME GAME HURRAH  
 ELWAY LEAVING ON HIS TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ He doesn't want any weeping goodbyes, so those who
adore him are giving His Rocky Mountain Majesty a one-game farewell
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway's teammates aren't about
to let him walk out of Mile High Stadium for the last time as a
loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very emotional,'' tight end Shannon Sharpe
said.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Super Bowl champions have won 18 consecutive home
games going into today's AFC championship game against the New York
Jets. They've won 24 regular-season games in a row at Mile High
Stadium, 32 of 35 under Coach Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are well aware of the historical implications. One
minute, cornerback Otis Smith refers to Elway as ``the Michael
Jordan of Denver.'' The next minute, linebacker Bryan Cox talks
about crashing Elway's party.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want me to do, send a cheer for him?''' Cox said.
``He had a great career, and he's doing the same thing as Michael
Jordan. He's leaving on his terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) damn, I ain't got nothing to do with that. I'm not
worried about his last game. I'm trying to get to the next game,
and we have to get through the best team to do that. I don't give a
crap about the rest of the stuff. I'm not sentimental.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are fighting words in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Elway could run for mayor or governor of Colorado. Fans still
are hoping that the future Hall of Famer will come back for a 17th
season, but he maintains it's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, his family voted, 5-1, in favor of him playing
another season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no votes this year, at least not yet,'' said Elway,
who is married with four children. ``I've been too busy. They're
never home, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get a full ballot, and they're always out. And there
are no absentee ballots.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos players, coaches and team officials, knowing today is
Elway's last home game, are asking the fans to scream louder than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``How loud can the decibel level go at Mile High Stadium?''
defensive end Alfred Williams said. ``Whatever answer is, that's
how loud it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos owner Pat Bowlen gets choked up just thinking about the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be the last time I watch Number 7, period,'' he said.
``I'm not assuming we're going to win. I'm hoping we're going to
win, but that will be an emotional moment for me that drags out for
a long time. I don't want to be overly dramatic or anything, but
this could be the last time I kneel down next to John in the locker
room, holding hands when we say the team prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotion that will be there should be unbelievable because
John has been the franchise, no matter how far back you look over
the last 38 years. I don't think we'll ever have a player who will
be raised to that stature. . . . John obviously will have his
special place in Denver because he really brought this franchise
from the idea that it was guys in funny orange jerseys from the
mountains into national prominence. Even though Denver went to the
Super Bowl in 1977, nobody ever took the team seriously until
John.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many are taking the Jets' chances seriously. They're
nine-point underdogs against a team that scored 501 points during
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has averaged 35 points a game at Mile High and has been
particularly devastating in the first quarter when it outscored
opponents, 158-54. Of those 158 points, 54 have been scored on the
first drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous challenge to try to stop these guys,'' Jets
Coach Bill Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is the reason many Jets fans think they can get the
upset. He has taken the New York Giants to two Super Bowls and the
New England Patriots to one. Now, he has a team that was 1-15 two
years ago one step away from Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has been in three conference championship games and won
all of them. He is considered the ultimate big-game coach, a master
motivator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put something on the bulletin board this week,'' Jets
quarterback Vinny Testaverde said. ``He said one mistake at the
wrong time can send a team packing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets know they can't make many mistakes against the Broncos'
high-powered offense. They have the NFL's Most Valuable Player in
running back Terrell Davis, who ran for 2,008 yards and 21
touchdowns. If Davis gets untracked, it makes Elway and the passing
game that much more effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can run the football with the best of them,''
said Shanahan, whose rushing attack was ranked second in the
league. ``They can stop us, but at what cost?''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets also have great offensive weapons. Testaverde led AFC
passers with 61.5 percent completions for 3,256 yards and 29
touchdowns. He was intercepted only seven times.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Curtis Martin rushed for 1,287 yards. Wide receiver
Keyshawn Johnson had 83 catches for 1,131 yards and 10 scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was around Jerry Rice, every time he touched the ball
he thought he was going to score,'' said Shanahan, formerly
offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. ``I see the same
thing in Keyshawn Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have a slogan for today's game: ``Carpe diem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means seize the day, seize the moment,'' tight end Kyle
Brady said. ``One thing that's been made very clear to us by the
older veterans is that in this league, you don't know how many
opportunities you are going to get at something like this. So,
you'd better take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, meanwhile, has only one more opportunity at Mile High
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's retiring, John would rather think this one's for the
fans,'' Bowlen said. ``Because John is well aware that he's had the
greatest fans. They've elevated him, and he's elevated himself, to
a stature somewhere up there with the Rocky Mountains.'' &QL;

CARDINALS ASSESS WHAT WENT RIGHT, FOR A CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What goes on when the minds of the Cardinals congregate to
evaluate a season?
</P>
<P>
   Who throws the darts, and who strains a muscle patting himself
on the back? More important, who brings the doughnuts?
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' brass was in the unaccustomed position last week
of grading itself on a successful season, its first winning record
since 1984, its first playoff appearance since 1975, and its first
playoff win since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wanted to take credit for discovering the players who
made it happen. By one account, there were not enough feathers for
the headdresses.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, Coach Vince Tobin and his assistants have replaced
contempt with credibility in the locker room and on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, territorial niches are guarded as tightly as Aeneas
Williams rubbing out Michael Irvin. The games the big boys play are
fascinating, and front-office relationships border on the
dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   The team is owned by Bill Bidwill, who is content to leave
football decisions to football people. He has hired a good one in
Bob Ferguson, vice president for player personnel. Ferguson was a
key mover in building Super Bowl teams at Buffalo and Denver. He
has made his point by finding a number of ``keepers'' in the late
rounds for the Cardinals, the biggest being defensive tackle Mark
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bidwill Jr., a vice president, has veto power on all
football operations. He took over negotiations with first-round
draft pick Andre Wadsworth during a 44-day holdout. Bidwill Jr. is
credited with signing quarterback Jake Plummer to an extension that
includes a league-record $15 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The peacemaker, and at times dealmaker, is Bidwill Jr.'s
brother, Michael. His primary duty is getting voter approval of the
Rio Salado Crossing, which would include a retractable-roof,
natural-grass stadium for the team in Mesa. He was the closer in
the Wadsworth deal.
</P>
<P>
   They have a team of scouts tripping over each other to prove to
their higher-ups that they can spot talent _ not unlike the manner
in which fans suddenly tripped over themselves to hop on the
bandwagon that for years was parked in the barn.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Mr. B isn't crazy about seeing any of them quoted
in the newspaper, it's easier getting Susan McDougal to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this is the group that will chart the course of a team that
has made giant steps, and one positioned to make even more. The
roster is young, it has high draft picks _ two in the first round _
and it has salary-cap room.
</P>
<P>
   So there they were, in a room together for hours on end every
day last week, assessing the state of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in pretty good shape,'' Bidwill Jr. said. ``We have four
unrestricted free agents who are pretty valuable. If we sign them
back, we'll have no glaring holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The four are outside linebacker Jamir Miller, offensive left
tackle Lomas Brown, wide receiver Rob Moore and safety Kwamie
Lassiter. Even if the salary cap increases by the anticipated 10
percent, Miller or Moore might have to be ``franchised'' to fit
them both in.
</P>
<P>
   One break the team expects is an enormous rookie salary pool
given its high picks and the three compensatory picks its expects
to be awarded for free agents lost last year.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be unanimity on two issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two things we couldn't do,'' Ferguson said, ``was pick up
the yard on fourth and 1 or first and goal, and we got the ball run
down our throats. Which will we address first? Everyone has their
own opinion on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals need a big back, a lead blocker who also can
convert for them in short-yardage situations.
</P>
<P>
   They have to determine if their highly regarded defensive line
is just young, or if some of the luminaries are overrated.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals used their last three first-round picks on
defensive players _ ends Simeon Rice in 1996 and Wadsworth last
year, and cornerback Tom Knight in 1997. The success of the
Minnesota Vikings, who put the bulk of their resources into
building an offense that took them to an NFL-best 15-1 record while
scoring a league-record 566 points, adds weight to the argument
that it's time to spend more on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be shocked to see the Cardinals use one of their
first-round picks on an offensive lineman, especially in view of
the uncertainty regarding rookie Anthony Clement, a 6-foot-7,
355-pound behemoth coming off surgery on a herniated disc. He is
expected to recover, but until the Cardinals see it on the field,
they're not certain.
</P>
<P>
   They need at least one more receiver. The Vikings have shown
that a team can't have too many of them.
</P>
<P>
   On the defensive side, linemen Eric Swann and Brad Ottis are in
limbo because of injuries. Swann still is on crutches after the
second surgery in two months on his arthritic right knee. Ottis
fractured the same foot twice in four months. The bone graft from
the second surgery seems to have taken. The Cardinals won't have a
good read on either until after the bulk of free-agent signings.
</P>
<P>
   The team might need another outside linebacker. Can Tony
McCombs, a second-year player who started most of the season,
continue to improve? Is Patrick Sapp, who replaced him during the
playoffs, the answer? Or neither?
</P>
<P>
   Is Ron McKinnon the real deal at middle linebacker, or just the
beneficiary of Swann's dominance up front?
</P>
<P>
   Another safety and a return specialist also are needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have (4,000) people out to greet you at the airport,
as we did on one occasion, it is symbolic of the groundswell
support that has been generated,'' Michael Bidwill said. ``We
appreciate that and thank our fans. It has been an unbelievable
year, on the field and in the community. We've got a good watermark
now. We'll try to continue to improve upon that, on the field and
in the community.'' &QL;

<P>
   Former Kansas City Chiefs Coach  &UR; Marty Schottenheimer will be
the 1999 version of  &UR; George Seifert, a coach in waiting whose name
will surface for every NFL job next season.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are rumors that Schottenheimer will replace  &UR; Dick
 &UR; Vermeil in St. Louis after next year.
</P>
<P>
   He also could have his pick of other jobs.  &UR; Pete Carroll, still
haunted by the ghost of  &UR; Bill Parcells, is in trouble in New
England. Just last week, he fired two assistants, a sure sign that
the next pink slip will be that of the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bobby Ross also could be dumped in Detroit. Team officials
wanted to bring in  &UR; Matt Millen as a front-office executive over
him, but after Ross objected and threatened to quit, the Lions
withdrew the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where Schottenheimer goes, he had to get out of
Kansas City, where talk about his personal life has been the rage.
It got so out of control that during the news conference last week
to announce his resignation, he said, ``There have been rumors
during this last season regarding my marriage and my personal life.
Those rumors are absolutely false and untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife,  &UR; Pat, was at the news conference. For months, she has
had to endure gossip and innuendo that her husband has been having
an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Their son,  &UR; Brian, who was on the Chiefs' coaching staff, said
he also had heard the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard them all, too,'' he said. ``All the crazy stories.
And I can tell you, they're completely untrue. Everyone has someone
they know that's convinced it's a fact, so sometimes it's hard to
listen to it. But I know better, and you just have to laugh it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, I'm 25. I'm single. I go to bars. Of course, I hear the
stories. If anything, the rumors should be about me. I don't know,
maybe people were confusing my dad with me. But I think a lot of
that comes with just being an NFL coach and being a public
figure.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether his mother was bothered by the rumors, the
younger Schottenheimer's said, ``Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's tougher than all of us put together. She's been an NFL
coach's wife for a long time.'' &QL; 
Renaissance man
</P>
<P>
   Seifert, the new coach of the Carolina Panthers, enjoys fishing
for 165-pound marlins and going to the theater.
</P>
<P>
   He said his favorite show is ``Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it five times,'' Seifert said. ``I love it. The
first time I saw it I was in London. It brought tears to my eyes. I
don't know if I could ever watch it and not be moved by it.'' &QL; 
History major
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ron Wolf, general manager of the Green Bay Packers, researched
how teams that replaced successful head coaches from within fared.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that nearly all of the time the assistants were
colossal failures, including in Green Bay when  &UR; Phil Bengston
replaced
 &UR; Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   The only times the promoted assistants did well were in Oakland
when
 &UR; Tom Flores replaced  &UR; John Madden and in San Francisco when Seifert
replaced  &UR; Bill Walsh. Both Flores and Seifert went on to win Super
Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   He used that information to explain to Packers offensive
coordinator
 &UR; Sherman Lewis why he was bypassed for former Philadelphia Eagles
Coach
 &UR; Ray Rhodes in replacing  &UR; Mike Holmgren, who left to become general
manager-coach at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands it,'' Wolf said of Lewis. ``I'm not sure he
accepts it.''
</P>
<P>
   Going, going, gone?
</P>
<P>
   Two former Cardinals were among the five players left
unprotected by the 49ers for the Cleveland Browns' upcoming
expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers exposed  &UR; Chuck Levy, the Arizona product who was a
second-round draft pick of the Cardinals in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   They also made available deep snapper  &UR; Randy Kirk, whom 49ers
teammates call ``White Trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back  &UR; Terry Kirby got Kirk a baseball cap inscribed with
that nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby wouldn't say why Kirk was given that moniker but
acknowledged that Kirk often was seen leaving the team's practice
facility carrying a 12-pack of beer. &QL; 
Unhappy campers
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's  &UR; Bill Cowher now is the dean of NFL coaches, but
Steelers officials aren't happy the team slipped from 11-5 and six
consecutive playoff seasons to 7-9 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is talented enough to be in the playoffs,'' said
 &UR; Ton
 &UR; Donahoe, director of football operations.
</P>
<P>
   Team President  &UR; Dan Rooney said he can't accept the team ending
the season with a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were definitely capable of winning the division,
and I still do,'' Rooney said. &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   If the Washington Redskins fire  &UR; Norv Turner, the Cardinals'
 &UR; Vince
 &UR; Tobin will be the most senior coach in the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are $28 million over the estimated $57 million salary
cap for next season.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Coach  &UR; Mike Ditka, on offensive coordinator
 &UR; Danny Abramowitz being under fire: ``As long as I'm here, he's
here. When they get rid of me, Danny and I are going to go out
dancing together.'' &QL;

THIS IS THE REAL SUPER SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Welcome to the happiest day of the whole NFL
season, conference championship day, the really Super Sunday. Twice
the games and half the calories.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades' experience shows that if you want a great
football game, you're more likely to see it in today's conference
championships than two weeks from now in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not in the past decade, (begin ital)both(end
ital) conference title games were harder fought than the Super Bowl
they set up.
</P>
<P>
   Will it happen again with the Atlanta Falcons vs. the Minnesota
Vikings and the New York Jets vs. the Denver Broncos? Don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Do know these teams will have an easier time cracking the list
of the top 10 Super Bowls, if there is such a list, than our list
of the top 10 conference title-games, which follows.
</P>
<P>
   10.: Minnesota 24, Los Angeles 13; Dec. 26, 1976: Of the four
Rams playoff losses to the Vikings in an eight-year span, this was
the most heartbreaking, though the turning point came early.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence McCutcheon fell short of a touchdown on a controversial
call. Tom Dempsey tried a field goal. Nate Allen blocked it. Bobby
Bryant grabbed the ball on a big hop and ran 90 yards through the
12-below wind at the old Met.
</P>
<P>
   A John Cappelletti fumble and a blocked punt put the Rams in a
deep hole and a late interception thrown by Pat Haden kept them
there.
</P>
<P>
   Did you have to bring it up?
</P>
<P>
   9.: Pittsburgh 16, Oakland 10; Jan. 4, 1976: It was 3-0 Steelers
after three quarters on the ice at Three Rivers Stadium, and then a
hockey game broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth they went. Franco Harris, 25 yards for a
touchdown. Ken Stabler, a TD pass to Mike Siani. Terry Bradshaw, a
TD pass to John Stallworth. Forty-eight-year-old George Blanda, a
field goal. The Raiders recovered an offside kick but time ran out
on them.
</P>
<P>
   8.: Miami 21, Pittsburgh 17; Dec. 31, 1972: Bob Griese, out with
a broken ankle since October, relieved Earl Morrall in the second
half and led drives to two Jim Kiick TDs for the Dolphins on their
way to a 17-0 season.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bradshaw's forward fumble had given the Steelers an early
lead, but the tackle knocked him out of the game with dizziness,
and when he returned he threw two late interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   7.: Pittsburgh 20, Indianapolis 16; Jan. 14, 1996: Almost the
greatest ending in conference-championship history _ but Jim
Harbaugh's Hail Mary pass to Aaron Bailey fell incomplete at the
gun. Bam Morris had scored the winning TD with 1:34 to play.
</P>
<P>
   6.: New York Giants 15, San Francisco 13; Jan. 20, 1991: The
Giants' defense and ball-control offense _ an NFL record-low 14
turnovers in the regular season _ won it the hard way with five
Matt Bahr field goals. The last split the uprights from 42 yards as
time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   5.: Washington 24, San Francisco 21; Jan. 8, 1984: Mark Mosely's
winning field goal from 25 yards with :40 on the clock wasn't the
most dramatic thing about this game. Three Joe Montana TD passes in
the fourth quarter had wiped out a 21-0 Redskins lead. Montana's 27
completions set an NFL championship record but this was one game he
couldn't pull out.
</P>
<P>
   4. San Diego 17, Pittsburgh 13; Jan. 15, 1995: Neil O'Donnell
had an AFC championship-record 32-for-54 day but Stan Humphries'
pair of 43-yard TD passes in the second half for the Chargers put
the Bolts ahead. The Steelers had first and goal at the 9 but
O'Donnell's fourth-down pass was deflected by Dennis Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   3.: Denver 38, Cleveland 33; Jan. 17, 1988: Earnest Byner would
like this to be remembered for the John Elway-led 75-yard drive _
The !ital!Other Drive _ to the Broncos' winning TD at 4:01. But
it's remembered for the Byner fumble that ended the Browns' ensuing
drive at the 3 with a little over a minute left.
</P>
<P>
   Byner had run for 67 yards and a score and caught passes for 120
and a score but came out of it as the biggest goat in conference
championship history.
</P>
<P>
   2.: Denver 23, Cleveland 20 (overtime); Jan. 11, 1987: The
Drive. Broncos trail 20-13. Ball on their own 2. Elway takes them
98 yards in 15 plays, nine of them passes, ending with the
game-tying 5-yarder to Mark Jackson with 37 seconds to play. Then
Rich Karlis' field goal wins it in OT.
</P>
<P>
   1.: San Francisco 28, Dallas 27; Jan. 10, 1982: The Catch. It
was already a classic before that, the 49ers and Cowboys trading
leads five times to put Joe Montana at a 27-21 disadvantage with
less than five minutes to go and the ball at his own 11.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen plays later, Montana rolled right from the Cowboys' 6,
threw high in the corner of the end zone and Dwight Clark reached
as high as he could to pull it down.
</P>
<P>
   For the 49ers, who went 2-14 two seasons earlier, it was the
first of four conference titles under Bill Walsh. For what it's
worth, it was Vin Scully's last football game.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. One fan's ranking of the best conference-title games.
</P>
<P>
   Top 10 Super Bowls to follow as soon as we get to 10 good ones.

BUDGET PLAN A THREAT TO OHV FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Arizona's Joint Legislative Budget Committee has
proposed a budget plan for fiscal year 2000 that would transfer $1
million to the general fund from State Parks' Off-Highway Vehicle
recreation funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Governor's Office of Strategic Planning, on the other hand,
doesn't recommend changing the allocation of OHV funds to State
Parks.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, according to State Parks officials, the joint
committee budget would severely affect the availability of funding
for OHV grants and programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Education and Natural Resources Joint Appropriations
Subcommittee is scheduled to hear the State Parks budget on Feb. 5
at 9 a.m. in Senate Hearing Room 1.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is this: OHV operators often are criticized by the
public for tearing up terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The OHV program addresses those perceptions with grants to
establish OHV courses and to educate operators on proper ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that when the Legislature sees a tight budget, it
often turns to State Parks for funding?  &QL; 
Great Western studied &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service is exploring the possibilities of adding
the Great Western Trail to the National Trails System.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,100-mile trail would run from the U.S. border with Mexico
to Canada. It would accommodate the full gamut of outdoor travelers
from off-highway vehicles, to bicycles, to horses, to hiking.
</P>
<P>
   One purpose of the trail is to link western towns and provide an
opportunity to discover the heritage of the communities in addition
to the outdoor experience.
</P>
<P>
   Congress requested that the Forest Service study the feasibility
of the trail becoming part of the National Trails System.
</P>
<P>
   The trail already is well-established in Utah and parts of
Arizona. The trail will use existing roads and trails, mostly on
public land.
</P>
<P>
   The study will determine if such a trail is feasible and
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Informational public meetings are scheduled this week in Tucson,
Phoenix and Flagstaff. The meetings will include information about
proposed routes. Videos, maps and land management personnel will
provide the information.
</P>
<P>
   All meetings will start at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Tucson meeting is Tuesday at the Arizona Doubletree Hotel,
445 S. Alvernon Way; The Phoenix session is Wednesday at Tonto
National Forest offices, 2324 E. McDowell Road; and Flagstaff's
meeting is Thursday at the city hall, 211 W. Aspen Ave. &QL; 
Sunrise, Snowbowl open &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warm weather that hit Arizona last week, some slopes
at both Sunrise and Arizona Snowbowl ski areas remain open.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Sunrise, between Pinetop and Springerville,
reported a 24-inch snow base and said 33 percent of the slopes were
open. Lifts 1, 3 and 8 are operating.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise still is manufacturing snow at night to keep the slopes
skiable.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Snowbowl near Flagstaff reported a 26-inch base and
eight runs open on Mount Agassiz.
</P>
<P>
   The report predicted warm weather and good skiing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, it will turn nasty in the mountains. Otherwise, both
ski areas _ especially Snowbowl, which can't make snow _ could be
in trouble. That's not to mention the cross-country courses, which
already are in deep trouble. &QL; 
Walleye anglers meet &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Walleye Anglers have two meetings scheduled this
week in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Warnecke, the Arizona Game Fish Department biologist in
charge of lakes formed by the Salt, Verde and Agua Fria rivers,
will be the speaker on Tuesday when the Phoenix chapter holds its
monthly meeting, beginning at 7:30 p.m. at the American Legion hall
at Cave Creek Road and Peoria Avenue. He will explain walleye
stocking plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa chapter will hear from Ty Gray, an urban lakes
biologist, at it's meeting Thursday. That meeting also begins at
7:30 p.m. at Citrus Gardens, 4065 E. University Drive.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the public is welcome free of charge. &QL; 
Perez, Angulo win &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Perez and Frank Angulo, both of Tempe, weighed in a
six-bass limit totaling 10.18 pounds to win the second BestBet
Aluminum Boat bass fishing tournament at Bartlett Lake.
</P>
<P>
   They won $1,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The BestBet circuit is new, and participants can fish only from
aluminum boats. None can be on the pro circuits. &QL; 
Barry Burkhart can be reached at 602-444-8454 or at

CASINO BEEFS UP SECURITY FOR TYSON FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The MGM Grand went back into the boxing business
Saturday as though it were going to war.
</P>
<P>
   Heightened security was evident throughout the hotel and casino
before the Mike Tyson-Frans Botha bout, the first fight at the MGM
since the near-riot after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears in
June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 180 uniformed and plainclothes officers were assigned to
various details in and around the hotel's arena. The MGM said it
paid for the additional costs in security.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson fights often have been marred by violence and other
problems. After Tyson's victory over Bruce Seldon, rapper Tupac
Shakur was gunned down near the Strip in a suspected gang killing.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bite Fight, the casino was closed when gunshots were
reported. MGM management later said loud pops were the result of
breaking champagne bottles and exploding firecrackers instead of
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   During a stampede for the doors, $134,000 worth of chips
disappeared from a blackjack table. The hairdresser for former NBA
star Dominique Wilkins, Jeffrey Jerome Campbell, eventually pleaded
guilty to attempted grand larceny. &QL; 
Religious gifts
</P>
<P>
   Tyson received presents from Zaneb and Fatima Ali, the daughters
of Valley businessman Tahir Ali, who is the fighter's sponsor at
the Islamic Community Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson received a traditional head covering, a prayer rug from
Mecca and some prayer beads.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts are exchanged during a three-day celebration of Eud
ul-Fitr at the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. &QL; 
Strange bedfellows
</P>
<P>
   Botha trainer Panama Lewis was not in the corner Saturday night
because of a ban for altering gloves that was imposed in 1983 by
then-New York Commissioner Randy Gordon. Today, Gordon works for
Botha as a media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think Panama did it,'' Gordon said of the trainer, who
did a couple of years in prison as a result of removing padding
from Luis Resto's gloves in a terrible battering of Billy Collins.
``But we have an understanding of each other's roles in terms of
helping Botha.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Ken Starr and Al Gore on the same presidential
ticket in 2000? &QL; 
Rumor rings true
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of talk that Charles Barkley is headed to the
Seattle SuperSonics, and Barkley himself did most of the talking
late Friday after he and Sonics guard Gary Payton arrived for the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where am I going to be playing?'' he yelled to a crowd that
had gathered around him at the MGM casino.
</P>
<P>
   The chorus-like response was ``Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' Barkley said. &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
Happy birthday: Muhammad Ali is 57 today. A party for him is
scheduled at the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's new trainer, former Evander Holyfield cornerman Tommy
Brooks, signed for three fights at close to $1 million per bout.
Brooks averaged about $250,000 a fight with Holyfield. Brook's best
payday was Bite Fight, when he collected $500,000. &QL;

ALL-OVERLOOKED SQUAD LOOKS GOOD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   So who were the biggest losers when it came to filling out the
rosters for the NHL's World and North American All-Star teams?
</P>
<P>
   A few names immediately come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   How about the Kings'  &UR; Luc Robitaille, who entered the weekend
with 24 goals and 42 points? Or Edmonton's  &UR; Bill Guerin, who had 18
goals and 33 points at the time of the selections? And then you
have other woulda-coulda-shouldas such as Buffalo's  &UR; Michael Peca,
Dallas'
 &UR; Jere Lehtinen and Philadelphia's  &UR; John Vanbiesbrouck and  &UR; Rod
 &UR; Brind'Amour.
</P>
<P>
   The nonselection of Robitaille, fresh off his 500th goal, is
perhaps the worst case, which Kings Coach  &UR; Larry Robinson wasn't
afraid to address when asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised. I was even more surprised when I saw who
made it,'' Robinson said. ``I'm not saying (Montreal's)  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Recchi is not a great hockey player, but he's having a (expletive)
year. The All-Star Game isn't about what you did. It's about what
you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerin, snubbed yet again, wasn't about to add fuel to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say I got screwed,'' Guerin said. ``Luc
Robitaille's not there and he's having a hell of a year.'' &QL; 
Band on the run &QL; 
Rock bands split up all the time, but there's not a lot you can do
when your drummer gets traded to Anaheim and one of your guitarists
gets dealt to Phoenix. Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Five members of the expansion Nashville Predators banded
together this season and formed a group. Apparently, they were
pretty good. But goalie  &UR; Dominic Roussel, the band's leader, was
traded to the Mighty Ducks in October. Then last week, defenseman
 &UR; J.J. Daigneault was shipped to the Coyotes for future
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got together and tried to make something happen _ and we
did,'' Daigneault said. ``I don't think we're all that good, but
we're having fun and it sounds like a song when we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it ``did.'' The band was versatile, though, playing
everything from ``Sweet Home Alabama'' to ``With or Without You''
and was in the process of adding some country tunes to the play
list. And not just because  &UR; Garth Brooks is a close friend of Coach
 &UR; Barry Trotz.
</P>
<P>
   They still were searching for a name for the band before
Daigneault left. Dry Ice, the Crosscheckers and the Offsiders were
among some of the ideas being bandied about. But now that the band
has shrunk to a trio consisting of  &UR; Denny Lambert, Darren Turcotte
and
 &UR; Sebastien Bordeleau, maybe the remaining members should borrow
another hockey term and simply call themselves Short-Handed. &QL; 
Mileage marker
</P>
<P>
   Further proof that Eastern Conference teams have it easier when
it comes to traveling during the course of an 82-game schedule,
especially against conference opponents:
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia will travel an estimated 18,558 miles to face teams
in its own conference this season. By contrast, a team such as the
Dallas Stars will travel 32,694 to face foes in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know how good they've got it in the East,'' Stars
forward  &UR; Dave Reid said. ``It's so much easier in the East, it's
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-place Stars, by the way, on Saturday wrapped up a
five-game Western swing to Calgary, Vancouver, Edmonton, San Jose
and Anaheim that covered 5,304 miles. &QL; 
How Swede it is &QL; 
Anaheim defenseman  &UR; Fredrik Olausson, with an 18-point spurt since
Dec.13, is six points away from becoming the second non-North
American blueliner to reach the 500-point plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish defensemen led the pack over fellow Europeans (Russians,
Finns and Czechs). The all-time leading blueline scorer born
outside of the United State and Canada is Sweden's  &UR; Borje Salming,
who racked up 787 points. Next is Olausson, followed by fellow
Swedes
 &UR; Calle Johnansson (431),  &UR; Nicklas Lidstrom (393) and  &UR; Stephen
Persson (369).
</P>
<P>
   Olausson, a former Winnipeg Jet, had hardly displayed any
offensive production for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was thinking defense first because that's what (Craig)
Hartsburg wants,'' teammate  &UR; Teemu Selanne said. ``But Freddie can
do so much damage, offensively. That's what makes him so good.'' &QL; 
Slumping Shanahan &QL; 
One of the reasons the Detroit Red Wings have been in a bit of
tailspin is because  &UR; Brendan Shanahan is in one, too. Goal-less in
10 straight games entering the weekend, his game has fallen apart.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Scotty Bowman has been so frustrated with his star wing
that he's yanked him off the power-play unit and slashed his
minutes to 12 to 14 a game. That won't last for long, though.
Shanahan is simply in a slump and should pull out rather soon.
</P>
<P>
   Captain  &UR; Steve Yzerman isn't terribly concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mere presence keeps a lot of guys honest,'' Yzerman said.
``If he's not scoring, he's still effective and doing a lot of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate  &UR; Darren McCarty's take on the overall situation in
Detroit?
</P>
<P>
   ``Team Schizophrenia, that's what it feels like,'' McCarty said.
``We're the only ones who can fix it. We know when we do play our
game, we're successful. When we don't, we suck. And right now, we
suck a lot.'' &QL;

FREE-AGENT DANCE ABOUT TO GET HOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 Analysis 
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It is the biggest, most expensive game of musical
chairs ever played.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next few days, when the NBA and its players
union finally get their new collective bargaining agreement down in
writing, 29 teams will try to place almost 200 free agents on
rosters at about the same time training camps begin.
</P>
<P>
   And the general managers and coaches of those 29 teams don't
even know whether the music stops Tuesday or even later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than speculation at this point, it's confusion,''
said one NBA general manager.
</P>
<P>
   As a public service, then, we'll try to figure this out. But
remember, this is for entertainment purposes only. Please, no
wagering.
</P>
<P>
   The three players who will determine much of what happens in the
entire league are the Suns' Antonio McDyess, Chicago's Scottie
Pippen and Minnesota's Tom Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   They are the three most desirable free agents on the board, and
once they decide where they will play, the rest of the free agents
will begin falling into place.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess is a mystery. A friend who is fielding phone calls for
him said McDyess may wait until Tuesday to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do the Suns find themselves in a situation where, if
money isn't a factor, they don't have an advantage in getting a
player. But that appears to be the case. The Suns can pay McDyess
more than Houston or Denver, although state tax laws in Texas put
Houston on nearly equal ground.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing speculation that McDyess will go to Denver,
Pippen will end up in Houston and Gugliotta will stay in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume that's how it falls.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns would fill out their roster with less flashy names, try
to work some trades and end up as a playoff team, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Houston will re-sign Charles Barkley and have another aging
team, but one that is capable of winning a championship if those
aging players stay healthy. If the Rockets don't get Pippen or
McDyess, Barkley might bolt to Seattle. He was in Las Vegas on
Saturday for the Mike Tyson fight with SuperSonics Gary Payton and
Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Some other free agents who will probably receive healthy new
contracts include centers Isaac Austin, Vlade Divac and Matt Geiger
and point guard Rod Strickland. The bet is Austin will wind up in
Orlando or Chicago. Charlotte's reported deal with Miami free agent
Derrick Coleman could mean Divac will end up in Sacramento. Geiger
will probably sign for far more than he's worth with Philadelphia.
Strickland is likely to remain in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   What about the players the Suns don't re-sign from last year's
team?
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, Kevin Johnson is considering Seattle and the Los
Angeles Lakers. John ``Hot Rod'' Williams is being lured by Houston
but that could be part of the effort to get McDyess. The Rockets
were also showing interest in George McCloud until they started
moving toward Pippen instead of McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Robinson will probably end up back with the Suns if
McDyess goes to Denver, or he could be signed and traded. That
means Detroit will try to land center Chris Dudley, who played for
the Knicks last season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what about the Bulls, who are without Michael Jordan,
Pippen and Dennis Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have plenty of money, and they'll try to grab Miami
free agent Brent Barry. They'd love to get McDyess, but may turn to
Austin. The Bulls may also try to get involved in some
sign-and-trade deals. They'd like to find a way to get Orlando's
Anfernee ``Penny'' Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the toughest call for teams will be on forward Christian
Laettner, who played in Atlanta last season and blew out his knee
during the lockout. Some teams probably would have been reluctant
to go after Laettner because of his personality. Throw in a bad
knee, and it's not a desirable situation for the 6-foot-10 forward.
But Laettner is a talent.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Pistons apparently are ready to make him an offer,
bad knee and all. He played with Detroit's Grant Hill in college,
so why not?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we're a long way from 200 players.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the free agents will stay with the teams they finished
with last season. Some, like Suns free agent George McCloud, will
wait to see what the big-name players do before sorting through
their options. The money won't be much of a factor.
</P>
<P>
   That will only leave two issues unresolved: Which coach will
wear Latrell Sprewell's fingerprints on his neck next? And what
will happen to Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, there are a handful of teams that want Sprewell,
including the well-grounded Indiana Pacers, who are coached by
Larry Bird. We want some big money on the coach in that one, by the
way. But the Knicks are his most likely destination.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rodman, put him in a WCW leotard and forget about him. &QL;

YOUNT: BLUE-COLLAR HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm just a human being gifted with the ability to play
baseball. I'm nothing special. I'm just another person.'' _ Robin
Yount in 1993. &QL; 
PHOENIX - To hear those who know him best, there was never a day
Robin Yount played baseball for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Yount's unselfishness paid off in a manner he could never have
imagined when he became one of just 34 players ever elected into
the Hall of Fame during his first year of eligibility. Considering
236 players have been admitted into Cooperstown's hallowed halls,
the accomplishment is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   To Yount, who was reared in Southern California but has lived in
Arizona since 1983, the feat is absolutely mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to grasp,'' Yount said last week at the
Leinenkugel's Ballyard Brewery adjacent to Bank One Ballpark, the
one he and brother Larry co-own with Diamondbacks managing general
partner Jerry Colangelo. ``It's like this is a fictitious story.
I'm having a lot of trouble accepting what has happened. It doesn't
feel real. This was never ever something I thought about.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount will formally be enshrined into baseball's Hall of Fame in
late July. His plaque will hang alongside those of Willie Mays,
Babe Ruth, Frank Robinson and all of the other great names the game
has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he will maintain the pursuits that have kept
him busy since his retirement _ co-owning an auto-racing team,
serving as a part-time instructor in the Brewers organization,
taking part in a business venture or two and staying involved in
the lives of his four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent 20 years in the big leagues, and it's almost like now
I'm asking myself, `What do I do now?' '' said Yount, who resides
in Paradise Valley. ``Of course, there's never any shortage of
things to do. Once I'm up in the morning, I don't stop doing things
all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the players in the Hall, Yount managed to
distance himself from the spotlight throughout most of his 20-year
major league career.
</P>
<P>
   That he spent each of those seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers
easily is the biggest reason Yount was never considered a major
superstar during his career. But talk to those he played with and
against, and they attest to the true greatness that made Robin
Yount a rare first-ballot Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he played and handled himself, it was not even a
question that he's a Hall of Famer,'' said longtime Brewers
teammate Jim Gantner. ``Robin never got the publicity he should
have because he played in Milwaukee. If he had played in New York,
Chicago or Los Angles, you would have seen him make 10 All-Star
teams instead of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even through all that, I never heard him complain. Not once
did he mention he should have made this team or that team. And
there were plenty of years where he should have been an All-Star
and didn't get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Like those in the city he played in, Yount was all about being a
blue-collar kind of player and a man of simple tastes. He shunned
the press. In turn, though, the press never shunned him, twice
naming him the American League's Most Valuable Player. More
astonishing was the fact Yount was an MVP at two different
positions, shortstop and center field.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to other great players who come across as aloof or shy,
Yount always expressed himself best when on the playing field. An
excellent athlete, Yount made the climb to the major leagues after
just 64 games in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   At age 18, he broke in as the Brewers' everyday shortstop in
1974, a time when a kid athlete making the jump to the highest
level was almost unheard of. Now, of course, there are players such
as Kobe Bryant and Eric Lindros breaking in within months of their
high school graduation. That was not the case back then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he choked up on the bat and stood up on the
plate,'' Nolan Ryan, who along with George Brett also will be
enshrined in Cooperstown this summer, told reporters last week. `I
can remember after his first at-bat thinking to myself, `That kid
hung in there. He wasn't intimidated.' That's what I found
throughout his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount surpassed the magical number of 3,000 hits, a figure that
basically guarantees election into the Hall of Fame. (Pete Rose,
who is banned from baseball, is the only eligible player with at
least 3,000 hits not in the Hall of Fame.)
</P>
<P>
   These days Yount basks in the fruits his career in the majors
brought and has his hands elbow-deep in his more deep-rooted
passion, auto racing.
</P>
<P>
   Yount and partners Bill Fickling and Dave Goadby own the P1
Racing Team. They have two cars on the Toyota Atlantic Racing
Series, which usually runs races just before big-time Indy-type
races in several cities.
</P>
<P>
   Yount is so involved in the venture that he spent all of last
summer attending each of the events. It's a rather expensive hobby,
but one Yount has been following since before he became a
big-league player. He spends his winters trying to attract sponsors
for the team's two cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything with an engine, I love,'' Yount said. ``I started
racing dirt bikes competitively when I was 13 and have been hooked
ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Yount spends time honing his 5 handicap in golf and
watching his four children grow up. Yount and his wife, Michele,
have been married for 25 years. One daughter, Melisa, is in
college; another, Amy, is a senior at Chaparral High, where son
Dustin is a sophomore. Another daughter, Jenna, is 10.
</P>
<P>
   Yount has spent time in the past helping the Chaparral High
baseball team, for which Dustin plays.
</P>
<P>
   On this occasion, Yount was helping publicize the fact
Leinenkugel's has begun selling its beer to other restaurants and
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he and his brother own 49 percent of the ballpark
brewery, Yount admitted he doesn't keep up with much on the
business side of the operation. The Younts came to own their shares
through a partnership when they amicably sold the land it and some
of the ballpark sits on.
</P>
<P>
   Yount remains involved in baseball and is a part-time instructor
in the Brewers organization, although mostly as a goodwill
ambassador for the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   He basically has an open invitation to join the organization in
any capacity he wants. If Yount wanted to manage the Brewers
tomorrow, the club's front office would make it possible.
</P>
<P>
   For now though, Yount sees far too many problems in the game to
want to return to Milwaukee, the only place he says he would work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready for that commitment just yet,'' said Yount, who
will play in the AT&AMP;T Pro-Am golf tournament next month. ``I don't
want to do it, just to do it. Plus, I don't like where baseball is
at right now, the imbalance the game has in place. There's only a
handful of competitive clubs right now, and that's not right. The
small-market teams are at a huge disadvantage. It's the biggest
problem baseball faces now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look back at last season, and by all accounts it was a
wonderful season. But all of it was centered around individual
achievements. There really were no pennant races. Take away the
things Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Kerry Wood and David Wells did,
and what are you left with? I never remember going to spring
training thinking we didn't have some kind of chance. There are too
many teams now that will go to spring training with no chance. The
game needs to be fixed.'' &QL;

USC'S KUKAL REACHES TOURNAMENT FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS _ No one expected Roman Kukal to reach the final.
Not his USC teammates and presumably not the National Collegiate
Tennis Classic officials, who spelled his name wrong in the
program: Kukai.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Dick Leach also has seen it misspelled ``Kuekl.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, USC tennis fans should know this sophomore from Slovakia.
He'll take to the Sherwood Country Club stadium court today at 1
p.m. and try to become the first Trojan since Brett Hansen four
years ago to win this prestigious early-season tournament
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The unseeded Kukal, who doesn't even play No.1 for the Trojans,
beat a pair of Stanford players Saturday. He dispatched
fifth-seeded freshman K.J. Hippensteel 6-1, 6-4 and outlasted
junior Geoff Abrams 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
   ``I played pretty well,'' he said. ``One of my best matches in
college tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day overall for the Trojans. The doubles team of
Ryan Moore and Nick Rainey upset top-seeded Jeff Laski and Gavin
Sontag of Illinois 9-7 to reach today's final.
</P>
<P>
   Kukal faces fourth-seeded Jean-Noel Grinda of UCLA. Grinda
knocked off top-seeded Ryan Wolters of Stanford 6-2, 2-6, 6-4. No
UCLA player has won this tournament since Nark Knowles in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kukal is known as a player who tries hard, but one who hasn't
yet won anything significant.
</P>
<P>
   After going 12-12 in singles last year as a No.3 and No.4, Kukal
failed to advance past the second round in his two fall
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   This was unfortunate _ because as a junior, Kukal was ranked
eighth in the world in singles and fourth in the world in doubles
by the International Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kukal has found his stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was making easy errors, and now he's not doing it,'' Leach
said. ``He's too good a player to have a .500 record. He's
concentrating so well and playing hard every point.''
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, Stanford freshman Marissa Irvin, the top
seed from Harvard-Westlake, breezed into the final with victories
over two serve-and-volley opponents. Irvin beat fifth-seeded Amy
Jensen of California 7-5, 6-3 and unseeded senior Annica Cooper of
UCLA 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   For Irvin, playing two serve-and-volley opponents like herself
was fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all like to serve tough and come to the net instead of
taking five hours to play,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It also was fun for Irvin because she and Cooper were roommates
at a U.S. Tennis Association camp in Florida five years ago. The
pair, although three years apart in age, shared tennis tales and
played pranks on other campers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember everyone thinking she was real quiet,'' Irvin said.
``But I was her roommate. She wasn't quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The two haven't seen each other since, but Irvin almost became
Cooper's college teammate. Irvin chose Stanford over UCLA, in part,
because ``(UCLA) is five minutes from home (she lives in Santa
Monica). It's nice to be five hours from home.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin faces Cal's Anita Kurimay, the third seed, in the final,
which is scheduled to begin after the men's championship. Kurimay
beat Irvin's doubles partner, Teryn Ashley, 6-3, 6-0.

RED STORM'S BACKCOURT LEADS WAY AT THE FINISH
</HEADLINE>
   ( nk ) 
 By   CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Facing an aggressive Rutgers team Saturday night, St.
John's got crucial performances from its poised backcourt and from
its enthusiastic sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm's starting backcourt of Bootsy Thornton (19
points) and Erick Barkley (15 points) made critical plays that kept
St. John's in front when Rutgers kept threatening in the second
half. And the sixth man, forward Lavor Postell, a junior, had a
season-high 21 points to go along with a key block and a key steal
in the final four minutes. The result was an 88-78 St. John's
victory before 10,689 people at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The victory extended the Red Storm's winning streak to three
games, all at the Garden, as St. John's improved to 15-3 overall
and 6-1 in the Big East. The 15-3 start, in coach Mike Jarvis's
first season at St. John's, is the school's best since a 15-3 start
in 1990-91. St. John's has won all 12 home games this year and 14
consecutive home games dating back to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, losing for the second time this season to St. John's,
fell to 10-6 over all and 3-4 in the Big East. But the outcome was
in doubt until the final minutes. St. John's led, 75-71, with four
minutes to play. Dahntay Jones of Rutgers was fouled on a drive,
but he missed both free throws. On the next possession, Thornton
was fouled on a drive, and he made one of two foul shots to give
the Red Storm a 76-71 lead with 3 minutes 49 seconds left. After a
time out, Geoff Billet of Rutgers was called for traveling, then
Thornton made a crucial 3-pointer from the top of the key to put
St. John's ahead, 79-71 with 2:42 left. Rutgers never seriously
threatened thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever it looked as if St. John's might take control earlier
in the game, Rutgers responded with a key basket, often by forward
Jeff Greer, a sophomore, who led all scorers with 23 points. And
with both teams playing an up-tempo style, baskets came in bunches.
The shot clock was hardly necessary for this game, because neither
team needed encouragement to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, the fast-paced game seemed to wear down Rutgers.
Barkley and Thornton picked up the backcourt pressure for St.
John's as the game wore on. Rutgers began to hurry its shots, and
the Red Storm forced several turnovers that led to easy baskets.
St. John's scored 22 points in the game off of 21 Rutgers
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With Barkley doing a solid job running the offense, St. John's
continued to get high-percentage shots, and St. John's had a major
advantage on the backboards, outrebounding Rutgers, 34-22. Ron
Artest had a solid all-round game for St. John's with 12 points, 12
rebounds and 6 assists, while Barkley added a game-high 7 assists.
</P>
<P>
   A well-played first half ended with St. John's leading, 42-37.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams entered the game missing key players. St. John's was
without Tyrone Grant (sprained right wrist), a 6-foot-7-inch senior
center who is one of the team's leaders. And Rutgers was without
Rashod Kent (hip pointer), its second-leading rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   However, both offenses looked in sync during a fast-paced first
20 minutes that was close throughout. Thornton had a strong first
half (11 points), and an 8-0 run just before intermission gave the
Red Storm its halftime edge.
</P>
<P>
   Long-range shooting has been a key for St. John's this season,
and it was again Saturday night. With Rutgers leading, 35-34,
Artest made a 17-foot jumper, then followed with a 3-pointer from
the deep right corner, followed by Barkley's 3-pointer from the top
of the key.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm was 6 for 12 from 3-point range during the first
half, and both Artest and Barkley are shooting better than 40
percent from behind the arc this year. But Rutgers also played the
first half with confidence. Greer led Rutgers with 10 first-half
points, and the Scarlet Knights had a balanced attack and moved the
ball crisply against St. John's man-to-man defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers had reason to feel good about its chances. In the
Scarlet Knights' first meeting this season with St. John's, on Jan.
2, they jumped to an early 14-point lead before Artest's 25-point
effort led St. John's to a comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the second half started Saturday night, the
Scarlet Knights were the team hoping they could put together a
comeback. And they played well enough in the first half to let St.
John's know that they were not simply going to lie down on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's next game is Wednesday at Providence, while Rutgers
will play host to Syracuse on Monday. &QL;

SCAMMING A GREAT GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The TV anchorman Tom Brokaw says anyone who came of age during
the Great Depression and World War II is a member in good standing
of the world's greatest generation. He wrote a book that says so
right on the cover. It's called ``The Greatest Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest generation _ isn't.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying it wasn't a pretty darn good generation. Maybe
even a great one. It certainly produced some of the greatest
individuals the nation has known.
</P>
<P>
   My mother and father, for example.
</P>
<P>
   And Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   And the Kennedy brother everybody still loves, even after the
revelations out about him and other women.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brokaw, though, these people and others represent
``the greatest generation any society has ever produced.''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   They don't.
</P>
<P>
   It's true they lived through a Depression. It's true they risked
and (in many cases) lost their lives saving the world from Hitler.
It's true they were responsible for creating enormous wealth and
shaping much of the modern world. But that's only part of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   While fighting for freedom in Europe, they put
Japanese-Americans in internment camps and kept Black soldiers in
segregated outfits. &QL; 
GENERATION'S FAILURES
</P>
<P>
   The pitchmen pushing Brokaw's book say this was a generation
``united not only by common purpose, but also by common values _
duty, honor, economy, courage, service, love of family and country,
and, above all, responsibility for oneself.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it was the kind of family where a mother's place was
``only'' in the home.
</P>
<P>
   And a country with few civil rights for people of color.
</P>
<P>
   This was a generation that staged the worst witch hunts since
Salem, ruining the reputations and even jailing some of its
greatest artistic and scientific minds because of an exaggerated
``red menace.''
</P>
<P>
   As for honor and duty, were these men and women greater than
those who fought in the Civil War? Were their economic and
technological advances more important than those of the Industrial
Revolution? Were their political leaders better than Lincoln?
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about history, though. It's about commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Why give the ``greatest generation`` title to people from the
1800s when none of them are around to buy books?
</P>
<P>
   And why hedge your bets?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Good Generation'' isn't sexy enough. ``The Great
Generation'' is better, but if you want big numbers, it's got to be
``The Greatest Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's working, too. It's selling.
</P>
<P>
   Although, you might not buy the part about this generation
believing ``above all'' in ``responsibility for oneself.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, they produced and are benefitting from one of the
largest socialist experiments ever conducted by a society. A series
of government-controlled programs offering health care, housing and
higher education for hundreds of thousands of former soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And then went to work for businesses that still collect billions
of dollars in corporate welfare. &QL; 
A CHUCKLE IN ITALY
</P>
<P>
   Outside the U.S., I'm guessing there are a few countries who
also might get a chuckle out of Brokaw's claim that this was ``the
greatest generation any society has ever produced.''
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, there once was a generation that included fellows
named da Vinci, Machiavelli and Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest generation had to come from the United States,
where it would get the greatest exposure. And reach the greatest
number of consumers. And engender the greatest sense of nostalgia.
And have the greatest chance of landing on the bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   All of which proves nothing about my parents and their peers,
but does show how the men and women who followed them, including
Brokaw, may in fact compose ``the greatest generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of shills. &QL;

`SPIRIT ALIVE IN THE LAND': UDALL PRAISED IN EULOGY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Morris Udall still walks among us, urging us to
follow him up the mountain, the former congressman's eulogists said
Saturday in a memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``His spirit is still alive in the land,'' said Stewart Udall, a
former Interior secretary and brother of the beloved Arizona
Democrat, known so well across America for his wit, his wisdom and
his wonderment at nature.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Udall died Dec. 12 in a Washington, D.C., hospital where
he had spent most of the past seven years. Udall, 76, suffered from
Parkinson's disease, which ended his three decades in Congress in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Udall was memorialized repeatedly on Saturday as a giant who not
only overcame adversity but pursued excellence in everything he
did.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what he often described as his 18th-century upbringing
in the isolated farming community of St. John's and the loss of his
right eye at age 7, Udall went on to become a professional
basketball player, an accomplished lawyer and prosecutor, and one
of the most prolific and popular politicians of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   One of his seven children, Anne Udall, asked the more than 1,500
people gathered at the University of Arizona's Centennial Hall to
build on her father's ideals of social and environmental justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``For each of us not to take the best of Dad . . . would be to
squander the legacy of Morris Udall.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with his advocacy for the environment, Udall was
remembered as a pioneer for civil rights, for campaign finance and
civil service reforms, and for his early opposition to the war in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   One of his sons, Rep. Mark Udall, D-Colo., recalled a speech
against the war the congressman delivered in the same auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``America isn't perfect,'' Mark Udall quoted his father, ``but
we're not done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., took a break from President Clinton's
impeachment trial to be at the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the most overlooked of Morris Udall's
accomplishments was his advocacy for American Indians.

JARRETT UPSETS NCAA SPRINT CHAMP
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Jarrett described himself as ``one of those
athletes who would have been, should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Jarrett, a 25-year-old sprinter at New York
Tech, got a wide-eyed look at what he still could be. He defeated
the National Collegiate Athletic Association 55-meter champion
Ja'Warren Hooker of the University of Washington in the 60-meter
dash, providing a stunning upset in the New York Sports Museum
Track and Field Invitational at the 169th Street Armory in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett later won the 200 meters on the Armory's new rubber
track in a sizzling 21.22 seconds, qualifying him for the NCAA
indoor championships in March.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett did not know who Hooker was until he heard his name and
his accomplishments over the public address system before their
semifinal heat: NCAA champion at 55 meters, third-place finisher in
the 100 meters. When Jarrett sped by an eased-up Hooker in the
heat, the feeling was that Hooker was merely playing possum.
</P>
<P>
   But the final unfolded the same way. Jarrett, a sinewy 6-foot-2,
burst from the blocks slightly ahead of the shorter Hooker and
never ceded ground. Jarrett finished in 6.73 seconds, making him a
provisional NCAA qualifier at that distance. Hooker's time was
6.77.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to cop out and say this is why I lost the
race,'' Hooker said of his lower left leg, which was heavily taped
to protect a shin splint. ``I ran well for 59 meters. He ran good
today. He beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   The question was who beat him? A laughing Jarrett acknowledged
that the query was a reasonable one. He won the state 100 and 200
meter titles in 1990 and 1991 while at Farmingdale High School on
Long Island, then ran with modest success at St. John's before
dropping out because of academic difficulties. He spent a year and
a half out of college before resurfacing at New York Tech, a
Division II school in Old Westbury. He was the Division II
100-meter champion last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the biggest accomplishment for me,'' said
Jarrett, who ran the second leg on Jamaica's fourth-place 400-meter
relay team at the Goodwill Games last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The other NCAA champions won as expected Saturday night. Carmen
Douma of Villanova, who won the indoor mile last year, captured the
mile in 4 minutes 51.65 seconds. Angie Brown of George Mason won
the long jump (19 feet 11{ inches), and Dominique Calloway, an
All-American from Ohio State, edged teammate Donika Merriman in the
60-meter hurdles (8.34).

PANTHERS SCORE FIRST AND ISLES, OF COURSE, FOLD THEIR TENT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ Frustration. That has become the Islanders'
byword, and Saturday night they received yet another dose of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Panthers, no juggernaut themselves, scored early and
made the lone goal hold up for a 1-0 victory before 19,097 at
National Car Rental Arena. And not long after the Panthers scored,
the Islanders' best player, defenseman Kenny Jonsson, was helped
from the ice after spraining his right knee. Jonsson, who will be
re-examined Sunday, could miss up to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The loss took the Islanders' streak without a victory to 10
games (0-9-1) and left them at 29 points, the second-lowest total
in the Eastern Conference. They lost all five games on their
current road trip, the last three by one goal each.
</P>
<P>
   They are now 0-24-1 when the opponent scores first.
</P>
<P>
   It was no consolation that the Islanders outshot their hosts,
27-19. The game ended with center Bryan Smolinski taking a
desperation 65-foot shot, which goalie Sean Burke stopped easily as
time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' star winger, Zigmund Palffy, was held without a
goal for his sixth straight game.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Islanders 4 minutes 47 seconds to launch their first
shot. They would get six more by the end of the first period, but
none took any special effort for Burke to turn away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Felix Potvin, starting his third straight game in
goal for the Islanders, was victimized by a deflection during a
Florida power play 12:23 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers center Rob Niedermayer shot from the left point, and
the puck bounded from Potvin's stick to where the veteran right
wing Dino Ciccarelli was looming. Ciccarelli jabbed a 5-footer into
the net's left corner as Potvin's momentum was carrying him away
from the shot.
</P>
<P>
   The goal gave Ciccarelli his 1,200th career point, making him
the 28th player in National Hockey League history to reach that
plateau.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was another exercise in futility, though this
time for both teams. The Islanders won the shot battle, 10-8, but
couldn't crack Burke, who came in with a respectable 2.57
goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors swarmed the net early in the period, but were
unable to finish the job once center Robert Reichel bumped into
Burke in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Near the midway point of the period, with the Islanders playing
short-handed, Palffy almost slipped a slap shot past Burke from the
left side. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   The liveliest action of the period came after the Panthers'
bullying defenseman Ed Jovanovski went headhunting with his
forearms, knocking Smolinski to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of shoving and shouts between the teams ensued, as the
crowd stoked the emotions with their yells.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Jovanovski was tagged with a two-minute roughing
penalty, but the Islanders managed two harmless shots on the
following power play.
</P>
<P>
   New York entered the game eighth over all in the league in power
play effectiveness, but that is deceiving because the Islanders
have been great on the power play at home and woeful on the road.
That form held up.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders came out with particular fire in the final period,
producing the first four shots and 9 of the first 10.
</P>
<P>
   Florida withstood that heat, and eventually the Islanders flamed
out.

RED STORM'S BACKCOURT LEADS WAY AT THE FINISH
</HEADLINE>
  
 refiling  ( nk ) 
 By   CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Facing an aggressive Rutgers team Saturday night, St.
John's got crucial performances from its poised backcourt and from
its enthusiastic sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm's starting backcourt of Bootsy Thornton (19
points) and Erick Barkley (15 points) made critical plays that kept
St. John's in front when Rutgers kept threatening in the second
half. And the sixth man, forward Lavor Postell, a junior, had a
season-high 21 points to go along with a key block and a key steal
in the final four minutes. The result was an 88-78 St. John's
victory before 10,689 people at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The victory extended the Red Storm's winning streak to three
games, all at the Garden, as St. John's improved to 15-3 overall
and 6-1 in the Big East. The 15-3 start, in coach Mike Jarvis's
first season at St. John's, is the school's best since a 15-3 start
in 1990-91. St. John's has won all 12 home games this year and 14
consecutive home games dating back to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, losing for the second time this season to St. John's,
fell to 10-6 over all and 3-4 in the Big East. But the outcome was
in doubt until the final minutes. St. John's led, 75-71, with four
minutes to play. Dahntay Jones of Rutgers was fouled on a drive,
but he missed both free throws. On the next possession, Thornton
was fouled on a drive, and he made one of two foul shots to give
the Red Storm a 76-71 lead with 3 minutes 49 seconds left. After a
time out, Geoff Billet of Rutgers was called for traveling, then
Thornton made a crucial 3-pointer from the top of the key to put
St. John's ahead, 79-71 with 2:42 left. Rutgers never seriously
threatened thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever it looked as if St. John's might take control earlier
in the game, Rutgers responded with a key basket, often by forward
Jeff Greer, a sophomore, who led all scorers with 23 points. And
with both teams playing an up-tempo style, baskets came in bunches.
The shot clock was hardly necessary for this game, because neither
team needed encouragement to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, the fast-paced game seemed to wear down Rutgers.
Barkley and Thornton picked up the backcourt pressure for St.
John's as the game wore on. Rutgers began to hurry its shots, and
the Red Storm forced several turnovers that led to easy baskets.
St. John's scored 22 points in the game off of 21 Rutgers
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With Barkley doing a solid job running the offense, St. John's
continued to get high-percentage shots, and St. John's had a major
advantage on the backboards, outrebounding Rutgers, 34-22. Ron
Artest had a solid all-round game for St. John's with 12 points, 12
rebounds and 6 assists, while Barkley added a game-high 7 assists.
</P>
<P>
   A well-played first half ended with St. John's leading, 42-37.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams entered the game missing key players. St. John's was
without Tyrone Grant (sprained right wrist), a 6-foot-7-inch senior
center who is one of the team's leaders. And Rutgers was without
Rashod Kent (hip pointer), its second-leading rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   However, both offenses looked in sync during a fast-paced first
20 minutes that was close throughout. Thornton had a strong first
half (11 points), and an 8-0 run just before intermission gave the
Red Storm its halftime edge.
</P>
<P>
   Long-range shooting has been a key for St. John's this season,
and it was again Saturday night. With Rutgers leading, 35-34,
Artest made a 17-foot jumper, then followed with a 3-pointer from
the deep right corner, followed by Barkley's 3-pointer from the top
of the key.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm was 6 for 12 from 3-point range during the first
half, and both Artest and Barkley are shooting better than 40
percent from behind the arc this year. But Rutgers also played the
first half with confidence. Greer led Rutgers with 10 first-half
points, and the Scarlet Knights had a balanced attack and moved the
ball crisply against St. John's man-to-man defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers had reason to feel good about its chances. In the
Scarlet Knights' first meeting this season with St. John's, on Jan.
2, they jumped to an early 14-point lead before Artest's 25-point
effort led St. John's to a comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the second half started Saturday night, the
Scarlet Knights were the team hoping they could put together a
comeback. And they played well enough in the first half to let St.
John's know that they were not simply going to lie down on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's next game is Wednesday at Providence, while Rutgers
will play host to Syracuse on Monday. &QL;

JARRETT UPSETS NCAA SPRINT CHAMP
</HEADLINE>
 
refiling  (nk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Jarrett described himself as ``one of those
athletes who would have been, should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Jarrett, a 25-year-old sprinter at New York
Tech, got a wide-eyed look at what he still could be. He defeated
the National Collegiate Athletic Association 55-meter champion
Ja'Warren Hooker of the University of Washington in the 60-meter
dash, providing a stunning upset in the New York Sports Museum
Track and Field Invitational at the 169th Street Armory in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett later won the 200 meters on the Armory's new rubber
track in a sizzling 21.22 seconds, qualifying him for the NCAA
indoor championships in March.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett did not know who Hooker was until he heard his name and
his accomplishments over the public address system before their
semifinal heat: NCAA champion at 55 meters, third-place finisher in
the 100 meters. When Jarrett sped by an eased-up Hooker in the
heat, the feeling was that Hooker was merely playing possum.
</P>
<P>
   But the final unfolded the same way. Jarrett, a sinewy 6-foot-2,
burst from the blocks slightly ahead of the shorter Hooker and
never ceded ground. Jarrett finished in 6.73 seconds, making him a
provisional NCAA qualifier at that distance. Hooker's time was
6.77.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to cop out and say this is why I lost the
race,'' Hooker said of his lower left leg, which was heavily taped
to protect a shin splint. ``I ran well for 59 meters. He ran good
today. He beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   The question was who beat him? A laughing Jarrett acknowledged
that the query was a reasonable one. He won the state 100 and 200
meter titles in 1990 and 1991 while at Farmingdale High School on
Long Island, then ran with modest success at St. John's before
dropping out because of academic difficulties. He spent a year and
a half out of college before resurfacing at New York Tech, a
Division II school in Old Westbury. He was the Division II
100-meter champion last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the biggest accomplishment for me,'' said
Jarrett, who ran the second leg on Jamaica's fourth-place 400-meter
relay team at the Goodwill Games last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The other NCAA champions won as expected Saturday night. Carmen
Douma of Villanova, who won the indoor mile last year, captured the
mile in 4 minutes 51.65 seconds. Angie Brown of George Mason won
the long jump (19 feet 11{ inches), and Dominique Calloway, an
All-American from Ohio State, edged teammate Donika Merriman in the
60-meter hurdles (8.34).

MONTREAL STILL HAS RANGERS' NUMBER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Midway through the third period Saturday night, Wayne
Gretzky picked up a loose puck behind the Montreal Canadiens' goal
without a defender near him. As he looked left and right for an
opening, the sold-out crowd at the Molson Center was anticipating
something special.
</P>
<P>
   But the opening never came for Gretzky, and when he finally
unloaded the puck to Jeff Beukeboom, it presented little threat. It
was about as dangerous as the Rangers appeared all night. By the
time this chance passed, the chants of Rangers fans in the upper
decks had changed from, ``Let's go Rangers'' to ``Jets, Jets,
Jets.'' The fans would save their breath for another day.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers (17-19-7) succumbed to the Canadiens with little
fight, 3-0. The loss was the Rangers' second in two nights,
dropping them into a tie with the Canadiens, 4 points behind the
Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins for the final playoff berth
in the Eastern Conference. For the Canadiens (17-20-7), the victory
was their third in three tries against the Rangers this season.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was particularly disheartening after the Rangers fell,
3-1, on Friday night to a Chicago Blackhawks team that had not won
in its seven previous games. If that was supposed to wake the
Rangers up, they slept in, falling behind early and never posing a
threat. In the third period, trailing by 2-0 until an empty-net
goal by Vincent Damphousse in the final seconds, the Rangers had
just three shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it was Jocelyn Thibault who stymied them. Saturday,
it was Jeff Hackett, who recorded a shutout on Friday night in
Washington, his first since joining the Canadiens on Nov. 16, and
followed it with another by stopping 17 Rangers shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had surrendered goals on the first shot three times
in their last four games. This time they were able to avert that
problem as Dan Cloutier (29 saves) withstood four shots in the
opening two minutes. Still, the Rangers found themselves playing
from behind when the Canadiens made quick work of their first
power-play opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' Chris Tamer was sent off for cross-checking at 7
minutes 31 seconds of the first period. On the ensuing faceoff,
Saku Koivu beat Petr Nedved to the puck, sending it to Brian
Savage, who fed Vladimir Malakhov at the point. Malakhov fired a
shot from just inside the blue line, beating Cloutier to his glove
side, three seconds into the power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had their chances in the period, but just as they
had in the final minutes of Friday night's loss to the Blackhawks,
they could not take advantage. On Friday, Gretzky had had a pair of
point-blank chances, but could not convert. Saturday, Manny
Malhotra, Mike Knuble and Scott Fraser had shots from close range
that Hackett stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Rangers not score on their only power play in
the period, but they also nearly gave away a goal when Nedved
chased down the puck behind the Rangers' net. But he tossed his
stick, which was broken, along the boards and left the puck, which
was picked up by the Canadiens, feeding Patrick Poulin alone just
outside the crease. Cloutier came up with a glove save, and the
Rangers went to the locker room trailing by just one goal at the
first intermission.

LEGACY LIVES ON IN KING'S SON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB PETRIE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not easy being a King.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin Luther King III says he's doing the best he can to
carry on his father's name and legacy of making America freer of
poverty, racism and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never focused on trying to be my father. I know I can't be
that,'' King said Saturday during an interview at Tempe's first
official Martin Luther King Jr. holiday celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I can do is work toward my own dream, to make sure
his dream is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
King works to fight a more subtle form of racism, far from the days
of Jim Crow and the basic civil rights his father fought for in
freedom marches across the South decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, King says, the SCLC, co-founded in 1957 by his father,
works with corporations accused of not fairly treating minority
customers or workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to create opportunities for everyone that may
be excluded from participating in the vast wealth we have to
offer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   King also makes about 100 appearances a year, including the
Tempe stop. He spoke to a crowd of about 1,200 people, warmed up by
a rousing gospel music performance by the River of Life Church in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He also was the keynote speaker at a dinner Saturday evening to
celebrate Tempe's diversity, which attracted a sellout crowd of
300.
</P>
<P>
   King began his day with a museum tour of a traveling display of
black and white prints taken during the height of the civil rights
struggle in the 1950s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   They were highlighted by stark photos of his father's April 1968
murder, the blood on the hotel balcony, and the riots in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   King was paid $12,000 for his Tempe appearance, which city
officials said came from corporate sponsors, not taxpayers.
Sponsors included ``The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was well into the festive atmosphere, which also
included dance performances, food booths, and arts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful celebration and it's a celebration that
exemplifies what Dr. King stood for,'' said LaVerne DaCosta of
Mesa, an ASU student. ``I'm glad to see Tempe taking a step and
being part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempe resident Tanya Moulton called the elder King a
compassionate man who was ahead of his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he were still alive today,'' she said, ``to help guide
the youth today.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger King was 10 when his father was shot and killed
outside Room 306 of the Lorraine Motel, while working on behalf of
striking sanitation workers in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of America, he learned of the shooting on TV, and
remembered the immediate sorrow ``of losing a father and not
knowing what was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were prepared as much as we could be for children (for his
father's death),'' King said. ``We were at a certain point where we
knew what our father was doing was dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   King said he marvels at what his father did to break down the
seemingly impenetrable walls of hard-core racism, when it wasn't
the popular thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was criticized for what he did,'' he said. ``Most
people say they love him now, but during his lifetime they
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   How Dr. King did it was so simple, yet so complex, given the
sentiment of the times, his son explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took the law of the land, the Constitution, the Declaration
of Independence, and applied it to all people,'' King said. ``He
took the English language and used it in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who worked with Phoenix civil rights activists in 1992 on
successful passage of an official state King holiday, says Arizona
seems to have come a long way to recognize and celebrate diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always going to be individuals who are not going to
embrace the holiday,'' he said. ``But this means there'll be much
more work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. Day is Monday. &QL;

 (ATTN: Calif., Va.)  (Eds: UPDATES grafs 3 and 4 with Jones pleading not guilty at
arraignment, bail set.) 
 (DW) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A cousin riding with a well-known rapper in the
Wu-Tang Clan has agreed to become a witness in connection with a
shooting involving the performer and police officers, law
enforcement officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper, Russell Jones, who alternately goes by the stage
names Ol' Dirty Bastard and Big Baby Jesus, was arrested in
Brooklyn about 8 p.m. Friday, shortly after the police said he
fired at officers in who had chased a car Jones was driving.
</P>
<P>
   Jones pleaded not guilty Saturday night to charges of attempted
murder of a police officer, aggravated assault and possession of a
weapon, according to Patrick B. Clark, a spokesman for the Brooklyn
District Attorney's Office. Judge Jo Ann Ferdinand set bail at
$150,000 and ordered Jones to appear in court again on Jan. 21. He
could face life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the shootout took place after officers in an
unmarked police car saw Jones, 29, driving his 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe
erratically, with his headlights off, after he left the United
Kingdom Studios in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to stop him but when the plainclothes officers neared
the car and identified themselves, Jones fired two shots at the
officers, who returned his fire, Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a
Police Department spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle sped off, then stopped several blocks away, and
Jones's cousin, Frederick Cuffie, the only other person in the
vehicle, jumped from the car and ran, police said. Jones was
arrested as he got out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Cuffie, 37, was arrested about 11 p.m. after officers found him
in a nearby building. No weapon was recovered, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cuffie had also faced attempted-murder charges, those
charges were dropped when he became a witness for the prosecution,
according to a law enforcement official speaking on the condition
of anonymity. ``He has stated that Jones knew these were police
officers and that they wanted him to stop,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's confrontation was the latest incident involving
Jones, who has survived two shootings. In September, he was
arrested and accused of threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend in
Los Angeles, and in November he was arrested after the police said
he threatened security guards at a blues club there, according to
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Jones stormed the stage of the Grammy Awards at Radio City Music
Hall last year, seizing a microphone to complain about losing in
the best rap-album category.

FALCONS' REEVES HAS HEART OF A CHAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
SUWANEE, Ga. _ When Dan Reeves was hired two years ago by the
Atlanta Falcons, some suspected the spirit of the NFL's winningest
active coach might not be equal to the challenge. Rebuilding the
turmoil-scarred Falcons was a job for a younger man, they thought.
They worried that Reeves was a discouraged and burned-out veteran
returning to his home state with an eye on retirement.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Obviously, they didn't know him well enough.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves not only is putting his heart into his work, he has
resurrected the Falcons from the scrap heap to the brink of the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Although still somewhat feeble from his quadruple-bypass surgery
only five weeks ago, Reeves, who will be 55 on Tuesday, will be a
commanding presence when he walks the sideline in today's NFC
Championship Game at Minnesota. He had the attention of his players
before. He has their admiration now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's willing to risk having a heart attack for us,'' Atlanta
defensive end Chuck Smith said. ``Compared to that, playing
football is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves demands from his players preparation, dedication,
truthfulness and strict adherence to football fundamentals. He
expects no less from himself. Those values plus a series of
fortuitous roster moves explain the Falcons' quick turnaround, team
members say.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds familiar, perhaps it should.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Dan Reeves is Dan Reeves is because of Tom
Landry,'' said Dr. Charles Harrison, the team's physician for the
past 32 years. ``He's a Tom Landry clone.''
</P>
<P>
   In Reeves' eyes, that is the ultimate compliment. For the love
of the game Former Cowboys head coach Tom Landry took a chance on
Reeves first as a player and later as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves set 10 school records as a South Carolina quarterback,
but wasn't among the 400 players drafted by the NFL. Scouts
considered him too small and slow. The Cowboys signed him in 1965
as a free agent, and as usual, he did what it took to play and
succeed. He still hates the word ``overachiever,'' perhaps because
the term so frequently has been used to describe him.
</P>
<P>
   He became a running back, and in his second season his 16
touchdowns set a team record that stood until Emmitt Smith broke it
in 1992. The next year, he accounted for Dallas' only offensive
touchdown in the legendary ``Ice Bowl'' game in Green Bay, throwing
a 50-yard halfback pass to Lance Rentzel.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves blew out his knee in 1968, lost his starting job the next
year to Calvin Hill, and began to think about life after football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my career was coming to an end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Landry didn't cut or trade Reeves. Instead, he offered
him a promotion of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured Dan would make a good coach,'' Landry said this
week. ``He was a fierce competitor, and he had a great knowledge of
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, between the '69 and '70 seasons, Landry asked Reeves to
become a player-coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never even thought about coaching,'' Reeves recalls. ``But
I thought, gosh, this would be a good way I could still play. I
hadn't heard about teams cutting any coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Reeves enjoyed his dual role with the Cowboys.
However, his enthusiasm waned in 1971 when he supervised running
backs and had to deal with the uncooperative Duane Thomas, whose
talent was exceeded only by his sour personality. The silent
treatment Thomas gave the media extended to teammates and coaches,
Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   After a frustrating 1972 season _ an injury to Roger Staubach
forced Reeves into the role of backup QB behind Craig Morton _ he
walked away from the sport.
</P>
<P>
   For a year, he worked in Dallas real estate and developed
townhouses. He liked being at home with his family instead of
spending six weeks each summer at training camp in Thousand Oaks,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I felt like a duck out of water,'' he said. ``Somebody
wanted to talk to me about real estate, I had no answers. Somebody
talked to me about football, at least I felt comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I really realized how much \Rfootball\S meant to
me. I figured I wouldn't have to deal with as many problems. But I
learned that everywhere you go, you've got problems to handle.
Building a hundred townhouses, I had a hundred Duane Thomases to
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry took Reeves back in 1974 as special teams coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I knew what my focus was, that I wanted to coach,''
Reeves said. ``So I really paid more attention to details and tried
to learn everything I could, how to be a good assistant but also
trying to see how you did things as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I couldn't have learned from anybody any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his dozen years as head coach at Denver, Reeves took
the Broncos to three Super Bowls. He lost each time, but previously
earned Super Bowl rings with Landry's Dallas Cowboys as a player in
January 1972, and as an assistant coach and offensive coordinator
in January 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he had the chance to move on to Denver \Rin 1980\S, I
knew he would be successful,'' Landry says. ``He knew the job that
had to be done and he always did it well, probably better than any
coach I ever had.'' Up from the ground This season began as the
most fulfilling of Reeves' coaching lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, he came to Atlanta as damaged goods. His successful
tenure with the Broncos ended after an 8-8 season in 1992 when he
and John Elway couldn't agree on offensive philosophy. He became
the NFL's Coach of the Year _ an award he also won this year _ in
1993 with the New York Giants, then was replaced after losing teams
in 1995 and 1996 when he disagreed with owner Wellington Mara and
then-general manager George Young over authority in personnel
matters.
</P>
<P>
   The late Falcons owner Rankin Smith Sr. passed a chance to hire
Reeves in 1977 in favor of Leeman Bennett. Two decades later, he
didn't let Reeves get away again.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, a native of Americus, Ga., came home in 1997 and was
given the keys to the team. He was named head coach and executive
vice president of football operations. With full authority, Reeves
wasted no time shaking the tree.
</P>
<P>
   He scrapped previous coach June Jones' outdated run-and-shoot
offense. He signed 22 free agents in his first two years, six that
are now starters; in the three years prior to his arrival, the
Falcons signed four. He drafted four more starters, and traded for
journeyman quarterback Chris Chandler and receiver Tony Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get enough credit for his administrative
abilities,'' said current Dallas head coach Chan Gailey, who served
under Reeves in Denver, grew up in Americus and once was coached by
Reeves in Little League baseball. ``Dan makes good decisions from
top to bottom in an organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves made changes upon changes, but made them the right way
and for the right reasons, say his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood what he had to do, but he didn't come in here
and start hammering on people,'' said defensive end Smith. ``We had
some players who could contribute, and he saw that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves also instilled a new code of discipline, and went to work
mending bad attitudes that had festered through 26 losing seasons
in 31 years of the Falcons' existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a perfect marriage,'' agreed wide receiver Terance
Mathis. Surviving a scare Of course, it looked like the old days
when the Falcons lost seven of their first eight games under Reeves
last season.
</P>
<P>
   But since that point, Atlanta has won 21 of 25 games, tied with
Denver for best in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was on top of the world last month as the Falcons
approached their second-ever NFC West title. For a coach who was
burned out, his team suddenly was burning up the league. Jamal
Anderson ranked second in the NFL in rushing behind only Denver's
Terrell Davis. Chandler, who had been played for five other teams,
ranked fourth in the league in pass rating.
</P>
<P>
   And Reeves felt lousy. There was this nagging matter of a
burning sensation in his chest and the back of his throat, which
worsened under game-day stress.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't tell anyone. He had undergone angioplasty procedures
in August 1990 and January 1991 to clear arteries, and bounced back
in three or four days each time. After the season, he reasoned,
he'd go in and have another one done.
</P>
<P>
   The burning in his chest became worse, though, after the
Falcons' 27-17 victory on Dec. 13 against New Orleans in the
Superdome. On the plane home, he confided in Dr. Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 the next morning, Reeves was on his back at Piedmont
Hospital in Atlanta, where dye tests showed serious blockages in
his heart arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another day and this could have been fatal,'' Harrison said.
``He was that close.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and a second doctor advised Reeves and his wife, Pam,
that immediate quadruple bypass surgery was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote was three to one in favor,'' Harrison said. ``I don't
have to tell you who the one was.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves underwent a four-hour operation in which veins from the
inside of his legs and from behind his chest muscles were used to
bypass the blockages. When he awakened and the breathing tube was
removed, his first words were to inquire about the severity of the
knee injury his fullback, Bob Christian, suffered the day before.
Christian's injury was season-ending, but Reeves wasn't told. True
grit Reeves returned to the hospital with an irregular heartbeat
shortly after the surgery, but by last week's NFC semifinal against
the San Francisco 49ers, he was roaming the sideline again. His
manner was deliberate, and his quick comeback seemed risky, but
keeping him down might have been even more stressful.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is the same man who continued to play football
despite five knee surgeries in his 20s, and who cried when his
Americus high school coach wouldn't let him play with a pin in his
broken collarbone. The coach ultimately relented, and Reeves bent
the pin.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate stress test, he had admitted before the 49ers game,
would be a blown official's call.
</P>
<P>
   He got a doozy, when an apparent Atlanta fumble return for a
touchdown was negated, and the ball was given back to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happened, he was the first person I thought about,''
Mathis said. ``I sat there on the bench watching him the whole
time. He was moving back and forth, and his blood was really
boiling, and right behind him the doctor was moving back and forth
with him. Everybody was watching them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he got through that,'' said Dr. Harrison, ``then he's
passed the test.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Falcons prepared last week for today's test against the
Vikings, Reeves spoke to Landry and Gailey by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling Coach Landry about how similar the things I'm
doing here are to the things he used to do,'' Reeves said after
Wednesday's practice. ``Naturally, I've changed some of those
things that if you'd been in charge you'd like to have tried. But
there were very few of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, this season has been a totally different
experience. It was the most rewarding season I'd ever gone through,
and then all of a sudden I'm an outsider looking in. When you watch
your team battling for a division championship from an ICU unit,
that doesn't happen many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' voice cracked with emotion, but only for an instant. He
quickly was back in charge and headed toward the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Burnout? A kinder, gentler Reeves? Don't tell his players that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see him on the sideline when things go wrong?'' Anderson
said. ``Heart or no heart, I don't care. He's a great guy, but you
don't relax. Remember, he's the guy \Rwho\S cut Phil Simms.''

TESTAVERDE FINALLY LIVING UP TO EARLY HYPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. _ It has taken 12 years, six head coaches, and
four cities that groaned with each of his gut-wrenching
interceptions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet Vinny Testaverde, who joined the NFL in 1987 with a Heisman
Trophy in tow, is finally living up to the expectations afforded a
former No. 1 draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has shaken off his reputation as a mistake-prone
quarterback to lead the New York Jets (13-4) to their biggest game
in 30 years. Whether or not Vinny and the Jets upset the defending
Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos (15-2) in today's AFC
Championship Game, the 35-year-old native New Yorker considers this
his ``dream season.'' It is a season in which he has rehabilitated
his career under the leadership of head coach Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me a lot of my father in that he's very
demanding,'' Testaverde said. ``I'd only seen coach Parcells from
TV and seeing what he says in the paper. You always see him on game
day with that mean looking face of his and never smiling much. I'll
tell you what, I knew that after meeting with him the first time
that I wanted to play for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Parcells: ``What Vinny has given us is just too much to
have hoped for.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells didn't expect much from Testaverde. After all,
Testaverde had a .367 career winning percentage (48-83-1) in 11
previous seasons. The only thing worse was his ghastly
touchdown-to-interception ratio (175-183). Thus, when Parcells
signed Testaverde last June following his release from the
Baltimore Ravens, it was to back up promising 27-year-old Glenn
Foley, whose career record was 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hoped to get a guy that maybe we could use as a
quarterback if we needed to,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Foley has become a footnote in the Jets' remarkable
season. Testaverde started _ and won _ the third and fourth games
as Foley sat with a rib injury. Testaverde was named the starter
for good in Week 7 after Foley's 5-for-15 performance in a 30-10
loss the previous week against the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly able to pass to Pro Bowl wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson
or hand off to 1,000-yard running back Curtis Martin, Testaverde
began playing like everyone thought he would when he came out of
the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He posted a 12-1 record as a starter and led the Jets to their
first division title since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. He was named
to his second Pro Bowl. He completed 61.5 percent of his passes for
3,256 yards with a club-record 29 touchdowns and only seven
interceptions. His passer rating of 101.6 was second in the league
behind Minnesota's Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is such a different quarterback from when he was in Tampa
Bay and I was in Detroit,'' Broncos cornerback Ray Crockett said.
``He's playing in a controlled system where he doesn't have to go
out and make a great play all the time. He doesn't have to be Brett
Favre. He can just walk the ball up the field and let the other
guys work for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde did not have that luxury in Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers
had no offensive Pro Bowlers and only one 1,000-yard rusher in
Testaverde's six seasons there. Often, he was asked to win games by
himself. He rarely succeeded. He threw 35 interceptions in 1988,
the second highest single-season total in league history.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers finally grew tired of Testaverde and did not
re-sign him following the 1992 season. He played three seasons in
Cleveland and two more in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   As the talent around Testaverde improved, so did his
performance. He had 77 touchdowns and 112 interceptions in Tampa
Bay. He had 98 touchdowns and 71 interceptions with the Browns and
Ravens. In 1994, Testaverde led the Browns to an 11-5 record and a
victory over the Parcells-led Patriots in an AFC wild-card game.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells studied Testaverde on film, particularly his days in
Cleveland and Baltimore. He noticed Testaverde's problems came when
he tried to force the ball deep downfield, and when he tried to
scramble. When Parcells signed Testaverde last summer, he stressed
the importance of being smart with the ball, and the importance of
utilizing his tight ends and running backs.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde responded with the lowest interception total (seven)
of his career in seasons with at least six starts. Today,
Testaverde will take with him lessons learned from a career that
has hardened his resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting off the year as a backup I certainly didn't expect
what has taken place to this point,'' Testaverde said. ``I think
you go through highs and lows as a player. But I've always had
confidence in my work habits and my preparation. I knew if I
continued to work hard, someday I'd have an opportunity. It
probably came sooner than I thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   But not too soon for the Jets. (Kevin Lyons writes for the Fort

THANKS TO PARCELLS, JETS HAVE A CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
DENVER _ By most expert accounts, the Tuna boat stops here.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here at the Denver Broncos' eternal Love-In. Here at the John
Elway Two-Minute Miraclefest and Farewell Party. Here at Mile High
Stadium, where the local papers have been filled all week with
quotes from the players, exhorting an always-ear-rattling crowd to
yell even louder.
</P>
<P>
   If you're measuring bad karma, in other words, the New York Jets
would already be trailing by two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Except the Jets hold the day's one trump card. He is their
ticket to Miami. He is their Shanahan, their Elway, their
crowd-muzzler, their entire raison d'etre on this threshold to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, alias the Big Tuna, is all that and two Super
Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   You can count up the open-heart surgeries, the asthma fields and
the West Coast Offenses, and Parcells would still be the one coach
whose presence makes the dream all seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, the Jets don't have the horses to get past
the home-field Broncos today. But they do have the Tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is trying to do something no head coach has ever done
before _ take three different organizations to the Super Bowl. Not
Tom Landry, nor Bill Walsh, nor Jimmy Johnson has ever done that.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the Jets' astounding turnaround from a
1-15 season just two years ago. But the New England Patriots were
2-14 and foundering, too, when the Tuna took them over. And the
first Giants team that Parcells coached, 1983, began its Super Bowl
drive with a 3-12-1 season.
</P>
<P>
   Some pro football teams search forever for that combination,
that one coach who can turn their Gatorade into wine and finally
align the franchise planets. Parcells has done it, packed it away,
and then done it again and again.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, a franchise that played literally and figuratively in
the shadow of the NFC Giants, made the fateful decision in 1997
that Parcells was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots owner Bob Kraft's ego and Parcells' large footprint
made for an uncomfortable fit. But a vindictive Kraft charged the
Jets with tampering. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue had to resolve the
dispute and award the compensation.
</P>
<P>
   It included the Jets' No. 2 pick in 1998 and their No. 1 choice
in 1999, a veritable ransom considering that Kraft no longer wanted
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, however, is old news. Parcells jumped, and no one has
heard Jets owner Leon Hess complain since.
</P>
<P>
   No one has heard Hess, period, in fact, because it is the Big
Tuna who is captain of this ship. Parcells makes all the personnel
decisions _ the draft picks, the free agent signings, the daily
sift through the waiver wire.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in the league does it better.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells scoured the NFL dumpster and found linebacker Bryan
Cox, who had been abandoned as a ticking hot-air bomb. Parcells
also sent a lifeboat to greet fullback Keith Byars, safety Corwin
Brown and, in the most celebrated resurrection, quarterback Vinny
Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde had been cut by the Baltimore Ravens. He once threw
35 interceptions in a single season. When you ask him now, Parcells
says he just had a feeling that Broadway Vinny ``would fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time you hear a coach or owner whine about how the salary
cap and free agency have eaten away at their franchise, remind them
how Parcells rebuilt the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, first of all,'' Parcells told reporters two weeks ago,
``I didn't start with a $35-million cornerback.''
</P>
<P>
   He's talking about you, Owner Jones. But we digress.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Todd Burger left the Chicago Bears to the accompaniment of
shrugs from line coach Tony Wise. With the Jets, he is the starting
left guard. Likewise, Parcells needed a center, and so he signed
free agent Kevin Mawae from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells tells interviewers about something his old friend, Gene
`Stick' Michaels, the former general manager of the New York
Yankees, told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about getting a superstar here or there,'' Parcells
said. ``It's about putting your team together so that your needs
are met, not the public's needs and not the media's needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the signing of Testaverde has prompted the most epistles
in the Jets' turnaround season, the deal that defined Parcells was
the signing of running back Curtis Martin. He had been the legs
upon which Parcells and the Patriots ran to Super Bowl XXXI.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin was a restricted free agent, which meant he not only
cost the Jets a five-year, $26-million contract, but also their No.
1 and No. 3 picks in last year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Mike Holmgren (as of last week) and maybe Jimmy
Johnson, there may not be another coach in the league who would
have the guts to go to his owner with that.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 38 of the 53 players on the Jets roster have been added
since Parcells inherited the team. Of the 22 starters on offense
and defense, 14 were brought in by Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1-15 to the conference championship game in two years _
teams aren't supposed to do that,'' Jets receiver Keyshawn Johnson
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a tribute to the guy who has put it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the din of today's crowd, the ``guy'' is the one factor
that most teases us to think the New York Jets have a chance. He is
their builder. He is their meal ticket.
</P>
<P>

NBA NOTES COLUMN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a tree falls in a forest with no one around, is the noise
loud?
</P>
<P>
   If an NBA team wins a championship without Michael Jordan
around, is the title valid?
</P>
<P>
   While the league's individual players begin the impossible task
of becoming the Air-Apparent, 28 rejuvenated teams will fight for
the scraps Jordan left behind. Not only his worldwide legion of
fans, but also the championship trophy he hogged for six of the
past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a quiet voice inside everyone saying, `Fine, now
there's a chance,' '' said Miami Heat coach Pat Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a championship, you get a championship _ whether it's
with him or without him,'' added Indiana Pacers point guard Mark
Jackson, whose team lost to Jordan's Bulls in Game 7 of the Eastern
Conference Finals last summer. ``Everybody's path becomes easier
without him. He's been a headache to a lot of teams for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   With its greatest player gone and its greatest fear realized,
the NBA will kneel in forgiveness to fans, duct-tape together a
shortened 50-game schedule and likely crown an asterisked champion
other than the Bulls for the first time since 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty games is more credible than, say, 35, but you could say
it's not a full-blown championship unless you play 82,'' said Utah
Jazz owner Larry Miller. ``But if we win it, I may feel
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan gone and the Bulls' decade-long dynasty soon to
crumble with the expected departure of Scottie Pippen, the road to
the '99 title is suddenly crowded with optimistic contenders.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, the Pacers are the favorite to reach the Finals.
They have all their key players signed and have been the only team
to consistently practice together during the lockout. In
Washington, coach Bernie Bickerstaff said his players looked so out
of shape that he's considering three-a-day practices. And in
Milwaukee, the Bucks had exactly zero players show up at their
training facility last week.
</P>
<P>
   Before the frenzied free-agent bonanza begins this week, the
Jazz and Lakers appear prepared to return to the Western Conference
Finals. Each team has 10 players under contract and no key free
agents other than L.A.'s Rick Fox. Houston, courting Pippen and
Antonio McDyess, could join the favorites. The Suns, meanwhile,
have only five players signed, and the Clippers will play at least
until mid-February without No. 1 overall pick Michael Olowokandi,
who is in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that the championship used to go through
Chicago,'' said Lakers guard Eddie Jones, whose team was swept 4-0
by the Jazz last May. ``But now, I think it's us.''
</P>
<P>
   Minus 32 games, teams will essentially start 16-16 when the
season starts Feb. 5, 6 or 7. History shows that shortened seasons
can produce more competitive games, and wacky results.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball lost 54 games in '81, and wound up with the team with
the best overall record (Cincinnati Reds) not making the postseason
because it took the division winners from a first and second half.
Football in '82 lost seven games and saw the Washington Redskins
win the Super Bowl despite missing the playoffs the previous five
seasons. Even the St. Louis Cardinals made those playoffs. Hockey
in '95 lost 30 games and saw the New Jersey Devils make and win
their only Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   This must be good news for the Mavericks, who have 10 players
under contract and haven't made the playoffs the past eight
seasons. If nothing else, the mini-season should keep the Mavericks
from finishing 30 games out of first place in the Midwest Division,
something they've done six times in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it starts, it's going to be ugly, real ugly,'' said
Orlando Magic guard Nick Anderson. ``Who knows what's going to
happen? Guys tried to stay in shape, but no one is used to being
away from basketball this long. And two weeks in training camp
isn't going to suddenly put people back in top shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Magic forward Horace Grant, ``You've heard of Abbott and
Costello? Well, that might be what it looks like at the start.''
</P>
<P>
   So not only may the season be hideous, the prize will be a
silver medal, since Jordan took the gold and went home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys wanted me to come back so they could take the
title from me,'' Jordan said. ``But that's the cute thing about
retiring. They won't be able to say they beat me, even if they win
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess he had one last ``shot'' in him after all. IN THE PAINT
Offbeat Beat Is there any doubt Celtics guard Kenny Anderson became
the players' poster boy during the lockout? First, he whined about
struggling to pay the insurance on his nine cars. He made amends
for that blunder by giving away 500 free turkeys during
Thanksgiving. But last week in New York, minutes after the lockout
ended, he blew off a kid asking for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   At least Anderson deserves a chance to explain his actions:
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a heckler on the left side of me,'' Anderson said.
``I think he was drunk and he was swearing me down. The kid, I
thought, was in the back because I wasn't looking at him. I was
telling the cameraman \Rfrom CNN\S that I had to find my car and
get out of there. That's what that was about. It made me seem rude
to the fan. It was just the wrong timing. There were a lot of
cameras. There were a lot of people pushing. I was cold. It was a
hectic environment. I'm not saying it was the right thing to do.
Maybe I made a mistake and I learned from it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the supposedly fan-friendlier NBA, Anderson attempted to be
repentant.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the incident, he went on New York television
inviting the young fan to contact the Celtics for free airfare to
Boston, two tickets to a game and as many autographs as desired.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the Celtics' office was flooded with at least
100 calls claiming to be ``the kid that Kenny dissed.'' Numbers
Game Jordan's golf handicap. Instead of hanging on too long like
Muhammad Ali (taking a beating from Larry Holmes) or Nolan Ryan
(not retiring a single batter in his last outing), look for Jordan
to appear on the Celebrity Tour Challenge in the spring.

Already in the works is a television marketing campaign focusing
more on teams instead of individuals. 24 SECONDS West: In case you
missed it, Mavericks coach/GM Don Nelson predicted German sensation
Dirk Nowitzki would win Rookie of the Year. Remember, however, this
is the same Nellie who last year predicted the Mavs would contend
for the playoffs before their 20-62 disaster. ... On his Nov. 11
radio show in LA, Jazz forward Karl Malone said he would demand a
trade once the lockout was lifted. Malone has since retracted those
comments (at least he didn't say he was misquoted) and plans to
meet with Miller this week to talk about a contract extension.
``It's priority No. 1,'' Miller said. ... By refusing to reveal how
he voted in New York, Lakers guard Kobe Bryant all but confirmed he
was one of the five dissenters against the agreement. Bryant, who
previously salivated at the thought of becoming the league's first
$150 million man, can now sign an extension of only seven years and
$66 after the season. ``If you ask me, personally, I didn't like
the deal too much,'' he said.

<P>
   East: Pistons forward Jerome Williams came back from New York
saying ``I heard it more than once. More than twice.'' What was it?
That teammate Grant Hill will be a marked man for his passive,
anti-union stance during the lockout. ``I did communicate with
Billy Hunter and Patrick Ewing, but I didn't always agree with
everything,'' said Hill. ... Wizards guard Tim Legler also expects
to attract some attention, after being the first player to
criticize the union. He and veteran Mitch Richmond supposedly
cleared the air last week. ``We talked, and there's no bad blood,''
said Richmond. ``Not anymore.'' ... Knicks center Patrick Ewing
showed up at the Heat's workout last week wearing a Knicks T-shirt.
Tim Hardaway and Keith Askins made him reverse it. ``Not much was
said,'' explained Hardaway. ``Everybody just started looking, and
he turned it around. We had to protect our gym.'' (Richie Whitt

TCU'S OVERTIME VICTORY CAUSES FUROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ Horned Frogs coach Billy Tubbs thrust both
hands upward after No. 20 TCU's 92-89 overtime victory against
Colorado State yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rams coach Ritchie McKay took exception, and so began an
exchange of words between coaches until assistants from both teams
stepped between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned to go shake the coach's hand, and he started calling
me some obscene names. He didn't want a piece of me,'' Tubbs said.
``But you've got to remember he's just a young pup. He's just a guy
learning the game, but he's got a lot to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   McKay's outburst provided a wild conclusion to what already had
been a wild game at Moby Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs guard Ryan Carroll tipped in a Vladimir Jaksic miss
with 15.4 seconds remaining in overtime to lock up the victory as
TCU improved to 14-3 and 2-1 in the Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't done much the whole game. I had to do something,''
said Carroll, who got four of his 12 points in overtime. ``I
thought he was going to make it. Instead, he missed it, and I just
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs' defense, which had struggled in the waning
seconds of regulation, allowing Rams guard Milt Palacio to sail in
unmolested for a game-tying layup with 7.1 seconds remaining, then
stepped forward.
</P>
<P>
   TCU prevented Rams players from getting a shot on their last
overtime possession, Horned Frogs forward Marquise Gainous blocking
Nick Mayer's last-ditch attempt as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times you think you have a game won, you should have
a game won, and instead it goes into overtime,'' Tubbs said. ``A
lot of times you don't respond. ... It was tough. We fought every
circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue, foul trouble and a hyped bunch from Colorado State
(11-5, 1-3), to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's game ended a stretch of three games in six days for
the Frogs. It began with an after-hours, ESPN-televised victory
against SMU on Monday and followed with a trip _ and a loss _ to
Wyoming on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Horned Frogs preseason all-American Lee Nailon fouled out
with 3:31 remaining in regulation. He got his fourth and fifth
fouls in a 12-second span. Until that point, Nailon and Gainous had
been TCU's main weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Gainous finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds to lead all
players, and Nailon chipped in 15 and seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we've been leaning on Lee all season,'' said Horned
Frogs forward Shannon Long, who finished with 17 points. ``So when
he fouled out, we said: `OK, it's time for other guys to step up.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, Long and Frogs guard Prince Fowler contributed big
baskets down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's victory against Colorado State looked a lot like its loss
to Wyoming. The Horned Frogs once again shot well, 57 percent on
the game, including 64 percent in the second half. They also
outrebounded the Rams, 41-26.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, unlike against Wyoming, the defense was able to
step up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a weird week,'' Carroll said later.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs ``imposed a lockout'' all week, refusing to talk to Denver
and Colorado Springs media because of an article that mentioned an
incident that is alleged to involve Tubbs, his middle finger and
Colorado fans back in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs got blamed back then. McKay took blame yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a little of my inexperience, I guess,'' said McKay,
in his first season at Colorado State. ``I just thought he
should've just shook my hand and left the court. He didn't need to
celebrate like that at our fans. However, my reaction is not how I
want my team to be represented.'' (Jennifer Floyd writes for the

Jets at Broncos Time: 3:05 p.m. TV: KTVT/Channel 11 Radio: KTCK/AM
1310 Line: Broncos by 9 Series: Broncos lead, 13-12-1 Last meeting:
Broncos 31, Jets 6 (1996)STORY LINES BRONCOS (15-2) Are the Broncos
poised to be one of the greatest teams in NFL history?
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't win 13 consecutive games to start the season and 18
consecutive overall and not be considered great. A win today would
give the Broncos 32 victories the past two seasons, and 45 over the
past three. Both marks would tie league records. Ten of their
victories this season have come by 10 or more points. During the
13-game winning streak, they trailed just twice in the fourth
quarter of games for a total of 16:21. But first, Denver needs to
win today, then in two weeks at the Super Bowl to be considered an
all-time great team.
</P>
<P>
   What has been the key to the Broncos success?
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter. In 1998, the Broncos were the third-fastest
starting team in league history. They outscored their opponents in
the first quarter of games 144-54. The 90-point difference in the
first quarter trails only the 1966 Chiefs (158-30) and the 1986
Vikings (151-60). The Broncos outscored their opponents 47-9 on
opening drives during the regular season. In the playoffs last
week, Denver scored a touchdown on its first offensive drive and
outscored the Dolphins 14-0 in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   JETS (13-4) Do the Jets have enough defense to stop the Broncos?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. The Jets finished seventh in total defense during the
regular season. But they never faced a great offense down the
stretch. San Francisco, Atlanta and Tennessee were the only top-10
offenses the Jets faced this season. The top-ranked 49ers, who had
a more balanced attack than the Broncos, scored 36 points in the
season opener. New York held seventh-ranked Atlanta to three
points, but that was with Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler on the
sidelines. The Jets held ninth-ranked Tennessee to a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Jets too young to win such a big game on the road?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. The Cowboys were a very young team when they went on
the road to defeat the 49ers in the 1992 NFC Championship Game. The
Jacksonville Jaguars were very young when they defeated the Broncos
in a 1996 divisional playoff game. And the Cardinals were very
young when they defeated the Cowboys two weeks ago. So throw
playoff experience out the window. Besides, head coach Bill
Parcells is 11-5 in the playoffs and 3-0 in conference championship
games. Players such as Keith Byars, David Meggett, Curtis Martin,
Pepper Johnson and Jumbo Elliott, who have been with Parcells in
either New England or the New York Giants, have plenty of
championship game experience.
</P>
<P>
   KEY MATCHUPS TERRELL DAVIS vs. JETS LINEBACKERS Davis can bull
ahead to make a tough five-yard gain or cutback and go for 50. In
1998 he joined O.J. Simpson, Eric Dickerson, and Barry Sanders as
the only backs to gain 2,000 yards in a season. In the postseason,
Davis has no equal. He has averaged a league-record 145.2 yards
rushing in six postseason games. Jets linebackers Mo Lewis, Pepper
Johnson, and Bryan Cox are veteran playmakers who must fill the gap
in Bill Parcells' defensive alignment, which will mix between a 3-4
and a 4-3. Lewis, who made the Pro Bowl, Johnson, and Cox are part
of a unit that struggled at times, with a No. 14 ranking against
the run. They allowed 276 yards rushing in the last two regular
season games, but bounced back to hold Jacksonville to less than
100 last week. KEYSHAWN JOHNSON vs. DARRIEN GORDON and RAY CROCKETT
Johnson, the No. 1 draft pick out of USC in 1996, came into his own
this year. He caught a career-high 83 passes for 1,131 yards and 10
touchdowns. Against Jacksonville last week he had his best
all-around game as a pro, catching nine passes for 121 yards and a
touchdown, rushing for another touchdown, and recovering a fumble
that kept a Jets drive alive. He also lined up in the nickel
defense and made an interception on the Jaguars' last drive. At
6-foot-3, 212 pounds, Johnson uses his size and jumping ability to
position himself for most receptions. Crockett is 5-10, Gordon
5-11. Both have been beaten for big plays this year, but they've
also responded with big plays. Crockett has three interceptions and
a touchdown return, Gordon has four and a touchdown return of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   KEYS TO VICTORY BRONCOS Jump out in front early and get the Jets
to start wondering if they are good enough to be here.
</P>
<P>
   Keep quarterback John Elway healthy, because if you are down in
the fourth quarter, Elway has proven he can win it.
</P>
<P>
   Try to get tight end Shannon Sharpe lined up on a linebacker to
open up the passing attack. JETS Stay with running back Curtis
Martin who can break the game open on any play.
</P>
<P>
   Give Vinny Testaverde time to throw so Keyshawn Johnson and
Wayne Chrebet can work on an undermanned Broncos secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Make a big play on special teams and keep Mile High Stadium real
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   THE EDGE Broncos run offense (154.3 ypg) vs. Jets run defense
(103.7) Edge: Broncos
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The Broncos are one of three NFL teams that started the
same five in the offensive line in all five games. Terrell Davis
has averaged 145.2 yards in six postseason games, an NFL-record by
34.5 yards over runner-up John Riggins.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos pass offense (226.5) vs. Jets pass defense (190.0) Edge:
Broncos
</P>
<P>
   Comment: John Elway will hope to make his last game at Mile High
Stadium a winning one with passes to Shannon Sharpe and Ed
McCaffrey. The Jets defender, cornerback Aaron Glenn, likely will
miss his fifth game with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Jets run offense (117.4) Broncos run defense (80.4) Edge: Even
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Curtis Martin (1,287 yards) has been worth the bushel
of draft picks the Jets gave New England to get him last year.
Nobody runs on Denver because they spend so much time passing to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Jets pass offense (239.8) vs. Broncos pass defense (228.0) Edge:
Jets
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Vinny Testaverde has a pair of 1,000-yard receivers in
Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet. The Broncos allow too many big
plays and don't get enough consistent pressure on the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams Edge: Broncos
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Broncos punt returner Darrien Gordon has a career punt
return average of 13.2 yards, best in league history. The Jets best
kick returner, Aaron Glenn, is expected to miss the game with an
ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching Edge: Jets
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Jets coach Bill Parcells is 3-0 in conference
championship games and with a win would become he first coach in
league history to take three teams to the Super Bowl. Denver's Mike
Shanahan is one of the brightest offensive minds in the game.

SOLVING FINANCIAL WOES, OTHER NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
The last time George Will was at Arlington Stadium, he was seen
daintily eating his barbecued ribs with a knife and fork. That
alone is enough to question his placement on Commissioner Bud
Selig's blue ribbon panel being formed to study baseball's alarming
economic situation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Selig is facing another revolt by small-market owners aghast at
the latest round of mega contracts handed out to Kevin Brown, Mo
Vaughn, Albert Belle and others this winter. Those owners are
voicing the same concerns about revenue and competitive disparity
that led to the 1994-95 players strike and the cancellation of the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The stark reality is the bandage solutions devised to end that
nightmare have done little to solve the underlying problems that
caused the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Now many owners are looking at the recent NBA deal enviously and
wondering why they can't have payroll caps and salary maximums,
conveniently forgetting the players have successfully fought off
such attempts in the past.
</P>
<P>
   So Selig is calling on Will, former Federal Reserve boss Paul
Volcker, former Senator George Mitchell and Yale economics guru
Richard Levin to study the situation and come up with a solution
that would avoid another labor war.
</P>
<P>
   Selig is also on that committee, along with 13 other owners. The
Players Association, naturally, is not represented. So much for
that partnership supposedly being forged between the barons and
their multi-million dollar serfs.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball last called on Volcker in 1994. His committee then
recommended elimination of salary arbitration and reducing the
number of years needed for free agency from six to three years.
They also advocated greater sharing of ticket receipts and local
broadcast revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Small-market owners have been against lowering free-agent
eligibility because it reduced the number of years they can hold
onto their best players. But they're now finding out that because
of arbitration and other factors, they have to trade away their
best players long before they get close to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Big-market owners are naturally resistant to revenue sharing.
Rangers owner Tom Hicks just paid $250 million for his franchise
and isn't interested in sending some of his profits off to the
Kansas City group that paid $70 million for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners are never going to get the players to help solve
their problems or get them to agree to an NBA-type contract.
Baseball union founder Marvin Miller wasted no time in blasting the
basketball union for agreeing to salary maximums, comments that
were no doubt directed toward his own successors Don Fehr and Gene
Orza.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's competitive balance in the free-agency era will
forever be tied to revenue. The more revenue sharing, the better
chances Kansas City and Montreal have. The more money George
Steinbrenner, Peter Angelos and Rupert Murdoch have to outspend
their opponents, the worse it will be for the lower-, middle- and _
like the Rangers _ upper-middle class teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will have an $80 million payroll, and it's still
hard to imagine them threatening the New York Yankees and the
Cleveland Indians. If they do, don't doubt that either Steinbrenner
or Cleveland general manager John Hart will redouble their efforts
to pry Roger Clemens away from Toronto. Short hops There is nothing
more overblown around here than the debate about whether or not
Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez should be allowed to play winter
ball. The Rangers' concern about Rodriguez wearing down would be
more understandable if manager Johnny Oates were willing to give
Rodriguez more time off during the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Oates was hardly more willing to use reserve catcher Bill
Haselman last year than he was Dave Valle or Henry Mercedes in
previous years. And if he wasn't willing to use Haselman more then
he'll hardly get excited about Gregg Zaun or John Marzano.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter, retired Gen. Colin Powell and
former Atlanta mayor Andrew Young are among the many dignitaries
expected for the Feb. 5 Hank Aaron Gala, which will celebrate
baseball's all-time home run leader's 65th birthday and the 25th
anniversary of his record-breaking 715th home run. Organizers, who
expect to raise $1 million for Aaron's Chasing the Dream
Foundation, are also hoping to get Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's new ownership is trying to push out club president
Claude Brochu, the boss who presided over the demise of a
once-competitive franchise. But the Expos still need to find a new
boss, get their ownership group in place and have it all approved
by Major League Baseball. They also need to find a way to build a
new stadium, otherwise the franchise is headed to Northern
Virginia. The latest deadline is March 5 for approval by MLB, but
the Expos are unlikely to get it all done.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Boston general manager Dan Duquette signed Jose
Offerman to that ridiculous contract with the idea of having him
play second base. But manager Jimy Williams wants Jeff Frye at
second, Offerman at first and Reggie Jefferson and Mike Stanley
platooning at designated hitter. It could get interesting in spring
training. (T.R. Sullivan writes for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram) &QL;

MCCURRY SAY CLINTON CRITICISM IN BBC INTERVIEW TAKEN OUT OF
CONTEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's former chief spokesman says the
politics of impeachment ``grate'' on Clinton in ways he doesn't
publicly show, but that the president still aspires to be
remembered positively in the history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would not be a human being if it didn't grate on him, but
he understands that if he dwells on this all day long, it's going
to take all the energy that he needs to do the other stuff,''
former White House press secretary Mike McCurry said in an
interview with ``The Arizona Republic.'' ``I think he does a pretty
good job of disciplining himself so he doesn't focus on that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, who stepped down in October after nearly four years at
the White House, said Clinton ``is a student of the presidency, and
he knows how presidents have been treated in history, and I think
he cares very much about what the historical record will be of his
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first president to be impeached by the House
since Andrew Johnson in 1868. Judging by their opening statements
at Clinton's Senate trial last week, House managers seem to believe
Clinton's legacy cannot be salvaged. Failing to hold Clinton
accountable for his efforts to conceal his affair with Monica
Lewinsky ``will cause a cancer to be present in our society for
generations,'' Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., told the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCurry, Clinton ``knows that there is nothing he
can do about events that have already transpired, but there is
something he can do about trying to get things done in his capacity
as president that will reflect well on him in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, 44, who now works at a public relations consulting
firm, lived in the Valley for a few years during the 1980s. He was
a top aide on then-Gov. Bruce Babbitt's unsuccessful 1988 campaign
for the Democratic presidential nomination. In the 2000 race,
McCurry said he hopes to be ``as helpful as I can'' to Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry has given few interviews since telling the BBC's
``Newsnight'' program last month that he had ``enormous doubts''
about Clinton and his ``incredibly bizarre personal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry later had to explain that his widely quoted comments
were excerpted from a broad assessment of Clinton that included
good and bad points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the interviewers) kind of bored in. They said, `You,
personally, weren't you troubled by his behavior?' And I said,
`Well, yeah, sure, anybody would be troubled. The guy's fooling
around with a 21-year-old staff member. I mean, that's not a good
thing.' And I said, `Of course, you have to look at the larger
picture.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The affable McCurry, widely respected as a press secretary, said
former White House colleagues gave him ``a hard time'' about the
remarks. But he never heard from the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him when I left that I was not going to trash him and
be disloyal to him, and I meant that. And that's why I'm kind of
aggravated that I got myself in a situation where some of the
things I said sounded critical,'' McCurry told ``The Republic.''
``The other thing that really killed me was that they taped the BBC
interview that I did, and they aired it the Friday night before the
(House) impeachment. When it came out, looked like it was just
uncommonly bad piling on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I should write him a note or something, but I
don't know what I would say.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been silent on impeachment since the Senate
arguments began Thursday, according to White House aides, largely
because he doesn't want to appear to interfere with the process.
</P>
<P>
   While some pundits have speculated that Clinton may be depressed
or in denial, McCurry suggested neither extreme is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably like most Americans. They go to work; they do
their jobs. They don't sit around dwelling on politics all day
long,'' McCurry said. ``I think that's one of the reasons why
people basically still give him a pretty good job approval rating,
because they say, `Look, despite all the scandal stuff, he's
continuing to do a pretty good job as president.' And that gets him
a little bit of slack, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House's attention to Clinton's legacy is evidenced by
its frequently updated Internet site, detailing pages and pages of
Clinton-Gore accomplishments that ``transformed'' the nation.
Recently, the site also began featuring a trial brief defending
Clinton against the two articles of impeachment being considered by
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's stewardship of his public image has its limits. As
far as McCurry knows, Clinton has not tried to rein in or rebuke
former senior officials, including McCurry, who have made
unflattering remarks about their former boss after leaving the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   As the scandal unfolded, former press secretary Dee Dee Myers
said in August that the facts ``have not led me to conclude that he
has been telling the truth,'' and former senior adviser George
Stephanopoulos urged Clinton to ``come forward, clear the decks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Clinton) never, in my earshot, said anything critical
about George or about Dee Dee,'' McCurry said. ``I think it would
be a little self-obsessed to imagine that he tracks all of our
quotes. I'll be candid with you, I don't think he sits around and
worries very much about what Dee Dee Myers and George
Stephanopoulos and Mike McCurry say about him. I think he's got
other things to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   As the scandal intensified, the former Clinton aides inevitably
faced a ``gut check'' decision about the nature of their future
political analysis, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they (Stephanopoulos and Myers) have always had pretty
interesting commentary, but then when things suddenly are sour and
it's a real controversy and confrontation, then you get this gut
check moment. Do you say what you really think, or do you sort of
say, `Well, here's what the White House line is.' It's a different
balance for every person.''
</P>
<P>
   As for him, McCurry said he'll often leave listeners with the
notion that Clinton is a ``complicated'' man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're giving a 45-minute speech, at the end of it people
say, `Well, you obviously have a lot of affection for Bill Clinton,
you have a lot of respect for some of the things he did. But you
also clearly came away thinking that some of the stuff he did was
wrong.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's it.'' &QL;

WHITAKER STAGGERS TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Technically, Lance ``Mount'' Whitaker passed the
test.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8 behemoth from Northridge beat an established
(albeit aging) heavyweight for the first time in his young career.
</P>
<P>
   However, his seventh-round technical knockout of 34-year-old
former contender Alex Stewart on the undercard of the Mike
Tyson-Francois Botha fight was hardly the coming out that Whitaker
and Co. might've imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker nearly went down in the fourth round and was cut below
his left eye before the bout was stopped at 1:40 of the seventh
because of a deep gash below Stewart's right eye that bled from the
second round on.
</P>
<P>
   As one member of Whitaker's camp said, ``Whew! Welcome to the
big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   In another bout involving a local fighter, Robert Garcia
outpointed John John Molina to retain his IBF junior lightweight
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really that tough,'' said Whitaker, playing down his
apparent difficulties. ``I got careless and he caught me a couple
of times. I wasn't in that much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``...I'm not trying to be cocky. He caught me and I was a little
wobbly, but I came back and won. That's what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly looked tough from outside the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker (18-0, with 16 knockouts) outworked Stewart (43-9, 40
KOs) from the beginning. Stewart admitted it.
</P>
<P>
   And in the third round, a round after Stewart was cut from a
punch, Whitaker appeared to take charge. He hurt Stewart with a
flurry of his George Foreman-like, battering-ram punches late in
the round.
</P>
<P>
   However, Whitaker inexplicably has a bad habit of carrying his
hands at his waist and he paid the price against a big-punching,
veteran fighter who has been in the ring with many of the big-name
heavyweights of the past decade, including Tyson and Evander
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   He landed a left hook squarely on Whitaker's jaw. Whitaker
smiled but clearly he was hurt. Stewart, sensing the kill, went
after the bigger man, but he couldn't put him away. His window of
opportunity had closed.
</P>
<P>
   By the sixth round, the cut was bleeding profusely and Stewart
was tiring. No one was surprised when it was stopped in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Goossen, Whitaker's trainer, agreed it was anything but an
easy fight but was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of the one punch, it was a picture-perfect
fight,'' he said. ``You could see the brutality of Lance's punches.
(Stewart) took a beating. I thought they stopped the fight with
Lance dominating.
</P>
<P>
   ``...This win puts Lance right in the (championship) mix. You
have the top six, seven guys and then another group of four or five
right behind them. Lance is in that group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me six to nine months and I'll put him in there with
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who said he ran out of energy by the sixth round, gave
Whitaker credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He beat me,'' he said. ``You gotta give him that.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia (32-0, 24 KOs) survived a late rally by Molina (45-6, 30
KOs) to retain his title.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxnard resident controlled the fight for the first eight
rounds, consistently beating Molina to the punch and getting the
best of several furious exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   However, Garcia was unable to put away or even hurt the durable
Puerto Rican and Molina picked up momentum. He outboxed the
champion for the latter third of the fight _ when Garcia's right
eye was swollen almost shut _ but couldn't pick up enough points to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Molina knocked down Garcia in the 12th round but still lost by
the same score on all three cards: 115-112.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was particularly significant for Garcia because of
Molina's reputation _ he gave Oscar De La Hoya one of his toughest
fights _ and the fact it was on international pay-per-view TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a warrior,'' Garcia said. ``He always comes to fight. I
trained good, I trained hard for this fight.'' &QL;

DAD ADDRESSES FAILED POLYGRAPH, DENIES INVOLVEMENT IN
DISAPPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 and RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ Mikelle Biggs' father, responding to news reports
that he failed a polygraph test, stated flatly at a news conference
Saturday that he was not involved in the disappearance of his
11-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know myself that I wasn't in volved in it. I can't
comprehend somebody doing that to their own daughter,'' said
Michael Darien Biggs, 35, leaning against the family's car in front
of their Mesa home, his hands stuffed in his jeans pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel guilt? Heck yeah. Do I feel responsible? Absolutely.
Isn't that the definition of a parent?''
</P>
<P>
   Sources told ``The Arizona Republic'' that Biggs failed a
voluntary polygraph test about the Jan. 2 disappearance of his
daughter, who vanished after bolting outside her house after she
thought she heard an ice-cream truck.
</P>
<P>
   But Biggs said police told him the test was inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa police have not characterized Biggs as a suspect in the
investiga tion, describing him as one of hundreds of leads in the
case. And both police and Biggs said distress over his daughter's
disappearance may have affected the results of the FBI-administered
exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get scared, I get angry. And when I get angry, I can't
think straight,'' Biggs said. ``There was a period of three or four
days there when I was consumed with nothing but rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggs said he and his wife, Tracy, immediately agreed to take
poly graphs and submit fingerprints. And, he said, he is not upset
that investi gators asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would've thought the police were doing a poor job if they
hadn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mikelle was riding a bicycle belong ing to her sister, Kimber,
9, when she disappeared two weeks ago, four doors away from her
home at El Moro Avenue and Toltec Street. The bicycle and two
quarters for ice cream were found nearby in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents took the polygraph tests, independently, a little
more than a week ago, Biggs said. He couldn't recall the exact day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the questions were fairly general,'' he said, adding
that about three were related to Mikelle's disap pearance.
</P>
<P>
   He said he took the test in a stark room, where he sat strapped
to the device and staring at paint swirls on a blank wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing isn't designed to make you feel very at ease,
anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs said he took more than one test that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI agent said, `Look I think you've got too much anger
and this isn't going to work,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have declined to reveal the results of Tracy Biggs' test
and her husband said he can only assume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was OK, or she'd be out here talking to you,'' he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs offered to take another test, but wouldn't predict the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now added to the . . . fear and anger that I feel is
apprehension. What if I fail again?''
</P>
<P>
   Biggs said he hadn't hired a lawyer, but wasn't ruling out the
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   He has never shied from the public eye. Often decked out in blue
jeans and athletic shoes, he has calmly shared details about his
life and his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs added that he hopes his even-keeled statements and lack of
emotion in public aren't construed as a lack of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not normally an emotional person anyway. I tend to hide
that from people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, he has tried to remain calm in case Mikelle sees
television reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to make her feel any better to see her dad
crying on TV,'' he said. ``Dad is always the strong one that holds
everything together.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, time is taking its toll. His daughter's
disappearance enters its third week today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really a feeling of numbness after two weeks. This
can't be happening to us,'' he said. ``Nothing has a lot of meaning
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kym Pasqualini of the Nation's Missing Children Organization
Inc. said polygraph tests are commonly given to family members
after a disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process of ruling them out,'' Pasqualini said, adding
that being strapped to a polygraph device comes with its own set of
stresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intimidating for the families _ intimidating and
frightening. They feel like suspects,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mikelle's father said he hopes the publicity about him won't
deter the thousands who have helped the exhaustive search for his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Community volunteers said they are working as hard as ever to
help find the missing child.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday they plastered large vinyl stickers, featuring a
full-color picture of Mikelle, on dozens of car windows in the
parking lot of Simon's Warehouse Foods in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Most said they hadn't read the morning papers' stories about
Biggs failing a polygraph test.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa Police Department has fielded more than 4,000 calls
over the past two weeks, and checked out scores of leads.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa police ask that anyone with information about Mikelle's
where abouts call (602) 644-2002. &QL;
