<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 143.74 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The fear of higher interest rates returned to  
Wall Street Tuesday after a three-session hiatus, sending blue-chip 
stocks and bond prices sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.74 to close at  
10,765.64, more than wiping out Monday's solid gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also ended lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 dropped 17.19 to 1,317.33, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq 
composite index fell 49.65 points to 2,474.56. 
</P>
<P>
	Major market averages rallied in recent days as new economic  
data suggested the nation's unprecedented growth may be continuing 
without rising inflation. Analysts said many investors had 
abandoned their certainty that the Federal Reserve would raise 
interest rates to stifle inflation when its Open Market Committee 
meets June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday, William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve  
Bank of St. Louis suggested that he believed inflation has returned 
to the economy. Bond prices tumbled following his remarks, pushing 
the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bond market can't get out of its own way,'' said Charles  
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities, 
noting that at that level, bonds are perceived as a favorable 
alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors turned away from a wide range of stocks, although  
consumer products and chemical companies led the Dow industrials 
lower. Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 2 3/4 to 94 13/16, and DuPont dropped 3 
5/16 to 69 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economically sensitive stocks are weaker,'' noted Alfred  
E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in 
St. Louis. ``They're under a little profit-taking pressure after 
three up days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major airline stocks fell after several carriers cut ticket  
prices by as much as 25 percent for off-peak summer travel. UAL, 
the parent of United Air Lines, has already said it expects to miss 
second-quarter earnings forecasts, and the fare sale struck 
investors as another potential threat to profits. UAL led the 
decliners, falling 2 9/16 to 63 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the nation's biggest computer makers, including IBM,  
down 3 7/8 to 116 5/8, were held back by several factors. Goldman Sachs 
told clients it expects weaker consumer demand for computers in the 
coming months, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq fell 15/16 to 22 15/16 after US Bancorp Piper Jaffray  
analyst Ashok Kumar said the computer maker could post an operating 
loss in the second quarter. Kumar said Compaq is losing market 
share to Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer stocks are also suffering from investors' concerns  
over interest rates. Those stocks are often perceived as too pricey 
during times of higher interest rates, when corporate profits can 
be eroded by the higher costs of borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	But while some of the high-tech leaders faltered, the  
notoriously volatile Internet stocks held up fairly well. Infoseek 
rose 5 5/8 to 48 5/8 after Walt Disney Co. said it is negotiating to buy 
the 57 percent of the Web search company it does not already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume was light as traders looked ahead to Friday, when the  
government will report on producer prices. Scott Brown, chief 
economist at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., 
said traders will use that data to firm up their bets on whether 
the Fed will indeed raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The figures tell a story of how wage pressures are being met,  
and whether we may be approaching a breaking point,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 
835.12 million shares, up from 798.47 million the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 6.17 to 630.77, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 5.23 to 772.92. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.13 to 443.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.53 percent.  
European indexes were mixed, as Germany's DAX index fell 0.3 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 
closed 0.1 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Broadly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell broadly against major European  
currencies Tuesday as data showed Germany's economy stronger than 
expected, signaling that surrounding stagnant economies could be 
expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also fell against the yen as rumors surfaced that a  
major upcoming economic report will show Japan may be finally 
recovering from its devastating recession. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0458, up  
from $1.0286 late Monday and its most recent record low of $1.0260, 
set in the opening of trading in London Monday. In other late 
trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 118.88 Japanese yen, down 
from 120.80 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders liked several pieces of news Tuesday, including a report  
showing that Germany's gross domestic product rose 0.7 percent on 
an annual basis, against an expected growth rate of 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has been sliding since its inception in January as  
Europe's economies have lagged. The German economy is the world's 
third largest and the largest in Europe, and has not been able to 
help the flagging economies in the 11 countries the euro 
represents. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the president-designate of Germany's central bank,  
Ernst Welteke, said there was cause for concern regarding the 
euro's slide, allowing traders to speculate about possible 
intervention. That counters the majority of comments made by 
European monetary officials, who have seemed calm in the face of 
the euro's double-digit percentage fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also lost support Tuesday as the Dow Jones industrial  
average fell 143.74 to 10,765.64. Bond prices also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market's been looking for an excuse to rally after weeks  
and months of (euro) lows,'' said Ben Strauss, a vice president of 
foreign exchange at Bank Julius Baer &AMP; Co. There was enough going 
on ``to get people to come out and take profit on the dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there were rumors in Japan that a report due Thursday  
would show that country's GDP growing, perhaps indicating that 
Japan has turned the corner in the country's fight against its 
worst recession since World War II. The data are consistent with 
recent reports showing strength in other areas, said Jay Bryson, an 
international economist at First Union Capital Markets in 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all starting to sound pretty convincing,'' Bryson said  
of Japan's possible recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In other late trading, the dollar also was quoted at 1.5224  
Swiss francs, down from 1.5436, and 1.4753 Canadian dollars, up 
from 1.4685. The British pound rose to $1.6049 from $1.6005. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 
1.8702 German marks, down from 1.9015; 6.2735 French francs, down 
from 6.3776; and 1,851.85 Italian lire, down from 1,883.24.

	Off-Peak Summer Flights Discounted  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Major airlines cut ticket prices today by as much  
as 25 percent for off-peak summer travel. United Airlines set off 
the fare war and others including Delta Air Lines, Continental 
Airlines and Northwest Airlines joined the matched the United 
promotion on domestic and international travel. Under the 
promotion, consumers who purchase tickets for advance travel only 
on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays could see as much as a 25 
percent discount over regularly priced tickets. The promotion, in 
which tickets must be purchased by June 18, applies to travel 
through the end of September. The airline also capped advanced 
round-trip ticket purchases for peak travel days at $498.

	Productivity Rises in 1st Quarter  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American workers' productivity increased at an  
annual rate of 3.5 percent in the first three months of the year 
while wage pressures remained well contained, the government said 
today. The 3.5 percent increase in output per hour worked 
represented a slight downward adjustment of the earlier estimate. A 
key measurement of inflationary pressures was revised up slightly 
in today's report. Unit labor costs, the amount of compensation per 
unit of output, edged up 0.7 percent at an annual rate in the first 
quarter, compared to an original estimate of a 0.3 percent 
increase.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The heads of the nation's major business and  
high-tech groups urged Congress and the White House today to enact 
legislation protecting them from being battered by Y2K-related 
lawsuits. The Y2K litigation bill, which could return to the Senate 
floor this week, is the number one priority of the high-tech 
industry, Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology 
Association of America, said at a news conference on Capitol Hill. 
President Jerry Jasinowski of the National Association of 
Manufacturers also pushed for the bill sponsored by Sens. John 
McCain, R-Ariz., Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a second day of testimony damaging to  
Microsoft, an IBM manager accused the software giant today of 
dangling valuable discounts for Windows if IBM agreed not to 
distribute rival software on its line of personal computers. IBM 
manager Garry Norris testified at the federal anti-trust trial that 
Microsoft executive Bengt Ackerlind told him clearly in a March 
1997 meeting: ``No Netscape.'' The government showed U.S. District 
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson the notes handwritten by Norris 
regarding that meeting, when Microsoft Corp. allegedly offered to 
increase rebates available under its so-called Market Development 
Agreements if IBM promised not to include Internet software from 
Netscape Communications Corp. in the personal computers it sold.

	Saturn Extends an Engine Warranty

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Saturn Corp. has extended the warranty on 363,000  
engines to cover costly cylinder head cracks that have occurred in 
a small percentage of its 1994-96 model-year cars. The small-car 
subsidiary of General Motors Corp. said the warranty extension is 
for its single-overhead-cam, 4-cylinder engines only. The cracks 
are estimated to affect only about 5 percent of the engines 
produced during the three model years, spokeswoman Julie Hamp said 
Tuesday. The warranty is extended to six years or 100,000 miles, 
whichever comes first, from the regular powertrain warranty of 
three years or 36,000 miles.

	U.S. May Ease Computer Export Rules

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Clinton administration is making plans to  
ease government restrictions on the sale of high-powered computers 
to more than 100 countries, the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
The Commerce Department has proposed changes in export rules on 
sales to most countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Central 
and Eastern Europe, unidentified administration sources told the 
Times. The administration, however, will not loosen restrictions on 
China and some 50 other countries, the newspaper reported. 
Administration officials who spoke to the Times on condition of 
anonymity said the White House has not yet determined how much to 
ease controls

</P>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Police have closed some 300 cafes in  
Shanghai for offering Internet services without required licenses, 
the Shanghai Star newspaper reported today. The closures, which 
came during a crackdown last week, appeared to be part of efforts 
to silence potential sources of dissent around last Friday's 
anniversary of the bloody 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protests 
centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Cafes with computer 
terminals that sell Internet access by the hour are common in 
China, but they operate under increasingly strict rules. Operators 
must pass a police check, and users are required to register.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Looking at Web's Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Internet's impact on society, from its  
effect on families to how it's changing the world economy, will be 
tracked in an unprecedented study funded in part by rivals America 
Online Inc. and Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The project announced Tuesday by the University of California,  
Los Angeles, will follow not only computer and Internet use but 
also nonusage in the United States and other countries for at least 
a generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is transforming how we work, how we play and how  
we learn,'' said Jeffrey Cole, the study's principal investigator 
and director of the UCLA Center for Communication Policy. ``There 
isn't anything that's not going to be affected by this 
technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the sort of research scientists should have conducted on  
television when it first became available in the late 1940s and 
early 1950s, said Cole, whose center conducts studies on network TV 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with television was that nobody was in the  
households to watch what happened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 50 percent of U.S. households have computers and  
about a third of those use the Internet. Usage varies widely in 
other parts of the world, from a high percentage of residents in 
Singapore to very few households in parts of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers will examine how family time, political leanings and  
social life are affected by a new computer purchase. Do people 
spend less time watching television or talking to their families? 
Do they become more liberal? More politically active? 
</P>
<P>
	The study also will track online banking, shopping and buying  
habits, comfort with using credit cards and how e-mail affects 
other forms of communication. Do they shop online and buy at a 
store or shop at a store and buy online? How does it change the way 
people work? 
</P>
<P>
	The average participant will probably answer about 100  
questions, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to do it year by year, stay with the same families  
and watch the migration and the change in attitudes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and America Online both said the study will be used to  
better serve their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those times where an industrywide effort helps  
everyone,'' said Brad Chase, vice president of Microsoft Corp.'s 
Consumer and Commerce Group. ``We're taking the Internet in its 
infancy and helping it grow so we can do the right thing so 
everyone can get the most out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cole said the sponsors, which also include The Walt Disney Co.  
and Sony, will not influence the questions or analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, 2,000 randomly selected people mirroring  
the nation's ethnic, economic and geographic makeup will be 
followed during the study, with people added as others drop out. 
Most will be surveyed by telephone. He estimates the study's margin 
of error will be about 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore and Italy will also be studied in the first year;  
another dozen countries will be added in the next three to five 
years. Results will be presented annually, starting next year.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Rice Philosophical of Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry Rice spent the offseason  
confronting his football mortality and he insisted Tuesday he's 
learning to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, guys, basically it's coming to an end and I don't  
want to go out on a sour note,'' said the 36-year-old Rice, who 
joined the San Francisco 49ers for the opening of a four-day, 
full-squad minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go out feeling good about my career, enjoying the  
game of football,'' he said. Asked if this would be his last 
season, Rice laughed and said, ``No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not 
saying that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's leading career receiver earned his 12th Pro Bowl  
invitation last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But he conceded his comeback season from two devastating knee  
injuries was marred by his grousing over a diminished role as 
Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes became the focus on more and more 
plays. Both Owens and Stokes have been re-signed by the 49ers, 
preserving the team's triple threat at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not happy about what was going on with me, how I was  
dealing with the situation,'' Rice said. ``I said to myself that 
I've got to completely turn this thing around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be able to carry this team like I used to. I  
just want to go in there and try to be a factor, just try to help 
the young guys as much as possible and just enjoy. I'm not going to 
say I'm going to get too relaxed. When my number is called, I want 
to make the play and get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After so many years as the offensive focal point, Rice said it's  
tough accepting a reduced role. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's time for me to just kick back and enjoy this game,''  
Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also came to the realization that he had little choice.  
Owens, who led the team with 14 touchdown catches in 1998, and 
Stokes have developed into important playmakers in their own right 
and with running back Garrison Hearst also in the mix, San 
Francisco's offense operates best when quarterback Steve Young 
spreads the ball around. 
</P>
<P>
	That point was driven home even more when the 49ers kept both  
potential free agents, re-signing Stokes in March and designating 
Owens as a franchise player, effectively limiting his free agency 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, Owens signed his $3.5 million tender offer for this  
season with the expectation the two sides will work out a longterm 
deal in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for Terrell, to have that behind him, it's a relief,''  
coach Steve Mariucci said. ``The talks on a longterm deal are still 
going and that should get done. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to see not just Terrell, but the Three Amigos,  
Jerry, J.J. and Terrell. You line up with those three guys across 
the board, that's exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That image also helped foster the new philosophical approach by  
Rice, who also drew from watching David Robinson accept a change in 
his role with the emergence of Tim Duncan as the San Antonio Spurs' 
chief playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to step away but I've just got to let go,'' Rice  
said. ``I look at it just like David Robinson, the role he has 
taken now. I think he's dealing with that situation very, very well 
and for him to be able to step back like that, it really showed me 
a lot. Well, that's my role now and that's exactly how I'm going to 
approach it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, meanwhile, said he's glad to have his future stabilized  
and looks forward to another season playing beside Stokes and Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	He added he believes San Francisco's offense can duplicate or  
exceed last year's performance, when it finished at the top of the 
NFL rankings in passing and rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think keeping us together is just going to make us that more  
special,'' Owens said. ``You don't get three receivers with the 
talent that we have on a team very often. You've got those guys 
over in Minnesota. They've got their thing going but we've got to 
keep the Bay together. We've got a great group of young guys making 
some plays.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines, Creditors Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine Airlines said Tuesday it  
will start negotiations this week with European export credit 
agencies and the International Air Transport Association to 
restructure close to $1 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline said agreements with the European credit agencies  
and with IATA -- the airline industry's umbrella organization -- 
should pave the way for similar debt restructuring pacts with other 
creditors, particularly the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which rejected 
the carrier's rehabilitation plan. 
</P>
<P>
	To help support the recovery plan, PAL said IATA agreed to  
reduce its claims to $15 million from $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	IATA suspended the airlines' membership in September for failing  
to pay its dues. This resulted in all but one of its 231 members 
refusing to accept transfer passengers with the carrier's tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL said it has secured IATA's backing for its rehabilitation  
plan after majority shareholder Lucio Tan raised $200 million in 
fresh capital Friday to keep the company airborne. 
</P>
<P>
	Once it is back in the IATA fold, foreign carriers will accept  
transfer passengers holding PAL tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL is seeking to restructure about $900 million in loans from  
the export credit agencies, which consist of 17 French, British and 
German banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Since June 1998, the carrier has serviced only a trickle of its  
total $2.2 billion debt, and is seeking to stretch the repayment 
period with major creditors.

<HEADLINE> Ocean Warming May Threaten Salmon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP -- Rising ocean temperatures, perhaps caused by  
global climate change, are threatening to push salmon out of their 
Pacific Ocean habitat, two marine biologist said today, citing as 
early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether the changes are related to global warming is not  
statistically clear, but it's what appears to be happening,'' said 
Jim Barry, a marine biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research 
Institute in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists said at a news conference that warmer ocean  
waters in the Pacific has caused a much higher mortality rate among 
salmon. It also has produced a dramatic shift in plankton species 
that has interfered in food supplies for marine life and seabirds, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't fully realize what's happening ... but these are the  
sort of events we expect from global warming,'' said David Welch, 
head of the salmon research project for the Canadian National 
Department of Fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who is based in British Columbia, said he is convinced  
that ocean warming reflects broader climate change and raises the 
possibility of ``large-scale potential changes in the marine 
ecosystem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While scientists agree the oceans have become warmer, the  
reasons remain in dispute. Some scientists argue it reflects 
broader climate change as a result of heat trapping pollution, but 
others say it simply reflects cyclical temperature changes, 
including the El Nino phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, higher ocean temperatures already have had  
dramatic impact on Pacific salmon fisheries, the two biologists 
said at a news conference sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund and 
the Marine Conservation Biology Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch cited as clear evidence of concern the dramatic decline in  
Alaska's Pacific salmon population in 1997 and again last year. 
Salmon returning to swim up the Fraser River in British Columbia 
have been fewer in number and much smaller than in years past, he 
said. And the in-river mortality rate among salmon returning to 
spawn soared to 76 percent in 1997, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch attributed the smaller fish and high death rate to the  
warmer ocean waters that, he said, sapped the salmon of their 
energy and strength. ``We're starting to see a very troubling 
perspective on this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biologists said the high sea temperatures in 1997 and 1998  
produced a rate bloom of phytoplankton in the northern Pacific 
waters typical of waters closer to the equator, causing changes in 
the food chain. The reduced size of returning salmon and the 
decrease in overall numbers ``suggests large-scale starvation,'' 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch said that if the warming continues as part of a broader  
global climate change, the salmon as a species may be forced 
northward into the Bering Sea, abandoning their traditional Pacific 
habitat. While that may still be 40 or 50 years in the future, 
``the early stages are already here,'' he argued. 
</P>
<P>
	As for those who argue that the sea temperature rise may only be  
cyclical, Welch said that the last El Nino was the strongest ever 
recorded and the frequency of El Nino events has increased, 
suggesting a broader climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing now is unprecedented,'' agreed Barry.

<HEADLINE> Saturn Extends an Engine Warranty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Saturn Corp. has extended the warranty on 363,000  
engines to cover costly cylinder head cracks that have occurred in 
a small percentage of its 1994-96 model-year cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The small-car subsidiary of General Motors Corp. said the  
warranty extension is for its single-overhead-cam, 4-cylinder 
engines only. The cracks are estimated to affect only about 5 
percent of the engines produced during the three model years, 
spokeswoman Julie Hamp said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The warranty for the cylinder head was extended Monday to six  
years or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first, from the regular 
powertrain warranty of three years or 36,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn is not required to extend the warranty, and the cracks do  
not pose a safety threat, Hamp said. The cracks have appeared 
largely in engines subjected to high mileage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a customer satisfaction issue,'' she said. ``That  
kind of repair normally is expensive for an owner, and we don't 
think our owners should have to pay for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fix could be costly for Saturn, however. If 5 percent of the  
363,000 engines are repaired, based on an average cost of $1,500, 
that would cost the automaker $27.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	About 600 owners who already have paid for the repair have been  
issued checks to reimburse them for the expense, Hamp said. All 
owners of the affected cars are being notified of the warranty 
change by letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners who notice discoloration in the coolant reservoir under  
the hood or that the engine is running hot should bring the car to 
their Saturn dealer. The dealer will check to see if oil has leaked 
into the coolant, a sign of cylinder head cracks.

<HEADLINE> Productivity Rises in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American workers' productivity increased at an  
annual rate of 3.5 percent in the first three months of the year 
while wage pressures remained well contained, the government said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity, the output per hour of work, is considered the key  
measurement determining whether Americans' living standards will 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher productivity means that employers can afford to pay  
workers more without raising the price of their products. That 
keeps inflation under control and means that workers' fatter pay 
checks will go farther. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.5 percent increase in the annual rate of productivity  
growth for the January-March period represented a slight downward 
revision from the Labor Department's initial estimate a month ago 
that productivity had risen 4 percent in the first three months of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The revision resulted from the fact that the total output of  
goods and services, the gross domestic product, was revised down as 
well to 4.1 percent, compared to an initial estimate of 4.5 percent 
economic growth in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	With less output for the same amount of hours worked, the  
productivity figure was revised down slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	A key measurement of inflationary pressures was revised up  
slightly in today's report. Unit labor costs, the amount of 
compensation per unit of output, edged up 0.7 percent at an annual 
rate in the first quarter, compared to an original estimate of a 
0.3 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the upward revision, an increase of just 0.7 percent  
in unit labor costs is considered a good sign that wage pressures 
are well contained, even though the nation's unemployment rate has 
returned to a 29-year low of just 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.7 percent rise in unit labor costs followed an actual  
decline of 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter last year. For all of 
1998, unit labor costs were up 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.5 percent productivity increase for the first quarter  
represents a strong advance, better than the 2.2 percent gain for 
all of 1998. And even the 2.2 percent annual figure represented an 
improvement from weak productivity growth over the last two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a huge debate in economic circles over whether  
improvements noted in productivity recently represent a fundamental 
change in the economy or is just a cyclical improvement that will 
not last. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sided with  
the optimists. He argued that the recent solid advances in 
productivity did represent a significant change, representing the 
payoff for business investments in computers and other 
productivity-enhancing tools. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan called the combination of rapid growth, the lowest  
unemployment rates in nearly three decades and low inflation rates 
``truly phenomenal'' but he warned that productivity advances will 
not be able to keep inflation forever at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets took a nosedive on Greenspan's remarks,  
focusing on his worries that at some point rising wage pressures 
will overwhelm the productivity gains and spark higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists are split on whether the Fed will begin raising  
interest rates when policy makers next meet at the end of this 
month. Many believe that if next week's report on consumer prices 
shows another worrisome jump in price pressures, then the Fed will 
be forced to act. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the 1950s and 1960s, American productivity recorded  
impressive annual gains averaging 3 percent a year, allowing 
American workers to enjoy healthy rising gains in living standards. 
</P>
<P>
	But since 1973, productivity increases have been at anemic  
annual rates of around 1 percent. Last year's 2.2 percent increase 
in productivity was double the annual average in the previous two 
decades.

<HEADLINE> 'Niche' TV Blossoms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In 1980, when there were fewer than two dozen  
cable networks and only 15 million households receiving them, a 
station called ESPN was just getting off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time the conventional wisdom was that an all-sports  
network would never work, that it was too narrow to really be 
viable,'' said Roger Werner, who would become CEO of ESPN within a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the cable universe reaches 67 million homes and 174  
channels, ESPN's revenues are over $1 billion, and nobody could 
possibly call it narrow. ``Narrow,'' or ``niche network'' as the 
industry calls it, now means an all-golf channel, or an 
all-anthropology channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus will likely get narrower, too, since technology  
eventually will increase the number of cable channels reaching each 
household from dozens to hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Werner, now CEO of two niche networks, shows how things are  
going. His Speed Vision covers fast cars, boats and planes, while 
Outdoor Life hits everything from windsurfing to adventure 
expeditions to environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The networks I've been involved in have moved from the more  
generic to the more specialized,'' said Werner. ``The magazine 
business and the print business were the inspiration for both of 
these channels -- look how many titles are devoted to vehicles and 
outdoor recreation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another niche network called The Box goes even further. It  
allows viewers to pick music videos from playlists scrolled on the 
screen, and then call in and get them broadcast for $2 per request. 
</P>
<P>
	The offerings vary by region and even neighborhood, with 160  
different playlists around the country -- ranging from Latin, 
country and top 40 to alternative rock, classic rock and rap-urban. 
Radio playlists, record sales and viewer preference all influence 
what's offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. has a very diverse musical audience that has  
different tastes depending on the region,'' said Alan McGlade, CEO 
of The Box. ``We think this is the wave of the future. People are 
more and more going to demand something that really speaks to them 
and is responsive to them. You see -- in every area of development 
in TV and the Internet -- customization and personalization of 
programming to specific niche audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	One special-interest network that seemed like a gamble but  
became a sensation was the Golf Network, with legend Arnold Palmer 
at its helm. Just four years old, the station has already turned a 
profit and reaches 23 million households with its tournaments, 
instructional programs and talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forty-year-old guys can't go out and play football, but they  
can do this,'' said Golf Channel spokeswoman Debbie Sweeney. ``It 
definitely has been the secret of our success. A lot of people 
become hooked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, some niche networks are trying to widen their  
appeal after having gotten a foot in the door. The Food Network, 
for example, will be introducing a new batch of programs in July 
designed to increase its audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The station now reaches 40 million homes, but Larry Gerbrandt, a  
senior analyst with the media research consulting firm Paul Kagan 
Associates, says cable stations ``usually don't begin to approach 
profitability till somewhere in the 25 million subscriber range. 
And you're not really considered a success until you get about 50 
million people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a specialized audience that I can best describe as  
foodies,'' said Food Network President Eric Ober. ``What we're 
attempting to do is to go the other way, to broaden the category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While keeping popular shows like ``Emeril Live,'' featuring New  
Orleans chef Emeril Lagasse, the Food Network is branching out from 
traditional cooking shows and restaurant profiles by adding nine 
new shows ``where food is part of lifestyle,'' Ober said. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Calling All Cooks,'' Ober says, ``we literally go to  
people's neighborhoods and get family recipes.'' ``Food 911'' he 
describes as ``an action-adventure show.'' Viewers can contact the 
Food Network with food emergencies -- like a boss suddenly coming 
for dinner -- and a team will be dispatched to prepare a meal. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Iron Chef,'' a subtitled Japanese game show, chefs compete  
to create a meal featuring unusual ingredients like ostrich eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerbrandt says the Food Network's efforts to attract an audience  
beyond people interested in cooking is typical of a niche network 
becoming more mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get on (the air) you have to be specialized. But once you  
get an audience, you have to generalize,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broadcasting &AMP; Cable Yearbook lists dozens of wannabe niche  
networks -- stations that exist in concept, with offices, financing, 
a collection of taped programs ready to air, and even sponsors 
eager to advertise. The problem is finding distributors -- cable 
companies willing to carry them in an increasingly crowded field. 
</P>
<P>
	Although new digital technology is expected to increase to  
hundreds the number of stations available within the decade, many 
cable customers today get only 60 or 70 channels. So competition 
for a channel is intense. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those stations that exist on paper only are the Arts &AMP;  
Antiques Network. Its originator, Doug Ritter, has been trying to 
launch it for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideas for shows are plentiful, Ritter said. ``But what it takes  
is distribution. That proverbial 500-channel universe has to happen 
for us niche networks to get going. ... We know we have a giant 
audience but there's no way to get to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few other niche start-ups believe they will find distributors  
soon. Anthropology Programming and Entertainment -- APE -- would 
feature programs on evolution, primates and human culture. BookNet 
will have author interviews, children's programs, and shows about 
various genres -- mysteries, science fiction, romance novels, 
poetry. 
</P>
<P>
	But not every good idea gets its chance, said Gerbrandt, the  
industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of ideas fall by the wayside because they can't get  
anybody's attention,'' he said. ``Basically two or three cable 
networks wind up getting launched each year. For every one that 
gets on, there's probably 10 that try and fail.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Tries To Balance Y2K Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Robert Bennett, the Senate's leading  
expert on the year 2000 computer problem, wants Americans to know 
that Y2K is an ``unpredictable event that may have life-altering 
consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he says they must also know that Y2K ``will not be the end  
of the world as we know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Striking a balance between those two messages has been a  
delicate task. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the government is sending out mixed messages and  
lulling Americans into a false sense of security by playing down 
the possible crises from computer systems that fail because they 
can't read the year 2000 date. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are erring more on the side of fear,'' said Liza  
Christian of the grass-roots Rogue Valley Y2K Task Force in Oregon. 
``Fear that the American people will act with a lack of 
intelligence, that they will take bizarre measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, head of the President's Council on Year 2000  
Conversion, acknowledged that it hasn't been easy to convey their 
central theme, that national systems -- power grids, 
telecommunication networks, air traffic -- are safe, but people 
should be prepared for some localized, temporary disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is confusing, but we are trying to make it as clear as we  
can,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His council has created 25 working groups to make sure  
industries around the country are talking to each other about the 
computer problem and recently began a nationwide campaign, with a 
Y2K tool kit, to promote community conversations on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	The key, he said, is for people to make cool, informed  
decisions. ``I told some of the doomsayers from the start that 
sometimes people in a well-meaning way drive the argument to the 
extremes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Adams, head of Infrastructure Defense, a technology  
information firm that runs a Y2K news Web site, praised the 
council's efforts but said Koskinen is underfunded and the United 
States is well behind such countries as Canada and Britain in 
making people aware of the possible consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent testimony before Sen. Bennett's special committee on  
the Y2K problem, Adams cited a survey taken last year revealing 
that two-thirds of Americans did not know what Y2K was. Some 
thought it was a tooth whitener, a movie rating, a stain remover or 
a brand of petroleum jelly. 
</P>
<P>
	People are now more aware of the problem, but ``the level of  
ignorance remains alarmingly high,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, R-Utah, who chairs the Y2K panel with Sen. Christopher  
Dodd, D-Conn., agreed with Koskinen that there will almost 
certainly be isolated disruptions, but predicting where the 
problems will arise can be a risky business. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled that when ``Tonight Show'' host Johnny Carson joked  
in 1973 that toilet paper was disappearing from grocery store 
shelves, the next day 20 million viewers rushed out to stockpile 
supplies and caused a real shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The antidote to panic is always accurate information,''  
Bennett said in an interview. ``But some of the accurate 
information can be pretty scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's Internet site advises people to check with police,  
doctors, pharmacists and grocers about their services, keep on hand 
batteries, warm blankets and ``a couple of extra cans of food,'' 
save copies of financial transactions and beware of Y2K con 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said that at his own home he has filled a 55-gallon drum  
with water and has stored food. ``That's prudent in modern life. 
There's so many things that can interrupt your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen's council offers similar ``common sense'' suggestions  
such as preparing a three-day supply of water and nonperishable 
goods, filling up on gas and keeping copies of bank statements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web page assures people that major national disruptions are  
unlikely, that planes are safe and that coffee makers, microwaves, 
elevators and other equipment without calendar functions should not 
be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, such as Rogue Valley's Christian, say these guides  
seriously understate the problem and that people should have at 
least three weeks of basic supplies. She said President Clinton 
needs to take the lead in organizing a national fire drill this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bennett said there is a limit to what Washington can do. ``I  
don't think it's John Koskinen's responsibility or mine to run 
around to every local community and say the federal government is 
checking on you.''

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Tops $250 Million Mark / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Jedi Knights might be unbeatable in  
theaters now, but they could face their first real competition this 
weekend, when retro-secret agent ``Austin Powers'' swaggers into 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>

real match for the Force, opens Friday. Studios had steered clear 
of the space blockbuster or counter-programmed with romances and 
art films.

<HEADLINE> Trucks Escape Pollution Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Large diesel trucks belch out millions of tons  
of smog-causing chemicals and microscopic soot, yet face far weaker 
environmental controls than cars, state regulators and 
environmentalists complained today. 
</P>
<P>
	While the government pushes for cleaner-running cars and sport  
utility vehicles, the environmentalists and regulators said not 
enough is being done to cut pollution from the more than 5 million 
tractor-trailer rigs, dump trucks and other heavy vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's probably no more offensive air pollution than the  
thick, noxious pollution from big trucks,'' said Bill Becker, who 
represents state and county air pollution agencies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker joined environmental and public health groups at a news  
conference recommending cleaner diesel fuel and tougher emission 
controls on the smoke-belchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency has begun considering a  
requirement for low-sulfur diesel fuel, although no specific 
proposal has been issued. Two years ago, the EPA issued tougher 
emission controls on heavy trucks, to begin in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree that more may be required to reduce pollution from  
heavy trucks and buses, and we are presently considering the 
feasibility of more protective standards,'' EPA spokesman David 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollution from large trucks is gaining increased attention as  
the EPA is proposing dramatically tougher emission controls on cars 
and popular sport utility vehicles as well as cutting sulfur 
content in gasoline by 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of a series of public hearings on the proposed  
air-pollution rules for cars and the gasoline sulfur levels is 
convening Wednesday in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	But state regulators and environmentalists said trucks, although  
far smaller in numbers, comprise an equally huge air pollution 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5 million large trucks account for 3 million tons of  
smog-causing nitrogen oxide annually and half of the fine 
particulates, or soot, that come from mobile sources. Diesel fuel 
contains almost twice as much sulfur as even today's gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, regulation of large trucks is now at about the  
same stage as the regulation of cars in the mid-1970s, said Rick 
Kassel of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Unlike cars, large 
trucks are not required to have pollution-controlling catalytic 
converters, nor are they subject to annual emission inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Billings of the American Lung Association said tailpipe  
pollution from diesel trucks includes large amounts of soot, which 
is particularly dangerous because the microscopic particles imbed 
deeply into the lungs. Diesel particles also are toxic, raising the 
specter of cancer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA has regulated diesel truck emissions since the late  
1980s, reducing the amount of soot coming out of trucks by about 90 
percent. Releases of smog-causing nitrogen oxide also has been 
reduced and is expected to be cut further beginning in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker said advanced technologies -- catalytic converters and  
nitrogen oxide ``traps'' -- aren't going to be installed on heavy 
trucks until the amount of sulfur is dramatically reduced in the 
diesel fuel. Sulfur inhibits proper performance of pollution 
control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The petroleum industry has pledged to fight an EPA proposal to  
cut sulfur in gasoline from 300 parts per million to 30 parts per 
million and has aired misgivings about sulfur reductions in diesel 
fuel as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucking companies and independent drivers, meanwhile, have  
complained about the added cost of low-sulfur fuel as well as new 
costs associated with tighter truck emissions controls. Diesel 
engine manufacturers said they can meet the EPA's emissions 
requirements for 2004, but industry representatives have questioned 
whether additional reductions can be made without low-sulfur fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the state regulators and environmentalists said too  
little is being done to ensure trucks comply with existing emission 
standards. While diesel engines are certified after emissions tests 
at the factory, trucks are not subject to tests for soot or 
nitrogen oxide once on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, the Justice Department announced that more than  
1.1 million trucks, whose engines had passed emission inspections 
at the factory, actually were polluting much more than allowed 
because of devices designed to overcome emissions controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers agreed to a $1 billion settlement.

<HEADLINE> Inhofe To Protest Hormel Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative Republican Sen. James Inhofe  
threatened Tuesday to hold up ``every single presidential 
nomination'' to protest President Clinton's appointment of a gay 
philanthropist to be ambassador to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe, R-Okla., criticized Clinton for invoking a provision of  
the Constitution allowing him to bypass the Senate confirmation 
process by making a temporary appointment while Congress is in 
recess. Congress returned from a week-long Memorial Day break on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., joined Inhofe in  
criticizing Clinton, saying the president's move to appoint James 
Hormel on Friday was ``a subversion of the confirmation process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lott indicated he was unlikely to go along with Inhofe's  
blanket objection to presidential nominations. Several high-profile 
nominations are currently before the Senate, including that of 
Lawrence Summers to be treasury secretary and Richard Holbrooke to 
be ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, the former dean of the University of Chicago law school  
and a well-known San Francisco fund-raiser, is the nation's first 
openly gay U.S. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	By custom, any senator can block a presidential nomination by  
placing a parliamentary ``hold'' on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe said he was acting on a precedent set by Sen. Robert  
Byrd, D-W.Va., who in 1985 placed holds on President Reagan's 
appointments until Reagan agreed to refrain from making recess 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there is no formal rule on such ``holds,'' and they do  
not have to be honored by the Senate majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, despite his own opposition to Hormel's nomination, told  
reporters it ``would not be my inclination'' to allow any single 
senator to manage to single-handedly block every nomination. ``I 
wouldn't honor a hold indefinitely,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he conceded that Inhofe still had the right to use  
delaying tactics to slow down nominations on a case-by-case basis -- 
tactics that require a 60-vote majority in the 100-member Senate to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton has shown contempt for the Congress and the  
Constitution,'' Inhofe, R-Okla., said in a statement Monday. He 
called the appointment ``highly inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has forfeited the presumption of cooperation on  
any remaining appointments he wants to make while in office,'' 
Inhofe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced the ``recess appointment'' of Hormel last  
Friday. He made the appointment after a small group of conservative 
senators, led by Inhofe, was able to block the nomination for a 
year and a half -- and after Lott refused to bring it to the floor 
for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe at first listed seven nominations to which he was  
objecting. But Tuesday, in a Senate floor speech, Inhofe expanded 
his list, telling colleagues: ``I am putting holds on every single 
presidential nomination that comes from the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wasn't opposed to Hormel just because he was gay.  
``It is the fact that he is a gay activist that puts his agenda 
ahead of the agenda of America,'' Inhofe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven original nominees to which Inhofe has objected are:  
</P>
<P>
	--Gary S. Guzy of Washington, D.C., to be assistant administrator  
of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	--Diane Edith Watson of California, to be ambassador to  
Micronesia. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kenneth M. Bresnahan of Virginia, to be chief financial officer  
of the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
	--Carolyn L. Huntoon of Virginia to be assistant secretary of  
energy for environmental management. 
</P>
<P>
	--George T. Frampton, Jr., of Washington, D.C., to be a member of  
the Council on Environmental Quality. 
</P>
<P>
	--John T. Spotila of New Jersey, to be administrator of the  
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for the Office of 
Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
	--Thomas J. Erickson of Washington, D.C., to be a commissioner of  
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

<HEADLINE> Versace: Profits Fall Due to Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Italian fashion house Gianni Versace SpA  
said Tuesday that 1998 net profit fell 81 percent largely due to 
the Asian economic crisis, which cost it customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit was down to 16.5 billion lire (about $8.7 million) from  
87 billion lire ($46 million) a year earlier, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Santo Versace shot down speculation his group is  
seeking an alliance with another fashion group or a new financial 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not thinking of any partner,'' Versace told journalists.  
</P>
<P>
	He declined to comment, however, on reports the group is close  
to selling the lease to its flagship store in Milan to LVMH Moet 
Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the large French luxury goods group 
currently battling for control of Gucci NV.

<HEADLINE> $13M Crisis Center Opens in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A $13 million high-tech emergency center here  
has opened to criticism from some city officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50,000-square-foot complex was designed to serve as the  
command post during emergencies, but some city council members say 
the $1.4 million annual rent makes it little more than an expensive 
bunker for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his aides. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an incredible amount of money to enhance somebody else's  
property,'' Councilwoman Kathryn Freed said. ``We had a 
state-of-the-art emergency center in police headquarters, and I 
still don't understand why we needed this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Housed on the 23rd floor of a building near the twin towers of  
the World Trade Center, the center was built to withstand 
hurricane-force winds, bombs and power failures, and features walls 
reinforced with steel and Kevlar. It also has some of the world's 
most high-tech telecommunications and computer equipment, on which 
city officials can analyze digitized photos of sensitive subway, 
sewage and water lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Three generators guarantee continuous power, and there's enough  
food and water to sustain 100 city, state and federal officials for 
a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the threats confronting the city of New York for at least  
the next 50 years or so, this facility is probably as secure as it 
needs to be,'' said Jerry Hauer, head of the city's Office of 
Emergency Management. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, city officials gave opening day tours to the media  
and participated in a simulated terrorist drill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really state of the art -- the best I've seen,'' said  
Col. Robert Fitton of the Pentagon, one of the federal officials in 
the drill.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Asks GOP Colleagues To Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert shed his reactive  
leadership style today and told fractious Republicans to stop 
blocking votes on crucial bills or risk losing control of the 
chamber in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sixth month of a speakership that has seen the House GOP  
legislative agenda slow to a crawl, Hastert delivered a stern, 
17-minute lecture to his colleagues behind closed doors. And for 
one of the first times, the former high school wrestling coach 
whose trademark has been an ability to listen was the one demanding 
to be heard -- and followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My friends, you cannot be happy all the time,'' said Hastert,  
R-Ill., according to excerpts distributed by aides. ``Some days you 
have to give your leadership the benefit of the doubt and just 
follow. That is the difference between a majority mentality and a 
minority mentality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing his most immediate problem, Hastert ordered the House  
Appropriations Committee to make only relatively small cuts in the 
first group of spending bills for the coming fiscal year. A $270 
billion measure financing the Pentagon was expected to be exempted 
because of the GOP's strong pro-defense stance. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives had bogged down debate on the spending bills  
before Congress' Memorial Day break because they felt the measures 
were too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The first test of the new strategy was a success, as the House  
voted to trim $102 million from a $61 billion measure financing 
farm, food and drug programs. The near party-line vote was 234-195, 
with the reductions coming mostly in Agriculture Department 
building costs and Food and Drug Administration salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Only hours earlier, conservatives who had been delaying the  
agriculture bill halted their tactics as they embraced Hastert's 
planned cuts. The over-all bill was passed on a 246-183 vote. It 
was the first of the 13 bills for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, 
to pass the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert ordered the reductions to finally get the spending  
measures moving, and to free funds that can be added to later 
spending bills to enhance their chances of passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's larger concern was the November 2000 elections and  
worries that GOP infighting over spending, taxes, and other issues 
are undermining their chances of retaining House control. Those 
internal differences are magnified by the GOP's thin majority, in 
which defections by just six Republicans can defeat a GOP 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need you to stand together,'' said Hastert. ``To move  
forward together. To not just cry out for leadership, but be 
willing to follow it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, a 13-year House veteran, delivered his remarks in the  
same Capitol basement meeting room in which he was hastily selected 
to be speaker last December. That came after the speaker designate, 
former Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., resigned from Congress after 
admitting to extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Praise for Hastert's remarks came from both conservative and  
moderate Republicans, some of whom contrasted them with the more 
fiery style of his predecessor, former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just appealed to everybody to be part of the team,'' said  
conservative Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla. ``We weren't called 
stupid once. ... Nobody was taken to task for questioning the 
genius of the Republican leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, few thought Hastert's words would solve the GOP's  
legislative problems, especially on spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	By honoring spending caps and delivering a promised $19 billion  
increase for defense, domestic spending bills would be more than 
$30 billion short of what Clinton wants to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the extra $7 billion Republicans hope to find from  
trimming some bills and selling part of the broadcast spectrum, at 
least three bills covering health, veterans, commerce and other 
programs are likely to fall well short of what Clinton will demand. 
That is likely to lead to negotiations with Clinton this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said it will be a ``long, hot  
summer. It's going to be difficult, we know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, ranking Democrat on the  
Appropriations committee, said, ``They're still wandering in the 
wilderness, and will until they're willing to face (the) reality in 
October'' that billions more will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Differences remained among Republicans over other complicated  
issues such as which taxes to cut, how strictly to limit access to 
guns, the Kosovo intervention and whether to overhaul campaign 
finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said that to underline the GOP's message as the party of  
fiscal restraint, Republicans would insist on keeping the spending 
bills within limits required by the 1997 budget-balancing pact with 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing to spend more would put Republicans in the position of  
defending the balanced budget and Social Security, he said, since 
any additional spending would have to come from the pension 
program's surpluses. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Patriots Release Cornerback Canty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- The New England Patriots gave up on former  
first-round draft pick Chris Canty, releasing the cornerback 
Tuesday after two years with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Canty started the first nine games last season at right  
cornerback before being replaced by Steve Israel for the last seven 
games. Canty started one game as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	By releasing Canty, the 29th pick in the 1997 draft out of  
Kansas State, the Patriots gain salary cap room to sign their 1999 
draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Canty also struggled for most of the two years.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chris did not take full advantage of his opportunity with the  
Patriots,'' coach Pete Carroll said. ``I'm encouraged by the work 
and commitment shown by many of our players and expect great 
competition at that position in camp this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the veterans at right cornerback are Israel, 1998  
first-round pick Tebucky Jones and Kato Serwanga. All-Pro Ty Law 
plays the other cornerback position. 
</P>
<P>
	Canty, 23, had 79 tackles, one interception and three sacks in  
his two seasons. The interception came against Peyton Manning, the 
top pick in last year's NFL draft, in the Patriots' home opener 
against Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Canty also played last season on special teams, returning 11  
kickoffs for 198 yards and 16 punts for 170 yards. He had eight 
special teams tackles.

<HEADLINE> Bravo Won't Air Teen Sniper Segment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Bravo cable network said it won't air a  
satire about a ``teen sniper school'' produced by filmmaker Michael 
Moore because of public sensitivities following the Columbine High 
School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-minute segment, produced five months before the April  
20 shooting in Colorado, was to run on Moore's Bravo series, ``The 
Awful Truth,'' this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said his satire takes easy access to guns to its ``logical  
extreme,'' by arming children and teaching them to be better shots 
as part of the school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	Bravo didn't object to the content, but felt the timing was  
inappropriate, spokeswoman Sommer Hixson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping after some time goes by the original intent of  
the satire will be more clear to viewers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no telling when viewers will get that chance; the  
season's last episode of ``The Awful Truth'' airs June 27 and Bravo 
hasn't decided whether to renew it. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine and the focus on violence in television has left  
programmers skittish lately. CBS cited the massacre in leaving a 
violent drama off its fall schedule, and the WB postponed the 
season-ending episode of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' because it 
depicted high school students taking up arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequently, there's been a booming business in bootleg  
``Buffy'' tapes circulating through the Internet after the episode 
aired in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, producer of the documentary ``Roger &AMP; Me,'' said in an  
e-mail message to fans that while he respected Bravo's point of 
view, he disagreed with the decision to censor ``The Awful Truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the main functions of satire is to confront the  
uncomfortable issues,'' he wrote. ``Satire is not supposed to be 
the kind of Comedy Lite you can find on every other channel. Satire 
assumes the audience has a brain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said he offered to add a statement to his report that  
said, in effect, that it took 25 years after the King and Kennedy 
assassinations to get the Brady gun control bill passed, yet 
legislation happened much more quickly after shootings in Colorado 
and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the only way to get true gun control in this country  
is for there to be more school shootings,'' Moore offered to write. 
</P>
<P>
	Bravo didn't go for that, either.

<HEADLINE> China Issues New commodities Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China completed an overhaul of its  
commodities exchanges Tuesday by announcing new rules that strip 
local authorities of the power to regulate trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms, begun last year, reduced the number of exchanges  
from 14 to three and standardized regulation that had been in the 
hands of local officials who sometimes manipulated markets for 
their own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules ban trading outside the markets and give the main  
government regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, 
power to decide who runs the exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	That mirrors changes imposed last year on securities markets  
after years of haphazard, locally run regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, announced by the official Xinhua News Agency, impose  
guidelines for traders and brokerages. Violators can be fined up to 
$60,000 or imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Exchanges in Shanghai, the central city of Zhengzhou and the  
northeastern city of Dalian trade rubber, cotton, copper, aluminum, 
grain and other farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	Xinhua said the new rules were temporary, but would remain in  
place until China's legislature passes national regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last year, regulators have tried to tighten oversight of  
China's commodities exchanges, raising margin requirements and 
auditing brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of brokerages have been closed for irregularities.  
</P>
<P>
	Traders say as many as half of China's 300 futures-trading firms  
could close because of stricter regulation.

<HEADLINE> NYC Show Adds Sound to Mime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shane Dundas says he wanted to drag pantomime  
into the 1990s and decided the answer was sound. 
</P>
<P>
	So, on stage at off-Broadway's Minetta Lane Theater, Dundas,  
with a microphone, and David Collins, generally silent as the mime 
or ``action guy,'' are performing a zany show named ``Thwak.'' They 
bill themselves as the Umbilical Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's whimsical, inventive and clever but, because it's basically  
vaudevillian comedy, without a plot or even a real thread, it can 
wear out its welcome even though it lasts only 80 minutes. While 
some in the audience were finding it hilarious, we found the 
whimsy's appeal evaporating quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	With his mouth, Dundas makes more noises than Bobby McFerrin.  
The evening starts with Collins miming fighting a big animal and 
bees while Dundas makes their noises. An imaginary dog is thrown 
and heard to splatter, a tank is driven and a grenade explodes -- 
all from Dundas' mouth. ``No dogs were harmed during that last 
sequence,'' he intones. 
</P>
<P>
	As the show progresses, Collins becomes the nice guy and Dundas  
the meanie. A short wall emerges and they go behind it and lift up 
hand puppets. Dundas is cruel to a cute bunny puppet, which makes 
Collins cry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Umbilical Brothers work hard to present variety. There are a  
couple of rather tame skits in which the two play stiff German 
comics. At different times each declares, ``All the imaginary 
props, I made them. I'm the creative force behind this show.'' 
During a musical interlude, Collins promises five hours of ballads 
and Dundas rattles marbles in a bucket. Horses are heard to gallop 
on, jump into water and get shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thwak'' moved off-Broadway from the off-off-Broadway Westbeth  
Theater. Philip WM. McKinley, whose credits include the circus, 
directed. Collins and Dundas, who created the show they perform, 
met as drama students in Sydney, Australia. Since 1991, they have 
toured widely.

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Courting NBA Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore is actively pursuing an NBA team to  
play in a proposed $200 million, 19,000-seat downtown arena, a city 
official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles C. Graves III, the city's planning director, said he has  
spoken in the past 30 days with ``high-ranking team officials'' 
from several NBA teams, who have the authority to decide whether to 
relocate the franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	Graves said he has spoken to officials from the San Antonio  
Spurs, who will play in the upcoming NBA Finals, and the Sacramento 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Kings spokesman Troy Hanson denied his team was involved in  
talks with Baltimore officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke with the incoming president, John Thomas, and he says  
there is definitely no truth to that,'' Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings and the 17,317-seat Arco Arena were sold in January to  
a group headed by Joe and Gavin Maloof, who will take control on 
July 1. Hanson said the Maloof family is looking to stay in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanson said the 11-year-old Arco Arena is a prototype for modern  
NBA facilities, with luxury boxes and club seats. The Kings are 
happy with their home and there has been no talk in Sacramento 
about replacing the arena or moving the team, Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs play in the Alamodome, which was built for football  
and seats between 20,557 and 34,215 for basketball. Team officials 
have made no secret of the fact that they want a new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call by The Associated Press seeking comment from  
the Spurs was not immediately returned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the new arena is under construction, an NBA team moving to  
Baltimore would play for at least two years in the 36-year-old 
Baltimore Arena, which seats 11,200 and has a permanent concert 
stage at one end. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Basketball League's flagship franchise, the  
Baltimore Bay Runners, will open play in the Baltimore Arena 
Thanksgiving weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Smith, the team's acting president and league vice  
president, said he was not surprised to hear that the city was 
negotiating for an NBA team, adding that he did not perceive the 
talks as a threat to his team or league.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup Goalies Set for Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dominik Hasek put two frustrating seasons playing  
behind Ed Belfour to good use. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I watched him every game, even during practice,  
looking at him to see what he was doing,'' Hasek said Monday, a day 
before his Buffalo Sabres meet Belfour's Dallas Stars in Game 1 of 
the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour was the starter and Hasek the backup for Chicago in  
1990-91 and '91-92. The Blackhawks had hockey's best record the 
first season, and they reached the Stanley Cup finals the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour played 145 regular-season and playoff games in that  
span. Hasek was used in 31, then was traded to Buffalo the next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	With plenty of time on the bench in Chicago, Hasek studied every  
aspect of Belfour's game. One of the things Hasek noticed most was 
Belfour's feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a very good skater,'' Hasek said. ``He always  
tries to be in the right position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When either is caught away from the net, both get back by using  
a skating style akin to pedaling. Hasek said it's not a 
coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he started to pedal on the ice before I started to do  
it,'' Hasek said. ``I don't know who started to do it first. Many 
people say I was the first, but I think he was the first to pedal 
on the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour said he remembers Hasek forcing him to always play his  
best, even in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were always competitive in the drills,'' Belfour said.  
``He'd always compete hard and so would I. It made us both 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither goalie has been in the finals since the Blackhawks were  
swept by Pittsburgh seven seasons ago. Whoever wins this series 
will bring his franchise its first title. 
</P>
<P>
	Every hockey player works his entire life for the chance to put  
his name on the Cup. It's especially significant to be the starting 
goalie on a championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek already has earned a reputation as the world's best  
goalie, even without a title. Belfour, however, is often considered 
a second-tier player because he hasn't been a winner when it 
matters most. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to say whatever they dream up,'' Belfour  
said. ``I know what I've done and what I can do. My teammates 
always support me and back me and that's all that matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek also says the label is unfair.  
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie is a great goaltender and a very competitive person,''  
Hasek said. ``I don't think he gets enough credit because he never 
won the Stanley Cup. I don't think he has any weaknesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goalies insist they are friendly rivals. Hasek added that  
their wives are close and that their kids played together for 
several hours at this year's All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	If there was any tension during their Chicago days, both say it  
was nothing more than a healthy dose of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough relationship because he felt I was the person  
who could take his job and I felt he took my job,'' Hasek said. 
``When we see each other off the ice now, we always say hello. I 
respect him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour smiled and laughed when asked if there was a problem  
with their 1-2 status in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see anything wrong with it,'' he said. ``Maybe he had  
a problem with it because I was the No. 1 guy. But I didn't ever 
have a problem with Dominik. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always enjoyed the challenge of competing against  
Dominik, even when it was in practice. He's a competitor and I love 
competition. I think it's going to be a great opportunity to play 
against him again.''

	LYNWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Two teen-age cousins were shot to death  
by a young man as they walked to school today. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were looking for a man  
described as being in his 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivia Munguia, 17, and Jessica Yvette Zavala, 15, were shot  
numerous times about 7:45 a.m. as they walked to Lynwood High

	Relatives of the teens said Munguia's ex-boyfriend was upset  
about being barred from Zavala's weekend birthday party. The former 
boyfriend called, using profanity and told Munguia, ``it's not 
over,'' Albert Ontiveros, a cousin, told KNBC-TV.

<HEADLINE> Report: Ganga To Resign Olympic Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Jean-Claude Ganga, expelled  
from the International Olympic Committee for corruption, plans to 
resign in September as president of the Association of National 
Olympic Committees of Africa, a South African official said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no choice,'' Dan Moyo, secretary general of the  
National Olympic Committee of South Africa, said in a telephone 
interview. ``His own Olympic committee in Congo excluded him in May 
elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moyo said ANOCA bylaws bar the organization from expelling  
Ganga, who participates in the organization as an individual. He 
was elected president by the ANOCA general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga announced his intention to resign at a Paris meeting in  
May of the worldwide Association of National Olympics Committees, 
Moyo said. He said Ganga would resign at a special ANOCA meeting in 
September in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Moyo did not know why Ganga was waiting to resign.  
</P>
<P>
	``That question you can ask him,'' Moyo said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ganga could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Ganga and five other IOC members were expelled in March and four  
others resigned for taking over $1 million in bribes and 
inducements from Salt Lake City's successful bidders for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga was singled out by the committee for receiving nearly  
$270,000 in improper inducements -- by far the most of any member. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga denied the charges and called the investigation a ``plot  
against the Third World.'' The other five who were expelled were 
from Ecuador, Sudan, Mali, Chile and Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a U.S. congressional investigation, the 1996  
Atlanta Olympics bid committee also gave scholarship money to Ganga 
for two Congolese girls to attend a tennis camp in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Young, the former Atlanta mayor who was one of the  
leaders of Atlanta's bid, defended Ganga, saying he was looking out 
for his country and for other African countries.

<HEADLINE> Boston Office Rents Most Expensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Forget about New York and San Francisco: the city  
with the most expensive office space in the nation is Boston, 
according to a new survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Average rents for Boston's Class A office buildings were $47.93  
per square foot during the first quarter of 1999, according to the 
nationwide commercial real estate company Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. 
</P>
<P>
	That's 15 cents more than the $47.78 price per square foot in  
midtown Manhattan. San Francisco has the third-most expensive 
office space in the country, at $46.08 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, D.C., came next at $38.19 a square foot, followed by  
Chicago at $31.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's vacancy rate was also significantly lower than the  
other top cities, at 4.1 percent. New York was 6.5 percent, San 
Francisco 6.1, Washington 6.6 and Chicago 10.8. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last year, Boston's average rent has jumped $10, more than  
28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	At International Place in the city's Financial District, office  
space is pushing $70 per square foot. Last year, the cost topped 
$60. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, a change in the rent by 50 cents or $1 a square foot  
is a big deal, because it goes right to the bottom line,'' said 
Donald Chiofaro, the developer/owner of International Place, told 
the Boston Herald. ``We have a motivation to get the highest 
rent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with new office space being built downtown, Boston still  
doesn't have enough to meet demand. The city is absorbing office 
space at a rate of more than 1 million square feet each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of high-end offices in Boston are following Chiofaro's  
lead in deciding what to charge. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chiofaro said he realizes that the buildings must deliver  
great value, or people will stop paying top rents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that cities are enjoying the greatest  
popularity of my career, and Boston is among the greatest cities,'' 
said Chiofaro, whose twin International Place towers overlook 
Boston Harbor.

<HEADLINE> East Bakes in Pre-Summer Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Temperatures rose toward record highs again  
today in the East, overpowering antiperspirants and straining 
electric utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	With the official start of summer two weeks away, the season  
arrived early from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Ocean as 
highs climbed into the 90s on Monday. Today, the temperature in New 
York's Central Park was already 88 by 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Air conditioners were cranked up to full blast and the biggest  
supplier of electricity in Connecticut, Northeast Utilities, warned 
today that the demand has taxed the New England power grid. 
</P>
<P>
	If the region loses just one generator, utilities will have have  
to cut power in some areas if people don't conserve, said Northeast 
Utilities spokeswoman Deborah Beauchamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very serious,'' Beauchamp said.  
</P>
<P>
	ISO New England, which manages the region's power supply, had  
already issued a power warning on Monday, asking consumers to cut 
their electricity usage and warning that the situation could be 
worse today. 
</P>
<P>
	But how hot is it, really?  
</P>
<P>
	Delivery man Luis Justiniano had to stop Monday and stick his  
head in the refrigerated cargo section of his truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real bad,'' he said, mopping the sweat from his brow. ``I  
started work at 6 a.m. and it was bad already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York State Thruway, it wasn't just the heat, it was  
the Hondas. 
</P>
<P>
	Albany's record 94-degree heat got toll collector Jack Rice in  
every direction -- from above, reflected by the asphalt below and 
blasting from the side by the 500 vehicles per hour that revved 
through his toll plaza on the thruway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try not to pay attention to the weather,'' said Rice, a  
veteran of 12 summers in tiny thruway booths. ``It would be 
unbearable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland, Maine, topped out at 95, a full 10 degrees over the  
date's record and the hottest day there since July 1995. 
Harrisburg, Pa., peaked at 96, tying a June 7 record on the books 
since 1925. 
</P>
<P>
	The mercury climbed to 99 degrees at Newark International  
Airport in New Jersey, breaking the day's old record high of 95 set 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 172,000 people heading to New York City's seven public  
beaches, which normally see about 20,000 visitors on a weekday at 
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at Brookline Ice and Coal in Brookline, Mass.,  
shuttled from the freezer's frigid air to the sweltering outdoors 
as they tried to meet the demand from hotels, grocery stores, and 
ice cream and coffee shops. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ramirez Drops Appeal With MLB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Manny Ramirez won't be able to add to his RBI  
total over the next few days against the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Indians outfielder, leading the majors with 68  
RBIs, dropped his appeal Tuesday and began serving his three-game 
suspension for charging the mound against Detroit last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez will miss the Indians' entire three-game series against  
Milwaukee but will return for Friday's opener in Cincinnati against 
the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Ramirez for three games doesn't hurt the Indians now as  
much as it would on the weekend when Cleveland's pitchers will be 
required to hit in an NL ballpark as interleague play continues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he did it now,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said.  
``It would have been tough to play another man short in 
Cincinnati.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez and his agent, Eric Goldschmidt, decided to drop the  
appeal after they were informed by the American League that 
president Gene Budig was contemplating flying to Cleveland on 
Wednesday to hear Ramirez's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez was suspended for the first time in his career for  
charging Detroit rookie pitcher Jeff Weaver in a May 22 game at 
Jacobs Field. Ramirez was hit in the batting helmet in the bottom 
of the sixth by Weaver, who may have been retaliating for Indians 
pitcher Jaret Wright hitting Tigers' first baseman Tony Clark in 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright and Weaver were fined for their roles in the  
bench-clearing incident but not suspended. However, Wright, who had 
been suspended earlier in the season for hitting Boston's Darren 
Lewis, was called into Budig's office last week in New York to 
discuss the pitcher's behavior on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, who bats cleanup for the Indians, is hitting .344 with  
14 homers and is currently on pace to drive in 204 runs this 
season. In his career against Milwaukee, Ramirez is hitting .347 
(58-for-167) with nine homers and 27 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you lose a player like Manny Ramirez it hurts your  
lineup,'' said Hargrove, who batted Jim Thome in the No. 4 slot 
Tuesday night. ``Two of the hardest holes to fill in the lineup are 
leadoff hitter and the No. 4 hole. Fortunately we have some players 
who can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Justice played right field in Ramirez's absence and Richie  
Sexson started in left. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Fryman was a late scratch from Cleveland's starting  
lineup because of back spasms. He was replaced at third base by 
Enrique Wilson.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Futures Drop; Energy, Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coffee futures tumbled today on the Board of Trade of the City  
of New York amid forecasts of warm winter weather in Brazil that 
call for little chance of bean-damaging frosts. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, energy, soybean and grain futures settled  
higher -- also due to factors related to the warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say coffee traders are keeping an eye on South American  
weather, where winter temperatures never fell below the mid-40s 
over the weekend. Forecasters also say there is little chance of 
temperatures falling below the freezing mark in the next week to 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	That news -- coupled with a bearish Commitments of Traders report  
Friday -- caused July arabica coffee to fall 8 cents to $1.12 a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	One coffee analyst said Monday's results represented typical  
post-weekend behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market tends to firm up as the weekend approaches in case  
of any surprises,'' said Judy Ganes, first president at Merrill 
Lynch &AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Those surprises might include a frost, which didn't happen,  
causing traders to give back gains posted late last week, Ganes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, natural gas futures continued their climb on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	With summer reserves below normal and domestic production weaker  
than usual, analysts say traders were reacting to forecasts of 
continued hot weather through much of the country -- a factor that 
is likely to force utilities to use more fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures also finished higher -- in part in response to  
a statement from Nigerian President Olusegun Abasanjo that his 
country's state-run oil company will honor to its agreement with 
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to produce 
1.885 million barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for July delivery rose 4 cents to $2.437 for each  
1,000 cubic feet; July unleaded gasoline rose 1.51 cents to 50.11 
cents a gallon; July heating oil rose 1.56 cents to 41.29 cents a 
gallon; and July crude rose 58 cents to $17.32 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, soybean and grain futures prices finished higher on  
the Chicago Board of Trade though they retreated from a Monday 
morning rally that saw July soybeans up more than 8 cents a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Again forecasts for above-normal temperatures in the next week  
played a role -- the thought being that hot, dry weather could 
damage early planted crops and result in smaller crops and, thus, 
higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say traders backed off from some of those concerns  
by midday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoughts that dry weather will aid in the harvest of winter  
wheat also kept wheat futures in check, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 cent to $2.57 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn was up 1 3/4 cent to $2.22 1/2 a bushel; July oats rose 3 cents to 
$1.26 1/2 a bushel; and July soybeans were up 3 3/4 cents to $4.68 1/4 a 
bushel.

<HEADLINE> Pretrial Rulings Made in Intel Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that Intel  
Corp. had no license to use Intergraph patented technology in its 
Pentium family of processors, rejecting Intel's argument that the 
patents were included in an old agreement with National 
Semiconductor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The pretrial ruling by U.S. District Judge Edwin Nelson was an  
early blow for Intel in its defense against a lawsuit brought by 
Intergraph of Huntsville, a workstation manufacturer, in November 
1997. Intergraph contends Intel, which makes computer chips, 
infringed on its patents, used coercive business practices and 
violated antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson's ruling addressed only Intel's claim of a licensing  
agreement governing the Intergraph patents. The allegations of 
patent infringement, antitrust violations and illegal practices 
will be addressed at a trial in February 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Intergraph, Bill Baxley of Birmingham, did not  
immediately return a call seeking comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the news release, Intergraph Chairman and Chief Executive Jim  
Meadlock said Intel repeatedly has claimed they have a license to 
the ``Clipper'' chip patents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court affirms they don't have such a license,'' Meadlock  
said. ``We believe the entire Pentium family infringes on our 
patents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Intel, Chuck Mulloy, said Monday an appeal of  
Nelson's order was being considered. But the license claim was only 
one of several defenses Intel planned to raise in the lawsuit, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed and we respectfully disagree with the  
judge,'' Mulloy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intergraph makes computer workstations mated to its software,  
with the core of its business involving elaborate computer graphics 
for technical design, mapping and animation. For a time, Intergraph 
used its own high-end microprocessor, the ``Clipper,'' in its 
workstations but later moved to an Intel-based system and abandoned 
the Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	Intergraph claims when it tried to enforce the Clipper patent,  
Intel denied the company technical information and advance copies 
of new microchips -- both crucial to developing new products. 
Intergraph also contends Intel chips were made using Intergraph 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel claims it did nothing illegal. In the motion denied by  
Nelson, the chipmaker claimed the Clipper technology fell under a 
long-standing cross-license agreement with NSC. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Intergraph news release, Intergraph and NSC  
each bought parts of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. in concurrent 
transactions in 1987. Intergraph bought Fairchild's Advanced 
Processor Division, the original developer of the Clipper chip, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The undisputed facts establish that NSC had no legal authority  
to grant a license, as the patents at issue belonged not to NSC but 
to a legally distinct corporation -- Fairchild,'' Nelson wrote in 
his order. ``Intel thus never received a license from any entity 
with the power to grant one. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamental flaw in Intel's license defense is that the  
alleged license would have originated from NSC, while the Clipper 
patents quite clearly belonged not to NSC but to Fairchild, a 
separate corporation,'' Nelson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulloy said the judge's ruling had ``very broad and  
unprecedented implications'' for the high-tech industry.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Warned About Phone Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The American Association of Retired Persons  
wants to get the drop on fraudulent telemarketers who prey on the 
elderly by dropping a dime first. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer on Monday joined a group of  
AARP ``fraud fighters'' Monday, phoning senior citizens around the 
state to warn them they may be targeted by scam artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Spitzer admitted some seniors may not appreciate  
getting cold calls from a stranger -- even New York's attorney 
general -- he said it's important to warn them that they may be on 
so-called ``mooch lists'' circulated, sold and traded among illicit 
solicitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI provided lists of seniors to call based on scam artists'  
call sheets. Three years ago the FBI found a mooch list in a 
fraudulent telemarketer operation that had the telephone numbers of 
6,500 elderly New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we are here to turn the tables on the fraudulent  
telemarketers,'' AARP state President Charles Leaven said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Office for the Aging says 85 percent of those targeted  
by fraudulent telemarketers are older than age 65. Officials claim 
about one in every 10 telemarketers are dishonest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Bureau of Investigation says telemarketing fraud has  
grown to an industry that draws between $40 billion and $60 billion 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The most likely ways that telemarketers strike are by saying  
that a person has won a big prize, asking for contributions to a 
charity or promising to get back money from an earlier scam. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton County District Attorney Penelope Clute has a special  
stake in the programs. She said a con man bilked her mother out of 
$76,000 over several years through a phony telephone sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother was promised big prizes if she bought the caller's  
products, but the prizes never came, Clute said. She even got taken 
in by someone calling to tell her that they would help get her 
money back if she sent them some more, Clute said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was tricked, lied to and had her money stolen,'' Clute  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a 2 1/2-year undercover investigation by federal and  
state law enforcers in 38 states tape-recorded telephone scams and 
brought criminal charges against nearly 1,000 telemarketers.

<HEADLINE> Launch Failure Under Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Ikonos 1 Earth-imaging satellite launched in  
April failed to reach orbit because of an electrical problem, 
according to preliminary findings released Tuesday by a Lockheed 
Martin investigation team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lockheed Martin Anomaly Investigation Team suggested that  
the aerodynamic covering over the payload failed to come off 
properly because of a problem with an electrical signal. The 
problem with the electrical signal may have been caused by open 
circuits in redundant connectors, according to the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite, being launched for the private Space Imaging,  
Inc., and the fourth stage of the Athena II rocket, disappeared 
shortly after liftoff on April 27 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The fairing was supposed to separate and fall away from the  
rocket after it passed through the atmosphere. It weighs 1,143 
pounds and the extra weight prevented the rocket from achieving 
enough velocity to reach orbit, the Denver-based rocket builder 
said after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation by Lockheed Martin into what went wrong is  
ongoing.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- One of the books includes flattering and  
relatively tame details of a politician's career; the other reveals

quirks. 
</P>
<P>
	Guess which one is the autobiography, and which is the

	Quietly competing with Ventura's ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed''  
on the national bookshelves this month is ``Body Slam,'' a 246-page

<HEADLINE> Michigan State Fullback Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The projected starting fullback on  
the Michigan State football team has been suspended indefinitely 
after being charged Tuesday in connection with a riot at the school 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Greene, 22, was arraigned on a misdemeanor charge of  
assembling for a riot. It is punishable by 90 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	He also faces a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge --  
unrelated to the riot -- which carries a $25 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 10,000 people ran through the streets of East Lansing  
on March 27-28 after Michigan State's basketball team lost to Duke 
in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge alleges that Greene was present ``for the purpose of  
engaging in conduct constituting the crime of riot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The offense is so minor, you would wonder why it's even being  
charged,'' said Greene's attorney, Stuart Shafer. ``He was just 
standing around. He didn't do any damage to anything. He didn't 
burn any cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shafer said Greene put out a car fire the night of the riot.  
</P>
<P>
	``He saw the car on fire and grabbed a fire extinguisher,''  
Shafer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene stood silent Tuesday in East Lansing District Court,  
which means the court enters a plea of innocent on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene was already on probation with the football program for  
previous run-ins with the law, Michigan State coach Nick Saban 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Greene was charged with two counts of home invasion, a  
felony, stemming from a theft at a university residence hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The marijuana charge relates to a June 3 incident involving  
Greene at an apartment where police discovered the drug in an 
ashtray, Shafer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, who has one year of eligibility remaining, elevated  
himself from a career backup to the No. 1 fullback during spring 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Student-athletes who are on probation from their team remain on  
scholarship, but lose privileges such as use of the weight room and 
sharing team meals. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene's brother, Scott played at Michigan State from 1992-95  
and plays for the Indianapolis Colts.

<HEADLINE> Wisc. Co. Sues Japanese Copper Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A Wisconsin metal dealer sued a Japanese  
company Tuesday, claiming it formed a cartel with other companies 
to inflate copper prices worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Watertown-based Loeb Industries, along with a Los Angeles Scrap  
Iron &AMP; Metal Corp, filed the lawsuit against Tokyo-based Sumitomo 
Corp., claiming it engaged in price-fixing. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action lawsuit also names New York-based Global  
Minerals and Metals Corp., a copper merchant firm that entered into 
a series of contracts with Sumitomo from 1994-1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cartel drove up copper prices by hoarding supplies of  
physical copper and entering into paper transactions among the 
members of the group designed to appear as trading activity and to 
provide price support for the spot copper market,'' the lawsuit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Physical copper includes primary and scrap copper.  
</P>
<P>
	Loeb and Los Angeles Scrap Iron &AMP; Metal, who both purchase  
physical copper, claim they were harmed by the increase in prices. 
The plaintiffs also said the lawsuit should cover all U.S. copper 
or metals dealers who purchased copper from June 1994 to June 15, 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left with an attorney for Loeb was not immediately  
returned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Haveles, an attorney for Global Minerals and Metals, said  
the price increase in physical copper had nothing to do with the 
company's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company believes that the allegations made against it have  
no merit and wholly ignore that the price of copper rose during the 
mid-1990s solely as a result of the well-recognized substantial 
deficit of physical copper due solely to a dramatic increase in 
worldwide economic activity and copper consumption during that time 
period,'' Haveles said. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1996, Sumitomo said it lost $2.6 billion from the  
unauthorized trading by one of its traders, Yasuo Hamanaka. It has 
since paid millions of dollars in class action lawsuits filed by 
copper traders and others over trading in Japan and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamanaka was sentenced to eight years in prison in March 1998 by  
the Tokyo District Court on forgery and fraud convictions. Sumitomo 
has filed a separate civil lawsuit against Hamanaka. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Sumitomo Corp. refused to comment on the  
lawsuit. ``We have not seen the details of the complaint and can't 
make any comments until we do,'' Sumitomo spokesman Masahito 
Teramoto said.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Teen To Claim Mental Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Kip Kinkel, the teen-ager accused of  
murdering his parents and then killing two students in a shooting 
rampage at his Springfield high school, will use a mental illness 
defense that could someday result in his freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel, 16, goes on trial as an adult on Sept. 27. He will not  
face the death penalty because he was only 15 when the crime took 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court papers released Monday, his lawyers will  
present three legal theories. 
</P>
<P>
	They will argue that Kinkel suffers a mental disease or defect  
that prevented him from understanding his conduct was criminal, or 
prevented him from obeying the law. If that succeeds, he would be 
found guilty but insane and would be confined for treatment until a 
court decides he can be released. 
</P>
<P>
	The other defense avenues are partial responsibility, in which  
Kinkel's lawyers would claim he couldn't form the intent to commit 
the crimes because of mental disease or defect, and extreme 
emotional disturbance. They could lead to manslaughter convictions 
rather than murder. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Doug Harcleroad would not comment because of a  
court order barring the two sides from discussing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in court papers, prosecutors have said Kinkel was alert  
and responsive to questions after the shootings. They noted that he 
has no history of mental disease and did not seem to be hearing 
voices, suffering hallucinations or exhibiting other symptoms of a 
breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel is accused of fatally shooting his parents, Bill and  
Faith Kinkel, on May 20, 1998, then going the next day to Thurston 
High School, killing two students and wounding 22 others.

<HEADLINE> Off-Peak Summer Flights Discounted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Major airlines cut ticket prices today by as much  
as 25 percent for off-peak summer travel, with United Airlines 
setting off the fare war just a day after that carrier warned of 
weak quarterly profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines  
were among ther first to match the United promotion on domestic and 
international travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be competitive with United,'' Delta spokeswoman Kay  
Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the promotion, consumers who purchase tickets for advance  
travel only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays could see as much 
as a 25 percent discount over regularly priced tickets. The airline 
also capped advanced round-trip ticket purchases for peak travel 
days at $498. 
</P>
<P>
	The promotion, in which tickets must be purchased by June 18,  
applies to travel through the end of September. On domestic 
flights, the sale allows two companions of any age to buy tickets 
at even sharper discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a ticket for round-trip travel from Chicago to New  
York would cost $238, while companions could purchase tickets for 
$138 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks fell after the fare cuts were announced. In  
midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, United parent UAL 
was down $2.37 1/2 a share, or 3.6 percent, at $64; American Airlines 
parent AMR was down $2.75, or 4 percent, at $66.93 3/4; and Delta was 
down $1.62 1/2, or 2.7 percent, at $59.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is similar to a more restricted promotion launched last  
week by Northwest Airlines that was due to expire in a few days. 
The sale introduced by United, and now matched by Northwest and the 
other carriers, allows for travel on Saturdays and sets no age 
limit on companion travel. 
</P>
<P>
	United spokesman Joe Hopkins said consumers who previously  
purchased tickets under the old fares can get a travel credit for 
the difference or can get a cash refund after paying a $75 
ticket-change fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The fare sales undercut a 4 percent boost in ticket prices  
instituted last week by major airlines and comes as the carriers 
are finding an unexpectedly large number of empty seats despite 
strong summer bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen percent of Americans are expected to fly this summer,  
up 3 percent from a year ago, according to the Travel Industry 
Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, United warned Monday that second-quarter earnings would  
fall far short of Wall Street forecasts of $3.10 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the major carriers are taking delivery of new planes at  
a rate faster than retirement of old ones. That increases their 
seating capacity and causes the percentage of seats filled, or load 
factor, to drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Several airline analysts have warned in the past year that  
carriers were putting themselves in such a precarious position as 
they went on a plane-buying spree in the face of three years of 
record profits.

<HEADLINE> Getronics Completes Wang Global Buy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch communications technology  
company Getronics NV said Tuesday it has completed its $2 billion 
acquisition of U.S.-based Wang Global. 
</P>
<P>
	Getronics said it has received stocks and stock warrants  
representing 90.7 percent of the outstanding common shares of Wang. 
Getronics said the remaining shares would be exchanged for the 
right to receive cash. 
</P>
<P>
	With the deal, Getronics becomes one of the five largest  
computer-services companies in the world, with annual sales of 
around $4.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Getronics said it will rename the existing Wang Global companies  
Getronics in most of Europe, Latin America and Asia, and 
GetronicsWang in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang was founded in 1951 by An Wang, a Chinese immigrant who  
came to the United States to earn a Ph.D. at Harvard University. 
Then known as Wang Laboratories, the firm began with Wang's $600 in 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company peaked in the mid 1980s when it manufactured word  
processors and closet-sized ``minicomputers,'' but it stumbled 
badly later in the decade when it failed to negotiate the computing 
world's transition to modern networked and desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this deal, Amsterdam-based Getronics had no presence in  
the United States. It has about 11,000 employees and provides 
information and computer services in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Rabbi Sentenced in Bingo Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A rabbi who skimmed hundreds of thousands of  
dollars from the sale of instant bingo cards was given three years 
of probation Tuesday and ordered to do 400 hours of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Jacob Lustig, 72, was also ordered to forfeit more than  
$920,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Fred Cartolano spared Lustig and three others from prison  
but said: ``You'll always be remembered as a felon, as a thief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lustig was rabbi of Kneseth Israel Congregation for more than 20  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of bingo cards with scratch-off or otherwise hidden  
numbers brought in more than $1 million in cash in 1996 and 1997, 
but his congregation received only $25,000 of that. 
</P>
<P>
	Lustig and the others pleaded guilty May 7 to theft.

<HEADLINE> Jitney Jungle's Leaders Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Mike Julian, the longtime chairman and CEO  
of Jackson-based Jitney Jungle Stores of America Inc., resigned 
Tuesday as head of the supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the company announced that Rick Coleman, who  
had been chief financial officer since January, also had resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Jitney president and chief operating officer Ronald E. Johnson  
has assumed duties as chairman and CEO. David R. Black, the current 
senior vice president, will succeed Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced that Roger P. Friou, a former Jitney  
president, has been hired as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Julian said in a statement that he was leaving for personal  
reasons. Coleman said he was departing to spend more time with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel confident that I have left (the company) in competent  
and capable hands,'' Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said that Jitney was fortunate to have an experienced  
management team on hand to reduce the impact when a company changes 
its leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes come about three weeks after Julian said a $545  
million debt is keeping Jitney Jungle from aggressively competing 
with other grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Tuesday that the company is still reviewing its  
options. There was no mention of a sale in the company's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Julian said if the company was debt free, it would  
be able to fight off competition from Albertson's, Kroger, Winn 
Dixie and Wal-Mart. Lingering debt is also preventing the company 
from renovating 40 existing stores, Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jitney had earnings of $117 million on about $2 billion in sales  
last year. Jitney operates 197 supermarkets, 10 liquor stores and 
55 gasoline stations in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, 
Florida and Arkansas.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Victims' Funds Near $5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Nearly $5 million has been raised to  
help victims of the Columbine High School shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 30 funds established to help the victims say the  
outpouring of support has created the problem of how to distribute 
the money, with some families disagreeing on how the money should 
be divided. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities and victim advocates are hoping answers on  
questionnaires handed in Monday by victims' families will help them 
decide how to dole out the donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might have been easier to have decided the way to allocate  
the money at the beginning, but it wouldn't have been right,'' said 
Aura Leigh Ferguson, the district attorney's community programs 
director. ``We are just now learning what people's needs and the 
victims' needs are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relief funds were established soon after the April 20 rampage at  
Columbine. Students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 
classmates and a teacher before committing suicide. Twenty-three 
others were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3.2 million Healing Fund is the largest. In addition to  
fund, 29 scholarship, memorial and other funds have raised at least 
$1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The questionnaires asked the families whether victims should all  
receive an equal lump sum, a lump sum based on established 
priorities or whether the money should be distributed as requested 
based on financial needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Survey results won't be tallied for a couple of weeks.

<HEADLINE> SEC Charges Attorney and Consultant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators on Tuesday charged an  
attorney and a consultant who worked at his firm with defrauding 
investors of $6.2 million in a sham securities offering known as a 
``prime bank'' scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims included an Ecuadorian charity for underprivileged  
girls, the Securities and Exchange Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a civil lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, the SEC  
charged attorney Lewis Allen Rivlin and consultant Edwin Earl 
Huling III with securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also charged Alfred Huascar Velarde, a former law  
partner of Rivlin, with aiding the fraudulent investment scheme. 
Velarde agreed to settle the charges by paying a $20,000 fine and 
promising to refrain from future violations of federal securities 
laws. He neither admitted to nor denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Huling's attorney described his client as an unwitting investor  
in the scheme and said he would contest the charges in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Huling ``invested his own money with Mr. Rivlin,'' said the  
attorney, Frank Razzano. ``He certainly had no knowledge of this'' 
being fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin's attorney, Craig Christensen of Sacramento, didn't  
immediately return telephone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin is the former husband of Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  
Alice Rivlin, who announced last Thursday she was leaving the 
central bank to devote more time to her second job as head of the 
District of Columbia's financial control board. They divorced in 
1977 after 22 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC alleged that Lewis Rivlin and Huling, with Velarde's  
help, sold some $6.2 million worth of sham securities to groups of 
investors, including the Ecuadorian charity. They allegedly 
portrayed their investment program as a pooling of investors' money 
to buy and resell at a profit the so-called ``prime bank'' notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Such ``prime bank'' schemes are a growing area of fraud in which  
ordinary investors -- especially seniors -- have lost millions of 
dollars, according to securities regulators. The schemes promise 
high, risk-free returns on debt notes said to be guaranteed by the 
world's biggest banks. Promoters often claim that only big 
corporations, foreign banks and super-rich individuals know about 
``prime bank'' notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prime bank offerings are a total scam; they do not exist,''  
SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker said Tuesday. ``Investors 
should contact the SEC immediately if they are asked to invest in a 
prime bank offering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its suit against Rivlin and Huling, the SEC is seeking  
unspecified fines, an accounting of the money trail and 
compensation to investors. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 'Moneyline' Host Quits CNN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lou Dobbs, one of television's most prominent  
financial journalists, resigned from CNN on Tuesday after reports 
he had been clashing with CNN's top executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs has been host of CNN's nightly financial wrapup show,  
``Moneyline,'' and is also president of the spinoff financial 
network, CNNfn. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs will leave his position on Friday to launch a new Internet  
venture, Space.com, a Web site for news, entertainment and 
educational content on space, CNN said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs did not return a telephone call seeking comment. He was  
replaced on ``Moneyline'' on Tuesday by Tony Guida. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by CNN, Dobbs said he was looking  
forward to the opportunity to build ``the world's leading Web site 
on space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I leave with the utmost respect for the organization, and for  
the news professionals it has been my pleasure to work alongside,'' 
Dobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, Dobbs was involved in an unusually public  
tiff with CNN president Rick Kaplan. A visibly unhappy Dobbs 
interrupted ``Moneyline'' to cover a president news conference from 
Colorado, telling viewers it was under Kaplan's orders. 
</P>
<P>
	It prompted a Kaplan deputy to issue memos stating that CNN's  
executive producers have the authority to break into ``Moneyline'' 
to cover news when warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	There reportedly has been ongoing tension between Dobbs and  
Kaplan, with the Wall Street Journal saying that Dobbs had 
complained internally about money being spent on ``NewsStand,'' the 
newsmagazine series that Kaplan has championed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaplan did not immediately return a telephone call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	CNNfn has run a distant second in influence to CNBC, the cable  
leader in business news. CNBC is seen in 69 million homes, while 
CNNfn is available in less than 10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Dobbs' ``Moneyline,'' shown weeknights for an hour at 6:30  
p.m., draws more than twice as many viewers as CNBC's competing 
``Business Center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is one of the people who helped put business news on the  
map in television,'' said George Jamison, a CNBC spokesman. ``He 
was a strong competitor and a respected journalist. This is a big 
loss for CNN and CNNfn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs joined CNN in its inception in 1980 as chief economics  
correspondent and anchor of ``Moneyline.'' Over the past two 
decades, he has served in numerous roles and was responsible for 
CNNfn's launch in December 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second resignation of a prominent on-air CNN  
personality this spring. International correspondent Peter Arnett, 
who was out of favor at the network following last year's 
``NewsStand'' report about Vietnam veterans that was later 
retracted, also resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bohrman, executive vice president of CNNfn, will oversee  
the financial network. Jeff Gralnick, executive vice president, CNN 
financial news, will be in charge of ``Moneyline'' and other 
financial news programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Willow Bay, who is host of two ``NewsStand'' editions, and  
others will serve as interim anchors for ``Moneyline,'' CNN said.

	China, Russia Demand Bombing Halt  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- China and Russia demanded today that NATO  
stop bombing Yugoslavia before the U.N. Security Council formally 
adopts a resolution ending the Kosovo conflict and paving the way 
for 850,000 refugees to return home. The 15-member Security Council 
met informally to discuss the proposed text hours after foreign 
ministers from the seven major industrialized nations and Russia -- 
the so-called Group of Eight -- agreed on the text of a resolution 
in Germany. Despite China's hesitancy, diplomats were hopeful that 
a resolution would be adopted tomorrow.

	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- NATO warplanes attacked targets  
across Serbia in a thunderous warning to President Slobodan 
Milosevic to implement a Kosovo peace plan, as Western and Yugoslav 
generals met to finalize the details for withdrawing troops. The 
meeting came after the United States, Russia and six leading 
democracies authorized a text calling for a peacekeeping force for 
Kosovo with ``substantial'' NATO participation and agreed on a NATO 
bombing pause -- once Serb forces began a verifiable withdrawal. 
U.S. B-52 bombers pummeled the area near Junik for a third-straight 
day. There were unconfirmed reports of a large number of Yugoslav 
army casualties.

artillery fire thundered on in the Himalayan region, could be the 
first major breakthrough in two weeks of rising tensions between 
the world's newest nuclear powers. The Indian Foreign Ministry said 
in a statement that Pakistan's foreign minister, Sartaj Aziz, would 
be welcome for talks Saturday. Aziz later agreed to go to New

Berger to appear to discuss what many Republicans say was the slow 
response to China's alleged theft of secrets from nuclear weapons 
labs. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said he would ask Berger to 
appear at a closed hearing of his panel as early as next week. 
Berger, along with Attorney General Janet Reno, have been targets 
of Republicans who say someone should be held responsible for not 
moving more quickly to stop the alleged espionage at the Energy 
Department's Los Alamos lab in New Mexico.

license plates under a bill signed today by Gov. Jeb Bush. Money 
raised by sales of the $20 specialty plate, which bears a crayon 
drawing of children, will go to support organizations that serve 
pregnant women who plan to put their babies up for adoption. The 
idea had been vetoed last year by the late Gov. Lawton Chiles, a 
Democrat, but Bush had promised to sign it into law.

system that will compete with traditional stock markets. Their 
venture is called Primex Trading, and is the latest in a string of 
electronic communications networks that offer investors another way 
to trade stocks. Primex's gimmick is that it displays all stock 
orders to an electronic ``crowd'' of participants who then compete, 
via computer, for the best price. The New York Stock Exchange 
relies on a brokers who gather on the floor and call out competing

<HEADLINE> 'Rent A Husband' Fills a Need </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Back when he was jobless, nearly broke  
and sleeping in a friend's warehouse along the waterfront, three 
words turned Kaile Warren Jr.'s life around: 
</P>
<P>
	``Rent A Husband.''  
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, Warren has parlayed that catchy name into a  
lucrative handyman business with 26 franchises nationwide and two 
in the United Kingdom. He received a $260,000 advance from 
Doubleday for co-writing a book about the handyman business, and is 
preparing to go on a 15-city promotional tour to launch the book 
late this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dramatic life change,'' says Warren, a former  
construction worker. ``An average day for me now is a lot of 
travel. I've gained a lot of weight from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 400 employees and projected revenues of $8 million, it's  
unlikely Warren will ever have to sleep in a warehouse again. When 
he's not promoting his business, much of his time is spent sifting 
through thousands of franchise applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren admits part of his success comes from the name. When his  
workers report for duty, they use the standard introduction to 
female customers: ``I'm your husband for the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another factor, he says, is an emphasis on ``plain common  
sense and decency'' in an industry replete with horror stories of 
contractors who never show up for work on time, fail to complete 
jobs or leave behind slipshod work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He makes you feel like a friend right off,'' says Dawn-Marie  
Bernard, who had rented Warren and another ``husband'' to clean her 
garage in Westbrook. ``You don't get that from a lot of people 
nowadays, not from people in this industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren says 95 percent of the company's customers are women or  
the elderly. The demographics explain the success of the name, 
which Warren chose during a moment of inspiration in May 1996 when 
he was down and out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ladies absolutely go nuts over it,'' he says. ``It sticks  
in a lady's head and they never forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren says the pileup of unfinished tasks around the home is  
more than a trifling annoyance for many. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry observers say longer work weeks and more dual-income  
households have made the country ripe for reliable companies that 
help with tasks that some people never seem to get around to 
completing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are services that people need because they're spending  
less and less time at home,'' says Jeffrey Johnson, director of the 
AAA's Home Services Network. ``The whole `Honey, do' list just 
seems to be expanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, despite the success of hardware superstores, many people  
just aren't comfortable tackling jobs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``As simple as hanging a towel bar might seem, it's a daunting  
task to many individuals,'' Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
	Rent A Husband obliges by doing everything from laundry to  
building additions to houses. In general, it costs about $25 an 
hour for the help, although jobs costing more than $1,000 are 
considered home improvements for which an estimate is given. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren says the company has succeeded by doing things many  
handymen don't, such as explaining in plain terms the work that 
will be done and following through on all the tasks they're paid 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have really underestimated the frustration and  
annoyance that builds up inside of these ladies,'' he says. ``At 
first, husbands greet it with skepticism. When they see how happy 
their wives are at the end of the day, they're more than willing to 
go along with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are many believers in Warren's concept.  
</P>
<P>
	Warren turns away nine franchise applications for each that he  
accepts after screening them with a written test based on a 
training video and manuals. And he has little patience for 
discourteousness or gruffness. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be a people person,'' he says. ``The biggest  
frustration I've had is finding out how many poor workers are in 
the profession and trying to find the good ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren says he came up with the idea at a low point in his life,  
when injuries from a car accident threw him out of work and forced 
him to spend most of his money on medical bills. His wife had left 
him, and his business -- which had a plain title, Melbren 
Construction -- was defunct. 
</P>
<P>
	His fortunes changed a local newsman spotted the ``Rent a  
Husband'' sign on the side of his run-down van and featured him on 
a television show. Since then, news organizations and television 
shows have done stories on Warren, and the momentum continues to 
build. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton's Remarks on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Partial text of remarks by President Clinton Tuesday in the Oval  
Office with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz: 
</P>
<P>
	Let me just say briefly again how grateful I am to have this  
opportunity to welcome President Goncz to the United States and to 
reaffirm our strong friendship with Hungary and what a good time it 
is for this visit to be occurring, and we are doing our best to 
bring an end to the conflict in Kosovo, to reverse the ethnic 
cleansing and to build a new future for all of Southeastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	I know all the Americans here know that there are hundreds of  
thousands of ethnic Hungarians living in Vojvodina in northwestern 
Serbia. This is a very, very important issue for Hungary, and we 
are determined to bring it to a successful conclusion -- to reverse 
the ethnic cleansing and to see the refugees go home. And the 
president and his country's support of this endeavor has been 
absolutely critical. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, Russia (OFF-MIKE) Kosovo. Do you expect the  
U.N. Security Council to pass this resolution? And if it does, do 
you expect that Milosevic will comply in good faith? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: Well, the answer to the first question is yes, I expect  
the U.N. Security Council will adopt it. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: No veto?  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: I don't expect so. The Russians are supporting it. We  
got the agreement in Bonn this morning early our time, and I had a 
talk already with President Yeltsin about it. In terms of 
compliance, that's what we're interested in. And we want to see 
compliance. And when there is evidence that the full withdrawal has 
begun, we will suspend the bombing and then monitor that for 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	But keep in mind, our military people in the  
military-to-military contacts between NATO and the Serbs will work 
out the logistics of Serb withdrawal and the international security 
force coming in so as not to create a vacuum. And I think all that 
will be worked out in a satisfactory manner. But our interest is in 
-- our opinions won't matter. What will matter is what actually 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, will the Russian troops, peacekeepers, be  
under NATO control -- command? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: I don't expect that to happen, but I do expect that  
there will be an acceptable level of coordination the way we worked 
it out in Bosnia. I hope there'll be something like what we did in 
Bosnia, because it worked there. And we had the command and control 
intact so that our soldiers and our mission could be protected. The 
Russians were involved, as it happens, in Bosnia, as you know, in 
the American sector where we worked together with them very 
closely. And I was -- I have been very pleased with that 
cooperation. I think it's quite important for the Russians to be 
involved in this. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, once the peace will be implemented, what  
commitment will the U.S. have to reconstructing the region? How 
will the new Marshall Plan look like? And what role Hungary can 
play in that? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: Well, it's interesting, that's what the president said  
to me this morning, that the most important thing is that we 
rebuild the region now. And we, as you know, at the NATO meeting 
here in Washington a few weeks ago, we had a meeting in which all 
of us committed to be a part of the reconstruction of Southeastern 
Europe. The details will have to be worked out. I expect the E.U. 
will be in the lead. The United States will certainly support that. 
</P>
<P>
	But what I would like to see is all the countries in the region  
participating. And I like not only the analogy of the Marshall 
Plan, but also the work that was done between the West and Hungary, 
Poland and the Czech Republic after the Berlin Wall fell. That is, 
we should be supporting democracy and human rights, as well as 
economic development. 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, I hope that Serbia will be a part of that, but in  
order to be a part of that, I think Serbia will have to observe the 
same standards and have the same sort of government and the same 
devotion to the human rights of its people and to others that all 
the other countries in the region have. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan has yet to be worked out. We don't have the details  
of that yet, but there's plenty of time for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Slobodan Milosevic took away the autonomy of the other  
province in Serbia, will that be addressed in the final peace plan? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: First things first here. Let's get the first things  
first. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What do you suspect (inaudible) up to, sir, in delaying  
implementation of the agreement? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: Well, I think the main issues, at least for the last 72  
hours, were involved in -- with the nature of the U.N. resolution. 
That was resolved today. So now we'll just have to see what happens 
with the military-to-military contacts. The most important thing 
now is that we get something that is: a, verifiable; and b, that 
will work, which means we have to know that they're withdrawing. We 
have to have a schedule for the introduction of the international 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, keep in mind the big picture here. The big picture is to  
reverse the ethnic cleansing, to bring the Kosovars home, to have 
them safe and be able to govern themselves, and to have an 
international security force with NATO at the core. 
</P>
<P>
	So we have to watch for the big picture. And that's why, even  
yet and notwithstanding this very good development, sound some note 
of caution here. We have to keep working.

</P>
<P>
	HEBRON, Neb. (AP) -- William Eberline Sr., a retired Associated  
Press reporter, died May 30 of cancer. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Eberline retired from the AP in 1985. He also was a member of  
the Press Club of Des Moines and the Iowa State Bar Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a son, William L. Jr.; two daughters, Judith  
Marcus of Plano, Texas, and Joan Barry; two sisters, Betty 
Jorgenson and Jeannette Lawson; and four grandchildren.

<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Eloise Hawkins, chairman and chief  
executive of the authority which ran stock-car races at Bowman Gray 
Stadium, died Monday of cancer. She was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1970, Hawkins was head of the Winston-Salem Speedway,  
Inc., which conducts NASCAR-sanctioned stock-car racing at the 
municipal stadium under a lease from the city. She remained active 
in its operation until the illness struck her earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	She entered the auto racing industry when she married J. Alvin  
Hawkins, who co-founded the stadium's racing in 1949 in a 
partnership with NASCAR founder William France. 
</P>
<P>
	France withdrew from the enterprise in the 1960s and Hawkins  
became the stadium's racing chief after her husband died in 1970.

</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- F. Steele Langford, former chief federal  
magistrate in San Francisco and a prosecutor of Sara Jane Moore and 
Patricia Hearst, died Friday night after heart surgery. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Langford was prosecutor of Sara Jane Moore, convicted of  
attempting to assassinate President Gerald Ford in 1975. He also 
took part in the 1975 prosecution of Ms. Hearst for bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	He presided over the extradition hearing of William Quinn, the  
first Irish Republican Army member extradited from the United 
States to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	He ruled that the shooting of an off-duty British police  
officer, of which Quinn was accused, was an ordinary murder rather 
than a political crime exempt from extradition. The ruling was 
upheld on appeal, and Quinn was extradited and eventually convicted 
of murder by a London jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Langford retired in 1996 after 17 years as a magistrate,  
handling bail and other pretrial matters for judges in the Northern 
District of California.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Ruth Lawrence, an Austrian Jewish swimmer who  
refused to take part in Hitler's 1936 Olympic games and eventually 
fled to England, died May 2. She was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	She was 14 when she broke the Austrian records for the 100-meter  
and 400-meter freestyle and was one of three Jewish girls who were 
to have represented their country at the 1936 Olympics in Nazi 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Federation of Jewish Sports Clubs asked competitors  
not to go to the Berlin games because of Adolf Hitler's persecution 
of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence and the other two Jewish swimmers declined to compete  
and were banned from participating in Austrian competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Austrian swimming records were removed from the national  
list and not reinstated until 1995.

	Her photograph and records are part of a display at the  
Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.

</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- Paul S. Newman, a comic-book writer who got  
listed in the Guinness Book of Records as most prolific, died May 
30 of a heart attack. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman wrote scripts for Superman, Mighty Mouse, The Lone Ranger  
and Jungle Jim comic books, among others. Beginning in 1947, he 
wrote more than 4,100 published stories totaling about 36,000 
pages, the equivalent of 120 mystery novels. His stories included 
dialogue and panel-by-panel descriptions of what the artist was 
supposed to draw. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the comic-book historian Robin Snyder named Newman King  
of the Comic Book Writers. The Guinness book listed him as most 
prolific comic book writer under a headline, ``Lots of plots!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote five newspaper comic strips -- ``The Lone Ranger,''  
``Smokey the Bear,'' ``Space Cadets,'' ``Robin Malone,'' and 
``Laugh In'' -- as well as screenplays and television sketches for 
such stars as Boris Karloff.

	Newman is survived by his wife, Carol; a son, Peter; a daughter,  
Lisa; two grandchildren, three stepdaughters and five 
step-grandchildren.

	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- David Nicolette, The Grand Rapids  
Press theater writer and former city editor, died Sunday. He was 
80. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his newspaper career in 1949 at the Evansville (Ind.)  
Press and joined The Grand Rapids Press on Nov. 9, 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years later, while serving as assistant city editor, he  
began writing his Words and Music entertainment column. He became 
city editor in 1971, and in 1977 took over the newly created 
entertainment/features department. 
</P>
<P>
	At Civic Theater in Grand Rapids, Nicolette's regular reviewer's  
seat for opening night -- halfway back and on the aisle -- will be 
left unoccupied Thursday night for the opening performance of 
``Steel Magnolias'' as a tribute to him, director Paul Dreher said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Phillies Claim Telemaco on Waivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies claimed pitcher  
Amaury Telemaco on waivers from the Arizona Diamondbacks on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old right-hander is expected to arrive at Veterans  
Stadium for Wednesday's game with the New York Yankees. Phillies 
manager Terry Francona said Telemaco would pitch out of the 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Telemaco on the team's 40-man roster, the  
Phillies transferred pitcher Matt Beech from the 15- to the 60-day 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Telemaco was 1-0 with a 7.50 ERA in five relief appearances with  
the Diamondbacks this season. He started the year on a minor-league 
rehab assignment due to tendinitis in his right shoulder. Overall 
in the majors, he is 13-20 in 81 appearances with a 4.81 ERA, 94 
walks and 173 strikeouts in 290 innings pitched.

<HEADLINE> Ausstralia Nixes Coke-Cadbury Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian regulators have rejected for  
the second time Coca-Cola Co.'s plan to buy soft drink brands in 
Australia from Cadbury Schweppes PLC because it would reduce 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian Competition &AMP; Consumer Commission announced  
Tuesday it opposed the revised plan to sell the brands to Coca-Cola 
on the grounds, saying it would substantially lessen market 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned down the initial plan in March.  
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola said the company is considering its options following  
the commission's action and hasn't decided whether to abandon all 
attempts at a deal, a spokesman said. Cadbury Schweppes officials 
declined to comment until the company's British officials had seen 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian deal was originally part of a $1.85 billion plan  
for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola to buy all beverage brands owned by 
Cadbury Schweppes outside the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft drink companies scaled back the deal to about $1.1  
billion after regulatory obstacles arose in several countries. Most 
European Union member states have been dropped from the worldwide 
deal, along with Norway and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian regulators said in a statement that the revised  
proposal didn't address the concerns the commission expressed with 
the first plan. ``The core concern is that the premium Schweppes 
branded drinks remain part of the transaction,'' said commission 
chairman Alan Fels. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger would result in a market structure where the  
leading carbonated drinks in almost every category will be 
controlled by Coke.'' That, in turn, would increase the likelihood 
of an increase in prices, Fels said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the revised plan, Coca-Cola was to buy the major brands of  
Schweppes -- Dr Pepper and Canada Dry -- with the intention of 
licensing the production, sale and distribution rights to Coca-Cola 
Amatil Ltd., its 43 percent-owned local unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Amatil was to sell its carbonated soft drink brands  
not licensed from its parent to Cadbury Schweppes Australia. Those 
brands, including Kirks, Halls and Deep Spring, would have 
supplemented brands to be retained by Cadbury Schweppes, leaving 
the size of its business ``essentially unchanged,'' according to 
Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Schweppes in its portfolio, Coca-Cola's share of the  
Australian carbonated soft drink market through Coca-Cola Amatil 
would have immediately increased several percentage points from the 
current 65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said the second-tier brands like those Coca-Cola  
Amatil was to sell to Cadbury Schweppes Australia have limited 
sales in outlets like convenience stores, and wouldn't likely get 
the display space that Cadbury enjoys.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Lower; Dow Down 76.93 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices fell on Wall Street today as blue-chip  
stocks gave up ground after their strong gains Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 76.93 at 10,832.45. The Dow climbed Monday for the third 
straight session amid enthusiasm over merger activity, adding 
109.54 to close at 10,909.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 composite down 5.71 at 1,328.81 and the Nasdaq composite up 
0.62 at 2,524.83. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led lower by Procter &AMP; Gamble, down 2 3/8  
at 95 3/16; IBM, down 2 1/4 at 118 1/4; and Sears, down 15/16 at 48 
13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said there was little news to influence trading.  
Investors are still concerned that the Federal Reserve might raise 
interest rates in an attempt to cool the economy at its next policy 
meeting on June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears appeared to weigh most heavily on major computer  
companies today, analysts said. Those stocks are often perceived as 
too pricey during times of higher interest rates, when corporate 
profits can be sliced by the higher costs of borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq fell 15/16 to 22 15/16 after a US Bancorp Piper Jaffray  
analyst said the computer maker is losing market share to Hewlett 
Packard. 
</P>
<P>
	But while some of the high-tech leaders faltered, the  
notoriously volatile Internet stocks held up fairly well. Infoseek 
rose 7 9/16 to 50 9/16 after Walt Disney Co. said it is negotiating 
to buy the 57 percent of the Web search company it does not already 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	Some market players have come to believe traders are already  
betting on a rate increase of 0.25 percentage point, and that 
they're not likely to do much more selling. They point to a report 
last Friday of moderate May employment gains, which helped ease 
fears of a larger rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most are willing to stay on the sidelines until this  
Friday, when the government will report on productivity. Scott 
Brown, chief economist at Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St. 
Petersburg, Fla., said traders will use that data to firm up their 
bets on whether the Fed will indeed raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Productivity data have never been a major market-mover, but  
the figures tell a story of how wage pressures are being met, and 
whether we may be approaching a breaking point,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 299.2 million 
shares, above Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.17 to 634.77, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.32 at 775.83.

<HEADLINE> Dozen Former Senators Endorse Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dozen former Democratic senators endorsed  
Vice President Al Gore's presidential candidacy today and said the 
public's perception of him will improve as they learn more about 
the man they admired when they worked with him in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The former senators who worked alongside the vice president when  
he was in the House and Senate came to Washington on their own for 
an event organized by former Sens. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio and 
Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and backed by the Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no person better trained to be president than Al  
Gore,'' Metzenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former senators praised Gore as an effective and competent  
leader with the experience to be an effective president. But 
several acknowledged he has to overcome perceptions among the 
public and the media that he is dull. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican front-runner George W. Bush, the governor of Texas,  
has a double-digit lead in head-to-head matchups with Gore, who is 
seen by a majority in several polls as uninspiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The elitist media has referred to him as wooden,'' said former  
Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama. ``Wooden to me is a very proud, 
descriptive term. Wooden in my state is seen as being solid, being 
sturdy and being representative of a builder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Mike Gravel of Alaska said that when a candidate is  
described as ``wooden,'' it's another word for ``boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you stop and consider that the substance of government is  
boring,'' he said, a leader characterized as boring could also be 
``a competent person who can properly govern. Al Gore is extremely 
competent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other former senators joining in the endorsement were Wendell  
Anderson of Minnesota, John Culver of Iowa, Harlan Mathews of 
Tennessee, John Melcher of Montana, Vance Hartke of Indiana, Don 
Riegle of Indiana, Wendell Ford of Kentucky and Donald Stewart of 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Metzenbaum listed these former senators as endorsing Gore but  
not attending: Dennis DeConcini of Arizona; Gaylord Nelson of 
Wisconsin; Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island; James Abourezk of South 
Dakota; Russell Long of Louisiana; James Exon of Nebraska and 
Harrison ``Pete'' Williams of New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Smith To Republicans: Keep Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who  
wants to be his party's presidential nominee next year, warned his 
party today that it is heading for defeat if it chooses a moderate 
candidate for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times do we have to lose with a Dole or a Bush,''  
Smith said at a National Press Club luncheon. ``Let's try someone 
new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith hopes to be that new face but is vying for the same  
conservative voter pool as former Vice President Dan Quayle; Gary 
Bauer, former head of the Family Research Council; and former White 
House aide and television commentator Patrick Buchanan. Smith 
raised less money through March 31 than any of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Targets of Smith's attack were the generally acknowledged  
front-runner for the 2000 GOP nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of 
Texas, and the former head of the American Red Cross, Elizabeth 
Dole. Bush's father lost his bid for a second presidential term to 
Bill Clinton in 1992, and Dole's husband Bob Dole lost to Clinton 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Smith's criticisms, Republican National Committee  
spokesman Mike Collins said a conservative defection would send 
Vice President Al Gore to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Smith accused GOP leaders of being too eager to  
seek the middle ground and compromise with the Democrats rather 
than stick with conservative principles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Electing Republicans is not enough,'' he said. ``You have to  
stand for something, or you stand for nothing. And it's not good 
enough to only talk tough on issues that the pollsters tell you are 
popular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Smith criticized his party for refusing to pass  
anti-abortion legislation, for supporting gun control measures in 
the recent Senate-passed juvenile crime bill and for supporting 
normal trade relations with China.

	Once dubbed ``Team of the Decade'' by Baseball America magazine,  
traditional national power Louisiana State will be sitting out the 
last College World Series of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yard work,'' LSU coach Skip Bertman said gruffly. ``Getting a  
lot of yard work done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's just the third time this decade the Tigers won't travel to  
Omaha. LSU has won four national championships during the 1990s, 
including consecutive titles in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Those purple and gold Mardi Gras beads won't be the only  
familiar sights missing when this year's tournament begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Southern California lost to Stanford in last  
weekend's super regional, and Trojans coach Mike Gillespie said it 
will be hard for him to watch the series on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we justifiably believe we are one of the teams that  
could have given a good account of ourselves,'' Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say the CWS field represents a shakeup.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year's top-seeded team, Miami, is back for the sixth  
straight year. Alabama is making its third trip this decade, Cal 
State-Fullerton won the title in 1995 and Oklahoma State was here 
as recently as 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, a relative newcomer to Omaha, is making its second trip  
overall but it's the school's second visit in three years. Texas 
A&AMP;M, making its fourth trip, last qualified for the series in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the idea of some fresh people that haven't been there  
much before,'' Texas A&AMP;M coach Mark Johnson said. ``I don't like to 
see total domination by any team in any sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some new blood might even make the CWS more fun to watch.  
Johnson said the famed traditions of Aggie football fans -- kissing 
after touchdowns, coordinated cheering and so on -- sometimes carry 
over to the baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of great fans,'' Johnson said. ``They have real  
Aggie spirit and we know those who show up in Omaha will carry it 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA tournament grew this year from 48 to 64 teams. As a  
result, the NCAA Division I baseball committee added super 
regionals for the first time to fill out the expanded bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our super regional was pitted against Alabama and they were  
the hottest team in the country,'' Bertman said. ``We weren't good 
enough to beat them at their place. USC of course would have been 
back, but they ran into the same problem we had. They had to go to 
Stanford's place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So while Texas A&AMP;M fans are puckering up at Rosenblatt, Bertman  
said he will be mowing his lawn in Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, during the playoffs, my yard looks like a wildlife  
preserve,'' he said. ``Evidently this year, unfortunately, my yard 
will be looking good. I almost wish my neighbors had reason to 
complain.''

<HEADLINE> IOC To Vote on Status of Australian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian International Olympic  
Committee member Phil Coles should not be expelled from the Olympic 
movement for preparing secret dossiers on other members, IOC vice 
president Dick Pound said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound told Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper that ``there  
wouldn't be too many IOC members around'' if they faced dismissal 
for gathering information on fellow delegates to help Games bid 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have thought the amount of attention gathered (on  
Coles) is far in excess of anything he's done,'' the Canadian said. 
``My understanding is candidate cities share information all the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC meets in Seoul on Monday to vote on whether to expel  
Coles for his role in preparing dossiers of private information 
about his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said dossiers were common as was sharing information.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a camaraderie built up by the candidate cities,''  
Pound said. ``Every single bid city does this. It's part of your 
strategy; where are you going to get your support?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has already been censured by the IOC for accepting lavish  
gifts from officials with Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 
2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	His expulsion would require the approval of two-thirds of the  
IOC's 103 members.

<HEADLINE> Malone Breaks All-NBA Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  
never accomplished what Karl Malone did Tuesday -- make the All-NBA 
first team for the 11th time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah forward, winner of the NBA's MVP award this season, was  
the leading vote-getter on the team with 580 points and 113 
first-team votes from a panel of 118 NBA writers and broadcasters. 
He finished four points ahead of San Antonio's Tim Duncan, who had 
576 points and 112 first-team votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Malone and Duncan on the first team were Miami's Alonzo  
Mourning, Philadelphia's Allen Iverson and Phoenix's Jason Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone's 11 first-team appearances are a record.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, Abdul-Jabbar, Elgin Baylor, Bob Cousy, Bob Pettit and  
Jerry West each made it 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning received 95 first-team votes and 542 points, Iverson  
had 93 first-team votes and 532 points, and Kidd had 86 first-team 
votes and 516 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Voted to the second team were Chris Webber of Sacramento, Grant  
Hill of Detroit, Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers, Gary 
Payton of Seattle and Tim Hardaway of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Garnett of Minnesota, Antonio McDyess of Denver, Hakeem  
Olajuwon of Houston, Kobe Bryant of the Lakers and John Stockton of 
Utah made the third team. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 15 players on the three teams, 11 are from the Western  
Conference. Only one of the 15, Duncan, plays for a team that made 
it to either conference final.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Hear American Air Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A voice tape shows the pilots of  
American Airlines Flight 1420 made no mention of deploying 
plane-slowing spoilers while landing their jet in a thunderstorm at 
Little Rock last week, an investigator said today. 
</P>
<P>
	It is still possible that Capt. Richard Buschmann and First  
Officer Michael Origel communicated non-verbally about the 
spoilers, panels that pop up on landing to break the plane's lift 
and help slow it, said George W. Black Jr. of the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 1420 landed June 1 as a violent thunderstorm approached  
Little Rock National Airport. Nine people were killed and more than 
80 were injured as the plane crashed, broke up and caught fire. Two 
people remained in critical condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane slowed little after landing and roared off the runway  
at 92 mph. It clipped lights at the end of the runway and wrapped 
around steel stanchions on a catwalk to an airport guidance system. 
</P>
<P>
	Buschmann died in the crash, and Origel broke a leg. Black,  
speaking in Washington, said investigators want Origel to listen to 
the cockpit voice recording with them in an effort to refresh his 
memory about preparations made for landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel said last week that he believes the spoilers were  
deployed to help slow the plane, but data recorders indicate that 
they did not open at touchdown. In that first interview, though, 
Origel was in pain and on pain medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the voice recording indicates that the pilots went  
over some items on the pre-landing checklist, but there was no word 
pertaining to the spoilers. He would not say if any other elements 
of the checklist were not heard on the tape. It is possible, he 
said, for the pilots to have used pointing or nods of the head to 
acknowledge the proper setting of switches. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm really interested in is the communication between the  
two officers,'' NTSB lead investigator Greg Feith said in Little 
Rock, shortly before boarding a plane for Washington. ``Was there a 
miscommunication? Did they not do something because someone did not 
understand?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feith said that in a hospital interview, Origel said he had  
completed the checklist for landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got through the mechanical part, completed some items like  
talking on the radio, and then went back and completed the rest of 
the mechanical checklist,'' Feith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel also told investigators last week that he never lost site  
of the runway as the airplane approached in a ``bowling alley'' 
type gap in the storm clouds. Black said today that the cockpit 
voice recorder indicated otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews on Monday moved the plane from the north end of Runway 4R  
to an airport hangar. The runway reopened at 10:35 a.m. today, 
although repairs were not complete to the lighting approach system. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots' console containing many of the jet's important  
controls was removed Monday from the smashed nose of the plane 
after it was taken in pieces from its crash site to a private 
hangar. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 1420's spoiler system -- along with its anti-skid, thrust  
reverser and braking systems -- will be removed and sent to labs run 
by the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are examining whether mechanical problems, pilot  
error or severe weather -- or a combination of those factors -- 
played a role in the crash. The plane's engines were removed 
earlier and shipped to an American Airlines hangar in Tulsa, Okla., 
for tests and possible dismantling. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing is expected to take two to three weeks, Feith said.  
Scrutiny of the jet's other parts is expected to take months.

<HEADLINE> France Declines in European Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- How far can France fall?  
</P>
<P>
	Of Wednesday's 17 Euro 2000 qualifiers, the game in Barcelona  
between the World Cup champions and the semi-pros from Andorra 
normally wouldn't count for much. But these aren't normal times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fall from Grace,'' was how Tuesday's France Football magazine  
put it, referring to a 3-2 loss Saturday to Russia, the first at 
the Stade de France and France's first defeat since the 1996 
European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	France is third (11 points) in Group 4 behind leaders Ukraine  
(14) and Iceland (12). Only the group winner qualifies 
automatically. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken a knock, a big smack in the face,'' captain Didier  
Deschamps said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play like world champions,'' added captain Laurent  
Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
	France, which struggled in a 2-0 home victory earlier against  
Andorra, will again be without injured playmaker Zinedine Zidane, 
with forward Youri Djorkaeff also most likely absent. 
</P>
<P>
	England is also in trouble going into its game in Bulgaria. In  
third place (8 points) behind leaders Sweden (13) and Poland (9), 
England now hopes to finish second in the group and qualify for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The honeymoon ended Saturday for new coach Kevin Keegan in a 0-0  
tie with Sweden at Wembley Stadium. Keegan is now gambling with six 
changes from that team. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no such problems for Italy and the Czech Republic,  
which can be the first two countries to qualify with victories. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czechs, the 1996 runners-up, are the only team with six  
victories and can advance at home against Scotland, which was 
embarrassed in a 1-1 weekend tie at the Faeroe Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czechs have no injuries and coach Jozef Chovanec plans no  
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Scots are playing for their lives here,'' forward Vladimir  
Smicer said. ``If they lose, they'll have trouble finishing 
second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Czechs lead Group 9 (18 points) followed by Scotland (8),  
Estonia (7) and Bosnia (7). 
</P>
<P>
	Italy will also advance with a win over Switzerland in Lausanne.  
Coach Dino Zoff most likely will stick with the same lineup that 
beat Wales 4-0 last weekend, prompting the resignation of coach 
Bobby Gould. 
</P>
<P>
	Striker Christian Vieri and captain Paolo Maldini have minor  
injuries but should play.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Falls on Brazil Weather News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coffee futures tumbled nearly 6 percent Tuesday on the Board of  
Trade of the City of New York as forecasts for warm weather in 
Brazil dimmed chances for crop damage. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, gold continued its sharp descent, while cocoa  
futures raced to two-month highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures extended their slide after Brazilian  
meteorologists called for above-average temperatures this week in 
the nation's main coffee-growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculators have been confounded as the world's largest grower  
flirts with the chance for a damaging frost, only to have such 
weather fail to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil in the past two years has seen bumper production as young  
trees yield more beans and after escaping sustained temperatures 
below freezing. While Brazil produces mostly robusta beans -- the 
type not favored by gourmet coffee drinkers -- its product often is 
blended with the better-tasting arabica produced by Latin American 
and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Arabica coffee for July delivery fell 6.30 cents, or 5.6  
percent, to $1.057 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures continued to post new 20-year lows on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange as traders failed to shake off bearish 
sentiment about the metal's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold prices went into a tailspin after the British government  
announced it would sell more than half the country's reserves to 
raise cash for buying higher-yielding investments. 
</P>
<P>
	That announcement reinforced sentiment that world governments  
will move to sell their holdings because of gold's relative expense 
to store. Many public officials also believe they no longer need to 
back the economies with physical supplies in an era where consumers 
are drifting toward paperless currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	June gold fell $3.30 to $262.80 a troy ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures raced to their highest levels in nearly two months  
on the New York Board of Trade as market participants continued to 
bet new sales would be long in coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have gained for five of the past six trading sessions  
amid the perception that Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world's largest 
growers, have virtually run out of product to sell from the midyear 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries contribute more than half the world's cocoa  
supply, which is used mainly in making chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are betting price that earlier this year reached  
six-year lows are on the rebound. They also note chocolatiers soon 
will need to begin buying after sitting on the sidelines for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	July cocoa rose $90 to $1,139 a ton.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Recruits Iowa Supporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- With a sharp new focus on grass-roots  
organizing, Lamar Alexander said today that he has recruited 
leaders for his Republican presidential campaign in each of Iowa's 
99 counties, the first candidate to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to turn out more than 35,000 Alexander supporters''  
with an organizational structure that eventually will reach into 
each of the state's more than 2,100 precincts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Short of campaign funds, Alexander is focusing his efforts on  
the Iowa caucuses, which launch the 2000 presidential nominating 
season. A former Tennessee governor, Alexander finished third in 
Iowa's caucuses in the last election cycle, and hopes to build on 
that showing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans want a winner, but a winner ... is a candidate who  
is well prepared for the presidency,'' Alexander said at a news 
conference. ``This nomination is too important to be bought, it 
shouldn't be inherited, it ought to be earned. I'm here today to 
earn it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He showed some signs of frustration as he talked about the GOP  
front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to let the political elite pick a nominee six  
or eight months before the people have a say and then find out in 
the middle of a debate with Albert Gore that we've nominated 
someone who is not ready to be president,'' said Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if that meant Bush was unprepared to assume the office,  
Alexander said: ``We don't have any idea if he's ready to be 
president. He's a popular one-term governor and the woods are full 
of popular one-term governors. We don't know a thing about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander continued campaigning virtually nonstop after dropping  
from the race in the last election cycle, and he's campaigned more 
frequently in Iowa this year than almost any other GOP contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, early polling has shown Bush atop the field, with  
Alexander bunched up with other contenders in single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush looks forward to meeting with the people of Iowa  
and allowing them to make a determination on his candidacy,'' 
spokesman Eric Woolson said in response to Alexander's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush makes his first swing through the state this weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most voters in Iowa couldn't pick him out of a lineup,'' said  
Alexander. ``His whole objective in this campaign is to make sure 
the race never gets to the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's strategists say their tactic is rooted in the  
conventional wisdom that it takes a finely honed campaign 
organization to turn out voters for precinct caucuses that are 
basically neighborhood meetings.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Japanese Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today after an  
influential Japanese finance ministry official warned against a 
hasty rise in the Japanese currency. Tokyo share prices advanced 
moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.32 yen, up 0.48 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 120.80 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 87.03 points,  
or 0.53 percent, closing at 16,562.92. On Monday, the average 
gained 175.14 points, or 1.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's advance came on the heels of comments from Eisuke  
Sakakibara, vice finance minister for international affairs and 
known as ``Mr. Yen'' for his influential remarks on the currency 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a general rule, it's undesirable for the yen to strengthen  
too much before the economy recovers,'' Sakakibara told reporters 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	His remark prompted U.S. funds to buy dollars to cover their  
short, or oversold, positions in the greenback, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since it's still unclear whether Japan will compile an extra  
budget for additional public works, Sakakibara's words invoked 
concerns in U.S. participants,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant 
manager of foreign exchange at Nippon Credit Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.50 yen and 121.45 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 125.98 yen, up from  
124.47 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo stock market, meanwhile, posted moderate gains on  
select buying of blue chips following an overnight rise on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	But many investors held back to wait for Thursday's release of  
gross domestic product figures for the first quarter, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also keeping investors on the sidelines was a government report  
on industrial competitiveness, expected to be released soon. 
Investors also are awaiting a meeting of finance ministers and 
central bankers from the G-7 industrialized nations over the 
weekend in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 10.49 points, or 0.79 percent, to 1,339.14. 
The TOPIX closed up 12.12 points, or 0.92 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond fell to  
1.5700 percent from Monday's finish of 1.6650 percent, driving its 
price up to 98.53 yen from 97.72 yen.

<HEADLINE> House Funds Killing of Predators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted today to fully fund a program  
in which federal officials kill animals -- mainly coyotes -- that 
prey upon sheep and other livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter DeFazio tried to cut $7 million from the program,  
which is popular with ranchers in the West. The Oregon Democrat 
argued that the program is wasteful and ineffective, and that 
ranchers should have to take care of their own pest problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, should federal taxpayers pay for predator  
control services on private ranches -- for profit -- in the western 
United States?'' DeFazio said on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House defeated the amendment, 230-193, with supporters  
arguing that the program does far more than aid ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting funds from the $30 million program would increase the  
threat of rats spreading the bubonic plague, of mountain lions 
killing hikers and even of planes crashing, since program funds 
eradicate troublesome birds at airports, supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ask yourself if you could live with an accident occurring at  
an airport -- or live with a child dying, who was afflicted with 
rabies -- because there was not enough money in the budget to 
support this program,'' said Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Department officials in 1997 killed 146,000 animals,  
and about 82,000 of the animals were coyotes, according to wildlife 
services program figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Other animals killed included 31,000 beavers, 7,300 raccoons and  
6,800 skunks. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFazio and Rep. Charles Bass, R-N.H., offered their amendment  
to a $61 billion agriculture appropriations bill.

<HEADLINE> China Swimmer Fails Drug Test Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- In a further setback for China's antidoping  
efforts, a top Chinese swimmer who already served a two-year year 
ban for steroid use has failed another drug test, a Chinese 
swimming official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Li Jun of the National Swimming Management Center said Xiong  
Guoming, who won gold at last year's Asian Games after having 
served out his ban, was given a surprise, out-of-competition test 
in March by FINA, swimming's international governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiong's first urine sample tested positive for drugs, Li said. A  
second sample will be tested, probably later this month, and if 
that also turns out positive, Xiong could face another ban after a 
hearing, Li said. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiong's positive test is a blow to Chinese sports officials'  
efforts to convince the world they are winning their war against 
doping. 
</P>
<P>
	While China has toughened punishments for drug cheats and  
stepped up efforts to educate athletes, Xiong's test and other 
recent drug cases could renew suspicions about Chinese doping, 
particularly among swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 18 months, 10 Chinese swimmers and coaches have been banned  
from competition or coaching because of drugs, the state-run Legal 
Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said four swimmers were caught before last year's  
Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand, and one, Tian Bin, was given a 
four-year ban for using banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Punishments for the other three -- Nian Yun, Chen Yan, and Sun  
Xixi -- are still being worked out, it said in a report Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A ban against Xiong could deprive China of one of its top male  
swimmers heading into the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiong was one of seven Chinese swimmers banned for two years  
after testing positive for the performance-enhancing steroid DHT at 
the 1994 Asian Games, the region's Olympic equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
	He stormed back at last year's Bangkok games, winning gold and  
breaking the Asian Games record in the 200-meter medley and taking 
silver in the 400-meter medley.

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Tuesday that  
he would have voted to impeach President Clinton over the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have voted for it. I thought the man lied,'' he said  
in response to a question posed during a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential  
nomination, didn't call for Clinton's impeachment last fall, when 
the House approved articles of impeachment, or earlier this year 
when the Senate voted to acquit him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't talk about it during the time because I thought the  
House and Senate members could make up their minds,'' Bush said. 
``I did say it was an embarrassment, and I did say it was important 
to blow the whistle on not telling the truth.''

<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Opening his Iowa campaign office,  
Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan was clearly cheered 
by the prospects of yet another battle with a member of the Bush 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush is ahead in the polls for the GOP  
presidential nomination in 2000; Buchanan ran unsuccessfully 
against President Bush, the Texas governor's father, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``We challenged King George as we called him in '92 and we think  
we're going to have to go up against the Prince of Wales in 2000,'' 
Buchanan said Tuesday. ``I think it's going to get down to a 
Buchanan versus Bush contest again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan finished second in Iowa's precinct caucuses in the last  
election cycle, and went on to win the New Hampshire primary before 
fading from the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference is the folks in Iowa didn't really know who I  
was,'' said Buchanan. ``I think we won their hearts and this time 
we start with a lot of good will out there. I think we've got a 
base this time that we did not have last time.''

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's senior state legislator, breaking  
Tuesday with the state's Republican leadership, endorsed Sen. John 
McCain's bid for the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator McCain has the character, the courage and the  
credentials necessary to lead this country,'' state Sen. John 
Marchi of Staten Island said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchi's announcement came 15 days after Gov. George Pataki was  
joined by former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and dozens of other party 
luminaries as he endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush's bid for the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	While Marchi attended that Pataki-led event, an aide said that  
was simply as a courtesy to the governor and did not signify that 
the Republican state senator was backing Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a combat veteran of World War II service, I have great  
respect for Senator McCain's record as a Navy pilot in Vietnam and 
his courageous leadership of prisoners of war held in the infamous 
`Hanoi Hilton,''' Marchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchi, who has served in the state Senate since 1957, can be  
something of a maverick. He is a former chairman of the powerful 
Senate Finance Committee, but has lost influence in recent years in 
part because of his refusal to quickly fall in line with changes in 
the state's GOP leadership.

<HEADLINE> White House Dinner Honors Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was a little too warm in the nation's  
capital today to stir up a serving of goulash for visiting 
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. 
</P>
<P>
	So the White House brought out the next best things for its  
state dinner affair: sumptuous entrees borrowing flavors from the 
Eastern European nation and performances celebrating the folk 
cultures of Hungary and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Band Strolling Strings perfected a selection of  
songs, including the Hungarian Rondo, to perform while circling the 
East Room tables set for 180 dinner guests. The ensemble also 
selected a version of the Beer Barrel Polka, to highlight the 
talents of 12-year-old accordion virtuoso, Cory Pesaturo. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer Judy Collins, the evening's featured entertainer,  
included in her repertoire one particularly timely piece for a 
crowd with the war in Kosovo weighing on many minds. Titled 
``Walls,'' the song came about after her husband, Louis Nelson, 
designed the Korean War Veterans Memorial Mural. 
</P>
<P>
	The song ``kind of says it is all about the transformational  
experience of when the war is over,'' Collins said Tuesday 
afternoon as she rehearsed. She hoped the music would focus her 
audience on looking toward the end of war. 
</P>
<P>
	``My music has been a kind of hope, a unifying force,'' said  
Collins, who has made numerous visits to the former Yugoslavia as 
UNICEF's special representative for the arts. ``Music touches us in 
ways that are bigger than issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, President Clinton and Goncz celebrated the ties between  
their two nations, an alliance that has taken on special meaning 
with Hungary's recent entrance into NATO and its support for the 
action in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your vision of people living together and nations living  
together, resolving differences peacefully, drawing strength from 
their diversity, treating all people with equal dignity, this will 
form the basis of a better future for Europe and the world,'' 
Clinton said in his toast to Goncz. 
</P>
<P>
	Goncz said his visit reinforced the shared values and ideals of  
their countries, as they discussed the current problems in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the first time I really felt, genuinely, that the two  
countries are allies. And a real alliance is characterized by 
identical values, and also that you approach the problems to be 
solved from the same angle,'' Goncz said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
	The dinner drew a host of literary figures -- including authors  
E.L. Doctorow, William Styron and Elie Wiesel -- in a fitting 
tribute to the president who taught himself English while in 
prison. Goncz later went on to translate a host of English works 
into Hungarian and become a writer himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an exceptionally cultivated man,'' said writer Susan  
Sontag, whose works were translated by Goncz. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best Hungary has had in generations,'' said Rep. Tom  
Lantos, D-Calif., who was born in Hungary. ``He's a fantastic human 
being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Tony Curtis, author Kitty Kelley, Nobel laureate Wiesel  
and fashion designer Adrienne Vittadini peppered an eclectic guest 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House staff, taking their cue from Tuesday's  
record-breaking temperatures in the high 90s, created a cool 
environment to greet their guests. Mauve silk tablecloths 
complemented flower centerpieces featuring shades of violet -- 
lavender roses, blue columbines and purple allium gigantum. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinner included copper river salmon, which came into season last  
week, with portobello mushrooms. Its toasted caraway and tomato 
sauce simulated the flavors of a Hungarian goulash, ``but cooler,'' 
said White House chef Walter Scheib. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting as close to a summer cookout as a state dinner can, the  
White House served up a pecan crusted lamb with barbecued peach 
ragout to headline the evening's menu. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed a salute to Hungarian composer Bela Bartok, dessert  
consisted of a bing cherry strudel with cooked filo dough springing 
from the top, along with a chocolate violin surrounded by pastries. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House selected the Woodrow Wilson base plates and the  
Franklin Delano Roosevelt china to top the tables. Kennedy 
Morgantown crystal and gold vermeil flatware rounded out the place 
settings.

<HEADLINE> Serbs May Be Set To Leave Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. intelligence has detected signs that Serb  
forces are making preparations to withdraw from Kosovo, although no 
troops are moving or assembling for a pullout, the Pentagon said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of indications that the Serbs plan to  
withdraw,'' spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to reporters at the Pentagon, Bacon said the signs of  
preparation for a troop withdrawal include the mobilization of Serb 
transport vehicles in Kosovo that would be used to move soldiers 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just beginning to see signs of preparations for  
withdrawal. We have not yet seen any withdrawal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure came shortly after NATO announced that talks with  
Yugoslav military authorities on the conditions for a Serb troop 
withdrawal would resume Tuesday night at a Macedonia border town. 
The talks had collapsed Monday in a dispute over a United Nations 
role and other sticking points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also disclosed new details on U.S. planning for its  
contribution to the NATO-led peacekeeping force that would enter 
Kosovo after Serb forces begin leaving. Some 1,900 Marines from the 
26th Marine Expeditionary Unit now aboard ships in the Aegean Sea 
would serve as the vanguard of U.S. peacekeepers for Kosovo. In 
addition, Bacon said, the Army would send 1,700 soldiers from a 
group based in Tirana, Albania, including an aviation unit with 
eight Apache attack helicopters. The soldiers also would be 
equipped with artillery, multiple-launch rockets, tanks and other 
armor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a daunting mission,'' Bacon said, because  
of the land mines, booby-trapped bridges and other hazards the 
peacekeepers will face in preparing for the return of hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO hoped the Serbs would begin their withdrawal even before  
the renewed military talks finished, Bacon said, but he emphasized 
that it was up to Belgrade to decide when it was ready to end the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO will not suspend its bombing until the Serbs begin a  
verifiable withdrawal, Bacon said. He said B-52 bombers had struck 
Serb army concentrations Sunday and Monday in areas near the 
Albanian border where the Serbs are engaged in heavy combat with 
forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	He could not confirm published reports that several hundred Serb  
troops were killed in the B-52 attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if U.S. intelligence had picked up signs of Serb  
preparations for a withdrawal, Bacon cited a report that a senior 
Serb army officer had spoken Sunday of a peace deal that would let 
soldiers return to their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen, also, signs that they are mobilizing vehicles and  
other means to transport people out, but we have not yet seen signs 
that Serb troops or special police forces or paramilitaries are 
moving out, but we have certainly seen preparations for moving 
out,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are an estimated 40,000 Serb army, police and paramilitary  
forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said that once Yugoslav military authorities agree to  
NATO's withdrawal terms and NATO verifies that ``a certain amount 
of movement'' has taken place in a pullout from ``certain zones'' 
in Kosovo, then the North Atlantic Council -- NATO's political arm -- 
will vote to suspend the bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman would not be more specific about what NATO will  
require before it suspends the airstrikes. He said that was part of 
the discussions to take place in the military-to-military meeting 
in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Under NATO's withdrawal plan, the Serb forces would assemble in  
pre-designated areas in Kosovo and then travel on prescribed roads 
to four exit points on the Kosovo-Serbia border, Bacon said. He 
left open the possibility that a full withdrawal would take more 
than the seven days NATO initially demanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Headquarters for the U.S. peacekeeping contingent in Kosovo will  
be in Gnjilane in southeastern Kosovo, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plan President Clinton formally sent to Congress on  
Monday, about 7,000 American troops would take up peacekeeping duty 
as part of a 50,000-strong NATO-led force. Another 1,500 would go 
to Macedonia and elsewhere in the Balkans to help with the flow of 
supplies and other support to the peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to congressional leaders, Clinton said it is  
impossible to estimate how long the peacekeepers will need to stay 
in Kosovo. After ``an initial stabilization period,'' the force 
will be progressively reduced as local police forces are 
established, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines, meanwhile, remained aboard their ships Tuesday  
awaiting the Greek government's approval to land and begin 
traveling overland to a staging area in northern Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece has been NATO's most skeptical member since the allied  
airstrikes began March 24. The government had prevented the Marines 
from landing as scheduled Monday, fearing an escalation of 
anti-NATO protests. On Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry said Greece 
would ``not cause problems in the effort to install and reinforce'' 
the peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the Marines could reach Kosovo's border from their  
ships in four days or less. This would not cause any delay in the 
start of U.S. peacekeeping operations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Movie Theaters To Ask Teens for IDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a crackdown on kids sneaking into movies  
they're not supposed to see, young people will be required to show 
photo IDs proving they're at least 17 to view R-rated films at 
thousands of theaters across America. 
</P>
<P>
	``You shouldn't have to worry about your G-rated kids getting  
into violent or suggestive R-rated movies,'' President Clinton said 
Tuesday, announcing new restrictions imposed by the nation's 
largest group of theater owners. ``Too often, children do get past 
the ticket counter unescorted and underage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ID requirement was the latest in a series of steps to curb  
youth violence in the aftermath of the high school rampage that 
left 15 people dead in Littleton, Colo. The restrictions were a 
victory for Clinton, who had challenged theater and video store 
owners a month ago to enforce the rating systems on movies they 
show, rent and sell. The White House said it would keep up the 
pressure on video stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Watchdog groups said the new requirement will put teeth into the  
31-year-old movie rating system and the R-rating that bans children 
under 17 unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has taken a big step: enforcement at the box  
office,'' said James M. Wall, special consultant to the motion 
picture industry for the National Council of Churches. ``Kids have 
always managed to sort of slip their way past box offices. A 
requirement like this sets a mood that we are serious about 
enforcing the R-rating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some kids were unhappy at the prospect of being carded.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't agree with that at all,'' said 16-year-old Paul  
Griffith in the lobby of a 24-screen theater complex in Columbus, 
Ohio. ``But I'll probably just sneak in anyway.'' Jimmy Moore, 14, 
at the same theater, said: ``You see worse things every day out on 
the street. At least here it's fake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston, 15-year-old Jamie Frizzell of Standish, Maine, said,  
``It sounds like a stupid idea'' -- encouraging kids to get fake 
IDs. Another critic, 13-year-old Jinuk Lee of Portland, Ore., said, 
``How else will we learn? Most parents don't teach us about sex and 
violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But 12-year-old Aaron Whitmore in Portland said, ``I think it's  
right because kids shouldn't see those movies unless their parents 
want them to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy was adopted by the National Association of  
Theater Owners, representing more than 20,000 screens spread across 
every state. That's about two-thirds of all screens in the nation. 
The White House said it would try to get all theaters to follow 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that this will go a long way in carrying out our  
responsibilities to the parents of America,'' said William F. 
Kartozian, the association president. Appearing with Clinton in a 
ceremony in the Roosevelt Room, he said theaters will display 
posters announcing the new policy and advising young people to be 
ready to show an ID. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the years, theater owners have turned away millions and  
millions of dollars in business, and to the best of my knowledge, 
we're the only industry that voluntarily does such,'' Kartozian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America,  
applauded the ID requirement. ``It's a big step forward,'' he said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there is some wariness in Hollywood about the anti-violence  
campaign, with some worried that the entertainment industry has 
been turned into a political scapegoat. 
</P>

	However, he predicted that once people are persuaded that ``no  
one is pointing a finger at anybody else, I think we'll have good 
participation from the entertainment community, and I'll be 
surprised if we don't,'' he said.

	Clinton urged the House to follow the Senate's lead in approving  
tougher gun control measures, including requirements for safety 
locks on handguns and background checks for purchases at gun shows.

<HEADLINE> Burns Regains Lead in Acropolis Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Britain's Richard Burns held to the lead  
in the Acropolis Rally on Tuesday after a gearbox problem forced 
defending champion Colin McRae out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns, driving a Subaru Impreza WRC 99, led after the second  
day, but deliberately took a 30 second penalty to allow others to 
clear a path on dirt roads through central Greece, sweeping away 
the rocks and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
	That left McRea, also the 1996 winner, ahead at the start  
Tuesday. But his Ford Focus WRC developed gearbox in the 15th 
special stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns led the final stages, which descended from the steep  
mountains near ancient Delphi to flat farmland northeast of Athens, 
to finish in a time of 3 hours, 18 minutes, 27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	He was followed closely by Carlos Sainz of Spain, driving a  
Toyota Corolla, in 3:18.44, and Finnish world champion Tommi 
Makinen, seeking his third consecutive world title, in 3:19.02 in 
his Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 114 cars that started out from the foot of the Acropolis  
on Sunday, 53 remained in the rally by the end the third day. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally, which covers 817 miles through central and southern  
Greece, ends Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Indian Trust Documents Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite two Cabinet officials being held in  
contempt of court, the government still isn't taking proper care of 
some Indian trust records, a court-appointed investigator says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report issued Monday, Alan Balaran said trust documents are  
stored in ``patently substandard conditions'' at several Bureau of 
Indian Affairs offices he inspected recently. At Anadarko, Okla., 
records were kept in unmarked boxes in wooden sheds, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Balaran, special master in a lawsuit against the government,  
said the majority of the dozen offices he visited in April were 
``models of efficiency.'' He was appointed after U.S. District 
Judge Royce Lamberth found Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt in February for their 
delay in turning over trust records. 
</P>
<P>
	Balaran recommended the judge issue an order safeguarding the  
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges the government has been mishandling the  
trust accounts for decades. There are 300,000 accounts held by 
individual Indians, subjects of the lawsuit, and an additional 
1,600 tribal accounts worth $2.5 billion. The money includes lease 
revenue, royalties and court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is to be tried in two phases, with the first set to  
start Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	BIA officials say trust records are kept in 108 offices and it  
takes time to ensure that all of them have proper storage. The 
Interior Department released a memorandum dated June 2 that ordered 
all its agencies that might have Indian fund records to ensure they 
are preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, records have been lost or ruined, and ownership  
of reservation property has been divided so often through 
inheritances that only a few cents a year passes through many of 
the accounts, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the plaintiffs claim the government could be liable  
for billions of dollars in underpayments to account holders. While 
not making estimates, BIA officials have acknowledged that the 
liability could be substantial. 
</P>
<P>
	BIA is to launch a new computer system for handling the accounts  
later this month.

<HEADLINE> Dodger Pitcher Suspended For Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A contrite Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Chan  
Ho Park was suspended for seven games and fined $3,000 on Tuesday 
for hitting and kicking Anaheim Angels pitcher Tim Belcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize for the bad news for (my) teammates,'' Park said  
three hours before beginning the suspension Tuesday night against 
the Texas Rangers. ``I apologize for trying to hurt him. I expected 
three or five games, seven games is so long. I'll forget about it 
after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park will be eligible to return June 17 against Pittsburgh at  
Dodger Stadium, and manager Davey Johnson said the 25-year-old 
right-hander from Korea will pitch that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Belcher refused to comment on the fine and suspension following  
Anaheim's 6-2 loss at San Francisco on Tuesday, but expressed anger 
Monday night in his first public comments on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy about what happened,'' Belcher said. ``The guy  
tried to take my head off. I just don't think there's any place for 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, NL president Leonard Coleman agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	The fight last Saturday began after Belcher fielded Park's  
sacrifice bunt in the fifth inning and tagged him out. After a 
brief exchange of words, Park forearmed Belcher in the face and 
followed with a leaping kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Park later said Belcher tagged him hard, and then cursed him.  
</P>
<P>
	Both benches and bullpens emptied, and Park was ejected. Matt  
Walbeck had hit a grand slam off Park an inning earlier, the fourth 
grand slam allowed by Park this season, equaling a big-league 
record for grand slams allowed in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Park, 4-3 with a 4.84 ERA in 12 starts this year, will actually  
miss just one start. And because the Dodgers are off Thursday and 
Monday, it will allow them to go with a four-man rotation in his 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``All suspensions are stiff to me,'' Johnson said. ``There's  
nothing good about a suspension. We have some off days, we won't 
need an extra pitcher, that helps. Someone was looking out for us 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a difficult season so far, for whatever reason.  
There's still plenty of time left for him to have an excellent 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park was 14-8 with a 3.38 ERA in 1997, and 15-9 with a 3.71 ERA  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he respected Coleman's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``He did what he had to do,'' Johnson said. ``(But) it takes two  
to rumble. You don't get into a fight for no reason at all, you 
know what I'm saying? I know what it's like getting tagged hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's severe, seven games, but the schedule makes it  
easier. It's over and done with, let's turn the page and go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a big-league player for 13 years and in his 13th season  
as a major league manager, said seldom has he seen two pitchers 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they've got an unwritten rule, `Let's not fight each  
other,''' Johnson said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he'd ever seen a player leave his feet like Park  
did to unload a kick, Johnson smiled again and replied, ``I've seen 
people leave their feet going the other way.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Considers Kosovo Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council today held its first  
meeting on a draft resolution to end the Kosovo conflict, with the 
United States and its NATO partners pushing for quick adoption but 
China saying it has trouble with key points. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassadors from the United States, Britain and France went into  
the closed-door meeting saying they hope the council would quickly 
approve the draft agreed on today by the seven major industrialized 
nations and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to have it adopted as soon as possible,'' said Peter  
Burleigh, the deputy U.S. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Shen Guofang, China's deputy U.N. ambassador, told reporters he  
has some difficulties with the new text, however -- ``most 
important'' on China's demand for a bombing halt -- and needed 
instructions from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	As a permanent member of the Security Council, China has veto  
power over resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulties Shen cited were a reference to the mandate of  
the international criminal tribunal for Yugoslavia, and the 
resolution's proposed adoption under Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, 
which makes the resolution militarily enforceable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Netherlands' U.N. Ambassador Peter van Walsum introduced the  
draft resolution at an informal session of the council. 
</P>
<P>
	China had said it would not allow a formal discussion of a  
resolution on Kosovo while NATO planes were bombing Yugoslavia -- a 
point reiterated today in Beijing and by Chinese diplomats at the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Western diplomats said the scenario they are working toward  
would begin with the signing of a military agreement by NATO and 
Yugoslav military chiefs. This would be followed by the withdrawal 
of Yugoslav troops. The Group of Eight said they would suspend 
bombing once the withdrawal was verified. 
</P>
<P>
	This would set the stage for a formal Security Council meeting  
to adopt the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats said they do not expect any action by the council  
until Wednesday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the council's 15 members played no part in negotiating  
the text and were seeing the draft for the first time -- Brazil, 
Gabon, Gambia, Malaysia, Namibia, Slovenia, Argentina and Bahrain. 
Their ambassadors will have to send the draft to their governments 
for approval, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the peace plan, the Security Council must authorize an  
international force and civilian administration that would be sent 
to Kosovo under U.N. auspices to ensure the safe return of the 
estimated 860,000 refugees. The Yugoslav government agreed to the 
peace deal Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ARBUTUS, Md. (AP) -- A truck carrying a backhoe hit a pedestrian  
bridge and sent it crashing down on the Baltimore Beltway at the 
height of the today afternoon rush hour, killing one person and 
critically injuring three others. 
</P>
<P>
	The bridge crushed the front ends of three cars. The man who was  
killed was trapped in his sport utility vehicle, said Capt. Michael 
Robinson, a spokesman for the Baltimore County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Three women were hospitalized in critical but stable condition.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no one on the footbridge, which has been closed for  
three years because of vandalism and crime. The bridge passed an 
inspection last month, said Jack Cahalan, a spokesman for the state 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident halted traffic in both directions on Interstate 695  
-- the main artery around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were questioning the truck driver.

<HEADLINE> Online Book Retailer Offers Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Online retailer Amazon.com launched a new music service Tuesday,  
offering free downloads of songs in the controversial MP3 digital 
format and an industry-preferred format. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based leader in online book and video sales hopes to  
use the digital freebies as a teaser to boost CD sales and set the 
stage for a pay-per-song future at www.amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial selection of downloadable music doesn't include any  
chart-topping hits, although there are songs from well-known 
artists such as Sarah McLachlan, Lyle Lovett, and Public Enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the songs will be available in both the MP3 files  
popular with Internet music bootleggers and in Liquid Audio, which 
makes downloaded music hard to share with those who haven't paid 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com will continue to offer both until industry leaders  
settle on a common standard that will serve the needs of both 
manufacturers and consumers, said Amazon.com spokesman Greg Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	The two formats are not interchangeable, a concern for  
Amazon.com and other would-be Internet music providers looking to 
make a seamless transition from traditional music sales to online 
downloads. 
</P>
<P>
	The MP3 format has bedeviled the music industry for more than a  
year as Internet savvy fans copy and trade the songs on Web sites, 
depriving the recording industry of royalties. 

</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Software for both MP3 and Liquid Audio music players is

<HEADLINE> School Buses Found Safer Than Vans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It may be cheaper to transport students in  
vans instead of schools buses, but it's ``an economical advantage 
purchased at the safety of children,'' according to the head of the 
National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrapping up a special investigation into four crashes involving  
``nonconforming buses,'' Jim Hall, the board's chairman, said 
Tuesday that the standard yellow bus provides better crash 
protection than vans and should be the only type of vehicle used to 
take students to school and school-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The crashes that were the subject of the investigation occurred  
in 1998 and earlier this year in Sweetwater, Fla., Lenoir City, 
Tenn., East Dublin, Ga., and Bennettsville, S.C. They killed nine 
people, including eight students. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the vehicle damage would have been less and  
the injuries not as severe had the accidents involved school buses, 
not a van or a ``specialty bus'' -- a slightly larger vehicle akin 
to an airport rental car shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	School buses, unlike standard passenger vans, have special  
rollover protections and encase their occupants in a cocoon of 
padded seats and seatbacks. They also have welds designed to keep 
them from splitting open on impact. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, school buses are painted an eye-catching yellow and  
equipped with emergency exits, special warning lights and movable 
arms that block students from walking directly in front of them. 
Many of the protections date from a 1977 change in federal law, 
which was prompted by earlier recommendations from the safety 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``nonconforming bus'' is any vehicle that can carry 10 or more  
people and is used to take students to school or school-related 
activities, yet does not meet federal school bus standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits car dealers from selling vehicles that do  
not meet federal school bus regulations to schools that plan to use 
them to transport children. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many states have exemptions in their school bus laws  
for after-school, day care or church programs. Even the federal 
government has lagged in developing rules for transporting children 
involved in such activities as Head Start, the early-childhood 
education program. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst accident examined by the safety board occurred on Feb.  
16 in Bennettsville, S.C. Six children were killed, including three 
who were thrown from the vehicle, when the 15-passenger van they 
were riding in was struck by a tow truck. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 26, 1998, a 25-passenger specialty bus taking students  
home after an academic competition was rammed by a tractor-trailer 
in Lenoir City, Tenn., when the van's driver attempted a U-turn on 
a highway. A teacher and a student were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The East Dublin, Ga., accident occurred on Dec. 8, 1998, when a  
15-person van taking children to a Head Start program collided with 
a pickup truck. One child was ejected and killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 15-person van was involved in the Sweetwater, Fla.,  
accident, when it was struck by a transit bus at an intersection on 
March 25, 1998. Three children were ejected and suffered head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-member board only has the power to make safety  
recommendations, not rules. In a unanimous vote, the board urged 
the nation's governors to ensure that students are transported only 
in vehicles meeting the school bus standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also urged the Department of Health and Human Services  
to extend the same protection to children participating in Head 
Start. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government needs to practice what it preaches and  
it needs to start with Head Start,'' Hall said.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Urge Passage of Y2K Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The heads of the nation's major business and  
high-tech groups urged Congress and the White House today to enact 
legislation protecting them from being battered by Y2K-related 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K litigation bill, which could return to the Senate floor  
this week, is the number one priority of the high-tech industry, 
Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association 
of America, said at a news conference on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, he said, should ``unshackle the new economy'' by  
approving a compromise measure sponsored by Sens. John McCain, 
R-Ariz., Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	National Association of Manufacturers president Jerry Jasinowski  
said a coalition of more than 100 business groups comprising most 
of the country's economy was pushing hard for the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge those in the administration who understand and  
acknowledge that this is a reasonable bill to get on this train 
before it leaves the station,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats, upset over unrelated disputes with the  
Republican leadership, have twice before blocked floor action on 
the Y2K litigation bill. But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., said an agreement had been reached with the Democrats to 
resume debate on Wednesday, raising chances for quick approval of 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said Democrats would stop  
their delaying tactics and permit the measure to come up for 
debate. But unless changes are made in the GOP-drafted measure, he 
said, ``it will be vetoed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the urging of Wyden, Dodd and other Democrats, the Senate  
bill is being changed to better protect the rights of those with 
legitimate legal complaints. Caps on punitive damage awards will be 
limited to small businesses and personal liability caps for 
officers of businesses and corporations will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has nonetheless threatened to veto the bill.  
It supports the bill's provisions giving defendants a 90-day period 
to fix computer problems before lawsuits are filed and encouraging 
mediation, but says other provisions tip the balance between 
defendant and plaintiff rights. 
</P>
<P>
	There are stronger administration objections to a House version  
which passed last month and is viewed as applying more restraints 
on the right to sue for damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The business community says that without some controls they  
could be swamped by frivolous lawsuits initiated by those trying to 
make money from the disruptions that may occur from computers that 
misread the 2000 date as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	``One big lawsuit could cause a retail company, especially a  
smaller one, to falter. More than one lawsuit could cause 
catastrophe,'' said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Chamber of Commerce president and CEO Thomas J. Donohue  
said that while business groups support overall tort reform to rein 
in frivolous lawsuits, they have been careful to make clear that 
this is a one-time measure concerned only with the Y2K issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not using this as a subterfuge or cover to get a lot of  
other tort reform,'' he said. ``This has to be a clean bill.''

<HEADLINE> Credit Card Cos. Come Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- University of Central Oklahoma freshman Mitzi  
Pool, $2,500 in debt, hanged herself in her dorm room, her 
checkbook and credit card bills spread out on her bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups are citing the 1997 death to underscore their  
criticism of credit card companies, accusing the companies of 
trying to get college students hooked on credit the way cigarette 
makers tried to get young people hooked on tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Credit card companies are targeting America's children,''  
Frank Torres, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said Tuesday 
at a news conference organized by the Consumer Federation of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFA also released a study by Georgetown University  
sociologist Robert Manning indicating some students are forced to 
cut back on their courses or spend more time working to pay off 
their credit card debts. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of students at four-year colleges have at least  
one credit card, and revolving debt on these cards averages more 
than $2,000, Manning's study said. In the worst cases, students 
must drop out of school and work full time. 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Trisha Johnson of Enid, Okla., recounted  
how her daughter Mitzi had phoned her on a December night in 1997, 
crying because she had lost her part-time job and didn't know what 
to do. She already had maxed out three credit cards after 3 1/2 months 
of college. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to assure her that ... we would sit down and go over  
her bills and work some plan out,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``This was my 
last conversation with my daughter.'' Later that night, the 
18-year-old killed herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit card companies such as Visa USA Inc. and MasterCard  
International have defended their college marketing practices, 
maintaining that most students use credit responsibly and 
appreciate getting the cards as a way to establish a credit 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the suicides of Ms. Pool and Sean Moyer, a University  
of Oklahoma junior who had $10,000 in credit card debt when he 
killed himself in 1998, Visa said: ``The loss of a young person is 
tragic under any circumstances, and it is very troubling to hear of 
the loss these families suffered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Visa and its (member banks) feel a strong responsibility to  
educate college students about wisely managing their personal 
finances,'' the company said in a statement. ``We see financial 
education as an important tool to prevent problems before they 
occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer groups also criticized colleges and universities  
for allowing what they said was aggressive marketing of credit 
cards on campuses and benefiting financially from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit card companies pay colleges and universities fees to be  
able to sponsor school programs and student activities, to rent 
tables on campus used to solicit students to apply for cards, and 
for marketing agreements such as ``affinity'' cards linked to 
colleges, the groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	A study last fall by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group  
found credit card companies lure students with free T-shirts, 
Frisbees and other items if they apply for cards. It also found 
that students who obtain cards that way often end up with bigger 
unpaid balances and pay off their debts later than those who do 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unrestricted marketing of credit cards on college campuses  
is so aggressive that it now poses a greater threat than alcohol or 
sexually transmitted diseases,'' said Manning. ``Typically, 
students slide into debt through the extension (by credit card 
companies) of unaffordable credit lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His study, partially funded by the CFA, was based on interviews  
with and questionnaires completed by students at Georgetown 
University, American University and the University of Maryland, all 
in the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue that campuses are concerned about,'' said  
Jacqueline King, director of federal policy analysis for the 
American Council on Education, which represents college and 
university administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	She said some schools have raised concerns about aggressive  
soliciting by employees of marketing firms hired by credit card 
companies, while others have banned them from setting up tables on 
campus. Most students are able to handle credit responsibly, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Wackerman, a spokesman for Georgetown, acknowledged that  
schools can benefit financially from credit card promotions. 
However, he added, credit card companies need to conduct their 
activities in a responsible way. Manning's report ``raised some 
good issues,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassandra Robinson, a University of Maryland spokeswoman, said  
the school no longer allows credit card issuers to physically 
solicit students on campus. And American University's Todd Sedmak 
said the campus bookstore has stopped solicitations, though student 
groups can still sponsor them. 
</P>
<P>
	About a month ago, the House passed a bill sought by credit card  
companies that would make it tougher for people to erase their 
debts in bankruptcy court. It passed 313-108. Parallel legislation 
is pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Brobeck, the CFA's executive director, urged Congress on  
Tuesday to adopt a measure requiring people under age 21 to get a 
parent's approval or demonstrate sufficient income before obtaining 
credit cards.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Economic Adviser May Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Janet Yellen is expected to step down from her  
job as chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, an 
administration official says. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity, said  
Yellen would depart soon, marking the third resignation of a 
Clinton economic appointee in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 12, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin announced he would be  
stepping down around July 4. Clinton has nominated Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers to replace Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Alice Rivlin, whom Clinton appointed vice chairman of  
the Federal Reserve, announced her resignation from the central 
bank, effective July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen has served as head of the three-member CEA since 1997. At  
the time, her appointment was seen as an administration effort to 
foster closer ties with the Fed, where Yellen was serving when 
Clinton tapped her for the CEA post. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the CEA is considered the president's chief  
economist, and the three economists who serve on the council are 
used as the administration's in-house think tank on economic 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen was one of Clinton's first two appointees to the Fed.  
Before joining the central bank, Yellen was an economics professor 
at the University of California at Berkeley, specializing in the 
causes and implications of unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen was Clinton's third CEA chairman, following Laura Tyson,  
another Berkeley professor, and Joseph Stiglitz. Tyson has returned 
to Berkeley as dean of the business school, and Stiglitz is chief 
economist at the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen's departure would leave the Council of Economic Advisers  
with only one member, Rebecca M. Blank. Clinton has nominated 
Harvard professor Robert Lawrence to fill the other vacancy on the 
three-member panel, but the Senate has not yet acted on the 
nomination.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Five masked gunmen burst into a small  
concrete house Tuesday and shot dead five youths in what police 
said was an apparent drug dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings took place at dawn in the sugar cane growing region  
of Serrana, 175 miles northwest of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were between 16- and 17-years-old and all had  
criminal records for possession and sale of cocaine, said Ricardo 
Dama Cecilio, an officer at the Serrana police department. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing one youth who survived the shooting, Cecilo said the  
killers wore police uniforms and were armed with handguns.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Jailed drug lord Miguel Rodriguez  
Orejuela appeared before a judge on Tuesday to deny charges he 
tried to bribe his way out of a narcotics conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez Orejuela, who along with his brother Gilberto led the  
Cali cocaine cartel, requested the hearing in Bogota's La Picota 
prison, where he is serving a 20-year sentence for drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	He is being investigated for allegations that he offered a  
$640,000 bribe to a judge dealing with cases involving violent drug 
traffickers or terrorism. The accusation was filed by the judge who 
received the alleged offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists were not allowed into the session, and prosecutors  
have declined to say when the attempted bribe occurred or offer 
other details on the case. If convicted of the new charges, Miguel 
Rodriguez Orejuela could tack on between two and six years to his 
current sentence, which was shortened after he confessed and agreed 
to cooperate with authorities. 
</P>

	The Rodriguez Orejuela brothers were arrested and the cartel  
dismantled by Colombian police in 1995.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- An Argentine provincial governor  
has abandoned his plans to seek the Peronist party's nomination for 
president, leaving Eduardo Duhalde as the party's flag bearer in 
Argentina's October elections, reports said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, governor of the San Luis province, told a  
gathering of supporters on Monday he was relinquishing plans to run 
in the Peronist's July 4 primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez Saa had been given little chance of beating Duhalde,  
the governor of Buenos Aires province and a party stalwart who in 
the past had declared himself the ``natural'' candidate to succeed 
President Carlos Menem. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls have shown Duhalde has pulled even with Buenos  
Aires Mayor Fernando de la Rua, the presidential candidate from an 
opposition alliance of the centrist Radical Civic Union and the 
center-left Frepaso party.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Thousands of landless farm workers  
marched in southern Brazil on Tuesday to demand land and freedom 
for jailed compatriots in Parana state, a hotbed of agrarian 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding banners reading ``No more killing,'' some 4,000  
protesters massed in front of the governor's palace in Curitiba, 
the Parana state capital 420 miles southwest of Rio, organizers 
said. Hundreds set up makeshift tents on the lawn outside in 
preparation for a long protest, as police watched from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here for as long as it takes to free our 42  
companions,'' Roberto Baggio, a leader of the Landless Rural 
Workers Movement, said by phone from Curitiba. 
</P>
<P>
	Baggio said police had arrested some 200 members of the  
movement, which encourages farm workers to invade idle land to 
pressure the government to speed up agrarian reform. Fifteen 
members were killed in clashes over land. he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Uneven distribution of land is behind the violence in Brazil,  
where one-fifth of the population owns nearly 90 percent of the 
arable land.

<HEADLINE> 'Moneyline' Host Quits CNN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lou Dobbs, one of TV's most prominent financial  
journalists, resigned from CNN on Tuesday after reports that he had 
been clashing with the cable network's top executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs has been host of CNN's nightly financial wrap-up,  
``Moneyline,'' and is also president of the spinoff financial 
network, CNNfn. 
</P>
<P>
	He is negotiating to join a startup Internet firm, Space.com,  
which will deliver news and entertainment about outer space, 
according to a CNN executive who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs and CNN President Rick Kaplan did not return telephone  
calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs was replaced on ``Moneyline'' on Tuesday by Tony Guida.  
Willow Bay, who is a host of the newsmagazine ``NewsStand,'' will 
be an interim ``Moneyline'' anchor. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, Dobbs was involved in an unusually public  
tiff with Kaplan. A visibly unhappy Dobbs interrupted ``Moneyline'' 
so CNN could show a presidential news conference from Colorado and 
told viewers it was under Kaplan's orders. 
</P>
<P>
	It prompted a Kaplan deputy to issue memos stating that CNN's  
executive producers have the authority to break into ``Moneyline'' 
to cover news when warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported there had been longstanding  
tension between Dobbs and Kaplan, with Dobbs complaining about 
money being spent on ``NewsStand,'' a series Kaplan has championed. 
</P>
<P>
	CNNfn has run a distant second in influence to CNBC, the cable  
leader in business news. CNBC is seen in 69 million homes, while 
CNNfn is available in less than 10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Dobbs' ``Moneyline,'' shown weeknights for an hour at 6:30  
p.m., draws more than twice as many viewers as CNBC's competing 
``Business Center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is one of the people who helped put business news on the  
map in television,'' said George Jamison, a CNBC spokesman. ``He 
was a strong competitor and a respected journalist. This is a big 
loss for CNN and CNNfn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs became the second prominent CNN personality to resign this  
spring. The first was international correspondent Peter Arnett, who 
was out of favor at the network following last year's retracted 
``NewsStand'' report about the Vietnam War.

<HEADLINE> IBM Accuses Microsoft of Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A manager for IBM today accused Microsoft of  
dangling valuable discounts for Windows if IBM agreed not to 
distribute rival software on its line of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegation in Microsoft's antitrust trial from Garry Norris,  
supported by his handwritten notes from a March 1997 meeting, was 
characterized by government lawyers as the most flagrant example of 
Microsoft Corp.'s illegal aggression toward competitors.	   However, Norris, a mid-level manager for International Business 
Machines Corp., backed off a central claim in his earlier testimony 
-- that Microsoft proposed an alliance in 1994 if IBM would abandon 
its rival OS/2 operating system and ``primarily promote'' Windows 
on its computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Rick Pepperman confronted Norris with later  
drafts of the alliance proposal -- which IBM ultimately rejected -- 
requiring IBM to promote Windows ``but not exclusive to products 
offered by other divisions of IBM, affiliates or ventures of IBM.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said he never saw those later drafts, but acknowledged  
they didn't include restrictions against selling OS/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly appears that way,'' Norris said.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson asked Norris how he  
could be sure the later drafts were genuine, since they weren't 
turned over by IBM but were found in Microsoft's files. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperman offered to put on the witness stand two Microsoft  
executives to vouch for the drafts. But in a stinging rebuke, the 
judge replied that if they were to testify, ``there's a lot more 
they'll have to testify about than these documents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Norris testified about Microsoft's alleged  
efforts to dissuade IBM from supporting software rivals. He said 
said that Microsoft executive Bengt Ackerlind had told him clearly 
during a 1997 meeting: ``No Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government showed the judge Norris' handwritten notes from  
that meeting, when Microsoft allegedly offered to increase rebates 
available under its Market Development Agreements if IBM promised 
not to include Internet software from Netscape Communications Corp. 
in the personal computers it sold. 
</P>
<P>
	In notes he marked in the margins with three asterisks for  
significance, Norris wrote: ``No Netscape &AMP; receive more MDA $ 
across the PC Co.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, the government's next-to-last witness in the trial,  
recounted the meeting with Ackerlind, who wanted IBM to distribute 
on its computers the fourth version of Microsoft's Internet 
Explorer Web browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have to agree to load IE 4 without any competitive  
software,'' Norris said, shifting in his seat to face the judge. 
``Bengt was very specific. He said, 'No Netscape.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For a second day, the judge appeared transfixed by parts of the  
testimony. He took notes and alternated glances between Norris and 
Microsoft's lawyers at their defense table. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said outside the courtroom that  
Ackerlind was referring only to the software to be loaded on a 
prototype ``Broadcast PC,'' an expensive computer with television 
features that IBM and Microsoft considered developing years ago but 
ultimately canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe such a proposal was ever made,'' Murray said.  
</P>
<P>
	Murray also noted that IBM continues to this day to distribute  
rival software on its popular line of desktops and portable 
Thinkpad machines. The price IBM pays for Windows remains among the 
lowest in the industry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But E-mail from Norris about plans for the Broadcast PC  
indicated that Microsoft offered IBM other incentives -- including 
the secret blueprints to Windows -- if it agreed to ``neutralize'' 
its desktops and Thinkpads, and even its business-level servers by 
removing ``objectionable software.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft described a ``neutral'' computer as one that included  
Microsoft's own word processor, spreadsheet, digital encyclopedia, 
Internet software, finance software and several games, Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said Microsoft was angry about IBM's support for  
Netscape's Internet software and its distribution of the Lotus 
Development Corp. ``SmartSuite'' package of business applications. 
IBM bought Lotus in the summer of 1995, and SmartSuite competes 
directly with the lucrative Microsoft Office package.

<HEADLINE> Zurich Opera Head Moves to Cleveland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Franz Welser-Moest, head of the Zurich Opera,  
has been named music director of the Cleveland Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Welser-Moest signed a five-year contract Monday and will take  
over in 2002 when music director Christopher von Dohnanyi retires. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Welser-Moest ``is equally at home with classical  
and Central European repertoire as he is with innovative and 
unusual contemporary repertoire,'' said Richard Bogomolny, 
president of the orchestra's board. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian conductor was trained as a violinist but turned to  
conducting following a serious car accident in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	His international career began in 1986 when he filled in as a  
substitute conductor for the London Philharmonic. He ultimately 
served as its music director for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, Welser-Moest has been in Zurich, where he has gained  
a reputation for improving the symphony and luring renowned 
conductors as guests, including von Dohnanyi. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a recording contract with EMI/Angel and has twice been  
nominated for Grammy Awards for recordings with the London 
Philharmonic and Philadelphia Orchestra. 
</P>

	Financial terms of his contract with the Cleveland Orchestra  
were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Stars' Belfour Allows 3 Late Goals </HEADLINE>

	DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Stars fans were screaming ``Ed-die!  
Ed-die!'' before Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals even began. They

two third-period goals and another 15:30 into overtime as the

first 11 before giving up goals to Stu Barnes and Wayne Primeau 
within a 5:04 span of the third period, then was beat by Jason 
Woolley in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we were going to get our chances,'' Buffalo captain  
Michael Peca said. ``It was just a matter of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek stopped 35 shots, allowing two goals when Dallas had a  
man-advantage. The Stars got a power-play goal from Brett Hull 
midway through the first period and Jere Lehtinen scored with 48 
seconds left in regulation while Dallas went with an empty net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we shot a lot of pucks right at him,'' Stars captain  
Derian Hatcher said. ``Not to take anything away from him, but I 
don't think we forced him to make too many spectacular saves. We 
have to make it tougher on Dominik.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour made several big saves in overtime. He was all over a  
breakaway chance by Geoff Sanderson with 8:44 left that again had 
fans cheering his name. 
</P>
<P>
	With 6:07 left, fans held their breath when Belfour stopped a  
shot but didn't smother the rebound. The puck was accidentally 
kicked back toward the net by Brian Skrudland as he skated away, 
but Belfour covered it just before it crossed the goal line. 
Officials reviewed the play and upheld the initial no-goal ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Woolley took a pass from the wall and sent a slap shot  
under Belfour, dropping his career record to 14-14 in overtime 
playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a seeing-eye dog; it goes through Eddie's legs,'' Dallas  
coach Ken Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley skated into corner with his arms up and leaned against  
the glass as a dejected Belfour skated off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had just come off the bench, so I think I snuck up on  
them,'' Woolley said. ``I got lucky it went in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour, playing in his second career finals, is still seeking  
his first win. He was in goal for Chicago when Pittsburgh swept 
them in the 1992 finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour looked good early, even though Buffalo tested him just  
five times in the first period and four more in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres finally got to him with 11:27 left in the third  
period when Joe Juneau found Stu Barnes uncovered in front of the 
net and he fired a waist-high slap shot that beat Belfour on his 
glove side, tying the game at 1. 
</P>
<P>
	After two nice saves, Buffalo went ahead 2-1 on Primeau's  
power-play goal that Belfour probably never saw. 
</P>
<P>
	``My main job is just to create traffic and screen the  
goaltender,'' Primeau said. ``The guys were playing the puck really 
well around the outside. A rebound came to me and I was able to pop 
it home.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up in Midday Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was sharply lower against the yen  
Wednesday morning amid speculation a Japanese government report 
will indicate the economy is recovering. Tokyo stocks edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.36 yen in early trading, down 1.96 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but higher than its level of 118.88 yen 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 18.85 points, or 0.01 percent, to  
finish the morning session at 16,581.77. On Tuesday, the average 
closed up 87.03 points, or 0.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar came under selling pressure overseas following rumors  
that a government report due out Thursday would show the country 
may be finally recovering from its worst recession since World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors emerged that the report would show GDP growing, perhaps  
indicating that Japan has turned the corner in its fight against 
its economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency's relative strength from its New York level came  
after traders bought the greenback to cover short, or oversold, 
positions amid concerns that Japanese financial officials might 
warn against a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, influential Japanese finance ministry official,  
Eisuke Sakakibara, warned against a strengthening of the yen before 
Japan's economy recovers. Traders said that caution remained 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 124.77 yen, down  
from 125.98 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices edged higher despite a 143-point  
fall in the Dow Jones industrial average Tuesday and a stronger 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.46 points, or 0.04 percent, to 1,344.60. The 
TOPIX closed up 10.49 points, or 0.79 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.5600 percent from  
Tuesday's finish of 1.5750 percent, driving its price up to 98.61 
yen from 98.48 yen.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses War Powers Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by  
House members who accused President Clinton of overstepping his 
authority when he ordered the U.S. military to take part in the 
bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31 lawmakers who filed the lawsuit claimed that Clinton  
violated the 1973 War Powers Act when he authorized U.S. 
involvement in the NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vietnam War-era legislation, which has been ignored by  
presidents of both parties, requires a president to receive 
congressional approval for the ``introduction into hostilities'' of 
U.S. forces for more than 60 days. The NATO air campaign began 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman did not addressing the merits  
of the claim in dismissing the case Tuesday but ruled that the 
lawmakers lacked the legal standing to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plaintiffs have failed to establish a sufficiently genuine  
impasse between the legislative and executive branches to give them 
standing,'' Friedman wrote in his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Campbell, the California Republican who led the  
lawmakers suing the president, said he would appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effect of today's ruling is to prevent any member of  
Congress from contesting a war that the president initiates and 
carries forward in the absence of a declaration of Congress,'' 
Campbell said in a statement. ``That is an absurdity if the 
Constitution's war declaration authority is to have any meaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their lawsuit, the 31 lawmakers, including four Democrats,  
noted a 213-213 vote on April 28 that fell short of authorizing 
U.S. participation in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Another vote 
that day rejected a resolution declaring a state of war between the 
two countries. The lawmakers claim that Clinton ignored both votes 
by continuing with the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Friedman said that ``congressional reaction to the  
airstrikes has sent distinctly mixed messages.'' He noted that 
Congress later defeated a bill that would have removed U.S. troops 
from Yugoslavia. It also passed an emergency spending bill to help 
pay for bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had the four votes been consistent and against the president's  
position, and had he nevertheless persisted with airstrikes in the 
face of such votes, there may well have been a constitutional 
impasse,'' Friedman said. ``But Congress has not sent such a clear, 
consistent message.''

<HEADLINE> Niners Sign Cornerback McMillian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Free agent cornerback Mark McMillian  
was signed to a three-year contract by the San Francisco 49ers on 
Tuesday, adding depth and experience to a secondary stung by big 
plays last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract weren't disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	McMillian, whose ballhawking style produced 11 interceptions  
over the last two seasons in Kansas City, joined the 49ers in time 
to take part in the opening of the team's full-squad four-day 
minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco, which ranked second-to-last in pass defense last  
year, is in the process of remaking its secondary. The 49ers lost 
cornerback Marquez Pope to free agency and free agent bust Antonio 
Langham was claimed in the expansion draft by Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	R.W. McQuarters and Darnell Walker, who began last season as  
backups but wound up being pressed into starting roles, begin the 
year as the team's top two cornerbacks. San Francisco also drafted 
Anthony Parker and Pierson Prioleau last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci said McMillian could wind up starting or  
playing in the nickel defense. In either case, he's expected to 
tighten up coverage in a secondary that was all too vulnerable last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's technically sound. He's very veteran savvy. He's played a  
lot back there,'' Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-7, McMillian will be San Francisco's shortest  
defensive back but Mariucci said he doesn't expect him to have 
matchup problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows how to play against all these receivers that we're  
playing against and don't let the size fool you,'' Mariucci said. 
``It's like (5-foot-8) Darnell Walker. He's very productive, very 
capable and very experienced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMillian is joining his fourth NFL team. He spent his first  
four years in Philadelphia and spent one season with New Orleans 
before going to Kansas City in 1997, when he had a career-high 
eight interceptions including one in the Chief's 44-9 victory over 
the 49ers that season. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hopes to win a starting job but will fulfill his job  
with the team whether its coming off the bench or playing fulltime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been starting for seven years so I don't feel I'm a  
nickel guy,'' McMillian said. ``I'm going in with the idea that I'm 
going to start. If I don't, then the guy that's in front of me, 
he's going to get pushed, and make him even better.''

<HEADLINE> For Now, New Hastert Strategy Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heeding House Speaker Dennis Hastert's call  
for Republican unity, GOP lawmakers have pushed the first spending 
bill of the year through the chamber. But it is unclear how far 
their newfound togetherness will take them. 
</P>
<P>
	On a near party-line 246-183 vote, the House approved a $61  
billion measure Tuesday financing agriculture, food and drug 
programs for fiscal 2000. It was the first of the 13 annual 
spending bills for the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1, to 
pass either chamber of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage marked a victory for Hastert, R-Ill., because until  
Tuesday the measure had been bogged down by conservatives angry 
that the measure spent too much. It was approved only after the 
House voted 234-195 -- again mostly along party lines -- to cut $102 
million from Agriculture Department construction and other accounts 
in the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	It also came after Hastert used a closed-door morning meeting  
with Republicans to rally them behind his leadership after six 
months in which the House GOP's agenda has slowed markedly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am asking each of you as directly as I can, search your  
heart, search your conscience, and then decide to join us,'' he 
told them, according to excerpts provided by his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending cuts -- which Republicans hope to follow with  
reductions in some other spending bills -- are designed to portray 
the GOP as fiscally conservative. They are also aimed at creating a 
pot of money that can be added to some of the later, bigger 
spending measures for education, environment and other programs so 
they can garner enough votes to pass the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall GOP goal is to keep all 13 spending bills below the  
$538 billion cap set by the 1997 budget-balancing pact with 
President Clinton. They will not propose spending beyond that, they 
say, because to do so would require spending Social Security 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to show the American people which party is for a  
smaller government, which party wants to strengthen Social 
Security, and which party wants to return the surpluses to the 
taxpayer before it is spent,'' Hastert told his colleagues at their 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, most Republicans concede that some of the biggest, most  
controversial spending bills may never be approved by the House, 
and won't make it into law without autumn negotiations with the 
White House. That is because they will fall billions below 1999 
levels and even further below what Clinton wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said it will be a ``long, hot  
summer. It's going to be difficult, we know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Only in their own mind'' have Republicans solved their problem  
of pushing the spending bills through the House, said Rep. David 
Obey, D-Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bills expected to endure relatively small cuts include  
measures financing the Treasury Department and Congress' own 
operations. A $270 billion measure financing the Pentagon was 
expected to be exempted because of the GOP's strong pro-defense 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's larger concern was the November 2000 elections and  
worries that GOP infighting over spending, taxes and other issues 
are undermining their chances of retaining House control. Those 
internal differences are magnified by the GOP's thin majority, in 
which defections by just six Republicans could defeat a GOP 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Praise for Hastert's remarks came from both conservative and  
moderate Republicans, some of whom contrasted them with the more 
fiery style of his predecessor as speaker, Rep. Newt Gingrich, 
R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just appealed to everybody to be part of the team,'' said  
conservative Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla. ``We weren't called 
stupid once. ... Nobody was taken to task for questioning the 
genius of the Republican leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By honoring spending caps and delivering a promised $19 billion  
increase for defense, domestic spending bills would be more than 
$30 billion short of what Clinton wants to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the extra $7 billion Republicans hope to find from  
trimming some bills and selling part of the broadcast spectrum, at 
least three bills covering health, veterans, commerce and other 
programs are likely to fall well short of what Clinton will demand. 
That is likely to lead to negotiations with Clinton this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Differences remained among Republicans over other complicated  
issues such as which taxes to cut, how strictly to limit access to 
guns, the Kosovo intervention and whether to overhaul campaign 
finance laws.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Cancels More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways canceled more than half  
its flights Tuesday as more pilots called in sick ahead of Friday's 
deadline for them to either accept a pay cut or lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay bosses plan to meet again with the pilots union before  
Friday, but it was not clear exactly when. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides met Saturday and reported no progress, although  
the union has said it hopes for a negotiated settlement. The pilots 
say they will call a strike vote if anybody is fired in the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	To gauge support for further strike action, the Hong Kong  
Aircrew Officers Association has asked its members to indicate to 
an independent legal consultant whether they would accept Cathay's 
pay deal on the deadline, or whether they intend to continue the 
fight on, the South China Morning Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay spokeswoman Quince Chong confirmed that the company has  
been informed of the survey, but would not further comment. The 
lawyers and union officials were not immediately available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay had to cancel 67 of its 113 scheduled flights Tuesday,  
but it beefed up its schedule by hiring other airlines to operate 
39 services on a charter basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay is demanding that air crew give pay concessions averaging  
7 percent over two years in exchange for stock options. The airline 
is trying to cut costs and reverse losses brought on by Asia's 
financial crisis and Hong Kong's recession. 
</P>
<P>
	After Cathay said May 28 that pilots had two weeks to either  
take the offer, quit or be fired, the pilots began phoning in sick 
en masse. That has forced sharp reductions in Cathay's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The union said it did not organize the sickout but that pilots  
are not reporting because the layoff threats have made them too 
stressed to fly.

<HEADLINE> 'Average Joe' Frustrates the Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Law enforcers have come to bank on the elusive  
robber's routine: Smiling in sunglasses, he coolly waits his turn 
to see a teller, then springs a note demanding cash and, sometimes, 
a cordial sendoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten times at different Detroit-area banks he's done it since  
April, each time making off with loot and the note he takes back, 
apparently aware of its evidentiary value. 
</P>
<P>
	The bandit is so casually clad, pleasant and smooth in demeanor,  
investigators have dubbed him ``The Average Joe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We call him that based on the fact that he's totally  
unremarkable in what he does,'' Kevin Kendrick, special agent in 
charge of the FBI's Oakland County office in Troy, said Monday. 
``He's basically your chameleon kind of guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not really aggravating. He's more like a thorn. Every so  
often, you're made aware that he's there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe the spree began with a holdup of a Warren  
bank on April 22. Two days later, he robbed another one in that 
Detroit suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Both times, tellers complied with a note's demands for cash, a  
``thank you'' and a ``have a nice day'' -- demands accompanied with 
threats if the courtesies weren't extended, Warren police Detective 
Jeff Pierog said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Oakland County banks were held up in as many days last  
month. The most recent heist came Thursday at a branch in suburban 
Troy. 
</P>
<P>
	In every case, Kendrick said, the suspect ``walks in, waits in  
line like everyone else and isn't rude -- I'll give him that,'' then 
slips the teller a note, snatching it back once it has been read. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time he has demanded cash in small denominations --  
generally $100, $50 and $20 bills. The robber suggests he has a 
weapon but has never shown one, Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveillance cameras have photographed the bandit in various  
disguises and clothes, though without fail he has sported 
sunglasses and a baseball or fishing hat. Several times, he's 
smirked at the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators ``have what we believe to be outstanding photos''  
of the suspect but no sizable leads, Kendrick said. One reason: the 
suspect is, well, average -- a 6-foot, 180-pound man, 25 to 35 years 
old, wearing unremarkable clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hits so many different places it's hard to pinpoint his  
next hit,'' Pierog said. ``There's no rhyme or reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendrick and Comerica Inc. -- targeted in at least six holdups --  
would not divulge the robber's take or security measures banks 
employ. 
</P>
<P>
	A $2,000 reward for his arrest is being offered by the Detroit  
Clearinghouse Association, a banking group. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierog said he thinks success may be a matter of time, and  
believes the suspect is ``getting a little cocky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to wait until the next time he hits. Maybe we'll  
get lucky.''

<HEADLINE> Crashed Plane Cleared for Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Investigators prepared to pore over the  
instruments aboard the American Airlines jet that crashed here last 
week, while an airport hangar has become the grim repository for 
its twisted remains. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots' console containing many of the jet's important  
controls was removed Monday from the smashed nose of the plane 
after it was taken in pieces from its crash site to a private 
hangar. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary evidence indicates the pilots apparently skipped all  
or part of their regular checklist as they tried to land in a 
powerful storm, USA Today reported in today's editions, citing 
unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's co-pilot said last week that he believes the  
spoilers were deployed to help slow the plane, but data recorders 
indicate that they did not open at touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 1420's spoiler system -- along with its anti-skid, thrust  
reverser and braking systems -- will be removed and sent to labs run 
by the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also are examining whether mechanical problems,  
pilot error or severe weather -- or a combination of those factors -- 
played a role in the crash. The plane's engines were removed 
earlier and shipped to an American Airlines hangar in Tulsa, Okla., 
for tests and possible dismantling. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing is expected to take up to three weeks, said lead NTSB  
investigator Greg Feith. Scrutiny of the jet's other parts is 
expected to take months. 
</P>
<P>
	Examinations could reveal whether the flight's first officer is  
correct in believing Capt. Richard Buschmann properly prepared for 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight crashed on landing during a thunderstorm June 1 at  
Little Rock National Airport, killing nine, including Buschmann, 
and injuring more than 80. Fourteen survivors remained hospitalized 
on Monday, three in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services are to be held today and Wednesday in  
Russellville, Ark. for two crash victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet, which made its approach as a violent thunderstorm  
overtook the airport, roared off the runway at 92 mph, clipped a 
bank of lights and slammed into the steel supports of a walkway 
near the Arkansas River. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the airport hangar, the piles of parts create a jarring  
tableau: a jumble of twisted wires dangling from the jet's smashed 
nose, blue passenger seats leaning into a crushed left fuselage and 
a plastic magazine rack still attached to the bulkhead, its 
periodicals undisturbed despite a missing sidewall. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials expect to reopen the airport's damaged runway this  
week.

<HEADLINE> Minor Glitches From Conrail Breakup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minor glitches in rail operations resulting  
from last week's breakup of Conrail Inc. do not warrant major 
concerns for rail safety, a government official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp., the two railroads that  
carved up Conrail, said operations remained relatively smooth one 
week after the split. Minor problems were reported at the railroads 
in some staffing and computer functions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conrail split, which took effect June 1, has come under  
intense scrutiny in light of fatal accidents and delivery delays 
that followed the 1996 merger of Union Pacific Railroad with 
Southern Pacific in the West and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Newman, the Federal Railroad Administration official  
overseeing the Conrail restructuring, praised CSX and Norfolk 
Southern for their level of planning, which had delayed the split 
date and the companies' ability to reap benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a strong confirmation unless things change that the  
long-term duration -- two years worth of planning -- is right on 
target and has been worthwhile,'' Newman said. ``It minimized 
problems with the integration of this gigantic system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Conrail split, the most complex restructuring in modern  
railroading, breaks up a 23-year-old monopoly created by Congress 
in 1976 out of six bankrupt carriers. Norfolk Southern and CSX now 
control virtually all rail traffic east of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Railroad Administration dispatched more than 40  
inspectors since mid-May to identify problems before they turn into 
safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a few complaints from shippers of delays or shipment  
tracking problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very disappointed with the first week's performance,''  
said Norman Black, a spokesman for United Parcel Service. ``We saw 
an unacceptably high number of delays, of trains simply not 
arriving on time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CSX spokesman Rob Gould said the company ran a special train for  
UPS on Tuesday between Baltimore and Jacksonville, Fla. He cited it 
as an example of the company working aggressively to tackle 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern faced some computer troubles initially when  
technicians mistakenly loaded test data. Later, the company 
discovered a few problems with Norfolk Southern and Conrail 
computers talking with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald O'Brian, assistant Norfolk Southern vice president for  
implementation, said the company has technicians dispatched 
throughout the rail network 24 hours a day to handle those 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not ready to declare victory yet, but we are making  
progress each day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern also ran into problems with an unexpected  
number of crew members deciding to take days off in Michigan. Phone 
lines and crews had to be added to restore normal service. 
</P>
<P>
	At CSX, some customers had trouble accessing the railroad's  
electronic data system, used to track shipments and order cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some glitches, but while we didn't anticipate  
these things to be happening, we knew we would have issues that 
would arise and have responded to them,'' said Bob Haulter, 
assistant CSX vice president for integration planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The one major service disruption that occurred at CSX last week  
was not related to the Conrail transaction. A lightning strike at a 
communications center in Florida on Thursday slowed or halted about 
200 trains, including about 15 passenger trains. Computers were 
restored in about three hours.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Cancels More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways canceled more than half  
its flights Tuesday as more pilots called in sick ahead of Friday's 
deadline for them to either accept a pay cut or lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay bosses planned to meet again with the pilots union on  
Wednesday afternoon, but neither side would offer any hints about 
whether a solution was near. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides met Saturday and reported no progress. The pilots  
say they will call a strike vote if anybody is fired in the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay is demanding that air crew give pay concessions averaging  
7 percent over two years in exchange for stock options. The airline 
is trying to cut costs and reverse losses brought on by Asia's 
financial crisis and Hong Kong's recession. 
</P>
<P>
	In an open letter to passengers, the airline's 1,100 pilots said  
they recognize the economic difficulties faced by Cathay and were 
prepared to take significant salary cuts with the stock option 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the airline has made proposals that gives the management the  
right to make unilateral changes to contracts with the pilots, the 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our legal counsel advises that these contracts would not be  
acceptable internationally,'' the pilots said. 
</P>
<P>
	To gauge support for a strike, the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers  
Association asked its members to indicate to an independent legal 
consultant whether they would accept Cathay's pay deal on the 
deadline, or whether they would continue to fight, the South China 
Morning Post reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers will collect the information and forward it to  
Cathay bosses if a large majority indicate that they will not cave 
in, the Post quoted lawyer Michael Lintern-Smith as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay spokeswoman Quince Chong confirmed that the company has  
been informed of the survey, but declined any further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay canceled 67 of its 113 scheduled flights Tuesday, but it  
beefed up its schedule by hiring other airlines to operate 39 
services on a charter basis. 
</P>
<P>
	After Cathay said May 28 that pilots had two weeks to either  
take the offer, quit or be fired, the pilots began phoning in sick 
en masse. That has forced sharp reductions in Cathay's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The union said it did not organize the sickout but that pilots  
are not reporting because the layoff threats have made them too 
stressed to fly.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Mulls Concert Warning Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Seeing Marilyn Manson strapped to a cross  
and wearing a black G-string on stage convinced state Sen. Dale 
Shugars that parents had to be warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was like Satan,'' Shugars said of the April concert by the  
shock rocker in Grand Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing the concert, accompanied by two body guards,  
Shugars lobbied even harder for a bill he sponsored that would 
require parental advisories on tickets, posters and other 
advertising for certain concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure passed the state Senate last month and is now before  
a House committee. If it passes the full House, it would be the 
first law of its kind in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that a lot of times parents weren't aware of what the  
lyrics are, lyrics about drug abuse, raping and killing,'' Shugars 
said. ``Does this guarantee that parents won't let their kids go to 
these concerts? No. But it does guarantee a red flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit entertainment attorney Mike Novak called the bill a  
waste of state time -- and may even backfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is naive to suggest that putting some sort of a  
warning on shows will somehow solve problems,'' Novak said Tuesday. 
``Many bands will seek out this kind of labeling to make them more 
appealing to certain audiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novak also said the bill is insulting because it suggests  
parents don't know what their kids are listening to. 
</P>
<P>
	But state Rep. Sue Tabor, R-Delta Township, argues that she used  
to be one of those parents. 
</P>
<P>
	After her husband read about Shugars' bill, she said, ``he sort  
of declared war in our household.'' The Tabors and their sons held 
a meeting to look through the boys' compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband found one CD that did have the parental advisory  
label on it. He read the lyrics to me and I was absolutely appalled 
and stunned,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to point out that, hey, I think I'm a pretty good  
parent. We try to pay attention, we have a good, loving, Christian 
home. But one of my kids had these CDs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group that got parental warning labels put on albums, the  
Recording Industry Association of America, opposes the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a draconian measure that we feel could undermine a  
program that's working,'' said Joel Flatow, RIAA vice president of 
government affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, concert promoters or venue operators would have  
to put warning labels on tickets, posters or advertisements for any 
artist who has put out an album with a parental advisory label in 
the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would let promoters or venues choose to put the label  
on only one form of advertisement -- for example, only the concert 
posters or only the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	If they fail to put any warning, they could be fined up to  
$5,000. Record companies voluntarily place the warnings on their 
albums as part of the RIAA program, which began in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Wey, a 17-year-old rock fan from East Lansing, said the  
concern over Manson's lyrics is overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these bands that they're trying to target aren't  
really that violent at all,'' he said. ``Marilyn Manson is opposed 
to violence. I think the whole point of his music is trying to be 
yourself.''

<P>
	WOLF CREEK, Ore. (AP) -- In a June 5 story about a pair of  
teen-age murder suspects in rural Oregon, The Associated Press 
erroneously attributed a passage that police found in the 
handwriting of suspect Josh Cain as being lyrics from Marilyn 
Manson's song ``Portrait of an American Family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The passage is not from a Marilyn Manson song and prosecutors  
say they have not been able to identify its source. The passage 
was: ``Dealing with insanity, smoking pot, hating this (expletive) 
world, murder is the answer, I only kill to know I'm alive.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Gore Back From Mental Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tipper Gore told of sinking into such a  
depression that she went to a doctor and said, ``I need some 
help.'' A congresswoman talked about severe mood swings in her 
youth and how she couldn't look after her children. 
</P>
<P>
	A college student said that at age 15, she was taking in only 20  
calories a day and doing so many sit-ups she got sores on her back 
and hips, all in an irrational and potentially deadly drive to be 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving voice to each of these cases, a White House conference  
Monday showed just how close to home mental illness can be. 
</P>
<P>
	Organized by Mrs. Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, the  
meeting tried to make people understand mental illness is a 
sickness much like any other -- ``a real disease of a real organ, 
the brain,'' as one professional put it -- and that no one should 
feel shame or suffer discrimination for getting treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, public attitudes don't lump Mrs. Gore's bout with  
clinical depression 10 years ago in the same category as President 
Clinton's recovery from a bum knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental illness is ``the last great stigma of the 20th century,''  
Mrs. Gore said, noting how cancer and then AIDS were once 
unmentionable in many families. ``Most people treat someone with a 
mental illness as if it's their fault or as if they can just snap 
out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People must know ``there is the right diagnosis and the right  
treatment and the right health care professional out there for 
you,'' she said. About 50 million Americans are estimated to suffer 
some form of mental illness during their lives, but only one in 
five seeks treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons and the Gores shared the stage with CBS newsman  
Mike Wallace, whose own depression once laid him ``lower than a 
snake's belly,'' as well as others who believe healing power is 
found in the knowledge that mental problems strike people in all 
walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lynn Rivers, D-Mich., wife of an auto worker, said mood  
swings in her late teens were first signs of her manic depression. 
Later, ``I had two babies I could not deal with.'' She said the day 
she was diagnosed was a happy one because ``I was finally dealing 
with something that was not my fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, she said it took 10 years to figure out the right mix  
of medication, and the treatment at one point was eating half the 
family's income. She went public with her problem after political 
opponents in the 1994 election that brought her to Congress spread 
word that she had had a breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Against a backdrop of such testimony, Clinton asked Congress to  
ensure Americans with mental illness get the same health benefits 
they now have for broken bones or an asthma attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Without proper treatment for mental illness, he said, ``the loss  
of human potential is staggering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bill to eliminate distinctions between physical and mental  
health coverage is pending in the Senate but the Republican-led 
Congress has been wary of costly health care measures. The health 
insurance industry also is worried about mandated benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our experience has been that mandates, no matter how well  
intentioned, raise the cost of coverage,'' said Richard Coorsh of 
the Health Insurance Association of America. The National 
Association of Manufacturers also criticized the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore said she sought professional help and medication for  
clinical depression because ``I was not myself,'' after her son 
Albert was hit by a car in 1989, an accident from which he has 
recovered. So, she said, has she. ``I'm happy to say that it 
worked,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting heard from Jennifer Gates, a sophomore at William  
and Mary who struggled with anorexia nervosa in high school. 
Compliments about her slim figure made her want to be skinnier 
still. One night her mother, in tears, woke her in the middle of 
the night trying to get her to eat some yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw how much pain she was in,'' she said. ``I couldn't bring  
myself to eat it. I was just so desperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Professional help finally paid off, as it has for Robyn  
Kitchell's son, a manic depressive who recently graduated from the 
eighth grade and won a football award, even as the struggle against 
his illness continues. 
</P>
<P>
	``When mental illness hits puberty, boy is that a ride,''  
Kitchell said. She spoke of the imbalance of a health system that 
would cover her son's physical diagnostic tests for manic 
depression but not the $150 psychiatric sessions in Nashville, 
Tenn.

<HEADLINE> White House Hopefuls To Swarm Calif </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- White House hopefuls plan to swarm  
into California in a hunt for a mother lode of campaign cash, 
delegates and news media attention. 
</P>
<P>
	By advancing its primary to March 7, 2000, California has set  
off an early stampede by presidential aspirants: At least seven 
were scheduled to visit the state this month, and two candidates' 
wives will appear separately. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is completely unprecedented,'' Michael Schroeder,  
California's former Republican Party chairman, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gale Kaufman, a consultant for former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley,  
said early summer marks a critical time when presidential hopefuls 
must lay groundwork in this massive, expensive state. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``Labor Day always being a significant point in campaigns,  
you really need to have pushed off by then,'' Kaufman said. ``If 
you're looking at a March primary and trying to build a structure, 
something about June makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of this month's visits will not be the sort of political  
``quick hits'' California has previously drawn with its traditional 
June primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, candidates would quietly swoop in, hold a fund-raiser and  
possibly a news conference, and race back to Iowa or New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the Golden State's primary set a week after New  
Hampshire's primary, ``presidential candidates are all over 
California as if they thought it WAS Iowa or New Hampshire,'' 
Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Bradley, a Democrat, plans to hopscotch the state  
for about 10 days this month, holding what his aides bill as small 
forums with community leaders. He'll also raise money. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is the only declared challenger to Vice President Al  
Gore for the Democratic nomination. The two will compete for the 
media spotlight June 18, when both are scheduled to campaign in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men's wives also will campaign in California this month.  
</P>
<P>
	Tipper Gore will appear Saturday with First Lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton at Democratic National Committee fund-raisers in Los 
Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ernestine Bradley was scheduled to campaign today in  
Sacramento. The event is officially a rally to pressure lawmakers 
for more breast cancer research money, but the announcement went 
out under a ``Bill Bradley for President'' letterhead. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the most anticipated campaign swing of the year, Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush has plans to finally appear in California, 
hitting five cities at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush tops recent California polls, but has sequestered himself  
in Austin, Texas, as the Legislature there worked through its 
business. Meantime, Bush's support grew in California, and so did 
curiosity about him. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle spoke in Santa Barbara earlier  
this month. Other Republican presidential hopefuls who also plan 
visits include former Sen. John McCain; conservative commentator 
Pat Buchanan; and Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's team will be smaller when he arrives. On Monday, his  
campaign made more staff cuts, letting go its deputy press 
secretary and a press aide, said a campaign source, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as California basks in its new role in the nomination  
process, there are signs its clout could decline by March. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, other states hoping to attract more attention  
from candidates also are moving their primaries up. Inspired in 
part by California's move, at least 10 other states now plan to 
hold primaries on or before March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, one Republican lawmaker wants to scrap the  
``winner-take-all'' system that gives California much of its appeal 
for candidates, especially front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
	In the current system, the candidate who wins the primary takes  
all the delegates to the party convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ray Haynes has proposed that the delegates be awarded by  
congressional district, with varying numbers of delegates going to 
candidates depending upon how many districts they win in the 
primary.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Prompts Prepackaged Meals Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MULLINS, S.C. (AP) -- The Y2K bug is no pest to a company that  
makes MREs, those infamous prepackaged meals for soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales have jumped for MREs, with some people believing a  
programming glitch will cause millions of computers to malfunction 
on Jan. 1, 2000, shutting down power grids and slowing retail 
supply lines and disrupting commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	To prepare for any possible glitches in the food supply, some  
are turning to ready-to-eat meals. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 10 months ago, we started hearing about Y2K,'' said Dave  
Kuntarich, president of Mullins-based Crown Point Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The ledger hasn't looked the same since, with sales rising 500  
percent in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The meals offer unrivaled convenience. There are 12 in a case.  
Each comes with an entree, a cracker with spread (peanut butter, 
jelly or cheese), fruit and a dessert. Many meals come with side 
dishes, drink mixes, even coffee with cream and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no mixing and no dehydrated foods. Meals can be eaten  
cold or easily heated in their soft ``flexible cans,'' a laminated 
aluminum pouch capable of keeping food fresh for more than 10 
years. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Tuesday,  
with the key index in Jakarta soaring more than 12 percent after 
Indonesia held its freest election in 44 years in remarkable peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the election not only bolstered the troubled  
financial markets of Indonesia and some of its neighbors, it also 
persuaded the International Monetary Fund to approve a $450 million 
loan for Indonesia on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth installment in a rescue package launched after  
Indonesia became the worst victim of the 1997 Asian financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 12.2 percent,  
or 74.569 points, to close at 686.947. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added  
87.03 points, or 0.53 percent, closing at 16,562.92. On Monday, the 
average gained 175.14 points, or 1.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks posted moderate gains on select buying of blue  
chips following an overnight rise on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	But many investors held back to wait for Thursday's release of  
gross domestic product figures for the first quarter, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also awaiting a meeting of finance ministers and  
central bankers from the G-7 industrialized nations over the 
weekend in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.32 yen, up 0.48 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
120.80 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose after an influential Japanese finance ministry  
official warned against a hasty rise in the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian share prices closed sharply higher, with the main  
index rising 3.3 percent after the government announced favorable 
industrial output data for April. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia's industrial production index for April rose 0.8  
percent compared to March and 2.6 percent from a year earlier. 
</P>

	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index, which tracks  
100 blue-chip stocks, rose 24.08 points to 755.09.

pushed the index to a two-year high. The Straits Times Index closed 
up 41.03 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,996.44. 
</P>

<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher as news of an alliance

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mob Lawyer Leads Mayoral Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mob lawyer Oscar Goodman, who represented such  
hoods as Meyer Lansky and Anthony ``Tony the Ant'' Spilotro, was a 
lead-pipe cinch to win election today as mayor of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman faced veteran City Councilman Arnie Adamsen in a runoff.  
The longtime mouthpiece for the mob came within 277 votes of 
winning the mayor's post outright against Adamsen and seven others 
in the May 4 primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, 59, entered the race expecting he would have to defend  
his past with the same zeal he once used to defend his mob clients. 
Instead, he found out that Las Vegas voters didn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a non-issue as far as Las Vegas is concerned,''  
Goodman said Tuesday during some last-minute campaigning. ``It was 
always a non-issue with me. I love my past. I don't apologize for 
one day in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman campaigned with bluster and bravado, calling for  
developers to be assessed fees to help pay for road and air-quality 
improvements made necessary by the city's runaway growth. Donations 
from casinos poured in to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamsen prided himself on paying attention to more mundane  
matters such as crossing guards and stop signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm colorful. That's what got me in the limelight,'' said  
Goodman, who played himself in Martin Scorsese's movie ``Casino.'' 
``But I honestly believe I'm going to be the best mayor Las Vegas 
ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls showed Goodman with a 19-point lead over Adamsen, whose  
warnings that Goodman would be dangerous for Las Vegas' image 
failed to take hold with the voters. Sixty-nine percent said in a 
newspaper poll last week that Goodman would not hurt the city's 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Jan Jones is retiring.  
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, two state legislative primaries became unusually  
interesting because of spiteful party infighting. 
</P>
<P>
	In one primary for the House of Delegates, Democrat William P.  
Robinson easily defeated challenger Luther C. Edmonds, a former 
friend who allegedly pistol-whipped Robinson in 1997. Edmonds' 
trial ended in a mistrial when a jury deadlocked last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In another House race, Republican Anne G. ``Panny'' Rhodes was  
nominated for a fifth term even after party leaders took the rare 
step of supporting her conservative challenger. Gov. Jim Gilmore 
and others in the GOP establishment were upset that she had bucked 
them on tax cuts, welfare reform and abortion restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Judge Acquits 3 of Fund Misuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Three men were cleared of charges they bought  
lingerie, Super Bowl tickets and other goods with $1.3 million 
stolen from the Port of Miami. The judge ruled they couldn't be 
convicted because the money never belonged to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks said prosecutors  
``presented substantial evidence of greed and public corruption, 
the placement of private interests over those of the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he granted a defense motion Monday and acquitted Carmen  
Lunetta, longtime director of the county-owned port, and two 
co-defendants, saying the money didn't yet belong to the county 
when it was used on items such as vacations and a $120,000 donation 
to the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The two other defendants were Calvin Grigsby, the owner of  
Fiscal Operations Inc., which operated cranes at the port; and Neal 
Harrington, a part-owner of a stevedoring company. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said stevedoring companies paid Fiscal Operations  
for use of cranes, and Fiscal Operations turned the money over to 
Miami-Dade County. Fiscal Operations was allowed to deduct $150,000 
a year plus expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors said those expenses were heavily padded with  
such things $6,000 for cleaning Grigsby's yacht, thousands of 
dollars in contributions to the Democratic National Committee, 
Super Bowl tickets, Victoria's Secret lingerie, vacation trips, 
luxury car rentals and bar tabs. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge agreed with defense attorneys' contention that the  
misused money was owed to the county, but since it had not been 
paid, was not owned by the county. 
</P>
<P>
	Grigsby faces trial next month on charges of arranging $350,000  
in kickbacks to two Miami-Dade executives in return for county bond 
business. He owned Grigsby Brandford &AMP; Co., the nation's largest 
minority-owned municipal bond underwriter until it closed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors expressed disappointment, but U.S. Attorney Thomas  
E. Scott said the case ``brought to light the abuse of public trust 
that was rampant at the Port of Miami, and exposed the lack of 
financial controls and oversight that made this type of corruption 
possible.''

	Eight Nations Agree on Kosovo Force  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- The United States, Russia and six other  
nations agree on a U.N. resolution to settle the conflict with 
Yugoslavia and send international troops under NATO command to 
Kosovo. ``We got what we came for,'' Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright proclaimed. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said 
bombing could be suspended in the next few days if Serb troops 
begin withdrawing from the province. The bombing halt is a 
significant concession to Russia, long a vocal opponent to the 
attacks.

	Judge Dismisses War Powers Lawsuit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge today dismissed a lawsuit  
filed by a group of House members who wanted the bombing of 
Yugoslavia by U.S. forces to be declared illegal. The lawsuit by 26 
lawmakers alleged that President Clinton violated the War Powers 
Act of 1973 by authorizing military air strikes against Yugoslavia. 
The Vietnam War-era legislation requires a president to get 
congressional approval for the ``introduction into hostilities'' of 
U.S. forces for more than 60 days. The NATO air campaign began 
March 24.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teen-agers will be carded to see R-rated films  
under a tougher enforcement policy adopted by thousands of movie 
theaters across America. The theater owners were responding to a 
challenge by President Clinton. The National Association of Theater 
Owners represents about 65 percent of the screens in the United 
States. ``R'' in the movie rating system is for restricted, meaning 
anyone under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Likely Republican presidential candidate George W.

effective Sept. 1, an unmarried girl under age 18 cannot get an 
abortion until one of her parents is notified or she gets a judge's 
permission. One Right to Life committee member said abortion 
opponents have been pushing for a notification law for 25 years. 
Bush has been criticized by some in the anti-abortion movement as

weeks away, temps climbed into the 90s. Air conditioners were 
cranked up to full blast and the biggest supplier of electricity in

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Western Hemisphere nations are developing  
their own system to evaluate efforts to stop drug abuse in an 
effort to soothe one of the sorest points in U.S.-Latin American 
relations. The evaluation system developed by the 34-nation 
Organization of American States is not related to the U.S. policy 
of ``certifying'' other nations' drug-fighting efforts. But OAS 
members hope that even if the evaluation system doesn't end U.S. 
drug certification, it could at least influence the criteria used 
in the process.

	Off-Peak Summer Flights Discounted

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines today slashed ticket prices as  
much as 25 percent for off-peak summer travel, a day after warning 
too many empty seats would cause quarterly profits to fall. Delta 
Air Lines, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines were among 
ther first to match the United promotion on domestic and 
international travel. Consumers who purchase tickets for advance 
travel only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays could see as much 
as a 25 percent discount over regularly priced tickets. But tickets 
must be purchased by June 18. The move undercuts a 4 percent boost 
in ticket prices instituted last week by major airlines.

	NORTH ANDOVER, Mass. (AP) -- A stolen car sped by a police car  
and smashed into a pickup truck in a gas station today, killing 
three young women in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was going 75 mph in a 45 mph zone when it passed a  
parked police car, police said. The officer turned on his car's 
lights and pulled onto the highway to stop the car, which appeared

</P>
<P>
	When he next saw the Nissan Maxima, it had crashed into the gas  
station, striking some gas pumps and the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	A man in the car was hospitalized in critical condition. Another  
man, believed to be the driver, was arrested and faces charges of 
motor vehicle homicide and possession of a stolen car, authorities

<HEADLINE> Becker Opens With Win at Queens Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Boris Becker, returning to the site of his first  
pro tennis title 14 years ago, began tuning up for Wimbledon with a 
6-4, 6-4 victory over Petr Korda in the first round of the Queens 
Club tournament on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker, who won this event when he was 17, still showed the deft  
touch and quick movement that helped him to three Wimbledon titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt very comfortable,'' said Becker, who says he'll be  
playing his final Wimbledon and will retire this summer. ``I was a 
bit surprised by my rhythm and my timing. Petr is a good player, 
and good on his returns especially, and I was able to play a very 
solid game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker's next match is against defending champion and  
15th-seeded Scott Draper of Australia, who beat qualifier Oren 
Motovassel of Israel 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (9-7). 
</P>
<P>
	In other matches, Australia's Todd Woodbridge beat Rogier Wassen  
of the Netherlands 6-2, 6-1; Cecil Mamiit of the United States beat 
Germany's Axel Pretzsch 6-3, 6-4; fourth-seeded Mark Philippoussis 
defeated fellow American Michael Sell 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Jim Courier beat Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen 6-2, 4-6, 6-1;  
11th-seeded Cedric Pioline beat Italy's Mose Navarra 7-6 (7-2), 
3-6, 6-1; Germany's Michael Kohlmann beat ninth-seeded Swede Thomas 
Enqvist 6-4, 6-4; and Peter Tramacchi of Australia topped 
16th-seeded Fabrice Santoro 6-3, 7-6 (8-6). 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Becker said he would be playing his last  
Wimbledon, but changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two or three years ago I considered myself one of the few who  
had a chance at Wimbledon,'' the 31-year-old German said. ``I know 
I can play well on grass and I'm going to give a difficult match to 
anybody who's going to play me on it.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Last year's raunchy satire ``Orgazmo'' was  
slapped with an NC-17 rating for its constant stream of sex jokes 
and crude sight gags. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, the action-packed ``Payback'' showed Mel  
Gibson killing a variety of people in a variety of ways before he 
was tortured, but the ratings board gave the film an R rating. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, producers have complained the ratings board has more  
tolerance for violence than for sex. That raises questions about 
whether checking IDs at the theater door -- as President Clinton 
said Tuesday that theater owners have agreed to do -- will shield 
youngsters from violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The president may have complicated the issue further by getting  
the government involved, contends lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who 
helped push through the NC-17 rating in 1990 to take the X-rated 
stigma off non-pornographic films with adult themes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system itself is skewed against sex and in favor of  
violence,'' he said. ``But once the president puts the heavy thumb 
of government on the scale, it begins to smack of governmental 
intrusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America,  
which sets the ratings, said he applauded the agreement, calling it 
``a big step forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenti developed the system more than 30 years ago. He admits  
it is subjective and imperfect, but said it consistently receives 
favorable reviews from parents. Over the years, the system has been 
altered only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the ratings were G, M, R and X, but the M -- for  
mature audiences -- was changed to PG, for parental guidance 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, following concerns about violence in the PG-rated  
``Gremlins'' and ``Indiana Jones'' movies, the PG rating was split 
to include a tougher PG-13 for a higher level of intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, when 10 mainstream movies, including ``Henry &AMP; June,''  
received X ratings, the MPAA created the NC-17 category to separate 
films with strong adult content from sleazy porno films. 
</P>
<P>
	Many newspapers won't advertise NC-17 films and many theaters  
won't show them. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the MPA, board members place themselves in the role  
of ``most American parents'' and try to apply a rating that ``most 
parents would find suitable and helpful in aiding their decisions 
about their childrens' moviegoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After watching the entire film, each member comes his or her own  
conclusion, then a discussion is held. The final rating is 
determined by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The process is conducted in private and the MPA doesn't  
generally comment in detail on why a particular rating is assigned. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the secrecy and vagueness of the process that most  
frustrates filmmakers, who often complain they're never entirely 
sure what the ratings board found objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, it is a matter of degree.  
</P>
<P>
	Paul Thomas Anderson, who directed the sex-filled movie ``Boogie  
Nights,'' said he only had to remove about 40 seconds from the 
three-hour movie to get it from an NC-17 to an R. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the guidelines, a G film ``contains nothing in theme,  
language, nudity, sex or violence ... which would be offensive to 
parents whose younger children view the film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PG films are those that parents should examine before they let  
their children attend, the MPA said. There may be some profanity, 
violence and brief nudity, but none of these would be considered 
too intense. 
</P>
<P>
	PG-13 films carry a more stern warning for parents to see the  
film for themselves first. This kind of film ``leaps beyond the 
boundaries of the PG rating'' for violence, nudity and language. It 
does allow drug content, but usually no nudity in a sexual sense. 
</P>
<P>
	R-rated films may include ``hard language, or tough violence, or  
nudity within sensual scenes, or drug abuse.'' The MPA says that 
parents ``must find out more about an R-rated movie before they let 
their teen-agers view it.'' Anyone under 17 needs to be accompanied 
by a parent or adult guardian. 
</P>
<P>
	The MPA says that NC-17 films are those that ``most parents will  
consider patently too adult for their youngsters 17 and under.'' 
This rating can be due to violence, sex, ``aberrational behavior'' 
or drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	At Universal Studios Cineplex Odeon in Universal City,  
15-year-old Hunter Pechin said enforcement of the ratings system is 
spotty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some places know you're not 17, but they'll let you in, no  
questions asked,'' he said. ``Other places won't let you buy 
tickets.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Sets Sights on New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush said today that  
he would not campaign or file as a Republican presidential 
candidate in any state that encroaches on New Hampshire's 
first-in-the-nation primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who makes his first campaign trip to New Hampshire next  
Monday, said he knows he's late getting to the state, but he's 
ready to convince New Hampshire voters he knows how to lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I have a lot of work do to and I'm looking forward to  
doing it,'' he said in a telephone conference call with New 
Hampshire reporters. ``I'll honor the pledge and I intend to put 
together a great grass-roots organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush made his primary commitment in a letter to the secretary of  
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Elizabeth Dole said she would sign the New Hampshire  
primary pledge Wednesday. ``New Hampshire first by seven days,'' 
she said, referring to state law requiring the primary to be held 
at least a week before any other. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also said he had sent a letter accepting the Americans for  
Tax Reform pledge to veto any income tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor said he plans to spend his time in New  
Hampshire talking about tax cuts, free trade, education and 
strengthening the military. 
</P>
<P>
	He offered few specifics, saying voters should be patient. ``I  
think it's important for those who are watching the campaign to 
understand I will have a timetable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew, who met with  
Gov. Jeanne Shaheen and other officials Tuesday, predicted Bush 
would clash with voters who expect specific answers to specific 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the Titanic,'' he said. ``Great theme music, great  
boat, everyone wants to get on.... New Hampshire has a long history 
of debunking candidates who won't take a stand. I think that will 
be the iceberg he'll run into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush acknowledged the pressure to impress during his first trip  
to New Hampshire. He leads in the polls even though he hasn't yet 
started campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first problem I have is expectations are out of sight for  
me,'' he said. ``It means I'll have to go up there and shake as 
many hands as I can. My first hurdle is to tell people what's in my 
heart.''

<HEADLINE> Presidential Candidates Crowd Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- It was barely dawn Tuesday, when  
commentator Pat Buchanan concluded the 2000 presidential election 
was fully underway. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan was motoring through the streets of Des Moines on his  
way to a television interview when he spotted a jogger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just dawn and I saw a lonely figure running along the  
empty streets of Des Moines,'' Buchanan said. Moving closer, it 
became clear the jogger was no stranger, but was Republican 
presidential rival Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``I rolled down the window and said `Lamar, I think you're  
overdoing it,''' said Buchanan, concluding that it is virtually 
impossible to avoid running into a presidential contender in Iowa, 
where leadoff precinct caucuses launch the nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said his morning outings are more for mental fitness  
than physical exertion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just run to clear my head,'' said Alexander.  
</P>
<P>
	There were four Republican contenders in the state Tuesday:  
former Vice President Dan Quayle and publisher Steve Forbes, in 
addition to Buchanan and Alexander.

	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp.'s financing subsidiary has  
agreed to pay $1.8 billion for a commercial lending unit of The 
Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Acceptance Corp. will acquire BNY Financial

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Stock Market Up 12 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's stock market soared 12  
percent Tuesday, lifting indexes in neighboring Singapore and 
Malaysia, as a remarkably smooth election process raised hopes for 
political stability in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's currency, which was battered at the height of the  
Asian financial crisis, also benefited from the enthusiasm among 
investors, strengthening to 7,648 rupiah to the dollar. Last week 
it took more than 8,000 rupiah to get one dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta stock exchange's Composite Index closed with a  
stunning gain of 12.2 percent, slightly off its high for the day. 
Only two stocks fell, 189 gained and 24 were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Yohanna Iskandar, an analyst with Panin Securities, told Dow  
Jones Newswires that the main factor behind the ``frenzy buying'' 
was the smooth elections Monday. A strong showing on Wall Street 
also added to the positive sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The elections, hailed as the most free in decades, came more  
than a year after pro-democracy protests ended President Suharto's 
32-year authoritarian rule. The balloting in this ethnically 
diverse archipelago of 210 million people was held in remarkable 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rally Tuesday, there were concerns that Indonesia's  
stock market might be deflated by any negative political 
developments before a new president is chosen in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The euphoria in Indonesia's markets spilled over into exchanges  
in neighboring countries, which could also benefit from greater 
investment if Indonesian politics remain calm. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's Straits Times Index jumped 2.1 percent, reaching a  
two-year high, and Malaysia's Composite Index of 100 quality stocks 
surged 3.3 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Soccer's Vieri Sold in $43M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- In what would be a record soccer deal worth $43  
million, Italian striker Christian Vieri was set Tuesday to be sent 
from Lazio to Internazionale of Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	Vieri, the biggest star on Italy's national team, would be  
paired up front at Inter with Ronaldo, the two-time FIFA World 
Player of the Year. This would be Vieri's ninth club in eight 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vieri is Inter's,'' Inter owner Massimo Moratti said. ``He  
will play alongside Ronaldo next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lazio said negotiations are at an ``advanced stage''  
but the deal is not yet signed. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale would give Inter soccer's most expensive attack.  
Ronaldo went to Inter for a then-record $28 million two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Moratti said Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone will be sent to  
Lazio, offsetting some of the cash cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would be a record for a soccer transfer. However,  
Brazilian star Denilson's move from Sao Paolo to Real Betis -- 
completed in 1997 and worth $35 million -- remains the most 
expensive cash-only transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Vieri led Italy with five goals at the 1998 World Cup. He had a  
goal and an assist Saturday as Italy moved within one victory of 
clinching a berth at the 2000 European Championships by routing 
Wales 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored 13 goals in 22 league games in his first and only  
season with Lazio, which won the Cup Winners Cup but lost the Serie 
A title by one point to AC Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	The other chief bidder for Vieri had been Juventus, one of the  
forward's former teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Vieri can muscle many defenders off the ball. While at times he  
appears clumsy, he can score with both feet and is dangerous on 
headers. 
</P>
<P>
	His power should be a perfect complement to Ronaldo's pace and  
precision. 
</P>
<P>
	Vieri came to Lazio from Spain's Atletico Madrid last August for  
a $30 million transfer fee. He was thought to be the final piece of 
the puzzle that would bring Lazio its first league title since 
1974.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jane Robelot, a host of CBS's ``This Morning''  
since 1996, will leave following Friday's show, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robelot will be replaced for a month by Thalia Assuras, who  
currently delivers news reports on CBS's morning show. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS announced last month that former ``Today'' host Bryant

morning show is perennially last in the ratings behind NBC's 
``Today'' and ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While CBS said it would launch a search for a Gumbel co-host,  
Robelot hasn't been mentioned as a possibility. Her current 
co-host, Mark McEwen, will stay on with Gumbel to deliver weather 
and entertainment reports. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Judge Limits Use of N.J. Ballfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Baseball may be as American as apple pie,  
but a man who built a professional ball field in his back yard is 
breaking the law by bringing in too many crowds, a judge says. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Ingraham broke zoning laws in Tewksbury Township with  
round-the-clock games on his regulation-size diamond, Superior 
Court Judge Victor Ashrafi said Monday. The ruling came in a 
2-year-old lawsuit filed by township officials and neighbors who 
said the 12-hour days of games, traffic and pinging of bats 
shattered their privacy and peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingraham, a label company owner who moved to western New Jersey  
horse country to build his field of dreams, has said that Tewksbury 
just doesn't like baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	While agreeing with township officials that the field violated  
zoning laws, the judge rejected arguments that the field was a 
public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children playing baseball cannot easily be branded a  
nuisance,'' Ashrafi wrote in a 55-page opinion. ``One might as well 
say that apple pie is poison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But the fact that baseball for kids is wholesome and patriotic  
does not mean that full-scale games, practices and training can be 
held anywhere,'' Ashrafi added. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingraham spent nearly $300,000 to build the field and an indoor  
pool house in 1996, and sent out fliers advertising a ``Field of 
Dreams Academy,'' with classes for youngsters and a 35-and-over 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	He abandoned his plan to turn the field into a business after  
the township -- Gov. Christie Whitman's hometown -- told him it was 
illegal. But he said he still wanted to play ball with his 
11-year-old son and his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors and the township sued in 1997, saying Ingraham's use  
of the field, with back-to-back games, spectators and professional 
umpires, was out of hand. Ingraham has been limited by a court 
order to playing four days a week in small groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingraham's attorney said he would ask his client whether he  
wanted to appeal. Terence Scott had argued that Ingraham used his 
field the way that other neighbors use tennis courts or swimming 
pools. But Scott said Ingraham would live with the ruling, for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashrafi ruled that Ingraham, his wife and two children can play  
baseball anytime they want with up to eight guests, but they can 
have larger groups just once a month. The ruling also bans 
uniforms, aluminum bats, night games, loudspeakers and outdoor 
lighting. Ingraham also can't bring organized, league teams or paid 
officials onto the field, Ashrafi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tewksbury's deputy mayor, Tres Arnett, called the lawsuit's end  
``a reasonable result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't looking to have him plow the field under,'' Arnett  
said. ``It was up to the judge to draw a line.''

<HEADLINE> Dole Says She Has Helped Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth and Bob Dole never had children of  
their own, but the GOP presidential candidate said today that she 
and her husband were able ``to make a difference for a lot of 
children in the work we were doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When Bob and I married it was late in life. I mean, we were  
older,'' Mrs. Dole said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
She was 39 and her husband, a Senator from Kansas, was 52 when they 
were wed Dec. 6, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling was if we were fortunate to have children,  
wonderful. But if not, we both loved what we were doing and had a 
chance to make a difference for a lot of children in the work we 
were doing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt, 'Great, if it happens.' But if it doesn't, there  
really is a great opportunity through the positions that we're in 
to help a lot of children which is very satisfying -- to be able to 
give back,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole said she was ``blessed to have'' two nephews and a  
daughter from the former senator's first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	She was asked if she would be where she is today if she'd had  
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't speculate on what might have happened had it been a  
different set of circumstance because I've just lived this life and 
it's hard to really put yourself into another situation,'' she 
said. ``But I think women are doing a great job today of trying to 
juggle a lot of different areas and I'm very supportive of that.''

<HEADLINE> Tribal Smoke Shop Grant Draws Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A federal grant earmarked for an American  
Indian tribe's discount smoke shop is an example of the Clinton 
administration undercutting efforts to curb teen smoking, a Senate 
subcommittee chairman says. 
</P>
<P>
	``These smoke shops, which are selling discounted cigarettes and  
other tobacco products, will, in all likelihood, encourage teen 
smoking,'' Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee, raised  
his concerns in a recent letter to Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the Department of Housing and Urban Development's  
$450,000 community development grant to the Reno Sparks Indian 
Colony in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe plans to build a smoke shop, similar to a convenience  
store, that primarily would sell cigarettes and other tobacco 
products at tax-free, bargain prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that  
oversees HUD's budget, wants a list of all tribal smoke shops that 
have received federal money over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wants the ``rationale justifying'' approval of the  
grants by HUD and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``HUD-financed construction of smoke shops selling discounted  
cigarettes is, in my mind, completely at odds with the federal 
government's efforts to discourage teen smoking by increasing the 
price of cigarettes,'' Bond told Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
	The new smoke shop, similar to a convenience store, is planned  
on reservation land between a group of houses and a casino along 
Interstate 80 in Verdi, Nev., just west of Reno near the California 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe operates three other smoke shops in the Reno-Sparks  
area, and other tribes across the West do similar business. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Reno Sparks Indian Colony said the tribal  
chairman was not available to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD spokesman Peter Ragone said the smoke shop falls within the  
provisions of the community development grant and a change in the 
law would be needed to block the funds from being used for a 
particular project. 
</P>
<P>
	``If any member of Congress has concerns with its functions,  
they have the authority to change the law,'' Ragone said.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Departs From Script </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Super Mom or Super Executive. Women must  
choose, said Republican Elizabeth Dole, casting her own path -- all 
career, no children -- as a reality accepted but not chosen. ``I've 
just lived this life,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, the only woman in the 2000 presidential field, spoke  
for the first time in the campaign about her family life in a 
wide-ranging interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. After a 
calculated decision to ``go solo'' in the early months and 
establish her own credentials, she said her husband, Bob, the 1996 
GOP presidential nominee, would take a higher profile in her 
campaign and help raise some badly needed money. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never did it for himself. He just doesn't want to ask  
anybody for money. But you want to know something? He's doing it 
for me,'' said Mrs. Dole, who plans to announce her candidacy 
formally in late summer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's on the phone asking for money and he's also going to be  
doing some fund-raisers between now and the end of the month,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Kansas senator and Republican leader would bring  
stature and experience to her White House, Mrs. Dole said, and he 
would be particularly suited to handle agriculture issues. But 
there would be no Cabinet post, no ``two for the price of one'' 
that supporters of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton promised in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be a co-presidency,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, 62, is trying to become the first American woman to  
win a major party nomination. She ranks second in GOP polls, well 
behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush (``I believe he's a fine 
candidate,'' she said) but ahead of Democratic Vice President Al 
Gore in polls on a two-party race. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of her support comes from women eager to see one of their  
own make history in the White House or who think Mrs. Dole can 
relate to their hectic lives inside and outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
	In one recent poll, Dole's female supporters outnumbered men  
3-to-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The former American Red Cross president and two-time Cabinet  
secretary, who is often criticized for hewing too tightly to 
prepared texts and exposing little of her personal side, spoke 
expansively in the hourlong interview about the choices forced upon 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	Feminism was wrong in promising women they could have it all,  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most of the women who are involved today in trying to  
be the Super Mom or the Super Executive and all the rest would 
acknowledge that `Yeah, I have had to make some sacrifices. I don't 
have the time I need for all these areas,''' Mrs. Dole said. 
``That's just realism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government dictates -- such as the Family and Medical Leave Act  
or mandatory flextime employment policies -- are not the solution, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employee and the employer need to determine what are the  
best interests of that group,'' she said. ``I don't think one size 
fits all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saying ``my path was a different one,'' Mrs. Dole commended  
women who choose not to work and said society often denies them the 
credit they deserve for raising families. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her own path, Mrs. Dole said she and Bob Dole married  
``late in life,'' when she was 39 and he was 52. ``We felt, 'Great, 
if it happens.' But if it doesn't, there really is a great 
opportunity through the positions that we're in to help a lot of 
children which is very satisfying -- to be able to give back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she would be where she is today if she'd had children,  
Mrs. Dole replied: 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't speculate on what might have happened had it been a  
different set of circumstance because I've just lived this life and 
it's hard to really put yourself into another situation. But I 
think women are doing a great job today of trying to juggle a lot 
of different areas and I'm very supportive of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was blessed to have two nephews and a daughter,  
Robin, from the former senator's first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Held to her hawkish views amid signs of peace in Yugoslavia and  
said NATO should arrest Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic under 
a war crimes indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just label him and do nothing about it, it doesn't mean  
anything,'' she said. ``I think he needs to be apprehended and NATO 
is the right force to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Announced that pollster Tony Fabrizio, a veteran of her  
husband's failed campaign, would be her top strategist. 
</P>
<P>
	--Supported a move to raise the maximum individual presidential  
donation from $1,000, saying it takes too much time to raise money 
in such small increments. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to say whether she supported limiting the purchase of  
hand guns to one per month and requiring registration of weapons, 
as President Clinton has proposed.

<HEADLINE> Inhofe To Protest Hormel Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative Republican Sen. James Inhofe  
threatened today to hold up ``every single presidential 
nomination'' to protest President Clinton's appointment of a gay 
philanthropist to be ambassador to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe, R-Okla., criticized Clinton for invoking a provision of  
the Constitution allowing him to bypass the Senate confirmation 
process by making a temporary appointment while Congress is in 
recess. Congress returned from a week-long Memorial Day break on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., joined Inhofe in  
criticizing Clinton, saying the president's move to appoint James 
Hormel on Friday was ``a subversion of the confirmation process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lott indicated he was unlikely to go along with Inhofe's  
blanket objection to presidential nominations. Several high-profile 
nominations are currently before the Senate, including that of 
Lawrence Summers to be treasury secretary and Richard Holbrooke to 
be ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, the former dean of the University of Chicago law school  
and a well-known San Francisco fund-raiser, is the nation's first 
openly gay U.S. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	By custom, any senator can block a presidential nomination by  
placing a parliamentary ``hold'' on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe said he was acting on a precedent set by Sen. Robert  
Byrd, D-W.Va., who in 1985 placed holds on President Reagan's 
appointments until Reagan agreed to refrain from making recess 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there is no formal rule on such ``holds,'' and they do  
not have to be honored by the Senate majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, despite his own opposition to Hormel's nomination, told  
reporters it ``would not be my inclination'' to allow any single 
senator to manage to single-handedly block every nomination. ``I 
wouldn't honor a hold indefinitely,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he conceded that Inhofe still had the right to use  
delaying tactics to slow down nominations on a case-by-case basis -- 
tactics that require a 60-vote majority in the 100-member Senate to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said, ``It's hard to think that  
the Senate would allow itself to be blocked from fulfilling its 
constitutional responsibility because one member is upset because 
of a particular appointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the attention the Hormel appointment has received,  
Clinton ``has been extremely judicious in his use of recess 
appointments,'' Toiv said, adding that Clinton has made 57 such 
appointments in his 6 1/2 years in office, compared to Reagan's 239 in 
eight years and President Bush's 78 in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Inhofe, R-Okla., said, ``President Clinton has shown  
contempt for the Congress and the Constitution.'' In a statement 
Monday, he called the appointment ``highly inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has forfeited the presumption of cooperation on  
any remaining appointments he wants to make while in office,'' 
Inhofe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced the ``recess appointment'' of Hormel last  
Friday. He made the appointment after a small group of conservative 
senators, led by Inhofe, was able to block the nomination for a 
year and a half -- and after Lott refused to bring it to the floor 
for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe at first listed seven nominations to which he was  
objecting. But Tuesday, in a Senate floor speech, Inhofe expanded 
his list, telling colleagues: ``I am putting holds on every single 
presidential nomination that comes from the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wasn't opposed to Hormel just because he was gay.  
``It is the fact that he is a gay activist that puts his agenda 
ahead of the agenda of America,'' Inhofe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven original nominees to which Inhofe has objected are:  
</P>
<P>
	--Gary S. Guzy of Washington, D.C., to be assistant administrator  
of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	--Diane Edith Watson of California, to be ambassador to  
Micronesia. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kenneth M. Bresnahan of Virginia, to be chief financial officer  
of the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
	--Carolyn L. Huntoon of Virginia to be assistant secretary of  
energy for environmental management. 
</P>
<P>
	--George T. Frampton, Jr., of Washington, D.C., to be a member of  
the Council on Environmental Quality. 
</P>
<P>
	--John T. Spotila of New Jersey, to be administrator of the  
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for the Office of 
Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
	--Thomas J. Erickson of Washington, D.C., to be a commissioner of  
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

<HEADLINE> Computer Export Rules May Be Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is considering  
making it easier for U.S. companies to sell high-powered computers 
to other countries by easing export restrictions on them. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear when the Commerce Department, which has been  
working with other agencies on the matter for about a year now, 
will send the White House a final proposal, administration 
officials said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is under review but we do not anticipate a decision  
by the end of the week,'' said National Security Council spokesman 
Michael Hammer, noting a White House meeting on the issue scheduled 
for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	People involved in the debate over the export restrictions said  
the Commerce Department was considering loosening exports rules on 
certain computer sales to most countries in Asia, Africa, Latin 
America and Central and Eastern Europe. But for now, the 
administration is leaning against easing those restrictions on 
China and about 50 other countries, those people said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the end it's a mistake to treat the current problem  
of China in a Cold War fashion,'' said Daniel Goure, a defense 
analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
``To try and put a barrier down and expect that to last more than a 
nanosecond is just crazy. What you need is not tighter controls, 
but a different approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a Commerce Department official said ``no decisions have been  
reached'' regarding sales to China or any other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that the administration  
was preparing to loosen export controls on about 100 countries, but 
keep them on China and about 50 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, a special House committee cataloged 20 years  
of Chinese espionage against the United States. A congressional 
panel, chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, concluded China has been 
involved in the theft of nuclear secrets from U.S. weapons labs -- 
including culling key military information from commercial 
purchases of high-powered computers and other technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer industry -- upset that existing export rules limit  
their overseas sales -- has been pushing the administration for more 
leeway to export more powerful computers, particularly to China, a 
big, potentially lucrative market. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry and other supporters of looser export controls  
contend that the existing restrictions are out of date, given the 
rapid advances in computer technology. Goure said the restrictions 
limit U.S. companies from selling computer technology that is 
already available elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government regulates the overseas sale of computers  
based on their speed, measured by how many millions of theoretical 
operations the machines can perform per second. 
</P>
<P>
	To sell to the countries that would be included in the proposed  
export changes, computer companies have to get government licenses 
for any machine that can perform more than 10,000 of the operations 
per second, Goure said. The computer industry is pushing to have 
that tripled to 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from nearly a dozen top computer firms -- including  
IBM, Intel Corp., Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard Co., Dell 
Computers and SGI, formerly Silicon Graphics -- are scheduled to 
meet with White House chief of staff John Podesta on Friday to make 
their case on the export matter. The White House is sympathetic but 
has not determined how much to ease controls on computer sales and 
will not make any announcement at the Friday meeting, a White House 
official said.

<HEADLINE> Martin Fails To Qualify for Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Casey Martin's day took a drastic turn for the worse once he got  
to the 10th hole of the afternoon round. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who rides a golf cart because of a painful circulatory  
disorder in his right leg, had a morning round of 71 at Sand Ridge 
Golf Club in Chardon, Ohio, on Monday, but a triple-bogey 7 on the 
401-yard 10th hole and a back-nine 41 led to an afternoon round of 
76. With a 147, Martin failed to qualify for next week's U.S. Open 
golf championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty beat,'' Martin said. ``My leg is killing me. The  
heat was definitely a factor. Riding in a cart was no advantage 
today. I'm in pain. I laugh at people who think a cart gives me a 
competitive edge. They should feel what I feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Zinkon of Haines City, Fla., shot a 5-under-par 139 to  
lead a trio of qualifiers that included Nike Tour player Jason 
Tyska of Mount Pleasant, Pa., and PGA Tour pro Gabriel Hjerstedt of 
Ponte Vedra, Fla. Tyska shot a 3-under 141 and Hjerstedt a 142. 
</P>
<P>
	In Columbus, Ohio, Chris Smith, a non-winner in six years on the  
tour, had the low 36-hole score, while Lanny Wadkins, Ian Woosnam, 
Craig Stadler and David Frost missed out in qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and kids were rooting hard today, too,'' Smith said.  
``They had a ball at Congressional when I made the cut it through 
qualifying the last time and Pinehurst will be something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 27 players -- all pros -- qualified from a starting  
field of 129 from the Columbus sectional qualifier at The Lakes and 
Brookside Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	A shot back of Smith were Craig Bowden, Australia's Robert  
Allenby, Scott Gump and Ted Tryba. 
</P>
<P>
	It came down to 10 players playing off for the final six spots,  
with Tim Herron and Keith Clearwater hitting long birdie putts on 
the first hole. Former Masters champion Larry Mize, Bob Gilder, 
Chris Tidland and Stephen Allan all parred, eliminating Fulton 
Allem, David Ogrin, Jim Johnson and Steve Gangluff. 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, Colo., Gary Hallberg of Castle Rock, Colo., and  
Matt Call of Thornton, Colo., beat out 18 others to qualify for the 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallberg, a PGA touring professional, shot a 7-under 65 and  
added a 71 to finish at 136. Call, a junior on the University of 
Colorado golf team, shot a 69 and a 68 to finish one shot behind 
Hallberg with 137. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Fry of Fort Collins, Colo., a former University of Wyoming  
golfer, placed third with a score of 140 in the qualifying round at 
Columbine Country Club. He will be first alternate. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandt Jobe of Castle Rock, a Japan PGA Tour regular who tied  
for 14th at the 1999 Masters, tied for fourth with Mike Sauer at 
141. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Palm Beach, Fla., former Boise State All-American David  
LeBeck qualified with a 4-under-par 140. Other qualifiers were 
Scott Fawcett of Plano, Texas, and Jeff Street of Tuscaloosa, Ala., 
at 141, and Alberto Ochoa of McAllen, Texas, at 142. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, Bob Heinz shot an 8-under-par 136 at the East Lake  
Golf Club to lead four qualifiers. Tim Loustalot shot a 138, while 
Bryce Molder and Mark Slawter each shot 139s. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tarzana, Calif., Chris Zambri shot a 138 to lead four  
qualifiers at El Caballero Country Club. Ryan Welborn, David 
Berganio Jr. and Jeff Freeman each shot 140s.

is 7:55.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenyans also went 1-2 in the 5,000, with Benjamin Limo beating  
Thomas Nyariki in 13:38.15. 
</P>
<P>

performances. Many athletes withdrew rather than risk injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabor Dobos of Hungary won the men's 100 in 10.52 in light rain,  
while Britain's Tony Jarrett ended the meet with a victory in the

<P>
	Roland Nemeth gave Hungary a second victory, taking the 200 in  
20.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Denisa Krejcova of the Czech Republic took the women's 200 in

<HEADLINE> Mistrial in Fundraiser Tax Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The tax evasion trial of Democratic  
fund-raiser Maria S. Hsia ended in a mistrial after a jury said it 
was divided on all four counts but leaning toward acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury had reported it was unable to reach a verdict Friday,  
but U.S. District Judge Richard A. Paez told the panel to resume 
deliberations. Jurors again reported they were divided Monday, 
prompting the judge to declare a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors claim Hsia, who runs an immigration  
consulting business in San Marino, failed to file an income tax 
return for 1994, underestimated her income for 1995 and 1996 -- 
involving a total of $175,000 for the three years, and assisted in 
filing a false tax return for her business. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax charges are separate from accusations against Hsia in a  
Washington, D.C., case involving thousands of dollars Hsia is 
accused of funneling through Buddhist nuns at a 1996 Clinton-Gore 
campaign fund-raising event. Vice President Al Gore attended the 
event in Southern California. She is accused of soliciting illegal 
campaign contributions and arranging to use straw donors to hide 
the true source of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Kenneth Barish has said that he believes the tax  
charges in Los Angeles were intended to intimidate Hsia in the 
campaign finance case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge gave federal prosecutors 10 days to decide whether to  
retry Hsia. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left Monday at the U.S. attorney's office in Los  
Angeles was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending the prosecution's decision on whether to retry Hsia,  
Barish said he was preparing to file a motion to dismiss the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``She feels she's been vindicated. This is definitely a kind of  
a statement that she's on the right track. She's not guilty,'' 
Barish said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Hsia would face up to 10 years in prison and  
$850,000 in fines.

	Cop Found Guilty in Torture Case  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A police officer accused of holding down a  
Haitian immigrant while another officer tortured him in a 
stationhouse bathroom was found guilty today while three other 
officers were acquitted of all charges. The anonymous jury of seven 
men and five women reached the verdict after 18 hours of 
deliberations over three days. They heard four weeks of often lurid 
testimony in Brooklyn federal court in the case of Abner Louima.

<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- The United States, Russia and six other  
nations agree on a U.N. resolution to settle the conflict with 
Yugoslavia and send international troops under NATO command to 
Kosovo. ``We got what we came for,'' Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright proclaimed. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said 
bombing could be suspended in the next few days if Serb troops 
begin withdrawing from the province. The bombing halt is a 
significant concession to Russia, long a vocal opponent to the 
attacks.

	U.N. Considers Kosovo Resolution

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council today discussed  
the draft resolution to end the Kosovo conflict, with the United 
States and its NATO partners pushing for quick adoption but China 
saying it has trouble with key points, including the mandate of an 
international criminal tribunal for Yugoslavia. As a permanent 
member of the Security Council, China has veto power over 
resolutions. China had said it would not allow a formal discussion 
of a resolution on Kosovo while NATO planes were bombing 
Yugoslavia.

	Schumer Traces Guns Used in Crimes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One percent of gun dealers are the source of  
weapons used in nearly half of all crimes, according to a report 
released by Sen. Charles Schumer. The report from the New York 
Democrat found that only a tiny fraction of the nation's 100,000 
federally licensed gun dealers supplied guns used in 45 percent of 
the crimes where the weapon was successfully traced by federal 
officials. Schumer said the report shows that the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms needs to do more inspections at 
dealerships with track records of providing guns to criminals.

	Group Seeks Ban on Jail Stun Belts  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A human rights group that wants electric stun  
belts banned says federal and state prisons are increasingly 
relying on the devices that can deliver 50,000 volts of electricity 
to subdue prisoners. Amnesty International says the U.S. Marshals 
Service, the federal Bureau of Prisons and at least 20 state prison 
systems have authorized use of stun belts, although the extent of 
their use in some of those states isn't clear. The security devices 
are typically strapped onto prisoners for court appearances or 
while they are being transported. The battery-powered belts, 
triggered by a remote control, temporarily incapacitate inmates 
with a painful, eight-second jolt above the left kidney.

	LUXEMBOURG (AP) -- The Belgian government said today most foods  
it banned in a dioxin contamination crisis were safe and would be 
allowed back on store shelves within two days. Belgium claims it 
has proof the contamination was limited to 175,000 pounds of animal 
feed and that many of the tests on suspect farms proved negative. 
The European Union has insisted on the destruction of food products 
from suspect farms, and Belgium has banned sales of domestic 
butter, poultry, eggs, fatty beef and pork, and all byproducts. The 
Belgian food industry association says the crisis has cost the 
country $500 million.

	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A Michigan state senator is lobbying for a

other advertising for certain concerts. ``We found that a lot of 
times parents weren't aware of what the lyrics are, lyrics about 
drug abuse, raping and killing,'' State Sen. Dale Shugars said. 
Shugars sponsored the bill after attending a concert given by 
rocker Marilyn Manson. ``He was like Satan,'' the 46-year-old 
Republican said.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Strong Gun Control Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the House on the verge of a debate over  
gun control, confidential Republican polling suggests overwhelming 
public support for fresh restrictions, including an increase in the 
minimum age for handgun purchases from 18 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The polling, conducted last month for the GOP House campaign  
committee, found rock-solid support of roughly 80 percent for 
expanded background checks for handgun purchases, safety locks for 
guns, mandatory prison terms for felons who commit crimes with guns 
and the 21-year age limit for handgun purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the survey was made available to The Associated Press.  
</P>
<P>
	The poll underscores the political crosscurrents at work as the  
GOP leadership prepares for next week's expected debate on the 
House floor. While the public -- and most House Democrats -- favor 
new gun control measures, many Republicans and their traditional 
allies at the National Rifle Association oppose them. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate-passed measure to require background checks for all  
sales at gun shows would ``impose a cradle-to-grave massive federal 
regulatory scheme on gun owners throughout America -- and that's no 
exaggeration,'' the NRA said in a recent mailing to its membership. 
</P>
<P>
	It called the looming House vote on the issue ``the most  
critical gun vote in over five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within the House, jockeying continued. Republicans decided to  
bring the gun control issue directly to the House floor rather than 
to convene the Judiciary Committee next week for a preliminary 
airing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people don't want to vote repeatedly on guns,'' said  
Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the committee, in a reference to 
the political volatility of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered that Republicans had refused to allow  
immediate votes on the subject two weeks ago, saying at the time 
they wanted the committee to first consider it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It indicates to me once again that the delay ... was to allow  
the NRA to lobby,'' said Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the 
Democratic House leader. He later added that Democrats would 
scrutinize any GOP proposal ``to see if it's a loophole-ridden 
measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was  
possible the House would be given the chance to choose among three 
or four competing gun control proposals, and the one that gained 
the most votes would be advanced toward final passage. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to finding strong support for a variety of gun  
control measures, the internal GOP poll also asked whether voters 
would be more likely to support a candidate who is linked to the 
NRA. Fewer than one-third of those who answered said they would be 
more inclined to support such a candidate. More than 45 percent 
said they would be less inclined. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome of the debate over guns is difficult to predict,  
given the party split within the House. There are 223 Republicans, 
211 Democrats and one independent who customarily votes with 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, two to three dozen Democrats are expected to  
oppose at least some of the proposed new restrictions on guns. Yet 
as many as three or four dozen Republicans may be inclined to 
support amendments that gun control advocates will present. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, said she believes  
the House should enact ``what the Senate passed, at a minimum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Senate measure is under attack from some quarters,  
the internal GOP polling suggests the public is ready to accept 
even more restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Senate measure requires instant background checks for  
all purchases at gun shows and includes a safety lock provision, it 
does not address the issue of age of eligibility for handgun 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor did gun control advocates attempt to win approval for such a  
provision when the measure was in the Senate. Democrats said they 
were undecided about whether to attempt it in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hyde, R-Ill., said he will attempt to win a vote on the  
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue will come to the floor as part of a broader measure  
relating to efforts to combat juvenile crime. In addition, Hyde 
will attempt to force passage of amendments relating to violence 
and youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will outlaw the sale to children of extremely explicit  
sexual or violent material and also require record stores to allow 
parents to review on site and on request, prior to purchase, any 
lyrics packaged with CDs,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Not Wary About NY Rotation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Up 2-1 in the Eastern Conference finals, the  
New York Knicks gambled on a smaller, quicker starting lineup for 
Game 4 against the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	The gamble backfired.  
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell, making his first playoff start, picked up two  
quick fouls and was ineffective defensively against Chris Mullin as 
the Pacers evened the series 90-78 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell fouled out for the first time this season, scoring 12  
points in 33 minutes on 6-of-14 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you win the game, and he doesn't play the way he's  
capable of playing, you can look back with hindsight and say it 
was, or was not, a good move,'' Jalen Rose said of the switch. 
``They were going for the jugular. Being up 2-1, playing in front 
of their home fans they wanted to get a chance to have everybody 
involved in the game early so they could put us to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, it backfired.''  
</P>
<P>
	Indiana coach Larry Bird has no intention of changing his  
starters, no matter what Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy does. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to match what he's doing. We're just going to  
try and play our game,'' Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going into trying to cross-match and mismatch, and  
do things to shake up the lineup. We've had the same lineup since 
I've been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy, whose team already is hurting from the loss of center  
Patrick Ewing with a partially torn left Achilles' tendon, said he 
had no second thoughts about the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter who we start if we defend and rebound like  
that,'' he said of his team's play Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said he thought having Sprewell start was a matter of New  
York ``trying to adjust to our depth. ... I think they were 
bringing Sprewell in early as opposed to having him go against 
myself or Derrick McKey's defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's offense wasn't bad, either. The 6-foot-8 reserve guard  
scored 19 points in 31 minutes, consistently scoring big points to 
kill New York's bid for its fourth dramatic comeback in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose and Mullin, who had 18 points, helped Indiana overcome a  
scoreless first half by Reggie Miller and Rik Smits to lead 45-32 
at halftime and foil every New York comeback bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a one- or two-man show. Guys really know how to  
step up when other guys have been injured or have been struggling 
through the course of a game,'' Miller said. ``Last night's game 
was one of those indications why we're such a great team, because 
we have other players that can step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks remain confident despite Indiana regaining homecourt  
advantage in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not down,'' said Marcus Camby, who came off the bench to  
lead the Knicks with 18 points and 14 rebounds. ``Both teams are 
going to be pumped up, juiced up. ... We just have to play better 
on defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident that we can win on the road. You know  
homecourt advantage doesn't really mean much. The teams have been 
pretty evenly matched,'' he said. ``It's just all about who is 
playing well and who is defending well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he starts again, Sprewell anticipates another tough night  
defending Mullin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mulli is smart,'' he said. ``I played with him for a couple of  
years (at Golden State). ... He is constantly moving and so you 
just really have to key in on him. He's so smart with the ball that 
you know he's going to make something happen.''

<HEADLINE> Low-Income Group Uses Expert Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Judd Levy retired as Merrill Lynch's head  
of housing finance in 1988, he spent seven years running a 19-room 
Vermont country inn. But he never really left high finance -- all 
along he's considered it his mission to bring Wall Street 
innovations to low-income housing development. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Levy, having become the president of a tiny nonprofit  
housing organization, helped create the first real estate 
investment trust, or REIT, to specialize in affordable housing and 
community development. 
</P>
<P>
	REITs operate much like a mutual fund for real estate. Through a  
REIT, investors own a diversified portfolio of properties and 
mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy's group, the Community Development Trust, purchases  
fixed-rate mortgages on homes for lower-income people and then 
packages the loans into securities to be resold to investors at a 
profit. By creating a market for these loans, the trust makes it 
more attractive for lenders to make them in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm loving this now,'' Levy said. ``The ability to take a  
market that's somewhat asleep, and be able to introduce these 
techniques that have worked elsewhere and adopt them, is really 
interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To fund its purchases, the trust last week sold $29 million in  
stock to such heavy hitters as the Allstate, Prudential and 
Metropolitan Life insurance companies; banks Citicorp and First 
Union; and Fannie Mae, the mortgage financing company. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock sale signals ``an evolutionary trend toward using more  
sophisticated financial strategies,'' said Kenneth Bacon, a senior 
vice president at Fannie Mae, which invested $4 million in the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is in many ways consistent with what you've seen happen  
all over the world. In emerging markets, Latin America, Asia and 
Africa, people are being very innovative, and there's no reason why 
it can't be done here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Created in 1960, REITs have been used by real estate developers  
to finance projects from outlet malls and hotels to prisons. REITs 
bought low-income housing in the past, but only to convert it to 
more upscale units. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Levy's group has pledged to only buy mortgages and  
buildings that primarily benefit low-income people and to maintain 
any property that it acquires as affordable housing. The trust will 
also purchase low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our REIT is going to own tons of mortgages, tons of  
buildings,'' said Merilyn Rovira, vice president at the Community 
Development Trust. ``We're going to end up with $200 million worth 
of assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, Community Development Trust's genesis traces the  
evolution of community development financing. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust was formerly known as the Local Initiatives Managed  
Assets Corp., a non-profit group that packaged low-income mortgages 
into collateralized bond obligations, or securities backed by 
monthly mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
	LIMAC, in turn, was affiliated with Local Initiatives Support  
Corp., a nonprofit that started in 1979 by lending foundation money 
at below-market rates for housing and community development. 
</P>
<P>
	LISC ``made a lot of loans that a lot of people thought were  
crazy'' because they were to non-profit groups in poor 
neighborhoods, said Rovira, who helped structure the new real 
estate investment trust. Banks, concerned about borrowers' ability 
to repay the loans, might shy away from making them. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Rovira said, ``these groups, for the most part, paid them  
back, interest and principal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LISC began to think about raising more money by packaging loans  
into mortgage-backed securities, a financing innovation that 
changed the mortgage industry by making loans much easier to get. 
</P>
<P>
	But LISC's loans were tiny by Wall Street standards and secured  
by properties scattered around the country. And they had been 
originated by community organizations ranging from sophisticated to 
those that kept mortgage payments in a cigar box. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Judd Levy.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no such thing as a lack of capital for community  
development lending,'' Levy said last week from his Manhattan 
office. ``If we can securitize defaulted car loans ... then we 
can't say the problem in community development loans is credit 
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the creation of Community Development Trust, LIMAC changed  
from a nonprofit organization to a for-profit REIT. 
</P>
<P>
	REITs don't pay taxes provided they return at least 95 percent  
of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends. They tend to 
pay high yields of 5 percent to 10 percent, or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The REIT structure held several attractions for LIMAC. The  
potential high yield would entice people who wouldn't otherwise 
invest in low-income properties. A network of state and local 
housing authorities would keep the REIT supplied with mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy is confident the REIT is a much better investment than,  
say, loans to Russia and Asia that went into default over the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have never, ever seen a headline that such-and-such a bank  
took a $100 million hit on their community development portfolio,'' 
Levy said, ``and you never will.''

<HEADLINE> Savings Likely if Kids Get Flu Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The people who would benefit most from flu  
vaccines for all schoolchildren are parents and their employers -- 
to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars per year, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis released Monday in the journal Pediatrics said  
vaccination brings a net saving of $4 to $35 per child, mainly by 
helping parents avoid missing work to care for sick children or 
after catching the virus themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The savings depend on whether the child is taken to a doctor  
during work hours by a parent or gets immunized in a group setting, 
such as at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are efficient spreaders of the disease and a major  
factor in the introduction of influenza into households,'' the 
researchers said, citing previous research. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers, led by Terry White of Virginia Commonwealth  
University School of Medicine in Richmond, used existing data on 
infection rates, wages of caretakers and costs of immunization to 
make their estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	If the estimates were applied to Census Bureau figures, which  
project about 51.8 million school-age children in 2000, the total 
savings could range from $207.2 million to $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Although serious complications from flu vaccine have  
occasionally occurred in adults, none has been reported in 
children, the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> New Tallest Building Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO, (AP) -- To the owners of the Sears Tower and the  
Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, heads up. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago real estate company announced its intent to erect a  
112-story skyscraper that would reinstate Chicago as the home of 
the world's tallest building. 
</P>
<P>
	European American Realty, Ltd. filed its plans Monday with the  
city for a building that would rise 1,537 feet. The Sears Tower is 
1,450 feet tall while the Petronas Towers in Malaysia stand 1,483 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sears Tower held the world's tallest title from 1973 until  
1996, when the Malaysian skyscraper was ruled taller. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident that our building concept is right for  
downtown Chicago and right for the 21st century,'' European 
American Realty CEO Scott K. Toberman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The building was designed by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings &AMP;  
Merrill LLP, the architectural firm that also designed the Sears 
Tower and the John Hancock Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial site work is scheduled to begin this year.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup Goalies Set for Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dominik Hasek put two frustrating seasons playing  
behind Ed Belfour to good use. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I watched him every game, even during practice,  
looking at him to see what he was doing,'' Hasek said Monday, a day 
before his Buffalo Sabres meet Belfour's Dallas Stars in Game 1 of 
the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour was the starter and Hasek the backup for Chicago in  
1990-91 and '91-92. The Blackhawks had hockey's best record the 
first season, and they reached the Stanley Cup finals the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour played 145 regular-season and playoff games in that  
span. Hasek was used in 31, then was traded to Buffalo the next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	With plenty of time on the bench in Chicago, Hasek studied every  
aspect of Belfour's game. One of the things Hasek noticed most was 
Belfour's feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a very good skater,'' Hasek said. ``He always  
tries to be in the right position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When either is caught away from the net, both get back by using  
a skating style akin to pedaling. Hasek said it's not a 
coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he started to pedal on the ice before I started to do  
it,'' Hasek said. ``I don't know who started to do it first. Many 
people say I was the first, but I think he was the first to pedal 
on the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour said he remembers Hasek forcing him to always play his  
best, even in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were always competitive in the drills,'' Belfour said.  
``He'd always compete hard and so would I. It made us both 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither goalie has been in the finals since the Blackhawks were  
swept by Pittsburgh seven seasons ago. Whoever wins this series 
will bring his franchise its first title. 
</P>
<P>
	Every hockey player works his entire life for the chance to put  
his name on the Cup. It's especially significant to be the starting 
goalie on a championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek already has earned a reputation as the world's best  
goalie, even without a title. Belfour, however, is often considered 
a second-tier player because he hasn't been a winner when it 
matters most. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to say whatever they dream up,'' Belfour  
said. ``I know what I've done and what I can do. My teammates 
always support me and back me and that's all that matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek also says the label is unfair.  
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie is a great goaltender and a very competitive person,''  
Hasek said. ``I don't think he gets enough credit because he never 
won the Stanley Cup. I don't think he has any weaknesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goalies insist they are friendly rivals. Hasek added that  
their wives are close and that their kids played together for 
several hours at this year's All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	If there was any tension during their Chicago days, both say it  
was nothing more than a healthy dose of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough relationship because he felt I was the person  
who could take his job and I felt he took my job,'' Hasek said. 
``When we see each other off the ice now, we always say hello. I 
respect him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour smiled and laughed when asked if there was a problem  
with their 1-2 status in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see anything wrong with it,'' he said. ``Maybe he had  
a problem with it because I was the No. 1 guy. But I didn't ever 
have a problem with Dominik. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always enjoyed the challenge of competing against  
Dominik, even when it was in practice. He's a competitor and I love 
competition. I think it's going to be a great opportunity to play 
against him again.''

<HEADLINE> Plane's Tape Doesn't Mention Spoiler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The cockpit recording from the American  
Airlines jet that crashed while landing in a thunderstorm contains 
no mention by the pilots of setting the spoilers that slow a plane 
down, a federal investigator said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding raises more questions about whether the spoilers  
were set to activate on landing, as co-pilot Michael Origel 
believes they were. Previously, investigators said the flight data 
recorders indicate the spoilers did not open when the plane touched 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm really interested in is the communication between the  
two officers,'' said Greg Feith, lead investigator with the 
National Transportation Safety Board. ``Was there a 
miscommunication? Did they not do something because someone did not 
understand?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB's George W. Black Jr. said it is possible that Capt.  
Richard Buschmann and Origel communicated non-verbally about the 
spoilers, by pointing or nodding, for example. Spoilers are panels 
on the wings that pop up to slow the plane down on landing. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane ran off the end of a wet runway at more than 90 mph,  
tore open and caught fire June 1, killing Buschmann and eight 
passengers. More than 80 of the 145 people aboard were injured. Two 
people remained in critical condition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are examining whether mechanical problems, pilot  
error, severe weather, or a combination of those factors caused the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel, who broke a leg in the crash, said last week that he  
believes the spoilers were set by Buschmann during the jet's 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Black said Tuesday the recording indicates the pilots  
went over some items on the pre-landing checklist, but there was no 
mention of the spoilers. He would not say if any other elements of 
the checklist were not heard on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Feith said that in a hospital interview, Origel claimed he had  
completed the checklist for landing. Investigators want Origel to 
listen to the cockpit recording with them to refresh his memory 
about the landing preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	An American Airlines official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said it company policy to go through the items on the 
checklist out loud. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found a checklist displaying data for takeoff,  
instead of for landing, at the crash site. But Feith said the 
checklist could have been knocked out of place during the crash and 
the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel also told investigators last week that he never lost  
sight of the runway as the airplane approached in a ``bowling 
alley'' gap in the storm clouds. Black said Friday that the cockpit 
voice recorder indicated otherwise and that Origel would be asked 
to explain the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, two survivors filed a lawsuit in Chicago against  
American Airlines and Buschmann's estate. Serena and Johnnie Dexter 
of Conway claim the pilot and airline were negligent for attempting 
to land in a severe thunderstorm with high winds. They are seeking 
more than $50,000 in damages. Another survivor lawsuit was filed 
last week.

<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The opening of a center honoring Muhammad  
Ali will be pushed back by fund-raising delays, but backers remain 
optimistic that it will be built. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident about our ability to raise the money,''  
businessman Larry Townsend said Monday. ``Of course, we are going 
to get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend, who has worked with Muhammad and Lonnie Ali to build  
the center, declined to say how much has been raised or pledged so 
far. But he acknowledged that fund-raising delays will prevent it 
from opening by January 2001 in the former boxing champion's 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	The center will include a museum and an institute promoting good  
sportsmanship. It will also sponsor retreats to help young people 
develop self-esteem.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Testifies in Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The cardiologist at the center of the malpractice  
suit stemming from the death of Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis 
gave a detailed account Tuesday of the day he says the player 
privately confessed he was a cocaine user. 
</P>
<P>
	On the witness stand in his own defense, Dr. Gilbert Mudge said  
he and Lewis were sitting in a car at Brandeis University when he 
asked the NBA All-Star if he had used the drug in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Lewis quickly changed the subject, Mudge testified. Next,  
a young fan tapped on the car window and asked the athlete for an 
autograph. Then, Mudge said, the doctor reminded Lewis he hadn't 
answered the question. 
</P>
<P>
	``He nodded his head and said yes,'' Mudge testified.  
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, on July 27, 1993, Lewis died of a cardiac  
arrhythmia while practicing jump shots. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow sued Mudge and two of his consultants, Drs. Peter  
Friedman and Mark Creager, claiming they misdiagnosed and 
mistreated her husband. A third consultant settled with Donna 
Harris-Lewis for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge has claimed Lewis' alleged late admission of drug use made  
an accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months before Lewis died, Mudge had announced Lewis had a  
neurological condition that causes fainting spells and predicted 
Lewis would play professional basketball again. 
</P>
<P>
	That finding went against an earlier diagnosis by a ``Dream  
Team'' of top doctors who said Lewis had a life-threatening, 
potentially career-ending arrhythmia, or abnormal heartbeat. That 
diagnosis came after Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in April 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge had testified once before, when Harris-Lewis' attorney  
called him as a hostile witness and tried to portray him as a 
physician whose desire to be a hero to the Lewises, the Celtics and 
thousands of fans led to negligent care. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Tuesday, under questioning by his attorney, William  
Dailey Jr., Mudge tried to convince the jury that his treatment of 
Lewis was thorough and appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the start of the trial, now in its sixth week,  
cocaine had promised to be an explosive issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Harris-Lewis, who vehemently denies Lewis ever  
used drugs and tried to get any related testimony excluded from 
trial, suggested the claims are simply intended to divert attention 
from Mudge and smear the reputation of a local hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge, however, said Lewis repeatedly denied using cocaine until  
their July 12 conversation -- keeping silent on information that 
would have been critical to his medical treatment plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``By not knowing he was on cocaine, we deprived many of our  
consultants of valuable information,'' he said, referring to the 
more than half-dozen doctors from Boston to Los Angeles who helped 
evaluate Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge, head of the cardiac transplant unit at Brigham and  
Women's Hospital, said he was not surprised by Lewis' admission. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many wonderful people who have abused cocaine,'' he  
said, adding that he told Lewis they would have to meet again to 
discuss a future treatment regimen in light of the admission. 
</P>
<P>
	That meeting, he testified, was scheduled for July 28 -- the day  
after Lewis died. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff's attorney Robert Harley bore down on the doctor  
during cross-examination, pointing to a news conference held when 
Lewis was discharged from the hospital. There, Mudge said Lewis had 
a healthy heart and a relatively benign fainting disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge has said that, faced with tests suggesting two very  
different diagnoses -- one neurological, one cardiac -- he only told 
the media about the less serious problem out of concern for the 
Lewises' privacy. But he maintains he also was pursuing the cardiac 
ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you can be pretty convincing when you want to tell a story  
even though it's not the truth,'' Harley said, suggesting Mudge 
could also be lying about cocaine use to save himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's defense has rested on three principles: the claim he was  
investigating a possible cardiac problem; Lewis' alleged drug use; 
and allegations Lewis ignored orders not to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he said that before Lewis died, Harris-Lewis had  
told the doctor her husband wanted to shoot baskets again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said that was unacceptable to me,'' Mudge said. ``Mr. Lewis  
was not to exercise at all unless he was monitored. That was a very 
clear understanding I had with them.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Pitcher Suspended For Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Los Angeles pitcher Chan Ho Park was suspended  
for seven games and fined an undisclosed amount Tuesday for hitting 
and kicking Angels pitcher Tim Belcher during a game. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight last Saturday began after Belcher fielded Park's  
sacrifice bunt in the fifth inning and tagged him out. After a 
brief exchange of words, Park forearmed Belcher in the face and 
followed that up with a leaping kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Both benches and bullpens emptied, and Park was ejected. Matt  
Walbeck had hit a grand slam off Park an inning earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Park, 4-3 with a 4.84 ERA in 12 starts this season, was to begin  
his suspension on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on whether he would appeal. If he  
does, the suspension would not start until after a hearing before 
NL president Leonard Coleman Jr.

<HEADLINE> China Swimmer Fails Drug Test Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- In a further setback for China's antidoping  
efforts, a top Chinese swimmer who already served a two-year year 
ban for steroid use has failed another drug test, a Chinese 
swimming official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Li Jun of the National Swimming Management Center said Xiong  
Guoming, who won gold at last year's Asian Games after having 
served out his ban, was given a surprise, out-of-competition test 
in March by FINA, swimming's international governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiong's first urine sample tested positive for drugs, Li said. A  
second sample will be tested, probably later this month, and if 
that also turns out positive, Xiong could face another ban after a 
hearing, Li said. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiong's positive test is a blow to Chinese sports officials'  
efforts to convince the world they are winning their war against 
doping. 
</P>
<P>
	While China has toughened punishments for drug cheats and  
stepped up efforts to educate athletes, Xiong's test and other 
recent drug cases could renew suspicions about Chinese doping, 
particularly among swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 18 months, 10 Chinese swimmers and coaches have been banned  
from competition or coaching because of drugs, the state-run Legal 
Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said four swimmers were caught before last year's  
Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand, and one, Tian Bin, was given a 
four-year ban for using banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Punishments for the other three -- Nian Yun, Chen Yan, and Sun  
Xixi -- are still being worked out, it said in a report Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A ban against Xiong could deprive China of one of its top male  
swimmers heading into the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiong was one of seven Chinese swimmers banned for two years  
after testing positive for the performance-enhancing steroid DHT at 
the 1994 Asian Games, the region's Olympic equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
	He stormed back at last year's Bangkok games, winning gold and  
breaking the Asian Games record in the 200-meter medley and taking 
silver in the 400-meter medley.

<HEADLINE> Torre Switches Yanks' Batting Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- New York Yankees manager Joe Torre dropped  
Chuck Knoblauch from the leadoff spot and moved Paul O'Neill from 
third to fifth on Tuesday in what he hoped was a temporary cure for 
the team's struggling offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch, batting .258 and struggling to get on base, was moved  
from first to eighth for the Yankees' game against the Philadelphia 
Phillies. O'Neill, a career .317 hitter as a Yankee who is batting 
.255 this year, was dropped to fifth with Bernie Williams taking 
his place in the third spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to try to change things around,'' Torre said.  
``if we score five, six or seven runs I'm not going to guarantee 
it's going to stay this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the first time this season after 50 starts that  
Knoblauch was not in the leadoff spot. Tony Tarasco led off against 
Phillies right-hander Curt Schilling. Asked if the changes were 
indefinite, Torre said, ``It's tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The changes came one day after the Yankees suffered a sloppy 6-5  
loss to the Phillies, running their winless streak at Veterans 
Stadium to four. The most glaring error occurred when Knoblauch, 
anticipating a grounds rule double on Derek Jeter's shot down the 
left-field line, slowed down as he approached third and failed to 
score in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said the play had nothing to do with the changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``That would be punishment,'' Torre said, ``and we don't do  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Torre added, ``Just last night I decided I wanted to do  
something. It was an ugly game, and I figured if I'm ever going to 
do something it's after an ugly game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Yankees entered play Tuesday night trailing Boston by  
a half-game in the AL East, they have struggled with the enormous 
pressure of living up to last season's magical 125-win season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ingredients are here,'' Torre said. ``Nobody loses it  
overnight. I'm confident it will come back. We're a half-game out 
of first place. It's not as ugly or desperate as it may appear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill had batted third in all 53 of his starts this season and  
was a fixture in that spot last season as the Yankees won their 
second World Series championship in three years. He snapped an 
0-for-17 slide Monday night with an RBI single and was 1-for-5. He 
6-for-23 on New York's recent homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we had O'Neill started a few times,'' Torre said.  
``I just sense that he's trying to get too many hits each time 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre didn't talk with any players about the lineup changes.  
Instead, he simply posted it in the clubhouse. He doesn't 
anticipate any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope not,'' he said. ``We're not as strong as we should be  
if that's going to be a problem.''

<HEADLINE> Large Lichtenstein Exhibition Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Roy Lichtenstein, the artist who made comic  
strips into museum-quality paintings, is getting his first big 
sculpture exhibition. And it turns out that a lot of his sculpture 
looks like comic strips, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corcoran Gallery of Art is putting on the first  
comprehensive show of about 100 of his carvings, castings, moldings 
and forgings, and 100 of the drawings he made in planning them. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the building stands a 32-foot aluminum ``Brushstroke  
Group'' by Lichtenstein painted black, white blue, yellow and 
green. A similar work, only about 8 feet high, sold for $126,000 at 
a Sotheby's auction in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half a century ago, Lichtenstein apparently fell in love  
with the tiny, regular dots that can still be seen when looking 
closely at comic strips. They originate in the mechanical process 
used in printing, but Lichtenstein used them as an artistic element 
for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Corcoran sculptures, the dots appear much enlarged in a  
variety of his work from ``Brushstroke Nude'' that dominates the 
main staircase, to the low-slung BMW 320i sedan that had to be 
dismembered to get through the gallery's entrance. The car won 
first place in its class at Le Mans in 1977 -- for its speed, not 
Lichtenstein's painting on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Cowart, curator of the show, told a story that the artist's  
children brought him a bubble gum wrapper and challenged him to do 
a painting as good. The story says the result was his picture of 
Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck now owned by the National Gallery of 
Art, called ``Look Mickey, I've caught a big one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowart explained that when Lichtenstein and other American  
painters started imitating comics in the early 1960s, they were 
reacting from the fashionable ``abstract expressionism'' that 
produced colorful but unrecognizable images. He ``monumentalized'' 
the new style, Cowart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy was the one who was most interested and most successful in  
taking the dot pattern, the line pattern, the design and 
composition pattern and kind of re-engineering (them) into his own 
compositions,'' said Cowart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy Lichtenstein, Sculpture and Drawings'' will close Sept.  
30. It comes in part from an exhibit in Mexico that Lichtenstein 
was helping put together when he died in 1997. Admission for adults 
is $6. Students and senior citizens $3. Parts of the exhibit will 
go on to Valencia and La Coruna in Spain.

<HEADLINE> Remains of Vietnam Vet Coming Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	READING, Mass. (AP) -- Richard Holt was hunkered down in graduate  
school when his older brother took off for Vietnam with Marine 
Fighter Attack Squad 542. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't agree with his brother's decision to enlist, but  
figured they'd have plenty of time to debate it later. He never got 
the chance to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll get that chance this weekend, when the remains of Capt.  
Robert Holt are returned from the jungle where they lay for nearly 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt was 26 when his fighter plane crashed and exploded during a  
September 1968 bombing mission over the Quang Binh Province of 
Northern Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Details are incomplete, but the crash was likely caused by enemy  
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash site, now overgrown jungle, was off limits to  
Americans until the early 1990s when Vietnamese officials began 
allowing the recovery of remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt's remains were recovered in 1994, and this week the  
Department of Defense said they had been positively identified and 
would be returned to his family. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be laid to rest near his mother's grave in a Reading  
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was against him being there, which he understood and  
accepted,'' said Richard Holt, 54, of Westchester County, N.Y. ``We 
had gotten closer as we got older, so it was really hard (to lose 
him).''

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Plan To Keep Shanahan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings plan to hold on to forward  
Brendan Shanahan, general manager Ken Holland says. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland said Monday he has no plans to move Shanahan, who is  
entering the final year of his contract, and expects him to be at 
training camp in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had no conversations with any other team or general  
manager and at this point I have no plans to talk to anybody in the 
league regarding Brendan Shanahan,'' Holland told Booth News 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings also will offer associate coach Barry Smith a  
one-year contract extension, the Detroit Free Press reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan's situation has been questioned after two sub-par  
scoring seasons by his standards. After scoring 47 goals in 
1996-97, he scored 28 during 1997-98 and 31 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shanahan also has high-profile supporters, including Red  
Wings captain Steve Yzerman. Shanahan himself campaigned to remain 
a Red Wing after the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan also could become an unrestricted free agent after next  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings will begin negotiating with Shanahan this summer  
for a possible extension, Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Shanahan staying put, the chances of the Red Wings making a  
major move this summer are slight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like our nucleus, our supporting cast and our depth,''  
Holland said. ``If we can, I'd like to make a move to strengthen 
our team and give our team a different look. I don't know if we can 
make it happen for a number of factors, payroll being one of the 
most important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's offer from Holland is meant to keep him alongside Scotty  
Bowman, who signed on last month for a seventh season as head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings' other associate coach, Dave Lewis, interviewed  
last week for the Los Angeles Kings' head coaching position.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses War Powers Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge today dismissed a lawsuit  
filed by a group of House members who wanted the bombing of 
Yugoslavia by U.S. forces to be declared illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed by 26 lawmakers, led by Rep. Tom Campbell,  
R-Calif., who alleged that President Clinton violated the War 
Powers Act of 1973 by authorizing military airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vietnam War-era legislation, which has been ignored widely  
by presidents of both parties, requires a president to get 
congressional approval for the ``introduction into hostilities'' of 
U.S. forces for more than 60 days. The NATO air campaign began 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The members of Congress based their lawsuit on a 213-213 vote  
April 28 that fell short of authorizing U.S. participation in the 
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Clinton ignored the vote by continuing 
with the bombing, the plaintiffs claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, in his ruling granting a  
White House motion to dismiss the case, said ``congressional 
reaction to the airstrikes has sent distinctly mixed messages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge noted that on May 20, Congress passed an emergency  
spending bill to help pay for U.S. military involvement in the 
Yugoslav conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had the four votes been consistent and against the president's  
position, and had he nevertheless persisted with airstrikes in the 
face of such votes, there may well have been a constitutional 
impasse. But Congress has not sent such a clear, consistent 
message,'' Friedman said in his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	He goes on to note that some of the ``213 representatives who  
voted against authorizing the president's actions and against a 
declaration of war also voted in favor of supporting the troops and 
appropriating money to fund the conflict in Yugoslavia and against 
directing the president to remove the Armed Forces from their 
positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman said that ``absent a clear impasse between the  
executive and legislative branches, resort to the judicial branch 
is inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Campbell spokesman said that lawmakers plan to appeal the  
ruling but declined to comment further until officials could review 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said: ``We're pleased  
that the court dismissed the case because we believed all along 
that this was an issue to be resolved by Congress and the executive 
branch, not the courts.''

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Decision Just Days Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's future will be decided soon.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for baseball commissioner Bud Selig said Monday the  
decision on how Strawberry's latest drug suspension is resolved 
will be made ``in the next few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin, said the decision could come as  
early as today or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, 37, has been suspended since April 24 following his  
arrest for cocaine possession. Doctors for the players' association 
and the commissioner's office have been working on a joint 
recommendation to Selig on how he should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder, who served a 90-day suspension  
in 1995 after testing positive for cocaine, pleaded no contest to 
cocaine possession and solicitation charges last month and was 
sentenced to 18 months' probation and 100 hours' community service. 
He also must undergo more drug treatment, be tested twice and week 
and pay $456 in court fees.

<HEADLINE> Post-Tony Fallout: 4 Shows Closing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four Broadway shows that came up mostly  
empty-handed at the 1999 Tony Awards will close this weekend, 
including ``The Civil War,'' an $8 million musical. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Civil War'' ends its run Sunday. The musical by Frank  
Wildhorn, who also wrote the scores for ``Jekyll and Hyde'' and 
``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' will have played 61 performances. A 
national tour is planned, starting in Cincinnati in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' won two Tonys --  
for performers Kristin Chenoweth and Roger Bart -- it has been 
struggling to find an audience since it opened in February. The 
musical revue based on the Charles Schulz comic strip closes Sunday 
after 150 performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Two also-rans for the best-play prize, ``Not About  
Nightingales'' by Tennessee Williams and ``The Lonesome West'' by 
Martin McDonagh, will fold, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nightingales,'' which won a Tony Award for best set, was  
scheduled to close June 27 after a limited engagement, but its 
producers decided to end the run two weeks early. ``Nightingales'' 
will have played 124 performances. 
</P>
<P>
	The play was written by Williams in 1938 but was never produced  
until last year in London before coming to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lonesome West'' was McDonagh's second play on Broadway in  
two years. The first, ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' was a hit 
last year. ``The Lonesome West,'' the story of two antagonistic 
Irish brothers, ends its run after 55 performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other shows will finish their runs at the end of the month.  
``The Sound of Music,'' now starring Richard Chamberlain as Capt. 
Von Trapp, ends its more than year-long run June 27. Chamberlain 
takes the show on the road in August, starting in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Also shutting June 27 is ``Night Must Fall,'' a revival of the  
1930s thriller starring Matthew Broderick.

	NATO Bombs Targets Near Belgrade  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO hit targets near the Yugoslav  
capital of Belgrade for the first time in days today, keeping its 
pledge to intensify attacks until President Slobodan Milosevic 
orders his troops out of Kosovo. Fire and dense smoke could be seen 
rising above Pancevo, 12 miles northeast of Belgrade, and 
explosions could be heard from the direction of nearby Batajnica 
military airfield. In addition, one person was killed and five 
wounded in NATO attacks on Novi Sad, the country's second-largest

evening in the northern city of Torun was the first time the 
pontiff has mentioned Kosovo since beginning a 13-day pilgrimage to 
his native Poland on Saturday. It came at the final event of a 
hectic day that saw him consecrate the nation's largest church and

that came nearly four centuries after the Vatican condemned the

closing arguments at his treason trial. Ignoring a warning by 
Kurdish rebels -- who have threatened to intensify their war for 
autonomy if Ocalan is given a death sentence -- the prosecutors said 
the rebel leader should hang for leading a 15-year war for autonomy 
that has killed 37,000 people. The court then adjourned for 15 days 
to give Ocalan's lawyers time to prepare for his final defense. The 
lawyers had said they would ask for a month-long recess to read 
through the 16,000 pages of evidence against him.

<HEADLINE>  Agassi Has Pulled Thigh Muscle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLE, Germany (AP) -- Andre Agassi has an injured thigh that  
forced him to withdraw on Tuesday from a Wimbledon tuneup two days 
after winning the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi plans to return to the United States for treatment and  
intends to play Wimbledon, which starts June 28. 
</P>
<P>
	He consulted the tournament doctor at the Gerry Weber Open  
before dropping out because of a pulled muscle in his right thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great disappointment for me,'' Agassi said. ``I thought  
two days of rest would be enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd already felt it after the third round in Paris,'' he  
added. ``This morning I thought it was only a sore muscle but 
unfortunately it is not. I don't want to take any risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi won Wimbledon in 1992, his first Grand Slam title. He  
added the U.S. Open in 1994, the Australian Open in 1995 and this 
past French Open, giving him a career Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi was the major attraction of the Halle tournament, with  
tickets sales rising sharply after his French Open victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament tries to recreate Wimbledon conditions. But the  
center court has a retractable roof and it was much in use Tuesday 
as intermittent rain hit the grass-court event. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion from the  
Netherlands who is seeded third, was among three seeded players 
upset in the first round of the $900,000 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic beat Krajicek 7-6 (8-6), 6-4;  
Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands ousted No. 8 Jerome Golmard of 
France 7-5, 6-0; and Gianluca Pozzi of Italy routed Felix Mantilla, 
the fifth-seeded clay-court specialist from Spain, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	One seeded player to advance was No. 6 Tommy Haas. The German  
saved three set points in the second set to defeat France's 
Guillaume Raoux 6-4, 7-5.

<HEADLINE> Coffee May Help Prevent Gallstones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A few cups of regular coffee per day might help  
prevent gallstones. 
</P>
<P>
	A study found that men who drank two to three cups a day had a  
40 percent lower risk of gallstones than those who did not drink 
regular coffee. Men who drank four or more cups a day had a 45 
percent lower risk. 
</P>
<P>
	But hold the decaf: Only coffee with caffeine stimulates  
contractions in the gallbladder and lowers cholesterol in bile that 
can form painful gallstones. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly why is unclear. Caffeinated tea and soda don't have the  
same effect, the researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't actually say we would recommend that people take up  
coffee just to prevent gallstones,'' said Dr. Michael F. Leitzmann 
of the Harvard University School of Public Health. ``But it's OK to 
continue drinking it. Coffee doesn't cause any other major 
diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gallstones are painful deposits of cholesterol in the  
gallbladder, the organ under the liver that stores bile. They 
affect about 20 million Americans and cause 800,000 
hospitalizations each year, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leitzmann said lack of physical activity and being overweight  
are the two main causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers followed 46,008 men from 1986 through 1996. The  
men, who were 40 to 75 in 1986, were participants in the Health 
Professionals Follow-up Study, which is looking at diet and 
lifestyle factors and their effect on diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Leitzmann said he believes the findings would have been the same  
in women, but a separate study would look at that. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Thomas Magnuson, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins  
University, has conducted animal research that reached similar 
conclusions about the link between coffee consumption and 
gallstones. 
</P>
<P>
	``But further research needs to be done to see what that link is  
and what it is in coffee that causes that relationship,'' he said.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. and Sprint Corp. said today they  
were launching communications services for small business 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the voice and data services, which will be  
available this summer, include hardware and software for private 
branch exchange, local area network, Internet and remote access 
server functions, Dow Jones News Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
	With the services, businesses can use communications functions,  
including wireless and Internet services, in a single server, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The services are based on Microsoft's BackOffice Small Business  
Server 4.5 and Sprint's Business Flex communication services. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, a software giant based in Redmond, Wash., had 1998  
revenues of $14.48 billion. Sprint, based in Westwood, Kan., is a 
telecommunications company with 1998 revenues of $16.02 billion.

<HEADLINE> Analysts See Asia on Recovery Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Most economies in the Asia-Pacific region are  
likely to improve in 1999, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council 
said in a survey released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is the latest suggesting that the worst of the Asian  
financial crisis is over. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum -- which groups high-level business, academic and  
government representatives from 23 nations in the Asia-Pacific 
region -- predicted that most countries would post growth this year 
after severe economic declines in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's Pacific Economic Outlook predicted that average  
growth would be 2.6 percent, strengthening to 2.9 percent in the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also cautioned that several factors could upset the  
positive outlook, especially the ``uncertain direction'' of the 
Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, with the world's second-largest economy, is likely to see  
no economic growth this year and about 2 percent next year, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other laggards in the region include Indonesia, where the  
economy is expected to shrink by 2.5 percent this year. But next 
year, Indonesia is forecast to achieve 3.7 percent growth, the 
report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Karl Malone, who won the NBA's MVP award last  
week for the second time in three years, today became the first 
player ever to make 11 all-star teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the Utah Jazz power forward on the first team were San  
Antonio's Tim Duncan, Miami's Alonzo Mourning, Philadelphia's Allen

<HEADLINE>  Agassi Has Pulled Thigh Muscle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLE, Germany (AP) -- Andre Agassi has an injured thigh that  
forced him to withdraw on Tuesday from a Wimbledon tuneup two days 
after winning the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi plans to return to the United States for treatment and  
intends to play Wimbledon, which starts June 28. 
</P>
<P>
	He consulted the tournament doctor at the Gerry Weber Open  
before dropping out because of a pulled muscle in his right thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great disappointment for me,'' Agassi said. ``I thought  
two days of rest would be enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd already felt it after the third round in Paris,'' he  
added. ``This morning I thought it was only a sore muscle but 
unfortunately it is not. I don't want to take any risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi won Wimbledon in 1992, his first Grand Slam title. He  
added the U.S. Open in 1994, the Australian Open in 1995 and this 
past French Open, giving him a career Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi was the major attraction of the Halle tournament, with  
tickets sales rising sharply after his French Open victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament tries to recreate Wimbledon conditions. But the  
center court has a retractable roof and it was much in use Tuesday 
as intermittent rain hit the grass-court event. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion from the  
Netherlands who is seeded third, was among three seeded players 
upset in the first round of the $900,000 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic beat Krajicek 7-6 (8-6), 6-4;  
Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands ousted No. 8 Jerome Golmard of 
France 7-5, 6-0; and Gianluca Pozzi of Italy routed Felix Mantilla, 
the fifth-seeded clay-court specialist from Spain, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	One seeded player to advance was No. 6 Tommy Haas. The German  
saved three set points in the second set to defeat France's 
Guillaume Raoux 6-4, 7-5.

<HEADLINE> Tony Awards Falter in TV Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell stayed away from the Tony Awards  
this year -- and so did most television viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for Broadway's annual awards show plummeted this year  
after a two-year revival attributed to O'Donnell's stint as host, 
Nielsen Media Research said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday night's show, which had no host, drew an estimated 9.15  
million viewers. That was the second smallest audience since the 
show began being telecast in 1974. Only the 1996 show, one year 
before O'Donnell took over, was smaller at 8.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Tony Awards drew 12.9 million viewers in 1997.  
O'Donnell stayed away this year, saying she had other obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards tied for 31st place in Nielsen's prime-time ratings,  
even though it was the week broadcast networks began their long 
summer slumber. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was the week's champ with a 7.2 rating and 13 share, and  
also managed a comfortable victory in the 18-49 demographic it 
chases. CBS was second with a 6.8 rating and 13 share, ABC had a 
5.9 rating and 11 share, and Fox was at 4.8 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Those top four networks had 34.3 million people watching during  
an average minute of prime-time broadcasting last week, a sharp 
drop from the season average of 47.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating and 4  
share, UPN had a 1.6 rating and 3 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating 
and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
7.0 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.7 
rating and 16 share, and the ``CBS Evening News was at 5.8 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 31-June 6, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``Frasier,'' NBC, 10.2; ``ER,'' NBC, 10.1; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 10.0; ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 9.9; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 9.9; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 9.8; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 9.6; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 9.4; ``Law &AMP; 
Order,'' NBC, 9.2; ``20/20-Friday,'' ABC, 8.9.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Likes Idea of Senate Spouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The thought of President Clinton socializing  
with the other Senate spouses at a luncheon affair? 
</P>
<P>
	Another check in the ``plus'' column for the first lady  
pondering a New York Senate run. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many reasons to do or not do something,'' Mrs.  
Clinton said Monday night at a Democratic fund-raising event. 
``That kind of goes on the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Imagining the president at events for Senate spouses ``just  
brings an enormous smile to my face,'' she admitted. Mrs. Clinton 
announced last week that she plans to form an exploratory committee 
for the race. 
</P>
<P>
	And the president says he doesn't think it's such a bad deal --  
maybe even better than being in the Senate itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``No offense Senator Daschle, but until you change the numbers  
up there, if I were given the choice I'd rather be in the spouses 
club,'' Clinton quipped to the Senate minority leader, also on hand 
at the event which brought in more than $3 million for the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to it,'' the president added.  
</P>
<P>
	The dinner honoring fund-raiser Terence McAuliffe was held at  
the spacious Washington home of party activist Beth Dozoretz. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also got a sampling of what life might be like as the  
spouse rather than the president, when former Texas Gov. Ann 
Richards welcomed her friend Mrs. Clinton ``the next junior senator 
from New York ... and of course, her lovely husband Bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked today if he could settle for being just a political  
spouse, Clinton answered with a hearty ``absolutely!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he added: ``That won't be my only role, but I'll be happy  
if she's doing what she wants. I'm gonna run my library.''

<HEADLINE> Stars' Experience Could Pay Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Joe Nieuwendyk has waited 10 years for another  
shot at the Stanley Cup, which might seem like a lifetime to him. A 
lifetime is exactly what all the Buffalo Sabres have waited. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one of the reasons the Dallas Stars are given an edge  
over the Sabres in the Stanley Cup finals -- because Nieuwendyk and 
several of his teammates have won 10 titles compared to no one on 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	How important is the Stanley Cup-winning experience in the  
finals? 
</P>
<P>
	``That experience will come in handy, if we get down a game or a  
goal,'' said Mike Keane, who has already won two Cups with other 
teams. ``We are going to hopefully use the experience with the 
group of players we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Carbonneau is another two-Cup winner on the Stars. The other  
Cup winners: Craig Ludwig, Brian Skrudland, Shawn Chambers, Sergei 
Zubov and Doug Lidster. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, all these players won their Stanley Cups with other  
teams. The Stars and the Sabres, whose best-of-7 series begins 
tonight at Reunion Arena, are still looking for their first Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	While playing in Minnesota, the North Stars reached the finals  
twice, in 1981 and 1991. The Sabres' only other appearance in the 
finals was 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbonneau, who played most of his career with the Montreal  
Canadiens, has had the most playoff experience of anyone in this 
year's finals -- 202 games. Overall, the Dallas players have 
participated in a combined 1,985 playoff games. That's almost twice 
as many as the Sabres, with 1,023. 
</P>
<P>
	For Nieuwendyk, returning to the Stanley Cup finals has been a  
big emotional payoff. His last appearance was in 1989, with the 
Cup-winning Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all happens so fast that you don't really have a chance to  
enjoy it,'' he said. ``Now I appreciate coming back a little bit 
more. I think after you go through some of the wars and the pain 
and agony of an NHL season, you realize how tough it is to get back 
to the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're 22 years old and you have a young team like we did  
in Calgary, you think it is going to be easy. You think this is the 
way it is going to be in the NHL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carbonneau has been especially helpful to the Stars' younger  
players, according to Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock, and not only 
because of his Cup experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never met a player with that type of feel for the game,''  
Hitchcock said of the 39-year-old center. ``He is one step ahead of 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for the Stars' role as favorites was their  
regular-season performance: For the second straight season, they 
won the Presidents' Trophy for the best record in the NHL at 
51-19-12. The Sabres, meanwhile, finished seventh in the Eastern 
Conference with a 37-28-17 record, 23 points behind the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams split their two regular-season games.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are obviously the underdog,'' Sabres captain Mike  
Peca said. ``But it is a role we are comfortable with, starting on 
the road especially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars advanced to the finals with series wins over Edmonton,  
St. Louis and Colorado. Buffalo, which is 5-3 on the road in the 
playoffs, ousted Ottawa, Boston and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you need to have a Stanley Cup ring to have  
seasoning,'' Buffalo's Dixon Ward said. ``I think we got some good 
seasoning in the last couple of rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek said he hasn't thought about the  
supposed advantage the Stars have with their Stanley Cup 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The Stanley Cup) is my only focus in the next one or two  
weeks, to do everything to bring a Stanley Cup to Buffalo,'' Hasek 
said. ``I don't really (care) what other people think. It is not 
important to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing for me is to do everything to win  
four games.''

<HEADLINE> Union Poised To Reject TWA Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Ground and flight personnel for Trans World  
Airlines began voting Tuesday on a ``last, best'' contract offer 
they were expected to reject, extending a stalemate that could 
disrupt travel over the Fourth of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	About 16,000 mechanics, ramp workers, ticket agents and flight  
attendants were also voting on whether to approve limited strikes 
targeting key flights during the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA officials warned such an action would be disastrous, even  
threatening the airline's survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The different employee groups, all represented by the  
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, will 
each need to approve the contract provisions that pertain to them 
before any pact can be ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants across the country began taking a strike vote  
Tuesday, but they will mail in ballots on whether to approve the 
company's contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanics and ramp workers in Kansas City also cast ballots  
Tuesday, with other votes scheduled nationwide later this week. 
Their votes will be counted by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's no contract in place by the Fourth of July weekend,  
workers will select certain busy flights and refuse to hand out 
tickets, clean the planes, or load baggage, said Sherry Cooper, 
chairwoman of District 142 for the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders won't specify which flights, or even which cities,  
they would target, but the airline's main hub in St. Louis would 
probably be hit hardest. TWA accounts for about 70 percent of the 
air traffic at Lambert Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis officials were urging the workers to approve the  
offer, with Mayor Clarence Harmon issuing a statement on Monday and 
the city's Regional Commerce &AMP; Growth Association taking out a 
full-page ad in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both gestures came after an industry expert, hired by TWA to  
analyze the offer, concluded the airline had been pushed to the 
brink of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	``For management to offer workers less than they deserve is  
unfair,'' said Darryl Jenkins, executive director of the Aviation 
Institute at George Washington University. ``For the employees to 
demand more than the company can afford is self-destructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the threat of a strike could turn away passengers, landing  
a severe blow to a company that's already short on cash. That fact, 
one analyst said, is why the union hasn't yet announced an official 
strike date. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides know this company can't afford to strike,'' said  
Glenn Engel of Goldman Sachs in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which hasn't turned a profit in 10 years, contends  
the $350 million contract offer is the best it can do. According to 
TWA, the pact would bring its workers to 90 percent of the 
projected industry standard by summer 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the two sides appear to have reached a stalemate, Engel  
said there may be room for compromise if TWA agrees to give workers 
a large cut if it turns a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the world end tomorrow if the company bends more? The  
answer is no,'' Engel said. ``But are TWA's costs already higher 
than its peers? The answer is yes. Frankly they've bent more than I 
thought they would.''

<HEADLINE> Schumer Traces Guns Used in Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A tiny fraction of the nation's gun dealers  
provide the weapons used in almost half of all crimes and have done 
so for years, says a lawmaker who strongly supports gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the staff of Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., used  
statistics from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to show 
that 1 percent of the nation's 100,000 federally licensed gun 
dealers supplied weapons used in 45 percent of the crimes in which 
the gun was traced by federal officials. The report listed 137 of 
the ``worst'' dealers, which had each sold more than 50 guns used 
in crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This cries out for an explanation,'' Schumer said. ``Most gun  
dealers are law abiding citizens. But a few bad apples appear to be 
spoiling the bunch and it's them we have to go after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer said he will introduce legislation this week to allow  
unlimited ATF inspections at dealers found to have supplied more 
than 10 guns traced to a crime in any given year. Currently, the 
ATF can inspect gun dealers only once a year unless they have a 
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited 1998 statistics that found 1,160 gun stores that would  
be subject to increased inspections. Those problem gun dealers 
could have their licenses suspended or revoked if they failed to 
meet enhanced reporting guidelines, under Schumer's bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association accused Schumer of juggling the  
numbers to make a political point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every universe of data is subject to manipulation,'' the NRA's  
chief lobbyist, Jim Baker, said. ``I would believe the staff of 
Senator Schumer would be able to come up with the conclusion they 
wanted in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called Schumer's proposed legislation unneeded because the  
ATF already has the right to go after rogue dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF did not dispute or endorse the report.  
</P>
<P>
	ATF spokesman Jeff Roehm said Tuesday it was quite possible that  
in some cases dealers listed in Schumer's ``137 worst'' list sold a 
high volume of guns, skewing the results. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that a gun store sells a gun that is at some point  
later on used in a crime is not a definitive indicator of criminal 
activity,'' Roehm said. ``It's certainly a red flag we need to look 
at. But the sale could be perfectly legal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 percent of guns recovered from crimes scenes can be  
traced by federal officials, Roehm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer, who authored the Brady law while in the House,  
predicted the report would be used in lawsuits filed by 20 
municipalities against gun manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Education Land Grant Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cash-strapped school districts, particularly  
in the West, could buy small parcels of Forest Service land at 
minimal cost for educational purposes under a bill the House passed 
Tuesday without dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 420-0 for the measure, which advanced to the  
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration says it favors making such lands  
available but opposes the bill because the land would be sold for 
less than fair market price. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, said he understood the concerns but  
suggested the administration take note of who would benefit under 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about schoolchildren. We're talking about giving  
school districts a little land to build an elementary school or a 
playground for the children,'' Hansen said. ``This is a good cause 
and a very good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, school districts could apply for up to 80 acres  
of land. Before transferring the land, the agriculture secretary 
must determine that it will be used for a public elementary or 
secondary school, will serve the public interest and is not 
otherwise needed for National Forest System. 
</P>
<P>
	Districts would pay $10 per acre. Mineral rights would not be  
included in any transfer, and title to the land would revert to the 
government if a district tries to transfer the land or use it for 
purposes other than education. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts in the West face several problems in purchasing  
land, said Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., the bill's sponsor. Many 
towns are surrounded by federal land, which drives up the price of 
private land. Private land also is in great demand because of rapid 
population growth throughout the region, he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> `Death in Venice' Is No. 1 Gay Novel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Add another voice to the chorus of literary  
lists. 
</P>
<P>
	An organization of gays and lesbians in publishing has compiled  
its picks for the 100 greatest novels of all time. ``Death in 
Venice,'' Thomas Mann's short novel about a writer's infatuation 
with a teen-age boy, was voted No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an obvious response to the Modern Library's list. That  
list got me thinking about what novels by gays and lesbians were 
overlooked,'' said Charles Flowers, chair of the Publishing 
Triangle, which consists of more than 250 gay and lesbian writers, 
editors, agents and publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Announced last summer, the Modern Library's choices for the  
century's best English-language novels were widely ridiculed as a 
stodgy compilation of white, male fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Publishing Triangle's list is more diverse. It covers the  
best gay novels ever, not just for the century. There are far more 
women and nonwhites and all languages were eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Modern Library, a division of Random House, could be  
faulted for disregarding alternative voices, the current list could 
be cited for excessive loyalty to those voices. 
</P>
<P>
	Few critics would call James Baldwin's ``Giovanni's Room'' (No.  
2) a better novel than Marcel Proust's ``Remembrance of Things 
Past'' (No. 4) or rank Patricia Highsmith's ``The Price of Salt'' 
(No. 36) above ``The Turn of the Screw'' by Henry James (No. 40) 
and Louisa May Alcott's ``Little Women.'' (No. 43). 
</P>
<P>
	``Many elements went into the voting,'' Flowers said. ``Social  
influence. Cultural influence. Literary quality. I don't believe 
there's a single objective standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the question of what is a ``gay'' novel. Does the  
writer have to be gay? Should the subject matter be gay? Is it 
enough that the book is open to a gay interpretation? You could 
find all kinds on the Publishing Triangle list. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges disagreed, for instance, over the inclusion of  
``Moby-Dick.'' Some said the book didn't belong because it has no 
gay relationships and that Herman Melville wasn't trying to suggest 
any. Others found the novel inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of these books contributes to the understanding of the  
outsider mentality,'' said Dorothy Allison, author of the acclaimed 
novel ``Bastard Out of Carolina'' and other books. ``'Moby-Dick' is 
very much about the survival of the different. And that's pretty 
much the situation for gay and lesbian people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say that about a leper colony, too,'' responded  
fellow judge M.E. Kerr, a novelist. ``You have to consider the 
writer's intention. If you're supposed to choose a gay novel, I 
should think that it's not just because it has a group of men or 
women interacting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others on the 14-member judging committee included science  
fiction writer Samuel Delany and Anthony Heilbut, author of a 
prize-winning biography on Mann. 
</P>
<P>
	With both the century and the millennium nearing the end, there  
is competition within the literary world to define its history. 
(And, of course, to sell some books). 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, the Modern Library released its choices for  
the century's best fiction and nonfiction and publishing students 
at Radcliffe College, most of them women, also compiled a fiction 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such lists are basically a kind of game people play,'' Delany  
said. ``If people take them too seriously it's not a good thing. 
But they inspire people to think. And they inspire people to make 
their own lists'' 
</P>
<P>
	The list was released in conjunction with National Lesbian and  
Gay Book Month, started eight years ago by the Publishing Triangle.

<HEADLINE>  Mexico Outraged at TV Star's Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The death of a television star in a fusillade  
of bullets has galvanized popular outrage over crime in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the slaying of Francisco ``Paco'' Stanley  
remained a mystery on Tuesday, and its professional style made it 
untypical of murders in the Mexican capital, where taxicab 
kidnappings, armed robberies and carjackings have long terrorized 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fame of the victim and the brazenness of the noontime  
attack shocked many Mexicans, and prompted some to use it to attack 
the city's opposition party mayor, a candidate for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``With so much violence in the city, the government has ignored  
us. Anybody can carry a weapon in his hand just as he'd carry a 
cell phone,'' said Claudia Flores, one of thousands of people who 
lined up outside a funeral home Tuesday to file past Stanley's 
coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody protects us. We are alone,'' she said. Many in line  
sobbed as they talked among themselves about their memories of the 
comedian. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley was a sort of morning-show cross between Rosie O'Donnell  
and Ed Sullivan, a wisecracking host offering musical acts and 
silly skits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I woke up pessimistic, he would tell one of his jokes,  
which were stupid but graceful,'' said Carmen Dolores Duran, 74, a 
retired school principal, clutching a rose against her gray suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the memorial, thousands more gathered at Mexico City's  
Spanish Cemetery for the burial. Many clambered atop family tomb 
chapels to shower flowers upon the hearse carrying Stanley's body 
as it eased through the chaotic crowd. Some chanted ``Justice! 
Justice!'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 24 hours of developments since Stanley's death were  
covered almost non-stop on Mexico's two main television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a gunman with a .40-caliber automatic weapon fired  
26 shots into Stanley's black Lincoln Navigator at noon Monday in 
front of El Charco De Las Ranas, one of the capital's most famous 
restaurants alongside its busiest freeway, the Periferico. 
</P>
<P>
	An insurance agent standing nearby also was killed and three  
people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, whose 1997 election victory came on a  
wave of outrage at soaring crime in the city, quickly came under 
attack -- turning the slaying into a possible political issue ahead 
of Cardenas' likely run for the presidency in July 2000 on the 
opposition Democratic Revolution Party ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the government of Cardenas camouflages the statistics  
of the fight against crime ... Paco's death is one more example 
against what the authorities say,'' Congressman Jorge Galvan of the 
National Action Party told the daily El Heraldo de Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``The responsibility is that of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,'' charged  
Jorge Garralda, a newscaster on the TV Azteca network where Stanley 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody should resign and make way for people who are capable  
of protecting us,'' Mexico's best-known newscaster, Jacobo 
Zabludovsky, said on the rival Televisa network. 
</P>
<P>
	A prominent anti-crime lobbying group, Mexico United Against  
Crime, announced plans for a demonstration on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardenas claims that his administration has reduced the wave of  
armed robberies, carjackings, thefts and kidnappings that have 
soared in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	But figures are untrustworthy. Officials admit that many crimes  
are not reported due to lack of faith in authorities, and those 
victims who do report crimes sometimes find they are not treated 
seriously: an attempted kidnapping, for example, is classified as a 
lost document. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardenas at first seemed to minimize the Stanley killing, saying  
it ``is one more case and it will be investigated as one more case. 
... The city is well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as public outrage grew -- and more fingers were pointed his  
way -- his tone changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no such thing as a 'common crime,''' Cardenas said in  
a paid statement placed in Tuesday newspapers, vowing ``our most 
urgent priority'' to solve the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused ``some news media'' of ``an act of great  
irresponsibility'' in blaming his government for the crime and 
insisted that the federal government -- run by the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party -- also is responsible for fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley's show was not politically controversial and the motive  
for his slaying remained a mystery Tuesday. But that didn't stop 
the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The style of the execution of Paco Stanley is that of a  
settling of accounts among drug-trafficking mafias,'' the newspaper 
Excelsior noted in a Page 1 editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper Reforma said government intelligence reports  
earlier had linked Stanley to drug traffickers, but the city 
attorney general's office would not comment on the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	At first officials suggested it might have been a bungled  
kidnapping attempt, but that theory soon disappeared as the 
investigation made clear it was a deliberate assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Monday detained at least two people whose car matched  
the description of that seen by witnesses. But they said Tuesday 
that none of the witnesses could identify the two and they were 
released.

<HEADLINE> Bird Tapes Testimony in Battery Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- With his team in the midst of the Eastern  
Conference finals, Indiana Pacers coach Larry Bird on Tuesday gave 
testimony in the case of a downtown pub manager charged with 
battery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Etchison was charged after evicting a female patron he  
believed was bothering Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	In an office in Market Square Arena on Tuesday, Bird provided  
videotaped testimony for the June 30 trial. Bird calmly fielded 
questions from Deputy Prosecutor Bob Altice and Etchison's 
attorney, Martin Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	Etchison is a former owner of the Legal Beagle pub and managed  
it until shortly after his arrest. Bird is among prosecution 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution and defense agreed he could provide videotaped  
testimony instead of appearing on the witness stand. Also in 
attendance was Bird's attorney, James Voyles. 
</P>
<P>
	As the tape rolled, Bird described what he remembered of the  
evening of Feb. 4. Bird said he and an assistant coach went to the 
Legal Beagle for sandwiches and beers. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated his statement to police that patron Kay Williams  
was not bothering him when she came to his table. He said Etchison 
came up to her and told her it was time to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `She's fine.' I could tell she was about done,'' Bird  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not see Etchison physically grab her.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said Williams was treated at Methodist Hospital for  
bruises and soreness.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Roll Back Summer Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- This round of air fare wars goes to the consumer.  
</P>
<P>
	Major airlines rolled back summer fares after American  
vacationers and business travelers balked at steep increases -- 
including a round of hikes last week. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, the nation's No. 1 carrier, on Tuesday kicked  
off the largest fare war of the season by offering steep discounts 
on leisure domestic and international travel. Other major airlines 
quickly matched the promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the promotion, consumers would see the best savings on  
tickets purchased in advance for travel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and 
Saturdays. In some cases, those traveling in parties of three could 
pay less for all their tickets combined than one full-fare ticket 
cost earlier this year after prices jumped 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the airlines brought on the fare war by adding too  
many planes to fleets too quickly, leaving many seats empty. Savvy 
shoppers also were holding out for better prices, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real winners here are those in larger parties and those  
flying coast-to-coast, amounting to savings in some cases of 55 
percent,'' said Tom Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com, an Internet 
travel company. ``The major airlines haven't given us a 55 percent 
discount in many, many moons, so people should sit down and 
consider these will probably be the best fares of the summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, ticket prices for a round trip from New York to Los  
Angeles fell to $398 from as high as $622 earlier this month. And 
two fellow travelers could fly that route for just $258 each. 
</P>
<P>
	United also capped advanced round-trip domestic tickets for the  
remaining travel days at $498. 
</P>
<P>
	The promotion, in which tickets must be purchased by June 18,  
applies to travel through the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is similar to a more restricted promotion launched last  
week by Northwest Airlines, but the latest promotion also allows 
for travel on Saturdays and sets no age limit on companion travel. 
</P>
<P>
	The fare war undercuts a 4 percent boost in ticket prices  
instituted last week by major airlines and comes as the carriers 
are finding an unexpectedly large number of empty seats despite 
strong summer bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen percent of Americans are expected to fly this summer,  
up 3 percent from a year ago, according to the Travel Industry 
Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The fare war also comes after United parent UAL Corp. and US  
Airways Group, the sixth-largest carrier, warned second-quarter 
profits will fall below Wall Street expectations because of weak 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines, flush with success from three years of record profits,  
recently went on a plane-buying spree and have been adding flights 
faster than they retire older planes. 
</P>
<P>
	New planes have been arriving as May bookings came up  
unexpectedly short. Traffic industrywide rose 1.4 percent, less 
than a third of the 3.7 percent capacity increase. And the amount 
of plane seats filled, called the load factor, posted the sharpest 
monthly decline since mid-1993, at 1.6 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation analyst Samuel Buttrick at PaineWebber said airlines  
also have been hurt as companies better manage travel expenses for 
their employees. Airlines generally court business travelers 
because tickets cost far more than leisure fares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Corporations are gaining leverage in managing travel expenses  
by increasingly opting for advance purchases, negotiated discounts 
with preferred carriers and using the Internet as a booking tool,'' 
Buttrick said. ``With the Internet, they now have a booking tool 
that allows them -- and consumers -- to access the lowest fares for a 
particular itinerary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United spokesman Joe Hopkins said consumers who previously  
purchased tickets under the old fares can get a travel credit for 
the difference or can get a cash refund after paying a $75 
ticket-change fee.

<HEADLINE> Smith Ends Olympic Swimming Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Olympic champion Michelle Smith de Bruin  
ended her swimming career Tuesday, insisting she did not use drugs 
and hoping she did not disgrace her country. 
</P>
<P>
	Her announcement Tuesday came one day after the Irish swimmer  
lost her appeal of a four-year ban for manipulating a urine sample. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am saddened that my career has ended in this way, but now  
(husband) Erik and I must look to the future and decide where we go 
from here,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish government, which once hailed Smith for the greatest  
Olympic performance by an Irish athlete, ruefully accepted the 
verdict. And Irish swim authorities are now considering stripping 
her of her national records. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I condemn more in sadness than in anger,'' Sports Minister  
James McDaid said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We swam those lanes with her, we stayed up all night, we had  
served our time, and I'm sure a lot of people across the country 
had hoped she would be able to prove her innocence,'' McDaid said. 
``... You wanted to believe her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith won three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Games. The  
29-year-old swimmer is ineligible for the 2000 Sydney Olympics and 
the 2001 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will forever cherish my moments of victory and hope that  
those who still believe in me will also cherish their memories of 
those times,'' she said. ``I hope that you will not believe that I 
have brought this country into disrepute or that I have let you 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Peter Lennon, made no mention of an appeal. Smith  
said in a statement her victories are ``not hollow and were 
achieved without the use of any illegal performance-enhancing 
drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``However, I am strong in the knowledge that I have not  
committed the offense with which I was charged, or any other 
offense, and that to date no one has proven on a direct factual 
basis how the whiskey entered the sample,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDaid said he would start Ireland's first formal drug-testing  
program for athletes in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Swim Ireland, the country's swimming body, said it might strike  
Smith's nine national records she set in 1995, the year after Dutch 
discus thrower Erik de Bruin became her coach. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her husband, whose career ended with his own four-year  
ban for using performance-enhancing drugs, were married weeks 
before Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland  
rejected her appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA, the international swimming federation, banned Smith after  
finding her guilty of contaminating a urine sample with alcohol 
during an out-of-competition test in January 1998. Alcohol could 
mask banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith accused FINA of deliberately targeting her and accused the  
three-member arbitration panel of accepting circumstantial evidence 
from others rather than her direct testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict had even Smith's strongest supporters in her home  
village of Rathcoole, a Dublin suburb, searching for explanations. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Poitin Stil, Rathcoole's thatched-roof pub where  
thousands had cheered her Atlanta performances, manager Tom Young 
said people ``feel absolutely gutted by what's happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted that memories of 1996 -- when Rathcoole was draped  
with bunting and ``Our belle Michelle'' photos -- now ``seem so 
innocent and bitter. People definitely feel emotionally torn by the 
whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of Ireland's major newspapers Tuesday featured sad-eyed  
pictures of Smith -- taken at her last major news conference last 
year -- on their front pages. 
</P>

	The Irish Times' Tom Humphries, one of the Irish media's early

<HEADLINE> Former Ottawa GM Goes to Tampa Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Former Ottawa general manager Rick Dudley  
will oversee the rebuilding of the Tampa Bay Lightning -- the NHL's 
worst team the past two seasons -- as Palace Sports and 
Entertainment's vice president of hockey operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a whole new day. We are here to win ... make  
no mistake about it,'' Tom Wilson, Palace Sports and Entertainment 
president, said Tuesday in announcing Dudley's hiring. ``One of the 
key parts to that is to bring in somebody who will provide the 
overall direction for the hockey operation and that is Rick 
Dudley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palace Sports, whose holdings include the NBA's Detroit Pistons  
and the Palace of Auburn Hills, is expected to complete its 
reported $100 million deal to purchase the struggling franchise 
from Art Williams within the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley spent four years as general manager for the Detroit  
Vipers of the International Hockey League -- owned by Palace Sports 
-- before being named general manager of the Ottawa Senators on June 
30, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa had 103 points and the NHL's third-best record during  
Dudley's only season as general manager. He was released from the 
final two years of his contract Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't any reservation,'' Dudley said. ``It was a  
wonderful experience being in Ottawa. It was very difficult (to 
leave) because it was the best group of people that I've ever 
worked with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators will receive undisclosed compensation from Tampa  
Bay for signing Dudley. The status of current coach-general manager 
Jacques Demers should be determined within the next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley did not completely rule out Demers returning in both  
roles, but said handling the dual responsibility is very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're looking to make major changes. The ideal  
situation would be all the people here would remain here,'' Dudley 
said. ``Obviously there's some evaluating to go on. I just want to 
get the right mix of people pointed in the same direction and go 
from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley and Demers met for about 30 minutes Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll sit down and see what's best for the franchise and what  
Rick is going to be comfortable with ... where does he want Jacques 
Demers to be,'' Demers said. ``I've never felt not unwanted by this 
organization. We'll have to wait and see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Army Delays Antimissile Test Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- The Army today postponed  
its latest attempt to destroy a flying target with an expensive 
antimissile missile that has never scored a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's scheduled trial was put off until Thursday because of a  
power failure on the base during the night, said spokesman Jim 
Eckles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile system  
has cost at least $3.8 billion and critics call it a waste of 
taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department said it needs a new state-of-the-art  
antimissile missile to protect its troops from missiles that cannot 
be downed by current weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	THAAD's last previous direct-hit attempt, its sixth, failed  
March 29 over the Army's restricted range in southern New Mexico. 
Another test was scrubbed May 25 because the target missile 
malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Defense Secretary William Cohen said he wasn't  
discouraged by the problems in a program that involves so many 
technical difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are, in fact, breaking the barriers of technology every day  
and we would expect this to go forward, even if have future 
failures,'' Cohen said. ``We have to proceed and will ultimately be 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin Missiles &AMP; Space was assessed a $15 million  
penalty for not achieving a hit during the March 29 test. 
</P>
<P>
	And it must have two successful direct-hit missile tests by June  
30 or be penalized an additional $20 million, according to its 
contract. In all, the company could face up to $75 million in 
penalties by the end of 1999 if there are more failures. 
</P>
<P>
	THAAD is designed to strike enemy missiles fired from ranges of  
800 miles away or more, just the kind of weapons being developed by 
nations such as Iran, North Korea and Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Hogan's Wife Recalls Husband  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAR HILLS, N.J. (AP) -- Walking around a room filled with the  
trophies and medals that were a testament to her husband's 
greatness as golfer, seeing his trademark white hat and some of his 
clubs and clothes, Valerie Hogan gave in and cried for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ben would have loved this,'' she said Tuesday as the USGA  
Museum opened the Ben Hogan Room, the first it has dedicated to the 
life and career of a professional golfer. Hogan died two years ago 
at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	What Ben Hogan also would have liked would have been to hear his  
wife of more than six decades talk about the man whose 63 career 
victories and nine majors rank third in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
	She talked about his love of practicing, his personality, his  
battle to come back from a near-fatal car crash in 1949, and most 
of all, her love for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would give anything if he could be here, even if I were not  
here,'' Valerie Hogan said, and there was no doubt she meant it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-case permanent exhibit includes more than 300 objects,  
with the majority coming from Valerie Hogan. It details Ben Hogan's 
early years -- did you know his real first name is William? -- 
follows the highlights of his golf career, his accident and 
recovery and later his work as a clubmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you no one, no one loved golf more than Ben  
Hogan,'' Valerie Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, playing in tournaments wasn't what Ben Hogan enjoyed  
most. It was practicing on the range. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he felt the actual playing of golf was for something  
else,'' she said. ``Where he really enjoyed it was on the practice 
tee and then hoping he would play the way he would like to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most feared golfers of his time, Hogan was known as a  
loner by many competitors. He spent endless hours on the practice 
range and was known to be a man of few words during a round. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the course, Valerie Hogan said her husband was a man of many  
interests who also tried to do his best at whatever he was doing. 
He also didn't speak much off the course, for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could discuss almost any subject with you because he was  
the best listener,'' she said. ``As he said: `People who talk all 
the time don't learn anything because you have to listen, that's 
how you learn,' and believe you me, he listened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't true all the time, especially during his recovery  
from the head-on collision with a bus in 1949 that shattered his 
legs. After that, he always played in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first month after the accident, Hogan barely survived  
blood clots in his left leg. It took him almost a year to start 
swinging a club again, said his wife, who admits she was never sure 
whether he would play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``After he got home, he surprised me one day,'' she said. ``He  
so wanted to walk sometimes, he would slip out of the house. I had 
help and they wouldn't even know it. He would be out trying to walk 
and sometimes I'd have to go in the car and find him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within 16 months, he would win the U.S. Open in a playoff with  
Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio, much to the surprise of his wife. 
He had qualified for the playoffs by playing a 36-hole final day at 
Merion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to say that the night he came in, I didn't feel he  
would have the strength the next morning because he eyes were in 
the back (of his head) and he was so very, very tired. I felt that 
he was not going to be able to play the next day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hogan slept like a baby and woke up refreshed the next  
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even then I doubted he would have the strength,'' she said.  
``I was probably the most surprised person he won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan would go on to win two more U.S. Opens -- only Jack  
Nicklaus, Bobby Jones and Willie Anderson have won as many -- and 
the 1953 British Open at Carnoustie. He won the Masters and U.S. 
Open that same year, a year he won five of the six tournaments in 
which he competed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Valerie and friends had to persuade Hogan to play in  
the British Open, the only time he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept saying, `I just think you want me to go just to see me  
get beat over there,''' his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerie Hogan's funniest comment was about the movie `Follow The  
Sun' which portrayed her husband's life and starred Glenn Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Glenn Ford, he worked so hard, but he did not know how to play  
golf, but he told them he did,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who knew very little about golf when she married,  
Valerie Hogan has grown to love the game. She still watches it all 
the time. Justin Leonard is her favorite player. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if anyone reminds her of her husband, she bluntly says,  
``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's fair to compare,'' she said. ``I think he  
was the greatest, especially when he came back. I know what he went 
through and all that he did.''

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Leads Indonesia Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Election officials today were forced  
to defend the painfully slow vote-counting process that was 
dampening the euphoria of this southeast Asian nation's freest vote 
in 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Monday's balloting, election officials had promised to  
have half the 116 million votes counted by this evening. But late 
today, only about 1 percent had been tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The delay has nothing to do with political factors,'' National  
Election Commission Chairman Rudini said. ``It's purely the delay 
in the process of vote counting at the village level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a year after pro-democracy protests ended President  
Suharto's 32-year authoritarian rule, this ethnically diverse 
archipelago of 210 million people held Monday's election in 
remarkable peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Election observers, including former President Carter, said the  
voting in the world's fourth most populous country seemed to have 
been conducted fairly, with only scattered pockets of violence and 
irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	As results began to trickle in, the opposition party of Megawati  
Sukarnoputri, daughter of Indonesia's founding president, led the 
way. Final, official results weren't expected until June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is taking so much time, I am afraid the momentum is gone  
and I am worried about some kind of manipulation,'' Laksamana 
Sukardi, treasurer of the Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 96 percent of the 112 million registered voters cast  
ballots, said Jakob Tobing, head of the National Election 
Supervisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The elections brought a quick economic boost to a country that  
is still suffering after becoming the worst victim of the 1997 
Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote prompted the International Monetary Fund to approve a  
$450 million loan for Indonesia on Monday, the fifth installment of 
a rescue package. 
</P>
<P>
	The main Indonesian stock index surged by more than 12 percent  
today and the rupiah currency continued its gains against the U.S. 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard congratulated Indonesia's  
government and people for their ``real celebration of democracy.'' 
Japan and New Zealand also sent their praises. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-eight political parties and more than 11,000 candidates  
sought Parliament seats -- a vast change from elections under 
Suharto, which were largely rigged to ensure the victory of his 
Golkar Party. At the time, only three approved parties could field 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Up for grabs were 462 of Parliament's 500 seats. The rest go to  
appointees of the military, which is not allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislators will join 200 government appointees to choose a  
new president in November. No party was expected to win a majority 
in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 1 percent of ballots counted, Megawati's Indonesian  
Democratic Party for Struggle was leading with 390,398 votes, 
according to the General Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	In second place was the National Awakening Party, led by ailing  
Abdurrahman Wahid, with 254,547 votes. The Golkar Party of 
President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's former protege, came next with 
126,952 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnering 63,088 votes, the Muslim-based United Development  
Party ranked fourth, better than expected. And the pro-reform 
National Mandate Party of Muslim leader Amien Rais, another 
presidential candidate, was fifth with 52,222 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati's popularity soared in 1996, when Suharto tried to dump  
her as her party's leader after she criticized his rule and 
demanded democratic reforms. Bloody riots erupted when security 
forces stormed her party's Jakarta headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati's father, Sukarno, was Indonesia's founding president.  
He experimented with democracy and held a free election in 1955, 
but later had Parliament declare him president-for-life. In the 
mid-1960s, Suharto, then an army general, edged him from power.

<HEADLINE> CEO Reveals Secret of Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARKS, Nev. (AP) -- For decades, Jay Thiessens hid a painful  
secret as he built his machine and tool company from a mom-and-pop 
operation into a $5 million-a-year enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	During the day he hid behind the role of a harried businessman,  
too busy to review contracts or shuffle through mail. At night, his 
wife, Bonnie, would help him sort through the paperwork at the 
kitchen table, in the living room, or sometimes sitting up in bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Other tasks he delegated to a core group of managers at B&AMP;J  
Machine Tool Co. who had no idea their boss couldn't read. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked for him for seven years and I had no clue,'' said  
Jack Sala, now the engineering manager for Truckee Precision, a B&AMP;J 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was his general manager. He would bring legal stuff to me  
and say, 'You're better at legalese than me.' I never knew I was 
the only one reading them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few people knew of his shame and most burning desire: To be able  
to read a simple bedtime story to his grandchildren. But he 
couldn't keep his illiteracy secret forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became too hard to continue to hide it,'' said Thiessens,  
who has begun to read at the age of 56. ``Since I made the decision 
to let everybody know, it's a big relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Thiessens will be honored in Washington, D.C., as  
one of six national winners of the 1999 National Blue Chip 
Enterprise Initiative Award. Sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce and MassMutual, the award recognizes small businesses that 
have triumphed over adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiessens' torment took root when he was in the first or second  
grade in McGill, a small mining town in central Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	``A teacher called me stupid because I had trouble reading,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	All through school, he was the quiet little boy in the back of  
the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the teachers just got tired of looking at me so they  
passed me on,'' he said. He graduated from White Pine High School 
in Ely 1963, getting mostly C's, D's and F's. He made the honor 
roll once, in his senior year when he landed A's in auto mechanics 
and machine shop. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after graduation, Thiessens moved to Reno, where 10  
years later he started a small machine shop with his last $200. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, B&AMP;J specializes in welding, machine parts and precision  
sheet metal work. With 50 employees, the company conducts $5 
million a year in business and just broke ground on a new 54,000 
square-foot expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his success, the stigma of being labeled a dummy haunted  
him through adulthood. He compensated by being a good listener. He 
rarely forgets details and has a solid grasp of math and figures, a 
trait essential to the industry, others say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of everything we do is technical,'' said Randy  
Arnett of A&AMP;B Precision, B&AMP;J's longest competitor. ``It has more to 
do with math, geometrical shapes, than verbiage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been a decent competitor,'' Arnett said of  
Thiessens. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Thiessens was invited to join a local chapter of  
The Executive Committee, a kind of CEO-support group where 
non-competing chief executives discuss business trials and 
tribulations in confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiessens was reluctant.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was concerned he wouldn't measure up to the rest of the  
group,'' said Randy Yost, committee chairman and former CEO of 
Placer Bank of Commerce in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 6 months after we met he told me he had a reading  
problem,'' Yost said. ``At that time, he was very tight-vested 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thiessens confessed to the rest of the group last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was a little teary. His voice was shaking,'' recalled Doug  
Damon, a group member and CEO of Damon Industries, a beverage 
concentrate manufacturer. ``It was clearly a difficult thing for 
him to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damon was surprised by Thiessens confession. ``I knew he was a  
high school graduate, and so I guess I automatically assumed he 
knew how to read. He'd been very successful in his business. Who 
would have thought?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thiessens feared titters and jeers from his college-educated CEO  
peers. Instead, he was overwhelmed by support. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I respected him for what he accomplished, it  
enhanced my respect for him,'' Yost said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, Thiessens found a tutor to instruct him for an  
hour a day, five days a week. That's also when he told his plant 
managers. The rest of his employees found out last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiessens recently read ``Gung Ho,'' a book on employee  
relations, as a management team project. It was slow going as he 
underlined all the words he didn't know and later sought help with. 
But he finished it. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants someday to be able to rifle through mail as quickly as  
his wife and ``round file'' the piles of junk mail that comes 
across his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, he hopes his story will encourage others to  
learn to read. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no shame in not knowing how to read,'' said Mrs.  
Thiessens, his wife of 37 years. ``The shame is not doing anything 
about it.''

<HEADLINE> Mavericks May Have Exceeded Cap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Did the Dallas Mavericks exceed the NBA salary cap  
by showing Gary Trent the royal treatment? 
</P>
<P>
	That's what the NBA is investigating, according to league  
spokesman Chris Brienza. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA told The Associated Press on Tuesday it is investigating  
whether Dallas should be held liable for salary-cap violations 
because Don Nelson, coach and general manager of the Mavericks, 
arranged for Trent, his fiance, their infant son, Trent's parents 
and his fiancee's mother to spend a week at his Maui, Hawaii 
vacation home last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The team could be be fined if found guilty of the offense.  
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said he hoped the vacation would serve as a goodwill  
gesture to the 6-foot-8, 250-pound forward whom the Mavericks are 
aggressively trying to re-sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent averaged 16 points and 7.8 rebounds per game this season  
and finished third in the balloting for the league's Most Improved 
Player award. His salary this season was $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson has not been bashful in efforts to persuade Trent to  
remain in Dallas. But the Mavericks can't exceed the salary cap to 
re-sign him and so are limited to paying Trent no more than $5 
million over the next two years. A team can exceed the salary cap 
in resigning a player only if he has been on the roster three or 
more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everything, all the little things we do, helps the big  
picture,'' Nelson told The Dallas Morning News in Tuesday's 
editions. ``Like I said before, we just want to rub his belly a 
little bit and show him a good time. But we have to be careful how 
we approach things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The didn't say when a decision would be handed down.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Ban Abortion Pills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted for the second year in a row  
to forbid the government to test, develop or approve 
abortion-inducing drugs like the French RU-486 pill. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 217-214 vote Tuesday was a victory for House  
abortion foes, the bill's chances for becoming law this year appear 
dim. When the House voted a year ago for the same prohibition, the 
more moderate Senate did not approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something terribly wrong'' when the Food and Drug  
Administration uses taxpayers' dollars for ``drugs that are 
designed to kill unborn children,'' said sponsor Rep. Tom Coburn, 
R-Okla., during the sometimes emotional debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another baby pesticide that kills babies,'' said Rep.  
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., a leading antiabortion lawmaker. ``Come 
up with drugs that heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argued that the restriction was another attempt to  
limit abortion rights. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mich. Mulls Concert Warning Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- State Sen. Dale Shugars wasn't satisfied  
simply to hear about the antics of shock rockers like Marilyn 
Manson. He had to see them for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	So in April, Shugars headed off to a Manson concert in Grand  
Rapids, taking along two bodyguards. He was marveling at the light 
show when Manson appeared, strapped to a cross and wearing a black 
G-string. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was like Satan,'' said Shugars, a 46-year-old Republican  
whose own musical tastes run toward the Beach Boys. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience prompted Shugars to lobby even harder for a bill  
he sponsored that would require parental advisories on tickets, 
posters and other advertising for certain concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure passed the state Senate last month and is now before  
a House committee. If it passes the full House, it will be the 
first law of its kind in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that a lot of times parents weren't aware of what the  
lyrics are, lyrics about drug abuse, raping and killing,'' Shugars 
said. ``Does this guarantee that parents won't let their kids go to 
these concerts? No. But it does guarantee a red flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those fighting the bill claim that red flag is useless at best  
and unconstitutional at worst. 
</P>
<P>
	The group that got parental warning labels put on albums, the  
Recording Industry Association of America, opposes the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a draconian measure that we feel could undermine a  
program that's working,'' said Joel Flatow, RIAA vice president of 
government affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, concert promoters or venue operators would have  
to put warning labels on tickets, posters or advertisements for any 
artist who has put out an album with a parental advisory label in 
the past five years. Record companies voluntarily place the 
warnings on their albums as part of the RIAA program, which began 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would let promoters or venues choose to put the label  
on only one form of advertisement -- for example, only the concert 
posters or only the tickets. If they fail to put the warning on any 
of their promotional materials, they could be fined up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticketmaster, the ticket-sales giant, opposes the law as  
cumbersome, while Detroit entertainment attorney Mike Novak called 
the bill a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many bands will seek out this kind of labeling to make them  
more appealing to certain audiences,'' Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Wey, a 17-year-old Manson fan from East Lansing, said  
Manson's lyrics are misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these bands that they're trying to target aren't  
really that violent at all,'' he said. ``Marilyn Manson is opposed 
to violence. I think the whole point of his music is trying to be 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shugars said he doesn't buy the argument that music doesn't  
affect behavior: ``If we do know that Frank Sinatra makes you feel 
romantic, then this music will make you feel violent.''

<HEADLINE> Dole: Milosevic Should Be Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth  
Dole said today that NATO troops should arrest President Slobodan 
Milosevic to face his international indictment on war crimes. ``The 
next person who talks to him should be the one who arrests him,'' 
she said, taking a hard line on bringing the Yugoslav leader to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Mrs. Dole said her  
husband, the 1996 GOP presidential nominee, has a growing role in 
her presidential bid. After deciding to ``go solo'' early in the 
campaign, Mrs. Dole is asking the former Senate majority leader to 
help raise badly needed money. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never did it for himself. He just doesn't want to ask  
anybody for money. But you want to know something? He's doing it 
for me,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``He's on the phone asking for money and 
he's also going to be doing some fund-raisers between now and the 
end of the month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there were a Dole administration, she said Bob Dole would  
bring respect and experience to the White House and would be 
particularly suited to handle agriculture issues. But there will be 
no Cabinet post, no ``two for the price of one'' that supporters of 
Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton promised in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be a co-presidency,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, 62, who plans to formally announce her candidacy in  
the late summer or fall, is trying to become the first American 
woman to win a major party nomination. The former American Red 
Cross president and two-time Cabinet secretary ranks second in GOP 
polls, well behind front-runner George W. Bush but ahead of 
Democratic hopeful Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of her support comes from women eager to see a female  
succeed in politics or who think Mrs. Dole can relate to their 
hectic lives inside and outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
	In one recent poll, Dole's female supporters outnumbered men  
3-to-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most of the women who are involved today in trying to  
be the supermom or the super-executive and all the rest would 
acknowledge that `Yeah, I have had to make some sacrifices. I don't 
have the time I need for all these areas,''' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	But she does does not think the government programs -- such as  
the Family and Medical Leave Act -- are the solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women make different choices. There's not one mold for  
everyone,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying ``my path was a different one,'' Mrs. Dole commended  
women who choose not to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who decide to stay at home and raise a family of  
outstanding future citizens ... I want those women to be honored, 
too,'' she said. ``We don't give them credit as a society the way 
we really should. I want them to feel like they've got a choice. 
That that's just fine to do that. '' 
</P>
<P>
	She and her husband didn't have children so they dedicated  
themselves to public service, Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Announced that pollster Tony Fabrizio would be her top  
strategist, replacing Kieran Mahoney who departed in an early staff 
shakeup. 
</P>
<P>
	--Defended her record at the Red Cross, which has been the  
subject of a critical review by the KPMG Peat Marwick auditing 
firm. ``It is really one of the most far reaching contributions 
that I have had the opportunity to make in 30 plus years of service 
to the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Supported a move to raise the maximum individual presidential  
donation from $1,000, saying it takes too much time to raise money 
in such small increments. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said her husband was never really ``in the woodshed'' -- a  
phrase she coined after Dole raised questions about her campaign 
and suggested that he might donate money to an old friend from the 
Senate, presidential candidate John McCain of Arizona. ``Humor was 
the best way to handle that because the interpretation was so 
totally different than what he intended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to expand her gun control positions, declining to say  
whether she supported limiting the purchase of hand guns to one per 
month and requiring registration of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Yugoslavia remarks came as the United States, Russia and six  
other nations agreed on a draft U.N. resolution that could settle 
the conflict over Kosovo. And the Pentagon announced signs that 
Serb forces were preparing to withdraw from the Yugoslav province. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, who visited refugee camps early in the crisis, said,  
``I hope this agreement will go through. I hope that the people of 
Serbia would want to honor this agreement if indeed (Milosevic) is 
no longer there but I can't speak to what happens next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I frankly have found it difficult to consider how you  
negotiate with a war criminal,'' she said. Milosevic was indicted 
by a U.N. tribunal on May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just label him and do nothing about it, it doesn't mean  
anything. I think he needs to be apprehended and NATO is the right 
force to do it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole and McCain have been alone in the GOP fold advocating the  
toughest action against Milosevic, giving both their campaigns much 
needed attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole and spokesman Ari Fleischer said later that she wasn't  
implying that a massive NATO force sweep into Belgrade. Fleischer 
said there is historic precedent for a small, specially trained 
commandoes apprehending war criminals and terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Pine Tree Pollen Coats the Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It's yellow, it's dusty and it's everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
	Bursts of pollen have formed a thick coating on virtually  
everything in the Northeast -- from cars to patio furniture to 
window sills. 
</P>
<P>
	But while allergy sufferers can blame mold and grass pollen for  
their sneezes and coughs, everyone else can curse the ubiquitous 
white pine for discoloring their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
	The white pine, so named for the light hue of its wood, is the  
dominant variety of pine from Maine to the mid-Atlantic, and west 
to the Great Lakes region. 
</P>
<P>
	At the moment in the Northeast, the tree is at the height of its  
pollination season, the annual two- to three-week dance that 
ultimately will yield the following year's pine cone crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it has been this bad, but not in the last few years  
memory,'' said John O'Keefe, coordinator of the Fisher Museum of 
Forestry in Petersham. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many things in nature, heavy pollen seasons are cyclic,  
worsening every three to five years or so. This year's blast of 
pine pollen has been exacerbated by the dry weather. Rain washes 
pollen away. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain, however, doesn't seem to do much for removing the  
greenish-yellow film from vehicles. Wetness turns the dust into a 
sticky goo that windshield wipers just seem to smear. 
</P>
<P>
	The only remedy? A high-powered car wash.  
</P>
<P>
	Mike St. Pierre of Gentle Touch Car Wash in Nashua, N.H., said  
that before pollen season his shop washed an average of 125 cars a 
day. These days, they're doing up to 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Business also has more than doubled at the Lechmere Autowash  
Center in the Boston suburb of Somerville. The shop cleaned more 
than 2,000 cars this weekend alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in business for 30 years and this has been one of  
the worst for pollen. In translation, it's one of the best for 
us,'' said owner Vicki Previte. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Vaquez, 31, of Boston, spent part of Monday scrubbing her  
green 1985 Chrysler Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just washed this car two days ago and it's dirty again,''  
she sighed. ``I don't know what it is, but it's sickening and makes 
your car look horrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners have resorted to dust rags and polishers to clear the  
film off computers, television screens, book shelves -- anything 
near an open window. The pollen even squeezes through window mesh. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the majority of allergy sufferers are immune to white  
pine pollen, said Dr. James MacLean, an allergist at Massachusetts 
General Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Heat Sends Workers Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Much of the East baked in a second day of  
August-like heat today, with states sending workers home early and 
utilities warning they might not be able to keep air conditioners 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	The thermometer registered a record-tying 97 by early afternoon  
at Newark, N.J., and a record-breaking 96 at Raleigh-Durham, N.C. 
Washington sizzled at 98, and Philadelphia quickly reached a record 
95. It also was 95 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hot,'' said Yeshu Woldemichael, who sells drinks and  
snacks at a stand in downtown Washington. ``I drank all of my 
profit today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even in usually temperate New Hampshire, air conditioners were  
sold out. A Sears in Concord, N.H., ran out, and customers stood in 
the aisles waiting for the next truck delivery until they were told 
it was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Because this heat wave came so early in June -- two weeks before  
the start of summer -- some time-honored methods of cooling off 
didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Philadelphia teen-agers hoped to cool off in a Center  
City fountain, but the city hadn't turned it on yet. They ran 
through a nearby flower bed sprinkler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went through three times. It was fun. But the last time it  
burned my eyes, because it has plant food in it,'' said Joe Werner, 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for electricity was so high that the company that  
oversees the New England power grid asked all six of the region's 
governors to send nonessential employees home so their lights, 
computers and air conditioners could be turned off. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the red ``Exit'' signs were left turned on in corridors of  
the New Hampshire Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The request was necessary to avoid two-hour rolling blackouts,  
said Jim Sinclair, spokesman for ISO New England, the corporation 
responsible for bulk power transmission in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools closed early around Virginia because many buildings have  
no air conditioning. The elderly were given free fans. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the city housing authority opened fire hydrants  
to provide gushing street showers at 10 housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief from the heat, haze and humidity was expected to arrive  
by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While antiperspirants failed in the East, people in the West  
reached for their blankets. 
</P>
<P>
	Eureka, Calif., dipped to a low of 40, only the third time it's  
been that chilly there in June since 1887. And Klamath Falls, Ore., 
chilled to a record 25 degrees.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Paper Sold to Indiana Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONGVIEW, Wash. (AP) -- The Daily News of Longview, Wash., has  
been sold to a privately held newspaper group based in Indiana, 
ending 76 years of ownership by the McClelland-Natt family. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale to Howard Publications Inc., originally expected to  
close in January, also included three local weekly newspapers owned 
by Westmedia Corp., the parent organization of The Daily News. 
Terms of the sale were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	With the purchase, Howard now owns 16 small- to medium-sized  
dailies, although mostly in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Daily News publisher Ted Natt other family members had owned 69  
percent of Westmedia, with employees owning the remaining 31 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard may start a Sunday edition of the Daily News and will  
consider switching it to a morning publication, said Bill Howard, 
vice president of newspapers for Howard and publisher of a Howard 
paper in Munster, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said it was not certain what will happen to the three  
weeklies -- the Columbia County Review, Lewis River News and Kalama 
Bulletin and Cowlitz County Advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new publisher of the Daily News will be Peter York, 49, a  
native of Portland, Ore., who has been advertising director for the 
Howard-owned Twin Falls Times-News in Idaho for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Ted Natt will continue to write Views of the News, a  
front-page commentary, for the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Cable &AMP; Wireless Set To Win Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC came closer to acquiring a  
controlling stake in a major Japanese telecommunications company 
after Toyota Motor Corp. said Thursday it would sell its shares to 
the London-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone Corp., which had also been  
bidding for a stake in Tokyo-based International Digital 
Communications Inc., has reportedly given up hope of outbidding 
Cable &AMP; Wireless. 
</P>
<P>
	NTT said in a press release Tuesday it has told Toyota and  
another major IDC shareholder, Itochu Corp., about its decision to 
stand firm on its offer, citing time constraints. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Toyota indicated its willingness to sell its 17.7  
percent stake in IDC to Cable &AMP; Wireless unless NTT, Japan's 
largest telecommunications company, raised its offer price again. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota decided to accept Cable &AMP; Wireless' offer to pay $929 per  
share for IDC shares owned by Toyota -- valued at roughly $101 
million -- after NTT failed to make a new bid, said Toyota 
spokeswoman Hino Yamada. 
</P>
<P>
	Itochu, which also holds a 17.7 percent stake, said it would  
make a decision on Cable &AMP; Wireless' offer on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable &AMP; Wireless also currently holds a 17.7 percent stake in  
IDC, one of Japan's largest international phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media reports have said IDC executives had viewed Cable  
&AMP; Wireless' unsolicited takeover bid as hostile, raising the 
possibility they might try to resist. 
</P>
<P>
	But headlines in major newspapers Wednesday said the British  
company may now have won out.

<HEADLINE> Cable &AMP; Wireless Win IDC Bid War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC won a bidding war for a major  
Japanese telecommunications company Wednesday after two leading 
shareholders said they would sell their shares to the London-based 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable &AMP; Wireless' acquisition of shares in Tokyo-based  
International Digital Communications Inc. will make it the first 
foreign company to own a controlling stake in a Japanese 
telecommunications firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone  
Corp., which had also been bidding for a stake in IDC, gave up hope 
of outbidding Cable &AMP; Wireless. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. and Itochu Corp., which each own 17.7 percent  
of IDC, announced Wednesday they would accept Cable &AMP; Wireless' 
offer to pay $929 per share, or about $101 million, for their stake 
after NTT failed to make a new bid. 
</P>
<P>
	NTT said in a press release Tuesday it had told Toyota and  
Itochu it was going to stand firm on its offer of $916 a share, 
citing time constraints. 
</P>
<P>
	Itochu spokesman Yoshiharu Matsumoto said his company's decision  
was based on economic considerations stemming from the value of 
Cable &AMP; Wireless' offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable &AMP; Wireless' bids places IDC's value at about $580 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Cable &AMP; Wireless, which also holds a 17.7 percent stake in IDC,  
is one of Japan's largest international phone companies.

<HEADLINE> Court Tosses Secret Jury Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An appeals court dismissed a news media  
challenge to secrecy orders in the Unabomber case that protected 
jurors' names and some legal filings until trial proceedings ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that there  
was no need to decide whether the trial judge's orders were legal 
because they were lifted after defendant Theodore Kaczynski pleaded 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Charity Kenyon, lawyer for the Unabom Trial Media Coalition,  
said she was relieved that the court declared the case moot, 
without setting standards for future cases that could have 
broadened judges' power to impose secrecy in high-profile trials. 
When the appeals court heard the case last year, judges on the 
panel seemed more impressed with the need for security and secrecy 
than public disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition's challenge stemmed from an October 1997 order by  
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell which kept prospective jurors' 
names and other identifying information withheld. Burrell said 
jurors could otherwise face unwanted attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The order was backed by both prosecution and defense lawyers.  
</P>
<P>
	Jurors' names were released after Kaczynski pleaded guilty in  
January 1998 to bombings that killed three people and injured 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides keeping the jury anonymous, Burrell sealed records that  
contained statements by Kaczynski about other bombings, and a 
defense motion about the specifics of a proposed mental-state 
defense. Those records were also released after the guilty pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Unabom Trial Media Coalition is made up of The Associated  
Press, four newspapers and several radio and TV stations that 
covered Kaczynski's trial.

<HEADLINE> Marino Likely To Sign Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Dan Marino will likely sign a two-year contract  
extension with the Miami Dolphins before the week is out, his agent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say it's probable,'' Marvin Demoff told The Miami  
Herald on Tuesday. ``I'd like to get it done. ... I'm going on 
vacation for two weeks next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The long-discussed deal is likely to include a signing bonus of  
about $6.4 million and is meant to create salary cap space for the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino's contract, which is entering its final season, calls for  
a cap value of a little more than $7.14 million. Because of NFL 
rules limiting the amount the Dolphins can decrease Marino's 
contract, the team must give Marino a signing bonus of $6.4 million 
or offer other guarantees that he'll receive that amount when he 
signs the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Wiedmeier, the team's vice president of administration who  
is negotiating the deal, declined to comment Tuesday. Dolphins 
coach Jimmy Johnson and director of football operations Bob Ackles 
are both on vacation and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, who will turn 38 in September, has said he would like to  
play until he's at least 40. He said in April he expected to sign 
the deal soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been talking about it for months, and everybody knows  
about it,'' Demoff said. ``Dan isn't going anywhere else.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs Master the Waiting Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- David Robinson isn't worried about having  
more than a week off before the NBA Finals. He's getting used to 
these layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to take a couple of days and get our minds  
right, get our bodies right and get ready to go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Spurs won their first trip to the championship  
round by sweeping the Portland Trail Blazers in the Western 
Conference finals with a 94-80 victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Now San Antonio awaits the outcome of the Eastern Conference  
finals, with Indiana and New York tied 2-2. The NBA Finals begin 
June 16 at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs spent an extra night in Portland because their plane  
had mechanical trouble. When they arrived home Monday aboard their 
charter, a crowd of 3,500 fans greeted them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been part of the Spurs family for 26 years,'' coach  
Gregg Popovich said. ``It's just a thrill to be able to give this 
to them. I couldn't be happier for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs came to San Antonio from Dallas as part of the ABA  
before the 1973-74 season. It's the only major league sports team 
in town. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually not one for playoff pomp, Popovich couldn't help but  
delight over the airport party. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get all these people out here, if you don't feel that  
in your veins you're pretty much a dead person,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich didn't schedule practices for Monday or Tuesday.  
Workouts resume Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gym's locked,'' Popovich said. ``We don't want to see them  
on the court. We just want them to mentally and physically just 
restore themselves a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rust does not seem to be a big concern for the Spurs, especially  
for veterans like Robinson who are glad to have some time off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's played well for us so far,'' said Robinson, pointing out  
the Spurs had a few days off between each playoff series this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have swept their last two rounds 4-0 and have won 10  
straight playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the first round we had a nice little rest then we came  
back pretty fresh. Five days, after the second round. But I think 
we'll do the same this time,'' Robinson said. ``We'll be ready to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The time off also gives point guard Avery Johnson's left knee a  
chance to heal. He bruised it late in the first half of Sunday's 
game after he slipped on a wet spot. But Johnson came back to play 
most of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich said there is nothing structurally wrong and the bruise  
will ease. After arriving from Portland, Johnson sounded ready to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to practice even harder,'' he said. ``We've still got  
one more goal.''

	NATO, Yugoslav Generals Meet  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes attacked targets  
across Serbia in a warning to President Slobodan Milosevic to 
implement a Kosovo peace plan, as key Western and Yugoslav generals 
gathered to finalize details for withdrawing troops. The meeting 
came after the eight major powers signed off on a text to secure a 
U.N. blessing for the deal. The United States, Russia and six 
leading democracies authorized a text calling for a peacekeeping 
force for Kosovo with ``substantial'' NATO participation and agreed 
on a NATO bombing pause -- once Serb forces began a verifiable 
withdrawal. 

</P>
<P>
	Serbs May Be Set To Leave Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. intelligence has detected signs that Serb  
forces are preparing to withdraw from Kosovo, although no troops 
are moving or assembling for a pullout, the Pentagon said today. 
Spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the signs include the mobilization of 
Serb transport vehicles that would be used to move soldiers out. 
Bacon also disclosed details on U.S. planning for the NATO-led 
peacekeeping force. Some 1,900 Marines from the 26th Marine 
Expeditionary Unit now aboard ships in the Aegean Sea would serve 
as the vanguard of U.S. peacekeepers.

	NYC Cop Guilty in Torture Case  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A policeman was convicted today of holding down  
a Haitian immigrant in a stationhouse bathroom while another 
officer sodomized him with a broomstick. Three other officers were 
acquitted. The verdict came two weeks after Officer Justin Volpe -- 
the central figure in the trial -- pleaded guilty to torturing Abner 
Louima with the stick. Officer Charles Schwarz, 33, sat impassively 
as the jury convicted him of violating Louima's civil rights. He 
and Volpe could get life in prison.

	Heat Sends Workers Home  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Utilities warned today that they might not be  
able to keep air conditioners running as much of the East baked in 
record-breaking heat for the second day. The thermometer registered 
a record-breaking 96 at Raleigh-Durham, N.C. Washington sizzled at 
98, and Philadelphia quickly reached a record 95. It was 95 in New 
York. The company that oversees the New England power grid asked 
the region's governors to send employees home so electricity could 
be turned off. The request was necessary to avoid rolling 
blackouts, a spokesman said. 

</P>
<P>
	Group Seeks Ban on Jail Stun Belts  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal and state prisons are increasingly  
relying on stun belts that can deliver 50,000 volts of electricity 
to subdue prisoners, according to Amnesty International. The U.S. 
Marshals Service, the federal Bureau of Prisons and at least 20 
state prison systems have authorized use of stun belts, although 
the extent of their use in some of those states isn't clear, the 
human rights group said today. Amnesty International plans a 
worldwide print and TV advertising campaign next month calling for 
a ban on the belts.

	Hormone Benefits May Outweigh Risks  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A study of 37,000 women found that taking  
hormones after menopause does not increase the risk of breast 
cancer, except for forms of the disease that are slow-growing and 
very treatable. Researchers said the findings are good news because 
they add to evidence that the benefits of hormones outweigh any 
increased cancer risk. Millions of women take hormones to ease the 
symptoms of menopause. Previous studies have indicated that women 
who take hormones -- specifically estrogen -- after menopause are 
more likely to develop breast cancer.

	Boston Office Rents Most Expensive  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Forget about New York and San Francisco: the U.S.  
city with the most expensive office space is Boston, according to a 
new survey. Average rents for Boston's Class A office buildings 
were $47.93 per square foot during the first quarter of 1999, the 
nationwide commercial real estate company Cushman &AMP; Wakefield 
found. That's 15 cents more than the $47.78 price per square foot 
in midtown Manhattan. San Francisco has the third-most expensive 
office space at $46.08 per square foot.

<HEADLINE> Pretrial Rulings Made in Intel Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that Intel  
Corp. had no license to use Intergraph patented technology in its 
Pentium family of processors, rejecting Intel's argument that the 
patents were included in an old agreement with National 
Semiconductor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The pretrial ruling by U.S. District Judge Edwin Nelson was an  
early blow for Intel in its defense against a lawsuit brought by 
Intergraph of Huntsville, a workstation manufacturer, in November 
1997. Intergraph contends Intel, which makes computer chips, 
infringed on its patents, used coercive business practices and 
violated antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson's ruling addressed only Intel's claim of a licensing  
agreement governing the Intergraph patents. The allegations of 
patent infringement, antitrust violations and illegal practices 
will be addressed at a trial in February 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Intergraph, Bill Baxley of Birmingham, did not  
immediately return a call seeking comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the news release, Intergraph Chairman and Chief Executive Jim  
Meadlock said Intel repeatedly has claimed they have a license to 
the ``Clipper'' chip patents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court affirms they don't have such a license,'' Meadlock  
said. ``We believe the entire Pentium family infringes on our 
patents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Intel, Chuck Mulloy, said Monday an appeal of  
Nelson's order was being considered. But the license claim was only 
one of several defenses Intel planned to raise in the lawsuit, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed and we respectfully disagree with the  
judge,'' Mulloy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intergraph makes computer workstations mated to its software,  
with the core of its business involving elaborate computer graphics 
for technical design, mapping and animation. For a time, Intergraph 
used its own high-end microprocessor, the ``Clipper,'' in its 
workstations but later moved to an Intel-based system and abandoned 
the Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	Intergraph claims when it tried to enforce the Clipper patent,  
Intel denied the company technical information and advance copies 
of new microchips -- both crucial to developing new products. 
Intergraph also contends Intel chips were made using Intergraph 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel claims it did nothing illegal. In the motion denied by  
Nelson, the chipmaker claimed the Clipper technology fell under a 
long-standing cross-license agreement with NSC. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Intergraph news release, Intergraph and NSC  
each bought parts of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. in concurrent 
transactions in 1987. Intergraph bought Fairchild's Advanced 
Processor Division, the original developer of the Clipper chip, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The undisputed facts establish that NSC had no legal authority  
to grant a license, as the patents at issue belonged not to NSC but 
to a legally distinct corporation -- Fairchild,'' Nelson wrote in 
his order. ``Intel thus never received a license from any entity 
with the power to grant one. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamental flaw in Intel's license defense is that the  
alleged license would have originated from NSC, while the Clipper 
patents quite clearly belonged not to NSC but to Fairchild, a 
separate corporation,'' Nelson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulloy said the judge's ruling had ``very broad and  
unprecedented implications'' for the high-tech industry.

<HEADLINE> School Buses Found Safer Than Vans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- School districts might save money using vans  
instead of school buses to transport students, but it's ``an 
economical advantage purchased at the safety of children,'' the 
head of a federal safety panel said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrapping up a special investigation into four crashes involving  
``nonconforming buses,'' Jim Hall, chairman of the National 
Transportation Safety Board, said the standard yellow bus provides 
better crash protection than vans and should be the only type of 
vehicle used to take students to school and school-related 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The crashes that were the subject of the investigation occurred  
in 1998 and earlier this year in Sweetwater, Fla., Lenoir City, 
Tenn., East Dublin, Ga., and Bennettsville, S.C. They killed nine 
people, including eight students. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the vehicle damage would have been less and  
the injuries not as severe had the accidents involved school buses, 
not a van or a ``specialty bus'' -- a slightly larger vehicle akin 
to an airport rental car shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	School buses, unlike standard passenger vans, have special  
rollover protections and encase their occupants in a cocoon of 
padded seats and seatbacks. They also have welds designed to keep 
them from splitting open on impact. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, school buses are painted an eye-catching yellow and  
equipped with emergency exits, special warning lights and movable 
arms that block students from walking directly in front of them. 
Many of the protections date from a 1977 change in federal law, 
which was prompted by earlier recommendations from the safety 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``nonconforming bus'' is any vehicle that can carry 10 or more  
people and is used to take students to school or school-related 
activities, yet does not meet federal school bus standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits car dealers from selling vehicles that do  
not meet federal school bus regulations to schools that plan to use 
them to transport children. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many states have exemptions in their school bus laws  
for after-school, day care or church programs. Even the federal 
government has lagged in developing rules for transporting children 
involved in such things as Head Start, the early-childhood 
education program. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst accident examined by the safety board occurred on Feb.  
16 in Bennettsville, S.C. Six children were killed -- including 
three who were thrown outside the vehicle -- when the 15-passenger 
van they were riding in was struck by a tow truck. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 26, 1998, a 25-passenger speciality bus taking students  
home after an academic competition was rammed by a tractor-trailer 
in Lenoir City, Tenn., when the van's driver attempted a U-turn on 
a highway. A teacher and a student were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The East Dublin, Ga., accident occurred on Dec. 8, 1998, when a  
15-person van taking children to a Head Start program collided with 
a pickup truck. One child was ejected and killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 15-person van was involved in the Sweetwater, Fla.,  
accident, when it was struck by a transit bus at an intersection on 
March 25, 1998. Three children were ejected and suffered head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-member board only has the power to make safety  
recommendations, not rules. In a unanimous vote, the board urged 
the nation's governors to ensure that students are transported only 
in vehicles meeting the school bus standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also urged the Department of Health and Human Services  
to extend the same protection to children participating in Head 
Start. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government needs to practice what it preaches and  
it needs to start with Head Start,'' Hall said.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Rice Philosophical of Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry Rice took a long, hard look at  
himself during the offseason. He didn't particularly like what he 
saw. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's leading career receiver came back from two devastating  
knee injuries to earn his 12th Pro Bowl invitation last season. But 
he conceded the comeback campaign with the San Francisco 49ers was 
tainted by complaints over his reduced role and the perception of 
selfishness they generated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, who joined the 49ers on Tuesday for the opening of a  
four-day, full-squad minicamp, said he knows he's in the twilight 
of his career. He said his main concern now is getting the most out 
of time he has left rather than spend time worrying about whether 
he can maintain his place in the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it's coming to an end, and I don't want to go out on  
a sour note,'' the 36-year-old Rice said. ``I want to go out 
feeling good about my career, enjoying the game of football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if this would be his last season, Rice laughed and said,  
``No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not saying that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice missed most of the 1997 season with knee injuries. He came  
back strong last year, but had trouble adjusting to the notion he 
was no longer the 49ers' offensive focal point. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice, he complained publicly about his lack of involvement in  
the offense, including a memorable shouting match with coach Steve 
Mariucci that was captured by television cameras. He also had a 
harsh exchange with a reporter who suggested in a column that the 
49ers might be better off by trading him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice conceded he didn't handle himself well.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was not happy about what was going on with me, how I was  
dealing with the situation,'' Rice said. ``I said to myself that 
I've got to completely turn this thing around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be able to carry this team like I used to. I  
just want to go in there and try to be a factor, just try to help 
the young guys as much as possible and just enjoy. I'm not going to 
say I'm going to get too relaxed. When my number is called, I want 
to make the play and get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After so many years as the offensive focal point, Rice said it's  
tough accepting a reduced role. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's time for me to just kick back and enjoy this game,''  
Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also came to the realization that he had little choice.  
Owens, who led the team with 14 touchdown catches in 1998, and 
Stokes have developed into important playmakers in their own right 
and with running back Garrison Hearst also in the mix, San 
Francisco's offense operates best when Steve Young spreads the ball 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	That point was driven home even more when the 49ers kept both  
potential free agents, re-signing Stokes in March and designating 
Owens as a franchise player, effectively limiting his free agency 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, Owens signed his $3.5 million tender offer for this  
season with the expectation the two sides will work out a long-term 
deal in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for Terrell, to have that behind him, it's a relief,''  
coach Steve Mariucci said. ``The talks on a long-term deal are 
still going and that should get done. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to see not just Terrell, but the Three Amigos,  
Jerry, J.J. and Terrell. You line up with those three guys across 
the board, that's exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That image also helped foster a new philosophical approach by  
Rice after watching David Robinson accept a change in his role with 
the emergence of Tim Duncan as the San Antonio Spurs' chief 
offensive option. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to step away, but I've just got to let go,'' Rice  
said. ``I look at it just like David Robinson, the role he has 
taken now. I think he's dealing with that situation very, very well 
and for him to be able to step back like that, it really showed me 
a lot. Well, that's my role now and that's exactly how I'm going to 
approach it.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Sues Over Frozen Embryos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A woman who says a medical school clinic ruined her  
20 frozen embryos and her last chance at having a baby has sued the 
University of Miami for negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was my future, you know, and they took that chance away  
from me,'' Wandy Scriven said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Scriven, 35, a diabetic since her teens, had a transplant  
after one of her kidneys failed. She said medicine she takes to 
prevent her body from rejecting her kidney is considered dangerous 
to women trying to become pregnant, so she is unable to harvest 
more eggs for in vitro fertilization. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Monday by Mrs. Scriven and her husband, does not  
seek a specific award. But the couple's attorney said compensation 
for emotional distress should be in excess of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The university admitted that the freezer keeping the embryos  
preserved had failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is devastating to us,'' spokesman Christopher Dudley  
said. ``Our patients' welfare is our primary concern. We're just 
trying to figure out why it happened.''

<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The Miss America Pageant is giving  
rival casino moguls Donald Trump and Steve Wynn a chance to play 
nice. 
</P>
<P>
	The pageant's parade committee has invited the feuding casino  
rivals to serve as co-grand marshals of the Sept. 17 Miss America 
parade -- a pageant fixture in which contestants ride down the 
Boardwalk in open convertibles. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither has responded to the invitation yet, parade committee  
chairman James J. Lees said Tuesday. ``They are, in their own 
right, personalities, and that's why I asked them,'' Lees said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lees said a committee member suggested the idea and others  
endorsed it. Trump is a co-owner of the Miss Universe pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the recent spats between the two moguls, Wynn's Mirage  
Resorts Inc. sued Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. in April 
over the alleged theft of trade secrets.

<HEADLINE> Texas OKs Abortion Notification Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A Texas bill requiring that parents be notified  
when their minor daughters seek abortions has been signed into law 
by Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law both respects families and protects life,'' Bush said  
Monday during a signing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, effective Sept. 1, an unmarried girl under age 18  
cannot get an abortion until one of her parents is notified or she 
gets a judge's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The law does not require the parent's consent.  
</P>
<P>
	Darla St. Martin, of the Washington, D.C.-based National Right  
to Life Committee, said abortion opponents have been pushing for a 
notification law for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a law ``helps establish a general pro-life attitude on the  
part of people in the state,'' Ms. St. Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who is on the verge of beginning travels around the United  
States to push a probable presidential bid, has been criticized by 
some in the anti-abortion movement as being soft on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Bush said he would back a constitutional amendment to  
outlaw most abortions if more voters supported it. But he said, 
``America is not ready to ban abortions.'' In the meantime, he 
said, officials should `promote policies that reduce them. The 
remarks drew criticism from some conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the parental notification law argued that it  
targets the most vulnerable girls and that pregnant minors -- 
fearful of having to tell their parents of their situation -- will 
instead opt for dangerous illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen what minors can do to themselves when they're in  
fear of telling a boyfriend, a parent, a grandparent or anybody 
else,'' said Democratic Sen. Mario Gallegos Jr., a former 
paramedic. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said the law will reduce the number of abortions in the  
state and ``involve parents in this major decision of their minor 
daughters.'' Of the 84,870 abortions reported in 1997 to the Texas 
Department of Health, about 5,500 were performed on minors.

<HEADLINE> Productivity Rises in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American workers increased their productivity  
in the first three months of this year at an annual rate of 3.5 
percent, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That figure -- in line with analysts' expectations -- was slightly  
lower than the government's initial estimate of 4 percent a month 
ago, and follows a downward revision of the quarter's gross 
domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the 3.5 percent increase represents a strong advance,  
better than the 2.2 percent advance for all of last year. And even 
the 2.2 percent annual figure represented an improvement from weak 
productivity growth over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the last four years, labor productivity has advanced at  
an annual rate of 2.1 percent. This is about twice as fast as 
witnessed in the proceeding twenty years,'' said Stan Shipley, an 
economist with Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity, the output per hour of work, is considered the key  
measurement for determining whether Americans' living standards 
will increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher productivity means employers can afford to pay workers  
more without raising the price of their products. That keeps 
inflation under control and means that workers' pay checks will go 
farther. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.5 percent productivity figure resulted from a downward  
revision of the gross domestic product, the total output of goods 
and services, to 4.1 percent from an initial estimate of 4.5 
percent in the first quarter. With less output for the same amount 
of hours worked, the productivity figure was revised down slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a key measurement of inflationary pressures was  
revised up slightly in Tuesday's report. Unit labor costs, the 
amount of compensation per unit of output, edged up 0.7 percent at 
an annual rate in the first quarter, compared to an original 
estimated increase of 0.3 percent. The 0.7 percent rise in unit 
labor costs followed an actual decline of 0.4 percent in the fourth 
quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the upward revision, an increase of just 0.7 percent in  
unit labor costs is considered a good sign that wage pressures are 
well contained, even as the nation's unemployment rate has returned 
to a 29-year low of just 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly suggests that there is no inflation disaster  
lurking around the corner,'' said Ian Shepherdson, economist for 
High Frequency Economics. ``It also suggests that there is no 
pressing reason for the Fed to raise interest rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the rise in unit labor cost was driven by a 2.6 percent  
rate of increase in wages for each hour of work. This first-quarter 
hourly compensation figure represented a slight acceleration from 
the 2.2 percent rate of increase for the last three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	And some analysts blamed this slight rise in hourly wages on a  
dearth of skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That indicates there is real labor shortages from sea to  
shining sea in America, and that is a new trend,'' said Wells Fargo 
and Co. economist Sung Won Sohn. ``The bottom line is that labor 
shortages are beginning to slow productivity growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economists are split on whether the Fed will begin raising  
interest rates when policy makers next meet at the end of this 
month. Many believe that if next week's report on consumer prices 
shows another worrisome jump in price pressures, then the Fed will 
be forced to act.

<HEADLINE> Another Clinton Adviser Resigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Janet Yellen, head of President Clinton's  
Council of Economic Advisers for the past two years, said today she 
is stepping down to return to the University of California, 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Martin Baily, a former council  
member, is likely to succeed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen said she took her decision for ``personal and family''  
reasons. Her husband, George Akerlof, also an economics professor 
at Berkeley, is returning to the school after a two-year leave of 
absence. Yellen said after five years in Washington she does not 
want to subject her family to more cross-country commuting. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, President Clinton said Yellen's ``extraordinary  
intellect and keen grasp of domestic and international economics 
have contributed enormously to the formation of my administration's 
policies in critical areas ranging from Social Security, health 
care and the budget to trade and international financial 
architecture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official speaking on condition of anonymity  
said Baily is the leading candidate to succeed Yellen. He was a 
member of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1995-96 and since 
then has been a partner in the Washington office of McKinsey &AMP; Co., 
a consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said that in an effort to persuade Yellen to remain  
in government service, the administration offered her the No. 2 job 
at the Federal Reserve, but Yellen declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Alice Rivlin, the Fed's current vice chairwoman, said last week  
she will leave the central bank next month after three years in 
order to devote more time to her duties as head of the District of 
Columbia financial control board. 
</P>
<P>
	While the administration has taken a year to fill another  
vacancy on the seven-member Federal Reserve board, National 
Economic Council Director Gene Sperling said Tuesday the search for 
Rivlin' replacement is ``well along. We are down to a very short 
list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen's and Rivlin's announcements followed the revelation last  
month by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that he is leaving, 
effective around July 4. Clinton has nominated Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers to replace Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen, who said she did not set a departure date because of her  
desire for a smooth transition, has headed the three-member Council 
of Economic Advisers since 1997. At the time, her appointment was 
seen as an administration effort to foster closer ties with the 
Fed, where Yellen was serving when Clinton chose her for the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the CEA is considered the president's chief  
economist, and the three economists on the council are used as the 
administration's in-house think tank on economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen was among Clinton's first two appointees to the Fed.  
Before joining the central bank, she was an economics professor at 
Berkeley, where she plans to rejoin the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen was Clinton's third council chief, after Laura Tyson,  
another Berkeley professor, and Joseph Stiglitz. Tyson has returned 
to Berkeley as dean of the business school, and Stiglitz is chief 
economist at the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen's departure would leave the Council of Economic Advisers  
with only one member, Rebecca M. Blank. Clinton has nominated 
Harvard professor Robert Lawrence to fill another vacancy, but the 
Senate has not confirmed him.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Stars Acquire Derek Plante </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars acquired Derek Plante at the  
trading deadline to put another potential scorer at the end of the 
bench during the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	What they ended up getting was someone with inside information.  
</P>
<P>
	Plante came to Dallas after 5 1/2 seasons in Buffalo. On Tuesday  
night, his new team and his old club played Game 1 of the Stanley 
Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know everybody on both teams,'' Plante said. ``It's pretty  
funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches and teammates have been picking Plante's brain since  
Dallas clinched the Western Conference title Friday night. The 
Stars only had four days to prepare for the Sabres, so they're 
looking for any edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have pretty good scouting reports and they've been  
watching the team, so they know what's going on,'' Plante said. 
``But sometimes they come and ask me a few questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game tapes show how players react to certain situations. Watch  
enough tapes and you can log their reactions to dozens of 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	But to really understand what makes a guy tick and to know how  
to play with his mind takes knowledge that can only come from being 
with him regularly -- places Plante was just three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabres coach Lindy Ruff dismisses that idea  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's much of a factor,'' Ruff said. ``I think  
he's going to have as much input as he possibly can, but if they 
look at tapes, they're going to see all our tendencies and all the 
things we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo drafted Plante in the seventh round in 1989, and he made  
the team in 1993-94. A former winner of the NHL's fastest-shot and 
fastest-skater contests, he scored 50 points in three of his first 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Back spasms limited him last year and his playing time was down  
this season, too. He finally was sent to the Stars for a 
second-round pick in this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of figured something was going to happen,'' Plante  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plante went from a team fighting for the last playoff spot to a  
team cruising to the NHL's best regular-season record for the 
second straight year. He thought going to Dallas was his best way 
of playing for the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But as of last Monday, the seventh-seeded Sabres were in the  
finals for the first time since 1975 and the top-seeded Stars were 
down 3-2 to Colorado in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Plante was happy for his former teammates. But he also was  
confident the Stars would be joining them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best team I've ever been on,'' Plante said.  
``Obviously, the team in Buffalo is pretty good, too, but they're a 
totally different team. They are younger and kind of building 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	Plante played six of the first 10 playoff games and his lone  
point was a big one: a third-period goal that tied Game 6 of the 
second round, leading to Mike Modano's series-winner in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Plante sat out in the conference finals, but he's likely to play  
this round, especially if Grant Marshall can't return from a groin 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars also may want to tap Plante's desire to beat his  
former team. It worked last round with Avalanche-ex Mike Keane, who 
scored two goals in the deciding game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never played against them, so I don't know what will  
happen,'' Plante said. ``They know me as well as I know them, I 
guess. So I don't know if it's an advantage or disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I can provide some offense, just add a spark and  
help the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plante says he enjoys playing his old teammates.  
</P>
<P>
	``You always play against your friends and you want to beat them  
more than anybody else,'' he said. ``You want to have bragging 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plante hasn't spoken to his former teammates since the playoffs  
began and he doesn't expect to until after this series. He's 
excited about going back to Buffalo and seeing his non-hockey 
friends, many of whom will be seeking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Plante said his phone hasn't been ringing too often yet.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has my number down here,'' he said, smiling.

<HEADLINE> World Libraries Grapple With CD-ROM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The domed conference room was filled with the  
world's foremost librarians, their voices hushed with the urgency 
of the difficulties they face. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a global problem -- touching on saving the record of  
civilization itself -- and no clear answers are in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Often more comfortable quoting 17th century authors than surfing  
the Internet, representatives from more than 35 libraries gathered 
to discuss how their institutions can keep up with an increasingly 
digital world. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of pressure,'' said Wim van Drimmelen, head of  
the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in the Netherlands, that country's 
national library. ``The students of today hardly know there are 
books. If they have to write an essay, they start surfing the 
Net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only a fraction of libraries have full-fledged plans for  
archiving digital material. And while businesses increase the 
amount of digital information, libraries -- and frazzled librarians 
-- are left trying to figure out how to handle it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unlike the field of chemistry just after the  
discovery of the molecule,'' said Richard Ekman, secretary of the 
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and keynote speaker at last week's 
Virtual Libraries summit at the New York Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
	``The characteristics of digital data are still not very well  
understood, and they're still changing. It may simply be too early 
to find answers,'' Ekman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ariane Iljon, a specialist in information technologies with the  
European Commission in Luxembourg, put it another way: ``The basic 
definitions we're dealing with,'' she said, ``have become vague.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a global environment, collections are scattered in numerous  
museums, archives and libraries. The technological age is proving 
too costly and fast moving for libraries to easily decide which 
hardware and software to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certain that the future of libraries lies in part in the  
digitized library,'' said Jean-Pierre Angremy, president of the 
Bibliotheque Nationale de France. ``But you cannot afford to 
digitize everything. We don't have the time or money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Dewey Decimal System and the proper temperature for  
storing fragile documents are well known, it's still unclear what 
software will be compatible with computers in future decades -- or 
centuries. And it's unclear, too, how to best store electronic data 
to avoid losing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take a piece of paper, it lasts 500 years. If you take  
a CD- ROM, it lasts 10 years. It's frightening,'' Angremy said. 
``There's a new type of CD-ROM, which might possibly last 100 
years, but it's very, very expensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Public Library President Paul LeClerc warned that,  
unless someone keeps pace, parts of contemporary civilization might 
be lost to future generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a historian in the year 2090 wants to retrieve information  
about this culture, this moment in history, the books just won't 
have it all,'' he said. ``We're used to preserving books, but whose 
responsibility is it to preserve all this digital material?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many libraries have their own projects under way. In France, the  
national library has digitized about 80,000 books at a cost of 
about $20 million, Angremy said. One purpose of the librarians' 
conference, he added, was to avoid overlaps in saving the past's 
treasures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are currently digitizing all the books from the 16th to the  
19th century on travel in France and Africa,'' he said. ``The 
Library of Congress is digitizing books on travel in America, and 
the Germans are digitizing a lot of travel books from around 
Europe.'' As a result, he said, ``there is a kind of universal 
virtual library on travel which is being constructed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the landscape of the libraries of the future, their  
holdings may well be more digital than in book form. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm convinced that the library down the road won't exist in  
the sense that it does today,'' Angremy said. ``Digitized books 
won't exist there. They will be in your home, on the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the traditional library, with its reverent quiet and  
book-lined shelves, will likely remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may not need to go there often, and you will do most of  
your research at home,'' he said. ``But there is always a point 
where you need to have the original.''

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Dairy Farms Disappearing / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Dairy farmer Marty Davis has fences in  
disrepair. He has barns that need new roofs. He works his 450 acres 
in Bedford County on a 1971 tractor with 12,000 hours on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's like a driving a car with half a million miles on it,''  
he said Tuesday. ``I don't have the funds to replace it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is among a dwindling number of Tennessee Grade-A dairy  
farmers clinging to their businesses in the face of stiff 
competition and fluctuating prices. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 dairy farms have shut down in the state since  
1997, according to the Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation. Now, just 
998 dairy farms produce Grade-A milk in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been feast and famine. We have good prices for a while,  
then the prices get low,'' Davis said of his 150-cow operation. 
``We hang on in hard times and try to catch up in the good times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee farmers are more vulnerable to competition because the  
majority have small farms, with 50 cows or fewer. The state imports 
a large amount of its milk from other states where mass producers 
can offer cheaper prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The large dairies can take advantage of the latest  
technology,'' said John Harrison, a Loudon County dairy farmer with 
about 850 cows. ``As the industry becomes more management and 
capital intensive, it becomes harder and harder for the Southeast 
to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Development in rural areas is another factor. Many farmers feel  
they can make more money by selling their land for subdivisions 
than by continuing to operate. Those who choose to continue farming 
have seen property taxes skyrocket as land prices rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Strasser, president of the Dairy Association of Tennessee,  
is Davidson County's only remaining dairy farmer, with an 80-cow 
operation directly across from the Opryland Hotel. He believes 
dairy farms are particularly vulnerable to this land pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes back to the '40s and '50s, when we didn't have good  
roads and refrigeration, so dairy farms had to be close to towns 
and cities,'' he said. ``When development came, what was the first 
thing in their way? The dairy farms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Bureau has established a task force to find ways to  
bring some financial stability to dairy and other farms in 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering legislation that would create a Southern  
Dairy Compact that would allow delegates from Tennessee and other 
states to set regional prices above the federal minimum for raw 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents have argued it would simply raise costs for consumers,  
while farmers say they need the legislation to help ensure they get 
reasonable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis supports the idea of the compact so he can stay in  
business, even though it's unclear whether it will be enough to 
maintain Tennessee dairy farms into the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't love working outside and working with animals so  
much, I wouldn't continue,'' he said. ``I have a grown son. He 
says, 'Daddy, I'd love to farm, but I just don't feel like I can 
make a living doing it.'''

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Decision Just Days Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's future will be decided soon.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for baseball commissioner Bud Selig said Monday the  
decision on how Strawberry's latest drug suspension is resolved 
will be made ``in the next few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin, said the decision could come as  
early as today or Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> New La. Rep. Vitter Joins House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders welcomed a new  
colleague Tuesday: David Vitter of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter replaces former Rep. Bob Livingston, the House  
speaker-in-waiting who resigned from Congress after acknowledging 
having had extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans now outnumber Democrats 223-211 in the House, with  
one seat held by an independent who votes with the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter said he was ``honored, humbled, awestruck'' to be in  
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	His goal, he said, is to become at ease and comfortable with  
members and the ways of the House ``but never to become so at ease 
and comfortable that I lose these feelings of honor, of humility, 
of awe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old former Rhodes scholar made a name for himself in  
Louisiana politics by pushing a term limits bill for state 
lawmakers through a reluctant legislature in 1995. He's also noted 
more for his ability to get under the skin of his fellow 
politicians than for a willingness to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter ran an antiestablishment campaign and, in a runoff last  
month, defeated the state's former Republican Gov. Dave Treen 
despite Treen's endorsements from several high-profile politicos, 
including Livingston and Gov. Mike Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston, the former chairman of the House Appropriations  
Committee, announced his resignation as the House debated the 
impeachment of President Clinton. He has opened a Washington 
lobbying firm since leaving in February and returned to the House 
floor for Vitter's swearing in.

<HEADLINE> PET Scans Said Helps Find Cancers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A medical scanner once rarely used because of  
its high cost and difficulty can detect cancerous tumors missed by 
other imaging devices, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show that positron emission tomography, or PET scans,  
can lead to fewer surgeries and biopsies for cancer patients. The 
technology also could help doctors more accurately diagnose heart 
disease and brain disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were presented Monday at the Society of Nuclear  
Medicine conference, where about 40 percent of the studies were 
related to PET. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is that PET has arrived,'' said Edward Coleman,  
professor of radiology at Duke University. ``PET is now having a 
major impact in the way we are taking care of patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional techniques, such as computed tomography scanning, or  
CT, measure internal body forms -- whether a tumor is present, for 
example. CT scanners use computers to combine X-rays of the body. 
</P>
<P>
	But patients who undergo PET scans are injected with sugar that  
is labeled with signal-emitting tracers. The scanner records the 
radioactive tracers as they travel through the body and collect in 
various organs. A computer then reassembles the images, which show 
organ function -- and failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tumors really like sugar, or glucose, better than the  
surrounding tissue,'' said Alan Waxman, director of nuclear 
medicine and co-director of imaging at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
``You can actually see the concentration in a tumor at a far 
greater level than the surrounding tissue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show the course of treatment -- including a reduction in  
surgeries and biopsies -- is often changed for cancer patients after 
a PET scan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ongoing research at the University of California, Los Angeles  
has found that major surgery was avoided in about 25 percent of the 
dozen patients studied so far. It shows that PET scanning can be 
cost-effective, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In cases of malignant lymphoma, or cancer of the lymph nodes,  
PET scanning was 96 percent accurate in detecting tumors compared 
with 64 percent with CT scans, said Inga Buchmann, researcher at 
University Hospital in Ulm, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Both CT and PET scans have been around since the 1970s. PET  
scans were often expensive and difficult because the radioactive 
injections could be created only with an expensive compound and 
were effective only for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, only about 50 centers in the United States offered the  
procedure, mostly university research hospitals. This year, the 
number has increased to about 300 nationwide, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare started paying for the treatment for patients who  
suffer from some forms of lung cancer in January. Coverage will be 
expanded next month to cover patients with colon-rectal cancer, 
lymphoma and melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
	PET equipment remains a sizable investment for any hospital,  
costing as much as $1.8 million. A San Diego company has created a 
mobile version of the machine and contracts with several Southern 
California hospitals for its services. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hospitals use it once or twice a week, and our company  
maintains the upgrades,'' said Paul Crowe, chief executive officer 
of Mobile PET. ``What we do here is fulfill the business needs as 
well as the medical staffs' needs and create a win-win for 
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average cost per patient is about $1,300, he said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing To Examine Launch Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Faced with recent space launch  
failures, Boeing Co. has formed an independent panel of experts to 
examine the processes involved in its rocket programs, the company 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will review Boeing's Delta, Sea Launch and Inertial  
Upper Stage programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expressly selected team members with a broad range of  
senior-level systems experience in aerospace -- from satellites to 
academia to launch vehicles,'' said James F. Albaugh, president of 
Boeing Space and Communications Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is expected to report its findings by this fall.  
</P>
<P>
	The panel will be headed by Sheila E. Widnall, former secretary  
of the Air Force and currently a professor at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's new Delta III rocket failed to put a satellite in the  
proper orbit last month, and the Delta III's debut last August 
ended in an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, an early analysis of an April 9 failure of a launch of  
Lockheed Martin's big Titan IV rocket implicated the Boeing-built 
upper stage. The new head of Lockheed Martin Astronautics has 
similarly vowed to thoroughly review its programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will examine organizational roles and responsibilities  
within Boeing, recent launch failure investigation findings, 
processes used for government, civil and commercial launches as 
well as the acceptance processes for major subsystems and complex 
assemblies from suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also look at the manufacturing, assembly, transportation  
and storage activities of the Boeing launch programs.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Swimming Champ Ends Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- While insisting that she is innocent of  
drug violations, Olympic champion Michelle Smith de Bruin says she 
will no longer swim competitively. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am saddened that my career has ended in this way, but now  
(husband) Erik and I must look to the future and decide where we go 
from here,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith announced her decision Tuesday, one day after the Irish  
swimmer lost her appeal of a four-year ban for manipulating a urine 
sample. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith won three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Games. The  
29-year-old swimmer is ineligible for the 2000 Sydney Olympics and 
the 2001 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will forever cherish my moments of victory and hope that  
those who still believe in me will also cherish their memories of 
those times,'' she said. ``I hope that you will not believe that I 
have brought this country into disrepute or that I have let you 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and her husband, whose career ended with his own four-year  
ban for using performance-enhancing drugs, were married weeks 
before Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA, the international swimming federation, banned Smith after  
finding her guilty of contaminating a urine sample with alcohol 
during an out-of-competition test in January 1998. Alcohol could 
mask banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland  
rejected her appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish government, which once hailed Smith for the greatest  
Olympic performance by an Irish athlete, ruefully accepted the 
verdict. Irish swim authorities are now considering stripping her 
of her national records. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I condemn more in sadness than in anger,'' Sports Minister  
James McDaid said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We swam those lanes with her, we stayed up all night, we had  
served our time, and I'm sure a lot of people across the country 
had hoped she would be able to prove her innocence,'' McDaid said. 
``... You wanted to believe her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Peter Lennon, made no mention of an appeal. Smith  
said in a statement her victories are ``not hollow and were 
achieved without the use of any illegal performance-enhancing 
drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``However, I am strong in the knowledge that I have not  
committed the offense with which I was charged, or any other 
offense, and that to date no one has proven on a direct factual 
basis how the whiskey entered the sample,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDaid said he would start Ireland's first formal drug-testing  
program for athletes in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Swim Ireland, the country's swimming body, said it might strike  
Smith's nine national records she set in 1995, the year after her 
future husband, a Dutch discus thrower, became her coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith accused FINA of deliberately targeting her and accused the  
three-member arbitration panel of accepting circumstantial evidence 
from others rather than her direct testimony.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Fined for French Open Breach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Martina Hingis was fined $1,500 by the  
International Tennis Federation on Tuesday for crossing the netline 
in the French Open final against Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, who lost in three sets to Graf on Saturday, also was  
given a warning for smashing her racket and was penalized a point 
for crossing the line to argue a call with the umpire and 
lineswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF declined to confirm a report in the Daily Telegraph that  
Hingis was involved in a ``physical incident'' with a women's WTA

<HEADLINE> Nissan Making Trunk Release Device </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDENA, Calif. (AP) -- Nissan North America Inc. followed the  
lead of General Motors Corp. and other automakers to make it 
possible for anyone trapped inside a car trunk to get out. 
</P>
<P>
	During extreme heat last summer, 11 children, including four  
cousins in Gallup, N.M., died after crawling into trunks to play 
and shutting the lids. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan will make trunk release device kits available later this  
year for 4 million models beginning with the 1990 model year, said 
company spokesman Fred Standish. 
</P>
<P>
	New Nissan and Infinity cars sold later this year will have the  
trunk release already installed, said company spokesman Scott 
Vazin. The 2000 models will include pamphlets on how to avoid trunk 
entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interior trunk release mechanisms will be developed for the  
highest-volume vehicles first,'' said Nissan vice president Jason 
Vines. The cost of the kits has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March, GM has been installing manual handles into the  
trunks of cars already on the road as optional equipment at the 
dealership for about $50. GM's yellow handle is illuminated in the 
dark cargo area. It also plans to equip most of its four-door 
family cars with an infrared sensing device that automatically 
unlocks the trunk if anyone is trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG are working on a standard  
trunk-release system. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler and Dodge cars will have  
an optional kit available within a month. DaimlerChrysler also 
plans to make trunk releases a standard feature for new cars by 
2001. Ford will have a T-shaped handle that glows inside the trunk 
as a standard feature on most of its 2000 models.

<HEADLINE> Martin Fails To Qualify for Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Casey Martin's day took a drastic turn for the worse once he got  
to the 10th hole of the afternoon round. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who rides a golf cart because of a painful circulatory  
disorder in his right leg, had a morning round of 71 at Sand Ridge 
Golf Club in Chardon, Ohio, on Monday, but a triple-bogey 7 on the 
401-yard 10th hole and a back-nine 41 led to an afternoon round of 
76. With a 147, Martin failed to qualify for next week's U.S. Open 
golf championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty beat,'' Martin said. ``My leg is killing me. The  
heat was definitely a factor. Riding in a cart was no advantage 
today. I'm in pain. I laugh at people who think a cart gives me a 
competitive edge. They should feel what I feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Zinkon of Haines City, Fla., shot a 5-under-par 139 to  
lead a trio of qualifiers that included Nike Tour player Jason 
Tyska of Mount Pleasant, Pa., and PGA Tour pro Gabriel Hjerstedt of 
Ponte Vedra, Fla. Tyska shot a 3-under 141 and Hjerstedt a 142. 
</P>
<P>
	In Columbus, Ohio, Chris Smith, a non-winner in six years on the  
tour, had the low 36-hole score, while Lanny Wadkins, Ian Woosnam, 
Craig Stadler and David Frost missed out in qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and kids were rooting hard today, too,'' Smith said.  
``They had a ball at Congressional when I made the cut it through 
qualifying the last time and Pinehurst will be something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 27 players -- all pros -- qualified from a starting  
field of 129 from the Columbus sectional qualifier at The Lakes and 
Brookside Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	A shot back of Smith were Craig Bowden, Australia's Robert  
Allenby, Scott Gump and Ted Tryba. 
</P>
<P>
	It came down to 10 players playing off for the final six spots,  
with Tim Herron and Keith Clearwater hitting long birdie putts on 
the first hole. Former Masters champion Larry Mize, Bob Gilder, 
Chris Tidland and Stephen Allan all parred, eliminating Fulton 
Allem, David Ogrin, Jim Johnson and Steve Gangluff. 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, Colo., Gary Hallberg of Castle Rock, Colo., and  
Matt Call of Thornton, Colo., beat out 18 others to qualify for the 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallberg, a PGA touring professional, shot a 7-under 65 and  
added a 71 to finish at 136. Call, a junior on the University of 
Colorado golf team, shot a 69 and a 68 to finish one shot behind 
Hallberg with 137. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Fry of Fort Collins, Colo., a former University of Wyoming  
golfer, placed third with a score of 140 in the qualifying round at 
Columbine Country Club. He will be first alternate. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandt Jobe of Castle Rock, a Japan PGA Tour regular who tied  
for 14th at the 1999 Masters, tied for fourth with Mike Sauer at 
141. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Palm Beach, Fla., former Boise State All-American David  
LeBeck qualified with a 4-under-par 140. Other qualifiers were 
Scott Fawcett of Plano, Texas, and Jeff Street of Tuscaloosa, Ala., 
at 141, and Alberto Ochoa of McAllen, Texas, at 142. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, Bob Heinz shot an 8-under-par 136 at the East Lake  
Golf Club to lead four qualifiers. Tim Loustalot shot a 138, while 
Bryce Molder and Mark Slawter each shot 139s. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tarzana, Calif., Chris Zambri shot a 138 to lead four

<HEADLINE> Group Seeks Ban on Jail Stun Belts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's court bailiffs and prison guards  
increasingly are strapping inmates into stun belts capable of 
delivering a 50,000-volt shock, Amnesty International USA said 
today, urging an end to the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Bureau of Prisons has 40 of the battery-operated belts  
for use when transporting dangerous prisoners. In New Orleans, the 
Old Parish Prison routinely uses the belts on inmates being taken 
to a hospital for AIDS treatment. In Los Angeles, an inmate who was 
shocked for interrupting a judge during his sentencing hearing is 
suing the county. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International USA said Tuesday the belts are inhumane  
and dangerous. ``A nation that opposes torture in far-off places 
has no credibility when it sanctions torture of its own,'' said the 
human rights group's executive director, William F. Schulz. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union also has attacked the belts  
as a violation of prisoners' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prison officials defend the technology as a nonlethal  
way to deter violent behavior and protect guards, and say the belts 
are used under strict guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been the bureau's policy to use custody control belts  
to prevent escapes or prevent loss of life or grievous bodily 
harm,'' Bureau of Prisons spokesman Todd Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	The battery-powered stun belt, triggered by a remote control  
from up to 300 feet away, temporarily incapacitates inmates with a 
painful, eight-second jolt above the left kidney. Stun Tech Inc. of 
Cleveland is the primary manufacturer and sells the belt for about 
$700. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 state corrections agencies have authorized the  
belts, Amnesty International USA reported. The group did not 
determine to what extent the devices are actually being used by 
states and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International USA, the U.S. affiliate of the  
London-based human rights organization, argued there hasn't been 
sufficient medical study to determine whether the shocks are 
dangerous for inmates, including those with heart problems or AIDS. 
The group said the pain-inflicting devices cause terror and violate 
the constitutional prohibition against ``cruel or unusual 
punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Prisons, which cooperated with the Amnesty  
International report, started using the belts in 1994 at its 12 
high-security prisons. The 40 belts are used only in rare 
instances, such as transporting high-security prisoners to medical 
facilities, and none has ever been activated, Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	A warden must approve use of any stun belt, and only a senior  
lieutenant can hold the remote control that activates it. The 
bureau prohibits use of the belts on prisoners with heart disease, 
epilepsy or other medical conditions, Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Marshals Service, which provides security for federal  
courts and transports suspects, has been using stun belts for 
disruptive prisoners since 1986, spokesman William Dempsey said. 
The belts have been activated ``very few times,'' Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stun belts have received wide attention since a defendant was  
shocked while serving as his own lawyer in Long Beach, Calif., last 
year. A judge ordered Ronnie Hawkins shocked because of his 
repeated interruptions during a sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins later sued for $50 million. A federal judge issued a  
temporary injunction barring the use of stun belts in Los Angeles 
County courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU's National Prison Project also has sued in Louisiana,  
arguing inmates of the segregated HIV/AIDS unit of New Orlean's Old 
Parish Prison must wear the belts during transportation between the 
prison and a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for New Orleans Parish Sheriff Charles C. Foti Jr.  
said in court papers that the stun belts are now used for 
transporting all prisoners, including the AIDS patients.

<HEADLINE> Rate Swings Bedevil Bond Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After years of getting whipsawed by the ups and  
downs of interest rates, investors in bond mutual funds are still 
bedeviled by a bad sense of timing. 
</P>
<P>
	They poured substantial amounts of new money into bond funds  
last year for the first time since 1993. In a replay of the 
aftermath of all the other cash-flow peaks in recent history, now 
they are faced with a spell of weak performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Investment Company Institute, the industry's main trade  
group, reports that bond funds had net new cash flow of $74.6 
billion in 1998, surpassing the previous high for this decade of 
$73.3 billion five years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave of new money last year followed outflows totaling more  
than $75 billion in 1994-95, and inflows of just $2.8 billion in 
1996 and $28.4 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The abrupt dropoff in enthusiasm in the mid-1990s occurred when  
the Federal Reserve tightened credit conditions in 1994, and bond 
prices suffered a sharp drop as interest rates rose. In the years 
that followed, investors gradually returned to bond funds again as 
rates fell back to new 30-year lows by early last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	So what has happened now that enthusiasm for bond funds has  
warmed up again? Another jump in interest rates this spring, 
renewed talk of Fed tightening, and a new spell of skimpy or no 
returns from bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the research firm of Lipper Inc., the average among  
more than 2,000 domestic long-term fixed-income funds posted a 
total return of minus 1.06 percent in May. That left the average 
with a net return, including dividends and changes in net asset 
value, of minus 0.02 percent for the first five months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	World income funds, as tracked by Lipper, had an even tougher  
time of it, dropping 2.53 percent in May and 1.31 percent overall 
for the January-May period. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tough year for investors in most high-quality bond  
funds,'' says Norman Fosback, editor-in-chief of the newsletter 
Income Fund Outlook in Deerfield Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds climbed 120 basis points, or  
hundredths of a percentage point, from a low of 4.7 percent last 
fall to 5.9 percent recently, Fosback notes. ``The advance was 
accelerated in May when the Federal Open Market Committee announced 
that it would lean in the direction of tight money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FOMC announcement occurred almost simultaneously with the  
government's surprising report of a 0.7 percent increase in the 
consumer price index for April. ... Although inflation is likely to 
ease from the steep rate in April, the giddy days of only 1 percent 
annual inflation are long gone for this economic expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fosback recommends that investors avoid most funds that  
specialize in longer-maturity bonds, given this worrisome picture. 
Presumably, they would be better off waiting until prospects 
improved for a good payoff from bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble is, the record suggests that the majority of  
bond-fund investors can't do this kind of maneuvering with any 
degree of success. If they could discern when bonds were a good 
buy, they should have been pouring money into bond funds in 1994 
and 1995, rather than pulling it out. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, by the same standard, they should have turned cautious,  
instead of pumping more money in than at any time since 1986 
(another buying binge, by the way, that was followed by bond market 
woes in the spring of 1987). 
</P>
<P>
	The record shows a pattern of consistent misjudgment. If good  
timing were necessary to achieve worthwhile results, fund investors 
as a group would be better off staying away from this class of 
funds altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet in the long-term, patient investors in bond funds have been  
rewarded quite nicely. Over the past 10 years, according to Lipper, 
domestic bond funds have averaged a 7.84 percent annual return, and 
world bond funds 7.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to have realized those results for yourself, of  
course, was to own bond funds as of May 1989 and to hold them all 
through the up-and-down swings of the 1990s -- no attempt to pick 
when bonds looked good or didn't look good, just plain old 
buy-and-hold.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Has Pulled Thigh Muscle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLE, Germany (AP) -- Andre Agassi has a pulled muscle in his  
right thigh and is returning to the United States for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury today forced Agassi to withdraw from the Gerry Weber  
Open, a major ATP buildup on grass for Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great disappointment for me,'' the newly crowned French  
Open champion said. ``I thought two days of rest would be enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd already felt it after the third round in Paris. This  
morning I thought it was only a sore muscle but unfortunately it is 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to take any risks. I want to play Wimbledon.''  
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon starts June 28. Agassi won the British tournament in  
1992, his first Grand Slam title. 
</P>
<P>
	He added the U.S. Open in 1994 and the Australian Open in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	By winning the French Open Sunday, Agassi became only the fifth  
man to complete a career Grand Slam.

<HEADLINE> Cross Dressing Day Riles Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- A middle school scheduled a  
cross-dressing day as part of fun-themed week, but when some 
parents failed to see the humor the principal admitted the event 
was poorly named. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son said he wanted me to take him to Wal-Mart to buy him a  
dress or he wouldn't go to school,'' said Dave Ganger, who was not 
pleased with theme days at Cypress Lake Middle School. ``I think 
it's the wrong direction to morally steer the students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To celebrate test results on the recent Florida Comprehensive  
Achievement Test, eighth graders decided to have a week of theme 
days, including pajama day, school spirit day and clash day when 
students wear outfits that don't match. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-dressing day yesterday, boys were supposed to dress  
like girls and vice-versa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was obviously an unfortunate choice in names,'' Principal  
Jeananne Folaros said. ``The student council asked if they could 
have role reversal day, and the kids started calling it 
cross-dressing day.''

<HEADLINE> Chain Accused of Selling Old Condoms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Rite Aid, the nation's third-largest  
drugstore chain, stocked store shelves in California with expired 
condoms, baby formula and infant medications, prosecutors said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prompted by a consumer's complaint in January, investigators  
found more than 200 outdated products in about 50 of the chain's 
660 stores in California. Some of the condoms were four years past 
their expiration date, Merced County District Attorney Gordon 
Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is most astounding and disconcerting is that Rite Aid did  
not alert their customers,'' Spencer said, even as ``they bragged 
in commercials'' that customers were the key to their success. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors from Merced, Alameda and Santa Barbara counties and  
the city of San Diego filed a consumer protection lawsuit asking a 
judge to order Rite Aid to make restitution to victims and to pay 
civil penalties, which could run to $2,500 for each expired item 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had no reports of infants falling ill from outdated  
products, but they cautioned that formulas lose their nutritional 
value over time, and that condoms and spermicides lose their 
effectiveness after their expiration dates pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid said its policy has always been to pull items off  
shelves 30 days before they expire; last month, that was changed to 
60 days. Karen Rugen, a Rite Aid spokeswoman, said the company also 
posted signs advising customers that if they purchased expired 
infant formula, it would be replaced with fresh formula free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're surprised and disappointed that a handful of attorneys  
have decided to take this action, despite everything we ... have 
done since we were first informed of the incidents,'' Ms. Rugen 
said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 54.77 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed in early trading on Wall  
Street today, with blue-chip stocks giving up ground after their 
strong gains Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 54.77 at 10,854.61. The Dow climbed Monday for the third 
straight session amid enthusiasm over merger activity, adding 
109.54 to close at 10,909.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed today, with the Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 composite down 2.23 at 1,332.29 and the Nasdaq composite 
up 7.94 at 2,532.15. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led lower by Procter &AMP; Gamble, down 1 7/8  
at 95 11/16; IBM, down 1 5/8 at 118 7/8; and Sears, down 1 1/16 at 48 
11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said there was little news to influence trading.  
Investors are still concerned that the Federal Reserve might raise 
interest rates in a bid to cool the economy at its next policy 
meeting on June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	But some market players believe traders are already betting on a  
rate increase of 0.25 percentage point, and that they're not likely 
to do much more selling. They point to a report last Friday of 
moderate May employment gains, which helped ease fears of a larger 
rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the major indexes have performed well lately, they  
have done so on very thin volume, a sign, analysts said, that 
traders may begin selling again. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,178 to 989 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 91.84 million shares, 
above Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.30 to 635.64, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.41 at 777.74. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.53 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.53 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.20 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.29 percent.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Hits Targets Near Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO struck targets near the  
Yugoslav capital for the first time in days today, keeping its 
pledge to intensify attacks until President Slobodan Milosevic 
orders his troops out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Architects of an international plan calling for the troop  
withdrawal -- the G-8 countries of Russia, the United States and six 
major industrialized nations -- today unanimously agreed on a U.N. 
resolution authorizing a peacekeeping force for Kosovo with NATO at 
the core. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-8's action in Germany was forced by Yugoslav insistence  
that the U.N. Security Council endorse any peace plan for Kosovo -- 
a demand backed by Moscow, Yugoslavia's chief ally. The draft now 
on ``fast track'' goes to New York next for quick approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign ministers also agreed on a NATO bombing pause  
between the time Yugoslav withdrawals begin and the Security 
Council passes the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said regardless of the agreement among G-8 nations, the  
bombing campaign that began March 24 will continue until the 40,000 
or so Serb forces in Kosovo actually pull out and all the ethnic 
Albanians expelled over the past couple of months are allowed back 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to maintain our military pressure on Yugoslavia  
until we see the clear indication of a complete, rapid and 
verifiable withdrawal of the Yugoslav forces,'' spokesman Jamie 
Shea told reporters at NATO headquarters in Belgium. 
``Implementation is the bottom light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the negotiations an  
``outstanding example of how force and diplomacy work together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO force came into play today in Serbia, where fire and dense  
smoke could be seen rising above Pancevo, 12 miles northeast of 
Belgrade, and explosions could be heard from the direction of 
nearby Batajnica military airfield. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, one person was killed and five were wounded in NATO  
attacks on Novi Sad, Yugoslavia's second-largest city, Serb media 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin today condemned the stepped-up bombing,  
saying NATO was trying to establish a ``dictatorship of force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, a NATO statement this morning said allied jets  
conducted 658 sorties over the past 24 hours -- equal to the levels 
before the alliance scaled back attacks after Milosevic and the 
Serb parliament said it accepted a peace plan Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The airstrikes came despite an attempt by Milosevic to assure  
key Western countries he intends to abide by terms of the peace 
plan even though there was a breakdown of talks on withdrawing Serb 
troops from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Ministry spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic said his government  
was still committed to the plan but he accused NATO of ``trying to 
... have an international security presence enter Kosovo without a 
U.N. mandate, without a Security Council decision and without U.N. 
auspices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vujovic also said Yugoslavia is demanding it be able to keep  
guards and customs officials at the borders to monitor the return 
of hundreds of thousands of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain said a ``small symbolic force'' of Serbs at the border  
operating under strict NATO supervision would be allowed at the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cologne, Germany, Albright said ``NATO will be the military  
leader,'' adding: ``We got what we came for'' and that the ``Serbs 
in no way control who goes back into Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the ethnic Albanian refugees who fled Kosovo since  
March would be issued identity papers by the United Nations' main 
relief agency to replace those taken away by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians had resisted NATO's leadership of the force, but  
compromised on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any agreement is a compromise,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor  
Ivanov said. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the agreement breaks  
through the obstacles that blocked a military agreement between 
NATO and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The German foreign minister said high-level talks on getting  
that military agreement can now resume. 
</P>
<P>
	Said German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer: ``We have achieved  
a decisive step here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of Eight foreign ministers wrapped up 12 hours of  
negotiations today over lingering disputes to a U.N. resolution 
outlining the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council must authorize an international force and  
civilian administration that would be dispatched to Kosovo under 
U.N. auspices to ensure the safe return of the estimated 860,000 
ethnic Albanian refugees who have fled since March. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 50,000 troops, including 7,000 Americans, are expected to  
make up the peacekeeping force in a mission that Washington said 
will be open-ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Finland leader Martti Ahtisaari, a Balkans envoy to the talks,  
was in Beijing today, trying to get China to support the peace 
plan. China, a U.N. Security Council member with veto powers, 
called today for a halt in the NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia also wants a pause in the NATO bombing.  
</P>
<P>
	NATO-Yugoslav talks in Macedonia on pulling out the troops  
collapsed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, NATO resumed attacks around Yugoslavia's major cities for  
the first time since Milosevic said he accepted a peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Tanjug news agency said a NATO missile hit a  
residential area in Novi Sad, 50 miles north of Belgrade, 
destroying several houses. The attack apparently was aimed at a 
nearby oil refinery, which was also reported hit. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO also struck Kosovo. The alliance said it hit 20 artillery  
pieces, 10 armored personnel carriers and other military forces in 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO deployed more troops in Macedonia in the force that will  
first go into Kosovo once Serb troops pull out. Some 1,000 British 
troops joined the force, bringing it to 16,500 soldiers; more 
British and French troops are due today, Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's prewar population of 2.1 million was 90 percent ethnic  
Albanian, and many favor independence. NATO began airstrikes to 
force Milosevic to accept a peace plan for Kosovo and end a 
13-month crackdown on ethnic Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia 4, Malta 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALONICA, Greece (AP)-- Savo Milosevic scored two goals Tuesday  
as Yugoslavia trounced Malta 4-1 for its third victory in Group 8 
of qualifying for the 2000 European Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The war in Yugoslavia forced UEFA, Europe's soccer governing  
body, to change the site from Belgrade and move the game to 
Salonica. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslavs pressed from the start, but it was Malta which  
surprisingly took the lead with Nicholas Salliba scoring off a pass 
from Chuks Nwoko. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslavs kept testing goaltender Ernest Barry, who was  
unyielding, making a series of decisive saves. He also was helped 
twice by the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	But Predrag Mijatovic tied it off a centering pass from Jovan  
Stankovic in the 36th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Three minutes into the second half, Milosevic gave Yugoslavia  
the lead, and Darko Kovacevic made it 3-1 with the game's most 
spectacular goal. Before sending the ball into the Maltese goal, he 
dribbled past two defenders and Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds before the end of the game, Milosevic made it 4-1.

<HEADLINE> NRA Works Against Senate Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders, reacting to a spate  
of gun violence in schools, are talking about legislation that 
would restrict youth access to video games, movies and other items 
containing violent and sexually explicit material, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also would require the music industry to provide  
stores with copies of song lyrics as a means of allowing adults to 
keep questionable products from their children. 
</P>
<P>
	The provisions were among several prepared by Rep. Henry Hyde,  
R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, for inclusion in 
legislation cracking down on juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is expected to reach the House floor by next week,  
and has become the focus for responding to the April shooting 
deaths at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are attempting to force passage of gun control  
provisions that cleared the Senate, including a requirement for 
mandatory background checks for all gun show sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association has launched a fresh effort to  
derail that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans have said for weeks that the shootings  
underscored the need for steps to crack down on the often-violent 
images that youngsters are exposed to. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on its precise wording, the proposal being circulated  
Monday by Hyde could spark strong objections from civil 
libertarians, as well as from the manufacturers of video games and 
other popular consumer items. 
</P>
<P>
	A summary of Hyde's proposal, made available to The Associated  
Press, calls for prohibition of the sale or showing of ``explicit 
sexual or violent material which fails to qualify for First 
Amendment protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impact would be to restrict explicitly violent images, much  
as sexually explicit material is now prohibited for minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The First Amendment is not absolute and does not protect  
obscenity,'' the summary states. ``Furthermore, it is 
constitutionally permissible to accord minors under 17 a more 
restricted right'' to pornography than adults have. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Hyde's proposal, which relates to pictures, sculpture, video games, 
movies, books, magazines and other printed matter, were greeted 
enthusiastically by members of the Republican leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate-passed measure requires instant background checks for  
all gun-show purchases, closing what supporters said was a loophole 
that permitted some transactions to proceed without checks. In 
addition, it outlawed importation of large-capacity ammunition 
clips, required the sale of safety locks with handguns and barred 
juveniles with felony convictions from ever buying guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome of gun provisions in the House is unpredictable,  
aides in both parties said.

<HEADLINE> Off-Peak Summer Flights Discounted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Just a week after raising fares, the nation's  
major airlines on Tuesday began offering steep discounts for summer 
vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
	Major airlines quickly matched the sale by United Airlines, the  
nation's No. 1 carrier, on leisure domestic and international 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the airlines brought on the fare war by adding too  
many planes to fleets too quickly, leaving many seats empty. Wall 
Street expressed its disapproval to the fare cuts by sending 
airline company stocks lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the promotion, consumers would see the best savings on  
tickets purchased in advance for travel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and 
Saturdays. In some cases, those traveling in parties of three could 
pay less for all their tickets combined than one full-fare ticket 
cost earlier this year after prices jumped 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real winners here are those in larger parties and those  
flying coast-to-coast, amounting to savings in some cases of 55 
percent,'' said Tom Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com, an Internet 
travel company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major airlines haven't given us a 55 percent discount in  
many, many moons, so people should sit down and consider these will 
probably be the best fares of the summer,'' Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, ticket prices for a round trip from New York to Los  
Angeles fell to $398 from as high as $622 earlier this month. And 
two fellow travelers could fly that route for just $258 each. 
</P>
<P>
	United also capped advanced round-trip domestic tickets for the  
remaining travel days at $498. 
</P>
<P>
	The promotion, in which tickets must be purchased by June 18,  
applies to travel through the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is similar to a more restricted promotion launched last  
week by Northwest Airlines that was due to expire in a few days. In 
addition to the Northwest cuts, the latest promotion allows for 
travel on Saturdays and sets no age limit on companion travel. 
</P>
<P>
	The fare war undercuts a 4 percent boost in ticket prices  
instituted last week by major airlines and comes as the carriers 
are finding an unexpectedly large number of empty seats despite 
strong summer bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen percent of Americans are expected to fly this summer,  
up 3 percent from a year ago, according to the Travel Industry 
Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The fare war also comes after United parent UAL Corp. and US  
Airways Group, the sixth-largest carrier, warned second-quarter 
profits will fall below Wall Street expectations because of weak 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines, flush with success from three years of record profits,  
recently went on a plane-buying spree and have been adding flights 
faster than they retire older planes. 
</P>
<P>
	New planes have been arriving as May bookings came up  
unexpectedly short. Traffic industrywide rose 1.4 percent, less 
than a third of the 3.7 percent capacity increase. And the amount 
of plane seats filled, called the load factor, posted the sharpest 
monthly decline since mid-1993, at 1.6 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviation analyst Samuel Buttrick at PaineWebber said airlines  
also have been hurt as companies better manage travel expenses for 
their employees. Airlines generally court business travelers 
because tickets cost far more than leisure fares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Corporations are gaining leverage in managing travel expenses  
by increasingly opting for advanced purchases, negotiated discounts 
with preferred carriers and using the Internet as a booking tool,'' 
Buttrick said. ``With the Internet, they now have a booking tool 
that allows them -- and consumers -- to access the lowest fares for a 
particular itinerary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United spokesman Joe Hopkins said consumers who previously  
purchased tickets under the old fares can get a travel credit for 
the difference or can get a cash refund after paying a $75 
ticket-change fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline shares tumbled on the New York Stock Exchange. UAL's  
stock fell $2.56 1/4, or by 3.9 percent, to $63.81 1/4 a share. 
American's stock fell $2, or 2.9 percent, to $67.68 3/4 a share, while 
Delta fell $1.06 1/4, or 1.7 percent, to $59.93 3/4 a share.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell To Remain Knicks Starter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy has no  
plans to reconsider his decision to start Latrell Sprewell, even 
though the move backfired once. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our best chance to win,'' Van Gundy said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, making his first playoff start, picked up two quick  
fouls and was ineffective defensively against Chris Mullin as the 
Knicks fell to the Indiana Pacers 90-78 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell fouled out for the first time this season, scoring 12  
points in 33 minutes on 6-of-14 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	With Patrick Ewing out for the season with a partially torn  
Achilles' tendon, Sprewell might be the Knicks' best hope to win 
the best-of-7 Eastern Conference championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	He's expected to start again in tonight's Game 5 at Market  
Square Arena. The series is tied 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana coach Larry Bird said he'll stay with his usual starting  
five, no matter what Van Gundy does. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to match what he's doing. We're just going to  
try and play our game,'' Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going into trying to cross-match and mismatch, and  
do things to shake up the lineup. We've had the same lineup since 
I've been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the series will meet a well-rested San Antonio  
team when the NBA Finals begin next Wednesday. The Spurs swept 
Portland in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacers reserve Jalen Rose understands why Sprewell is starting.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you win the game, and he doesn't play the way he's  
capable of playing, you can look back with hindsight and say it 
was, or was not, a good move,'' Rose said. ``They were going for 
the jugular. Being up 2-1, playing in front of their home fans they 
wanted to get a chance to have everybody involved in the game early 
so they could put us to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, it backfired.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will be hoping the change doesn't backfire again.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Indiana is still waiting for Reggie Miller -- whose  
past playoff heroics are well-chronicled -- to end his scoring 
slump. Miller, who began this year's playoffs with a career 23.5 
average for 65 games, is averaging 14.8 points in the first four 
games. He's shooting 40 percent from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll break loose,'' Bird predicted. ``I know what Reggie is  
going through. He's sees other guys getting the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller picked up two fouls one second apart Monday and went  
scoreless in the first half as the Pacers built a 45-32 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get in foul trouble like that, it takes something  
away. ... You're not as aggressive as you want. He'll be fine,'' 
Bird said. ``You can only hold a great scorer down so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston's defense is one reason Miller has struggled,  
hitting just 17 of 43 shots from the field. But the constant 
battling to defend Miller appeared to take its toll on Houston in 
Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said Houston needs to deliver at both ends of the  
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say, `Take tonight off and go score.' We're probably  
not going to win another game in this series if Allan is effective 
defensively, but not effective offensively,'' Van Gundy said.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Place Eiland on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays placed  
right-hander Dave Eiland on the disabled list Tuesday and recalled 
left-hander Norm Charlton from Triple-A Durham. 
</P>
<P>
	Eiland (0-2, 4.09 ERA) started Monday night's game at Atlanta,  
but left after three innings because of stiffness in his lower 
back. The 36-year-old Charlton (0-0, 4.50) made two relief 
appearances during an earlier stint with the Devil Rays from April 
24-29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays also announced they had agreed to contract terms  
with four players selected in last week's baseball draft -- 
infielder Oginga Aaron, outfielder Glenn Katz and pitchers Chris 
Crawford and Matthew Dailey.

<HEADLINE>  Agassi Has Pulled Thigh Muscle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLE, Germany (AP) -- Andre Agassi has an injured thigh that  
forced him to withdrew on Tuesday from a Wimbledon tuneup two days 
after winning the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi plans to return to the United States for treatment and  
intends to play Wimbledon, which starts June 28. 
</P>
<P>
	He consulted the tournament doctor at the Gerry Weber Open  
before dropping out because of a pulled muscle in his right thigh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great disappointment for me,'' Agassi said. ``I thought  
two days of rest would be enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd already felt it after the third round in Paris,'' he  
added. ``This morning I thought it was only a sore muscle but 
unfortunately it is not. I don't want to take any risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi won Wimbledon in 1992, his first Grand Slam title. He  
added the U.S. Open in 1994, the Australian Open in 1995 and this 
past French Open, giving him a career Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi was the major attraction of the Halle tournament, with  
tickets sales rising sharply after his French Open victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament tries to recreate Wimbledon conditions. But the  
center court has a retractable roof and it was much in use Tuesday 
as intermittent rain hit the grass-court event. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion from the  
Netherlands who is seeded third, was among three seeded players 
upset in the first round of the $900,000 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic beat Krajicek 7-6 (8-6), 6-4;  
Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands ousted No. 8 Jerome Golmard of 
France 7-5, 6-0; and Gianluca Pozzi of Italy routed Felix Mantilla, 
the fifth-seeded clay-court specialist from Spain, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	One seeded player to advance was No. 6 Tommy Haas. The German  
saved three set points in the second set to defeat France's 
Guillaume Raoux 6-4, 7-5.

<HEADLINE> Mark McGwire Draws Large Crowds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Mark McGwire victory tour keeps  
right on going. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run king isn't putting up otherworldly numbers this  
season and is way off his record pace. He has 17 home runs and even 
trails four of his contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet no one rivals him as a gate attraction.  
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals are the first team in the majors to draw  
1 million fans on the road, topping seven figures on Sunday after 
an interleague series in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	That mirrored turnouts during McGwire's amazing stretch drive to  
70 last year. After eclipsing Roger Maris' 37-year-old record at 
home on Sept. 8, McGwire gave instant jolts of attendance in 
Cincinnati, Houston and Milwaukee, doubling or even tripling the 
house wherever he went. 
</P>
<P>
	It's happening again, and not just because the Cardinals have  
played more road games than any other team. Fans hungering for a 
glimpse of McGwire have gobbled up tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-game weekend series against the Tigers drew 125,371,  
and not because it was the Cardinals' first visit to Detroit since 
the 1968 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, it is McGwire, not the third renewal in three years  
of the 1985 I-70 Series, that is packing the house for a three-game 
series in Kansas City against the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be an incredible experience for our young players,''  
Royals manager Tony Muser said Monday. ``This will be the largest 
crowd they've ever played in front of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A turnout crowd of 37,248, second only to opening day, had to  
settle for some tape-measure batting practice homers in the opener 
from McGwire. He sat out the 7-5 victory in the opener with a stiff 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them to stay for batting practice or go home, because  
Mark ain't playing,'' said Shawon Dunston, who replaced McGwire at 
first and hit a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals were averaging 32,655 fans on the road, nearly  
2,000 fans per game better than the runner-up Chicago White Sox 
(30,659). Sammy Sosa's Chicago Cubs were third (30,262). 
</P>
<P>
	The attention certainly has not hurt the Cardinals' play away  
from Busch Stadium. The team has 20 wins on the road -- tops in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The only puzzlement to McGwire is the superstar treatment he's  
getting in American League cities. These are the same fans who saw 
a lot of him when he played in Oakland and never appeared overly 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just amazes me what's happened over one year,'' McGwire  
said. ``I played in Detroit and Kansas City for 12 years and I hit 
close to 400 home runs in the American League, then they start 
coming out because of what I did one year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm awfully flattered and it's a great thing that they're  
doing. But what can I say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, McGwire suspects most of his road following stems  
from the novelty of interleague play. He pointed out that a week 
ago, the team drew only about 20,000 a game for a series in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, that was a significant increase for the  
Marlins, and the Cardinals had another sellout series late last 
month at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to see,'' general manager Walt Jocketty said. ``I  
just wish we were getting a percentage of it like we used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current agreement, visiting clubs don't have to share  
gate receipts anymore. That shouldn't hurt much since the Cardinals 
are doing even better at home, averaging 40,570 in a major league 
low 22 dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we get home, I would think we'd top 1 million at home  
pretty soon,'' Jocketty said. ``So we might be the first 
million-million team.''

<HEADLINE> Indians' Cordero Injured From Catch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Wil Cordero broke his left wrist while making a  
sliding catch in the sixth inning of Cleveland's game against the 
Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday night and could be out for 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, making his 20th start in left field, bent his wrist  
back awkwardly as he caught a sinking liner hit by Milwaukee's 
Jeromy Burnitz. 
</P>
<P>
	After making the grab, Cordero threw the ball back into the  
infield as he attempted to catch a runner at second base. He then 
fell down in pain as his teammates and an Indians trainer came to 
his aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero was taken to Lutheran Hospital where X-rays revealed a  
break similar to the one that sidelined Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. 
for 10 weeks in 1995. Cordero will undergo surgery Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to see a guy get hurt, I feel bad for Wil,''  
said Indians starter Dave Burba. ``You hate to see a guy who goes 
out and plays hard like that go down like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, signed by the Indians during the offseason, is batting  
.316 with five homers and 26 RBIs. He missed five games early in 
the season with a bruised right wrist and missed eight more with a 
bruised right heel. He has also made 19 starts at DH. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians acquired Cordero at the urging of Roberto and Sandy  
Alomar, who like Cordero, are from Puerto Rico and knew him. 
Cordero was given a $500,000 non-guaranteed contract by Cleveland, 
one of the few teams to show interest in the 27-year-old who had 
prior off-field problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero was one of the surprises of spring training and was  
named the Indians starter in left field when camp broke in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I feel real bad,'' Roberto Alomar said. ``I am  
sad. Wil was doing a great job for us. He was playing well, all

<HEADLINE> Raiders Sign Returner Darrien Gordon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Darrien Gordon, a cornerback and kick  
returner whose career 13.2-yard punt return average is an NFL best, 
signed a free agent contract with the Oakland Raiders on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the Raiders released wide receiver and kick  
returner Desmond Howard, the 1991 Heisman Trophy winner from 
Michigan. Howard was the MVP of the Super Bowl in 1997 with Green 
Bay and signed with the Raiders that offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, a six-year veteran, played the past two years with the  
Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos. He has started in three Super 
Bowls overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully some of that playoff experience can rub off and we  
can be on track,'' Gordon said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of his agreement weren't released.  
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Gordon led the Broncos with four interceptions  
during the regular season, returning one against Washington for a 
touchdown. He added four more interceptions in the post season, 
included two in the Super Bowl against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	His 108 return yards in the championship game were a Super Bowl  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon signed with the Broncos in 1997 after four years with the  
San Diego Chargers. Overall, he has made 60 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon was the 22nd overall pick in the 1993 draft by the  
Chargers out of Stanford. With the Cardinal, he worked under 
current Raiders defensive coordinator Willie Shaw.

<HEADLINE> Orange County Prosecutor Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- An Orange County prosecutor could spend  
life behind bars if convicted on charges he conspired with a Hells 
Angels leader and others in a drug ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy District Attorney Bryan Ray Kazarian, 35, was among a  
dozen people arrested Monday for investigation of drug trafficking 
and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer insisted that Kazarian was duped by the ring's leader  
and did nothing criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 people, who also include Howard Irvine Coones, 44,  
founder of the Orange County Hells Angels chapter, were charged 
with various counts of conspiracy including money laundering and 
the distribution of cocaine, methamphetamine and prescription 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazarian and Coones could face life sentences if convicted,  
Orange County District Attorney Anthony Rackauckas said Monday. 
Kazarian is being held without bail pending trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A deputy district attorney for six years, Kazarian worked in an  
anti-gang unit until January when he was moved to a job inside the 
office so he ``could be more efficiently monitored,'' Rackauckas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the drug distribution charges involved the shipping of  
chemicals from New Jersey for the manufacturing of methamphetamine 
that was shipped to Hawaii inside Harley-Davidson motorcycles and 
motorcycle shipping crates. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Malcolm Guleserian said John David Ward, the  
alleged ringleader, used Kazarian for information and duped him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a friendship,'' Guleserian told The Associated Press.  
</P>
<P>
	Court documents claim Kazarian tipped ring members on the status  
of police investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Guleserian said Kazarian's only conversation with Ward about  
the case was when Ward asked the prosecutor if he knew a certain 
investigating officer and Kazarian answered no. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said prosecutors have  
wiretaps in which Kazarian is heard relaying information about a 
confidential informant -- actually a fictional character created by 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can imagine how we in law enforcement feel when one of the  
individuals with whom we work communicates confidential informant 
information to the targets of our investigative efforts,'' Mayorkas 
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Seek Medicare Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY ALICE ANN LOVE   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senior citizens would get Medicare  
prescription drug benefits for the first time but would have to pay 
a monthly premium to help cover the cost under a proposal President 
Clinton is expected to unveil this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The out-of-pocket charge has not yet been calculated, but  
administration officials said it will be less than the average $90 
a month that many retirees now pay to buy private drug coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare beneficiaries who already have private insurance  
covering prescriptions could choose not to participate and would 
not have to pay the premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working on a benefit that is both meaningful and  
affordable to both the beneficiaries and the program,'' said White 
House domestic policy adviser Chris Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
	John Rother, public policy director for the nation's largest  
organization of older adults, AARP, said that ``for people who 
don't have anything today, clearly they'll be ahead and will 
probably welcome this. But there will be cost sharing involved and 
it's not going to be painless ... it's hardly a freebie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For people who do have some form of drug coverage today it  
will be a matter of comparing what they have to what's being 
offered,'' Rother added. 
</P>
<P>
	The President plans to unveil details of his proposal later this  
month, as an alternative to a plan proposed in March by an advisory 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to offer new prescription benefits to all 39  
million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, a proposal agreed to by 10 of 17 members of the  
National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare earlier 
this year would provide government-subsidized drug benefits only 
for those living near the poverty level. Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., has asked the Senate Finance Committee to 
consider that plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings said Clinton's proposal, first mentioned in his State  
of the Union message in January, has yet to be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say they are looking for ways to make  
the new benefit affordable without imposing government price 
controls on drugs, possibly by hiring private companies to help 
negotiate the best prices and manage the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the pharmaceutical industry is watching warily.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it's another giant government program, regardless of  
exactly how it is administered we believe that it will lead to 
government price controls,'' said Alan F. Holmer, president of 
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneficiaries of Medicare now pay a $45.50 monthly premium for  
coverage that generally doesn't include drugs, except for a few 
that must be administered in hospitals or doctors offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The government estimates about two-thirds of senior citizens  
have some drug coverage -- mostly through retiree health benefits 
offered by former employers, or through supplemental policies known 
as Medigap that they buy on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	But with drug costs rising faster than overall inflation and  
many employers scaling back retirement benefits in the 1990s, 
affording prescriptions is a problem for more and more senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, as well as many Republicans and Democrats, has voiced  
support for Medicare drug benefits. But the costs are daunting, 
especially since Medicare is expected to run short of cash around 
2015, shortly after the first wave of baby boomers retires. 
</P>
<P>
	One government estimate found that adding even a modest benefit  
-- for example, having Medicare pay 75 percent of retirees' drug 
bills -- would cost at least $20 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed using about $700 billion in income tax  
surpluses expected over the next 15 years to boost Medicare's 
finances and help pay for the drug coverage. Also, he is expected 
to propose steps to save Medicare money, including requiring 
competitive bidding by managed care health plans and some other 
medical providers to serve Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also will argue that adding a prescription  
drug benefit could save Medicare money by reducing the need for 
hospital stays and nursing home care.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Tells House GOP To Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaker Dennis Hastert asked fractious House  
Republicans today to unite so they can finally begin passing parts 
of their stalled legislative agenda and retain their slender 
majority in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closed-door meeting, Hastert, R-Ill., delivered a 17-minute  
speech in which participants said he quoted Benjamin Franklin's 
words as he signed the Declaration of Independence: ``We must all 
hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most immediately, Hastert ordered the House Appropriations  
Committee to make relatively small cuts in the first batch of 
spending bills for the upcoming fiscal year. The reductions are 
designed to finally get those measures moving through the House, 
and to free funds that can be added to later spending bills to 
enhance their chances of passage. 
</P>
<P>
	But with an eye to the 2000 elections, Hastert spoke of the need  
for GOP factions to stop bickering so the House can accomplish 
routine business such as passing annual spending bills, and so the 
party can clarify its message. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're united,'' Hastert told reporters afterwards. ``We're  
standing to balance the budget. We are a party of spending 
restraint. We believe it's important that we preserve Social 
Security. We're not going to dip into the Social Security trust 
fund. And we're going to try to cut taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From outside the basement room in the Capitol where the meeting  
was held, applause could be heard. Participants said Hastert read 
his remarks calmly, and conservatives and moderates alike praised 
his call for GOP lawmakers to work together. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a heartfelt expression from the speaker that we have to  
work in a unified fashion, or the whole thing starts to 
deteriorate,'' said Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are beginning to think seriously about the delights of  
being in the majority'' -- something Republicans don't want to lose, 
said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a leader of conservatives who had  
blocked a farm spending bill because of unhappiness with earlier 
leadership strategy, said he supported Hastert's plans and would 
end the delays. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's telling some members if you don't have a worthy project,  
forget it,'' Coburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker's plan involves shifting about $7 billion to  
domestic programs while keeping the 13 annual spending bills for 
fiscal 2000 within limits set by the 1997 budget-balancing law, 
said GOP aides speaking on condition of anonymity. The money would 
come from projected sales of parts of the broadcast spectrum and 
from transfers from defense and other bills. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders were hoping the proposal would allow spending bills  
for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, to start moving through the 
House. So far, those measures and others have fared poorly on the 
House floor, as majority Republicans have struggled to control the 
chamber. Defections by just six Republicans can keep the party from 
passing a bill if Democrats hold ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives and other critics have said that under the  
leadership's earlier blueprint, about six of the domestic spending 
bills covering education, veterans and other popular programs would 
not have enough money to even pass the House, let alone get 
President Clinton's signature. That would leave Republicans in a 
weakened bargaining position for end-of-year talks with the White 
House, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are eager to avoid another damaging autumn spending  
showdown in which Clinton, as he has in past years, wins billions 
in extra spending from a GOP nervous that a politically costly 
government shutdown would result otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hope when those negotiations occur this fall -- as  
seems all but certain -- they will be able to limit spending 
increases and win something else in return, such as tax cuts, GOP 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1997 budget pact -- and under a GOP-written budget for  
2000 that Congress approved in April -- lawmakers must hold spending 
to $538 billion next year for all federal agencies. That excludes 
Social Security, interest to federal debt holders and other 
automatically required benefits and payments. The overall federal 
budget is $1.7 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a blueprint approved last month, House Republicans would  
spend $270 billion for the Pentagon, $19 billion more than this 
year. That leaves $268 billion for the 12 other bills: $25 billion 
less than this year, and more than $30 billion below what Clinton 
has requested.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Agriculture Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House passed a $61 billion measure today  
for financing farm and food programs next year, the first of the 13 
annual spending bills for fiscal 2000 to win approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Over Democratic objections, the bill was passed on a near  
party-line 246-183 vote. The Senate has yet to write its version. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it would spend about $1.6 billion less than this year  
and $6 billion less than President Clinton requested. But about 
$6.5 billion of this year's total was emergency spending Congress 
approved in response to low commodity prices and diminished 
overseas demand for U.S. agricultural products. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would increase spending for agriculture research and  
food inspections, but reduce rural development, crop insurance and 
Agriculture Department construction programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Included is $21.6 billion for food stamps, $1 billion less than  
this year and $5.7 billion below Clinton's proposal. It also has 
$800 million for conservation, $7 million above this year but $67 
million less than Clinton wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill had a troubled journey through the House.  
</P>
<P>
	It bogged down last month after conservatives unhappy with its  
price tag forced two days' of votes on amendments. And it passed 
Tuesday only after a near party-line 234-195 vote to cut it by $102 
million as part of a plan by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., 
to get spending bills moving and satisfy conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also contained language by Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.,  
continuing a ban on the use of federal funds for testing or 
approving abortion-inducing drugs like RU-486, the French pill.

<HEADLINE> Woods Plans Event for Foundation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In August, Tiger Woods will take part in the ``Showdown at  
Sherwood'' with David Duval. Perhaps his latest venture should be 
called the ``Rumble at Rio Secco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods' camp is working out the final details on an  
end-of-the-year tournament at Rio Secco Golf Club in Las Vegas, 
according to two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament will feature the top 10 players and two wild-card  
picks by Woods to compete for a purse that is said to be in excess 
of $2 million. Additional money from television rights and a title 
sponsor would benefit the Tiger Woods Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for IMG, Woods' management firm, said only that the  
event is still being discussed and could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether the field would come from the top 10 on  
the money list or the world rankings -- or what the event would be 
called. One source said Woods' name would not be part of the 
tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
	The promoters would also have to pay a release fee to the PGA  
Tour, which the source said would likely be about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RATINGS:* Overnight ratings suggest the U.S. Women's Open  
suffered going up against Tiger Woods in the Memorial Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS Sports, which broadcast the Memorial for the first time  
since 1988, had an overnight rating of 4.8 and a 13 share, up 30 
percent from a year ago when it was 3.7 and a 9 share. It was the 
highest overnight for the Memorial as far back as records go (10 
years). 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Juli Inkster's five-stroke victory in the Women's  
Open gave NBC Sports a 2.0 with a 4 share, down 35 percent from a 
year ago (3.1/8). 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very tough weekend with a lot going on,'' said NBC  
spokesman Ed Markey, noting that NBC was on the air from 9 a.m. 
with the French Open and ending at 9 p.m. with the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each network point represents 994,000 
homes. The share is the percentage tuned to a program among those 
televisions on at the time. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PENNEY CHANGES:* LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw will be in Dallas  
later this month to meet with JC Penney about sponsoring a 
full-field tournament. The opportunity arose when Penney decided to 
end its sponsorship of the Mixed Team Classic and instead focus on 
the LPGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed we're not going to have the mixed team  
concept, but the good news is the sponsor is staying with us,'' 
Votaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the details to work out is where the tournament would be  
played, when it would fit in the schedule and the size of the 
purse. If Penney commits the same money to the LPGA as it did with 
the Mixed Team ($2 million purse, divided evenly among tours), the 
LPGA could get another $1 million tournament as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the PGA Tour has given the green light to Suncoast  
Golf Group to put together the Greater Tampa Open, an official 
event with a $2.4 million purse that will be played Oct. 19-22 
opposite the 2000 Presidents Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Suncoast is working on a PGA Tour team event in non-Presidents  
Cup years or when the cup is played in December in the southern 
hemisphere. That event would be unofficial. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *KUCHAR AD:* Matt Kuchar nearly ran into eligibility problems on  
the eve of the NCAA Championships because MasterCard used his image 
in an advertisement called ``A Priceless Moment'' in this month's 
issue of Golf Digest. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Golfweek magazine, the ad was published without  
Kuchar's knowledge and he was not paid. Georgia Tech officials took 
care of the problem before the tournament started. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly did not want to do anything to jeopardize his  
eligibility,'' said Jeff Price of MasterCard, who wrote Tech an 
apology to say the implied endorsement in the ad was ``an 
inadvertent error on our part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar found out about the controversy the day before the first  
round. He shot a 15-over 159 at Hazeltine, and No. 2 Georgia Tech 
missed the cut by 18 strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it upset me,'' Kuchar said. ``I wish I could  
attribute something to my bad play, but I can't. I just didn't have 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BRADLEY SHUN:* Should the USGA women's committee stay true to  
its word, Nancy Lopez better get her game together if she wants 
another shot at the U.S. Open next year at the Merit Club in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadly missing at Old Waverly was Pat Bradley, the 1981 Open  
champion and only woman to win the LPGA's modern grand slam. She 
hoped to receive an exemption, but the USGA did not offer one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sitting here, basically in shock,'' she told the Boston  
Globe during the Open. ``It does not seem right. I gave 25 years of 
my life to the United States Women's Open and felt I deserved 
better treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USGA gave exemptions this year to Lopez and Jane Geddes.  
Bradley received one last year and missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We usually give past champions an exemption the first year,  
and that was last year for Pat,'' Mary Capouch, head of the women's 
committee, said. She said great champions often get a second 
exemption, through rarely in consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	That does not bode well for Lopez, unless the USGA changes its  
mind. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* No one is trying to jump on the senior tour gravy  
train like Mike McCullough. Since 1996, he has played in 89 
consecutive events for which he has been eligible. ... Phil 
Mickelson, whose wife has had a difficult pregnancy, plans to be at 
Pinehurst for the U.S. Open. The latest checkup revealed that the 
baby is healthy and that Amy is likely to go the full term. The due 
date is June 30. ... Grace Park skipped the award ceremony for low 
amateur in the U.S. Women's Open because she had a plane to catch. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* The last three women's majors have been won  
by scores of 18-under (du Maurier), 19-under (Dinah Shore) and 
16-under (U.S. Open). 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINAL WORD:* ``I would like to think of myself as an athlete  
first, but I don't want to do a disservice to the real ones.'' -- 
David Duval.

<HEADLINE> The Blossoming of 'Niche' TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In 1980, when there were fewer than two dozen  
cable networks and only 15 million households receiving them, a 
station called ESPN was just getting off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time the conventional wisdom was that an all-sports  
network would never work, that it was too narrow to really be 
viable,'' said Roger Werner, who would become CEO of ESPN within a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the cable universe reaches 67 million homes and 174  
channels, ESPN's revenues are over $1 billion, and nobody could 
possibly call it narrow. ``Narrow,'' or ``niche network'' as the 
industry calls it, now means an all-golf channel, or an 
all-anthropology channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus will likely get narrower, too, since technology  
eventually will increase the number of cable channels reaching each 
household from dozens to hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Werner, now CEO of two niche networks, shows how things are  
going. His Speed Vision covers fast cars, boats and planes, while 
Outdoor Life hits everything from windsurfing to adventure 
expeditions to environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The networks I've been involved in have moved from the more  
generic to the more specialized,'' said Werner. ``The magazine 
business and the print business were the inspiration for both of 
these channels -- look how many titles are devoted to vehicles and 
outdoor recreation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another niche network called The Box goes even further. It  
allows viewers to pick music videos from playlists scrolled on the 
screen, and then call in and get them broadcast for $2 per request. 
</P>
<P>
	The offerings vary by region and even neighborhood, with 160  
different playlists around the country -- ranging from Latin, 
country and top 40 to alternative rock, classic rock and rap-urban. 
Radio playlists, record sales and viewer preference all influence 
what's offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. has a very diverse musical audience that has  
different tastes depending on the region,'' said Alan McGlade, CEO 
of The Box. ``We think this is the wave of the future. People are 
more and more going to demand something that really speaks to them 
and is responsive to them. You see -- in every area of development 
in TV and the Internet -- customization and personalization of 
programming to specific niche audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	One special-interest network that seemed like a gamble but  
became a sensation was the Golf Network, with legend Arnold Palmer 
at its helm. Just four years old, the station has already turned a 
profit and reaches 23 million households with its tournaments, 
instructional programs and talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forty-year-old guys can't go out and play football, but they  
can do this,'' said Golf Channel spokeswoman Debbie Sweeney. ``It 
definitely has been the secret of our success. A lot of people 
become hooked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, some niche networks are trying to widen their  
appeal after having gotten a foot in the door. The Food Network, 
for example, will be introducing a new batch of programs in July 
designed to increase its audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The station now reaches 40 million homes, but Larry Gerbrandt, a  
senior analyst with the media research consulting firm Paul Kagan 
Associates, says cable stations ``usually don't begin to approach 
profitability till somewhere in the 25 million subscriber range. 
And you're not really considered a success until you get about 50 
million people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a specialized audience that I can best describe as  
foodies,'' said Food Network President Eric Ober. ``What we're 
attempting to do is to go the other way, to broaden the category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While keeping popular shows like ``Emeril Live,'' featuring New  
Orleans chef Emeril Lagasse, the Food Network is branching out from 
traditional cooking shows and restaurant profiles by adding nine 
new shows ``where food is part of lifestyle,'' Ober said. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Calling All Cooks,'' Ober says, ``we literally go to  
people's neighborhoods and get family recipes.'' ``Food 911'' he 
describes as ``an action-adventure show.'' Viewers can contact the 
Food Network with food emergencies -- like a boss suddenly coming 
for dinner -- and a team will be dispatched to prepare a meal. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Iron Chef,'' a subtitled Japanese game show, chefs compete  
to create a meal featuring unusual ingredients like ostrich eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerbrandt says the Food Network's efforts to attract an audience  
beyond people interested in cooking is typical of a niche network 
becoming more mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get on (the air) you have to be specialized. But once you  
get an audience, you have to generalize,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broadcasting &AMP; Cable Yearbook lists dozens of wannabe niche  
networks -- stations that exist in concept, with offices, financing, 
a collection of taped programs ready to air, and even sponsors 
eager to advertise. The problem is finding distributors -- cable 
companies willing to carry them in an increasingly crowded field. 
</P>
<P>
	Although new digital technology is expected to increase to  
hundreds the number of stations available within the decade, many 
cable customers today get only 60 or 70 channels. So competition 
for a channel is intense. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those stations that exist on paper only are the Arts &AMP;  
Antiques Network. Its originator, Doug Ritter, has been trying to 
launch it for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideas for shows are plentiful, Ritter said. ``But what it takes  
is distribution. That proverbial 500-channel universe has to happen 
for us niche networks to get going. ... We know we have a giant 
audience but there's no way to get to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few other niche start-ups believe they will find distributors  
soon. Anthropology Programming and Entertainment -- APE -- would 
feature programs on evolution, primates and human culture. BookNet 
will have author interviews, children's programs, and shows about 
various genres -- mysteries, science fiction, romance novels, 
poetry. 
</P>
<P>
	But not every good idea gets its chance, said Gerbrandt, the  
industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of ideas fall by the wayside because they can't get  
anybody's attention,'' he said. ``Basically two or three cable 
networks wind up getting launched each year. For every one that 
gets on, there's probably 10 that try and fail.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Fall on Inflation Fear / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury prices fell Tuesday, briefly boosting  
30-year bond yields above 6 percent for the first time in more than 
a year, amid speculation that the Federal Reserve will boost 
interest rates at its meeting later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/8 point,  
or $3.75 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, edged above 6 percent during the session before 
settling at 5.99 percent, up from late Monday's 5.96 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Tuesday, William Poole, president of the Federal  
Reserve Bank of St. Louis, suggested that he believed inflation has 
returned to the economy, causing bond and stock prices to tumble. 
On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average 
fell 143.74 points to 10,765.64. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bond market can't get out of its own way,'' said Charles  
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities, 
noting that at current yeilds, bonds are perceived as a favorable 
alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed, which already has adopted a bias toward raising  
interest rates to contain inflation, is scheduled to meet on June 
29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.60 percent as the  
discount fell 0.03 percentage points from Monday's auction rate to 
4.48 percent. Six-month yields were 4.96 percent, as the discount 
rose 0.01 percentage point from Monday's auction rate to 4.77 
percent. One-year yields were 5.06 percent as the discount rose by 
0.01 percentage point from late Monday to 4.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 percent from 4.75 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/8 to 121 1/32. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.43 percent, up from 5.42 percent late Monday.

	MANCHESTER, Tenn. (AP) -- Looking for the perfect gift for that  
die-hard country music fan? 
</P>
<P>
	George Jones' mangled sports utility vehicle, a black Lexus  
LX470, is on sale for $22,000 at Fann's Auto Salvage. The salvage 
yard acquired the vehicle after Jones wrecked it March 6 in an 
accident that nearly killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	A grainy picture of the crumpled vehicle tops the salvage yard's  
advertisement in the June 11 issue of the ``Wheels &AMP; Deals'' 
shopper publication, with a promise that Fann's ``has parts to fix 
many of our cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of people come look at it,'' said salesman  
Terry Henderson. ``Somebody will buy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and violating the  
state's open-container law in the accident. He promised to complete 
alcohol counseling and was fined $550.

<HEADLINE> Stars' Experience Could Pay Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Joe Nieuwendyk has waited 10 years for another  
shot at the Stanley Cup, which might seem like a lifetime to him. A 
lifetime is exactly what all the Buffalo Sabres have waited. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one of the reasons the Dallas Stars are given an edge  
over the Sabres in the Stanley Cup finals -- because Nieuwendyk and 
several of his teammates have won 10 titles compared to no one on 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	How important is the Stanley Cup-winning experience in the  
finals? 
</P>
<P>
	``That experience will come in handy, if we get down a game or a  
goal,'' said Mike Keane, who has already won two Cups with other 
teams. ``We are going to hopefully use the experience with the 
group of players we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Carbonneau is another two-Cup winner on the Stars. The other  
Cup winners: Craig Ludwig, Brian Skrudland, Shawn Chambers, Sergei 
Zubov and Doug Lidster. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, all these players won their Stanley Cups with other  
teams. The Stars and the Sabres, whose best-of-7 series begins 
tonight at Reunion Arena, are still looking for their first Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	While playing in Minnesota, the North Stars reached the finals  
twice, in 1981 and 1991. The Sabres' only other appearance in the 
finals was 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbonneau, who played most of his career with the Montreal  
Canadiens, has had the most playoff experience of anyone in this 
year's finals -- 202 games. Overall, the Dallas players have 
participated in a combined 1,985 playoff games. That's almost twice 
as many as the Sabres, with 1,023. 
</P>
<P>
	For Nieuwendyk, returning to the Stanley Cup finals has been a  
big emotional payoff. His last appearance was in 1989, with the 
Cup-winning Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all happens so fast that you don't really have a chance to  
enjoy it,'' he said. ``Now I appreciate coming back a little bit 
more. I think after you go through some of the wars and the pain 
and agony of an NHL season, you realize how tough it is to get back 
to the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're 22 years old and you have a young team like we did  
in Calgary, you think it is going to be easy. You think this is the 
way it is going to be in the NHL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carbonneau has been especially helpful to the Stars' younger  
players, according to Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock, and not only 
because of his Cup experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never met a player with that type of feel for the game,''  
Hitchcock said of the 39-year-old center. ``He is one step ahead of 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for the Stars' role as favorites was their  
regular-season performance: For the second straight season, they 
won the Presidents' Trophy for the best record in the NHL at 
51-19-12. The Sabres, meanwhile, finished seventh in the Eastern 
Conference with a 37-28-17 record, 23 points behind the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams split their two regular-season games.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are obviously the underdog,'' Sabres captain Mike  
Peca said. ``But it is a role we are comfortable with, starting on 
the road especially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars advanced to the finals with series wins over Edmonton,  
St. Louis and Colorado. Buffalo, which is 5-3 on the road in the 
playoffs, ousted Ottawa, Boston and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you need to have a Stanley Cup ring to have  
seasoning,'' Buffalo's Dixon Ward said. ``I think we got some good 
seasoning in the last couple of rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek said he hasn't thought about the  
supposed advantage the Stars have with their Stanley Cup 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The Stanley Cup) is my only focus in the next one or two  
weeks, to do everything to bring a Stanley Cup to Buffalo,'' Hasek 
said. ``I don't really (care) what other people think. It is not 
important to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing for me is to do everything to win  
four games.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Victims' Funds Near $5 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Nearly $5 million has been raised to  
help victims of the Columbine High School shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 30 funds established to help the victims say the  
outpouring of support has created the problem of how to distribute 
the money, with some families disagreeing on how the money should 
be divided. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities and victim advocates are hoping answers on  
questionnaires handed in Monday by victims' families will help them 
decide how to dole out the donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might have been easier to have decided the way to allocate  
the money at the beginning, but it wouldn't have been right,'' said 
Aura Leigh Ferguson, the district attorney's community programs 
director. ``We are just now learning what people's needs and the 
victims' needs are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relief funds were established soon after the April 20 rampage at  
Columbine. Students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 
classmates and a teacher before committing suicide. Twenty-three 
others were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3.2 million Healing Fund is the largest. In addition to  
fund, 29 scholarship, memorial and other funds have raised at least 
$1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The questionnaires asked the families whether victims should all  
receive an equal lump sum, a lump sum based on established 
priorities or whether the money should be distributed as requested 
based on financial needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Survey results won't be tallied for a couple of weeks.

<HEADLINE> Bias Charges Filed in N.J. Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- Eight people accused of torturing a  
retarded man for kicks have been indicted on bias charges in what 
may be the nation's first such case involving a disabled person. 
</P>
<P>
	In indictments announced Monday, the defendants, ages 19 to 23,  
were charged with kidnapping, harassment and conspiracy stemming 
from a Jan. 30 party in Keansburg. The bias charges would double 
the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, some of the defendants could get up to 30 years in  
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Physical and mental handicaps were added to New Jersey's bias  
law a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tormented this mentally disabled man because of his  
disability,'' said prosecutor John Kaye. ``They did it to him 
because they could, because they could manipulate him and because 
they believed he could not tell on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bias charges applied in a case of a disabled person are  
probably unique in the United States, said Stuart Van Meveren, a 
Colorado deputy district attorney and co-chairman of the bias crime 
committee of the National Association of District Attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Eric Krochmaluk was taped to a chair and  
forced to perform embarrassing acts. His eyebrows were shaved, and 
he was burned with cigarettes, choked and beaten, then abandoned in 
a forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said he also was attacked during at least two other  
parties after being lured with a promise that he could meet a 
pretty girl.

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Wil Cordero broke his left wrist while making a  
sliding catch in the sixth inning of Cleveland's game against the 
Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, making his 20th start in left field, bent his wrist  
back awkwardly as he caught a sinking liner hit by Milwaukee's 
Jeromy Burnitz. 
</P>
<P>
	After making the grab, Cordero threw the ball back into the  
infield as he attempted to catch a runner at second base. He then 
fell down in pain as his teammates and an Indians trainer came to 
his aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero will undergo surgery Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, signed by the Indians during the offseason, is batting  
.316 with five homers and 26 RBIs. He missed five games early in 
the season with a bruised right wrist and missed eight more with a 
bruised right heel.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers May Join Other Professions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People may soon be able to do one-stop  
shopping for legal, financial and other professional help. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest lawyers' group said today it will consider  
whether it's time to end the longtime ban in all 50 states on 
lawyers forming partnerships with other professionals such as 
accountants, psychologists and social workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many clients have a legitimate need for a network of  
professional services,'' Philip S. Anderson, president of the 
American Bar Association, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, some people might want accounting or financial  
planning advice in addition to legal help. Lawyers who practice 
family law might form partnerships with psychologists or social 
workers to aid people who are being divorced or need to arrange 
care for elderly relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is spurred in part by changes in Europe and other  
areas of the world where major international accounting firms are 
being allowed to provide legal services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Market forces cannot be stopped, but they can be channeled,''  
Anderson said, adding that the proposal is intended to keep pace 
with a global economy while making sure legal ethics rules apply to 
lawyers no matter where they work. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed ethics rule changes could occur as early as 2001,  
but only if approved next year by the ABA's policy-making House of 
Delegates and then by authorities who regulate lawyers' ethics in 
each state. An initial ABA vote on whether to draft a final 
recommendation is expected in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The decades-old rules barring lawyers from forming partnerships  
with nonlawyers were intended to protect lawyers' independent 
judgment, protect confidential client information and ensure 
lawyers' loyalty to their clients by avoiding conflicts of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said the proposals are intended to keep those  
protections by making the same legal ethics rules apply to all 
lawyers, whether they work in a traditional law firm or in a 
partnership with other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	Other professions have ethics rules that may conflict, however,  
such as mental health care workers' obligation to report suspected 
cases of child abuse. Clients would have to be told of such 
differing obligations, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	And an official with the Securities and Exchange Commission told  
the ABA panel the role of auditors and lawyers are incompatible 
under federal securities law. That issue is being studied further 
by an SEC standards board. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson acknowledged some ABA members oppose the proposed  
changes. But he said they are intended to help both large and small 
firms that want to join forces with other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a proposal that will permit a variety of novel  
combinations that will provide greater services to the public,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Cop Guilty in Torture Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A white policeman was convicted today of holding  
down a Haitian immigrant in a stationhouse bathroom while another 
officer brutalized him with a broken broomstick. Three other 
officers were acquitted in the racially explosive case. 
</P>
<P>
	The split verdict came two weeks after Officer Justin Volpe --  
the central figure in the trial -- pleaded guilty to torturing Abner 
Louima with the stick. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against five white officers heightened racial tensions  
between the Police Department and minorities and touched off 
protests. But it also brought about the collapse of the ``blue wall 
of silence'' that keeps police from testifying against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The anonymous jury of eight whites, three Hispanics and one  
black deliberated 18 hours over three days in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Charles Schwarz, 33, sat impassively as the jury  
convicted him of violating Louima's civil rights. Schwarz was 
immediately taken into custody as his supporters wept in the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Volpe could get life in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Volpe rammed a broomstick up Louima's rectum as he lay  
handcuffed in a bathroom on Aug. 9, 1997. Louima suffered severe 
internal injuries, including a ruptured bladder and colon, and 
spent two months in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll say something that I've never said before: The jury  
reached the wrong verdict,'' said Stephen Worth, Schwarz's 
attorney. ``I'm sure they were under pressure to convict somebody, 
but they got it wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louima, 32, was not in the courtroom for the verdict but said  
later that the decision fell short of what he had hoped for. 
Louima, who is suing the city for $155 million, added: ``I am 
confident in the end that complete justice will be done in my case. 
I hope what comes out of my case is change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz was acquitted of beating Louima inside a police car  
before the bathroom attack. Also acquitted in the alleged beating 
were Thomas Wiese, 35, and Thomas Bruder, 33. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did nothing wrong that night,'' Bruder said outside the  
courtroom, where he hugged Wiese. ``I didn't do anything wrong. I 
treated Mr. Louima like a gentleman that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louima had testified that Bruder came to his aid after the  
bathroom attack by taking off his handcuffs and helping him dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Michael Bellomo, 37, was acquitted of lying to cover up the  
false arrests of Louima and another Haitian man, who were picked up 
during a melee outside a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I didn't do anything wrong, and the jury saw that,''  
Bellomo said outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruder, Wiese and Schwarz still face conspiracy charges for  
allegedly lying to investigators by saying Schwarz was not in the 
bathroom during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima provided some of the trial's most riveting testimony. He  
testified he was arrested, beaten and finally tortured in a filthy 
bathroom stall -- an account bolstered by the testimony of four 
police officers credited with shattering the blue wall of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was interrupted on May 25 by Volpe's dramatic guilty  
plea. The stocky, square-jawed patrolman admitted brutalizing 
Louima in the mistaken belief that Louima had sucker-punched him 
outside the nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, said Tuesday that before the  
plea, Volpe gave prosecutors the name of a second officer he 
claimed was in the bathroom with him -- and that it wasn't Schwarz. 
``They've convicted the wrong man,'' Kornberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Alan Vinegrad would not address Kornberg's claim,  
other to say that Volpe -- as ``the perpetrator of one of the most 
horrific sexual assaults in modern history'' -- was not credible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a veteran civil rights activist, said  
he was not disappointed by the split decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived with worse than this,'' Daughtry said. ``What it  
says, finally, is that this man told the truth. We keep on 
struggling and maybe next time justice will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir  
praised the officers who stepped foward to testify against their 
colleagues. Giuliani said the police testimony ``made possible the 
convictions.''

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley Defends Firing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former investment analyst who alleged racial  
discrimination in a $1.35 billion lawsuit against a prominent Wall 
Street firm used the courts in a ``well-orchestrated extortion 
scheme,'' the firm said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This lawsuit is totally without merit,'' Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter said in papers filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in 
response to a lawsuit filed two weeks ago by 25-year-old Christian 
Curry. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry said he worked for Morgan Stanley as a real estate analyst  
for 10 months until he was fired in April 1998 because he was black 
and was thought to be homosexual because nude photos of him 
appeared in a gay men's magazine. He was accompanied at a May 19 
news conference to announce his lawsuit by his fiancee, a 
21-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest securities firm said in its papers that  
Curry's allegations that Morgan Stanley discriminates against 
minorities or supports a hostile work environment ``is a vicious 
falsehood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Curry was fired after it discovered 14 separate  
instances in which Curry had falsified ``overtime meal'' receipts 
totalling hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Curry's repeated submission of fraudulent expense account  
reports constituted the sole basis for his termination,'' the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley called his allegations sensationalistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``This action is nothing more than a well-orchestrated extortion  
scheme cloaked with a caption and docket number,'' the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Morgan Stanley suspended two executives, saying it  
had made a mistake in making a $10,000 payment to a police 
informant whose information helped lead to the arrest of Curry. It 
did not identify the executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry was arrested last summer by undercover police who said  
they had caught him conspiring to plant racist e-mail in the firm's 
computer system, apparently to support his planned discrimination 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	After learning of the $10,000 payment, prosecutors last month  
dropped the charges against Curry. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley said in its court papers that it ``did not entrap  
Curry, did not manufacture any evidence and did not need any fake 
evidence to defeat Curry's bogus claim of discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also said Curry never during his employment brought any  
allegations of racial misconduct to anyone's attention at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
	At his news conference, Curry had said he was once asked at a  
Christmas party to mock one of Morgan Stanley's black executives by 
wearing an Afro wig and making his lips appear larger. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, the son of a surgeon who grew up in the Westchester  
County town of Chappaqua, said he never complained because he was 
raised ``to rise above any racism or ignorance like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A message left with his lawyer Monday was not immediately  
returned.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Filed Against Denny's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A group of 30 black middle school students and  
their chaperones are suing Denny's for racial discrimination, 
saying they were mistreated at a Florida restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, says the group  
from Ashburton Elementary-Middle School had to wait an excessive 
amount of time to be seated and served during a visit to a Denny's 
in Ocoee, Fla., in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members also received drinks in dirty glasses, including  
one that appeared to have spit in the bottom, according to the 
lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The group had to wait so long for service that some of the  
students actually fell asleep on their respective tables and had to 
be carried out of the restaurant,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Hood-Phillips, chief diversity officer at South  
Carolina-based Advantica Restaurant Group, parent company of 
Denny's, said an internal inquiry turned up no evidence of 
wrongdoing. She said the chain ``will be litigating this 
vigorously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hood-Phillips said Monday that the arrival of the large group  
without notice brought the restaurant ``to a standstill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Service ``took too long, but there was no discrimination,'' she  
said. ``We are a lightning rod for these kinds of allegations 
because of our history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denny's has been operating under a consent decree not to  
discriminate since reaching a $46 million agreement with the 
federal government in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The consent decree settled claims by black Secret Service  
agents, who said they could not get breakfast at a Denny's in 
Annapolis while their white colleagues were served quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	When allegations by the Ashburton group arose a year ago, the  
company's president apologized to the group and promised swift 
action if an investigation revealed discrimination had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall N. Perkins, one of the attorneys representing the  
group, said it was clear that Denny's had not ``met the obligations 
it undertook'' in the consent decree.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses Support Astros Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The owner of the Houston Astros gained support  
from three witnesses who insisted he made no derogatory remarks 
about the Hispanic community, as a Spanish-language broadcaster 
said he did. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses say that executives from KTMD-TV misinterpreted a  
conversation with Drayton McLane before an awards banquet last 
Thursday. KTMD-TV reported that McLane said Hispanics couldn't 
understand baseball, bought cheap seats and didn't patronize the 
concession stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Camacho, vice president and general manager at KTMD, and  
Rod Rodriguez, the station's sales manager, made the accusations on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising buyer Ron Lucas said Camacho took the remarks  
``totally out of context'' because McLane was talking in general 
terms about his problems marketing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas and his wife, Lori, told the Houston Chronicle and KRIV-TV  
in Houston that they were present for the conversation and that 
Camacho and his two executives misinterpreted it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only reason that conversation was talking about Hispanics  
is he was talking with Hispanics from a Hispanic broadcasting 
station,'' Lucas said. ``I think he felt the same way about Anglos, 
African-Americans and Asian-Americans. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has a right to hear what they want to hear,'' he  
said. ``But as an Anglo, I didn't hear (McLane say) that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tami Weitkunat, an advertising consultant, said Camacho  
misrepresented the portion of the conversation she heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of explaining the Astros don't market to Hispanics  
because they buy cheap tickets, Weitkunat said, McLane was 
responding to a question about the high cost of attending sporting 
events by noting that the Astros have $2 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho had said McLane made the comments to a small group at a  
cocktail party before a banquet hosted by the Houston Advertising 
Foundation, which presented McLane with the Trailblazer Award for 
community service. The station later reported McLane's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho said he was under the impression that Lucas agreed with  
KTMB executives' interpretation of the comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just absolutely stunned and disappointed that Ron would  
change his position on this,'' Camacho told KRIV. 
</P>
<P>
	Weitkunat and Mrs. Lucas said they complained to Camacho later  
in the evening when they heard he might broadcast a story about the 
conversation, which was not taped. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassandra Castellano, a KTMD spokeswoman, said the station  
stands by its story. The Astros declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Michelle Smith: My Career Is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- An arbitration panel has rejected  
the claim of Olympic swimming star Michelle Smith de Bruin that 
positive drug samples either were not hers or that a third party 
manipulated the samples. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dublin, Ireland, Smith de Bruin said today the decision meant  
an end to her career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am saddened that my career has ended in this way, but now  
(husband) Erik and I must look to the future and decide where we go 
from here,'' said the triple gold medal winner at the 1996 Atlanta 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued by her Dublin lawyer, Peter Lennon, Smith  
insisted her victories ``are not hollow and were achieved without 
the use of any illegal performance-enhancing drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The international swimming federation (FINA) banned Smith after  
finding her guilty of contaminating a urine sample with alcohol 
during an out-of-competition test in January 1998. The alcohol 
could mask the presence of banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld that ban.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith accused FINA of deliberately targeting her and accused the  
three-member CAS arbitration panel of accepting others' 
circumstantial evidence rather than her direct testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will forever cherish my moments of victory and hope that  
those who still believe in me will also cherish their memories of 
those times,'' she said. ``I hope that you will not believe that I 
have brought this country into disrepute or that I have let you 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying statement, her lawyer said Smith would give  
no interviews. He made no mention of any appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon previously raised the possibility of taking the case to  
the European Court for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is ineligible for the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the 2001  
world championships. She is 29 years old and will be 33 when the 
ban expires in August 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA said the samples were adulterated with alcohol, possibly  
masking the presence of banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-member CAS panel dismissed her contention that the  
burden of proof was on FINA to eliminate all possibilities other 
than manipulation by the swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the facts of the case and the evidence before them,  
the arbitrators were of the opinion that FINA had convinced them 
that (Smith) was the only person who had the motive and opportunity 
to manipulate the sample,'' the CAS statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling comes 17 months after the disputed test.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time FINA has had a manipulation case,'' Gunnar  
Werner, FINA's honorary secretary, said by telephone from Sweden. 
``Manipulation is a bad crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is more or less two abuses in one -- manipulating samples to  
cover up something else. Hopefully this will warn others not to try 
anything of the same kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon called the 35-page ruling ``fairly comprehensive'' and  
said he will have a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who emerged from relative obscurity to become one of the  
stars of the 1996 Games, submitted to a surprise, 
out-of-competition drug test at her home in Kilkenny, Ireland, on 
Jan. 10, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA later reported the sample was contaminated with a  
concentration of alcohol so high it would have killed a person had 
it been a legitimate sample. Analysis of the backup sample at an 
IOC laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, confirmed the finding. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith denied any wrongdoing and appealed the ban. She appeared  
at a CAS hearing in Lausanne on May 3-4. Lennon maintained there 
were major flaws in the testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's spectacular results in Atlanta -- winning gold in the  
400-meter medley, 400 freestyle and 200 individual medley, and 
bronze in the 200 butterfly -- led to accusations she used 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith repeatedly denied doing so. She said she had been  
tested more often than her rivals, and each time the result was 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicions were also fueled because of Smith's coach and  
husband. Erik de Bruin, a Dutch discus thrower and shot putter, was 
banned for four years after testing positive for excessive 
testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAS arbitration panel was led by Yves Fortier of Canada. The  
other arbitrators were lawyers Michael Beloff of Britain and Dennis 
Oswald of Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Offers Song Downloads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com, the Internet's largest online music  
retailer, launched its first foray into digital music downloads 
today by offering free song files on its Web site as a teaser for 
CD sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The online retailer hopes the availability of top-notch tunes by  
such well known artists as Sarah McLachlan, Lyle Lovett, and Public 
Enemy will mark a smooth segue into a pay-per-song download format 
in the future on its well-traveled Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a really exciting time now for the music  
industry. It gives music fans access to far more music than they 
had before,'' said Amazon.com spokesman Greg Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	While the initial music lineup doesn't include any chart-topping  
hits, digital music downloads provide Web surfers with a new way to 
try out the latest recordings from well-known artists free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The songs are available in the popular MP3 and Liquid Audio  
formats. Amazon.com will continue to offer both formats until a 
collection of industry leaders settle on a common standard that 
will serve the needs of both manufacturers and consumers, Hart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two formats are not interchangeable, a concern for Hart and  
many other would-be online music providers looking to make a 
seamless transition from traditional music sales to Internet-based 
downloads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our worry is that you may see a situation similar to Betamax  
vs. VHS (videotape formats),'' he said. ``It's not good for the 
customer because you have multiple formats that aren't compatible 
with each other.''

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Trial Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing the difficulty of convening a poll of  
300 potential jurors during the summer, a federal judge has 
postponed the trial of former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros for 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros was indicted in December 1997 on charges he lied to the  
FBI about $250,000 in payments he made to a former mistress after 
their affair ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally scheduled for July 6, the trial now is to begin in  
mid-September. At a hearing Monday, U.S. District Judge Stanley 
Sporkin set the start of jury selection for Sept. 7, with the trial 
expected to begin a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Cisneros' defense team filed a motion Monday seeking  
a psychiatric examination of the woman, Linda Jones, who has agreed 
to cooperate with the independent counsel prosecuting her former 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros lawyer Barry Simon cited both Ms. Jones' addiction to a  
prescription medication used to treat depression and a recent 
competency motion she filed. In it she denied she was competent 
when she pleaded guilty in January 1998 to multiple counts stemming 
from the Cisneros investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who previously went by her married name Medlar, is a  
major part of the government's case against Cisneros. Currently 
serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence, she is due to testify at a 
hearing Sporkin has set for June 21 on the admissibility of tapes 
she secretly made during telephone conversations with Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Jackowski opposed the request. He noted a  
federal judge in Lubbock, Texas, where Ms. Jones was sentenced, 
rejected a motion she filed in March seeking to vacate her guilty 
plea on the ground that she was incompetent because of her 
prescription drug usage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporkin delayed further arguments on the psychiatric exam until  
the June 21 hearing, at which Ms. Jones is expected to testify for 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros served as housing secretary from 1993 to 1996 and now  
heads the Spanish-language television network Univision. He has 
pleaded innocent to accusations that he vastly underreported his 
payments to Ms. Jones as well as lying about the timing of the 
payments.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Ease Computer Export Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Clinton administration is making plans to  
ease government restrictions on the sale of high-powered computers 
to more than 100 countries, the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department has proposed changes in export rules on  
sales to most countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Central 
and Eastern Europe, unidentified administration sources told the 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, however, will not loosen restrictions on  
China and some 50 other countries, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of eased controls come just two weeks after a House  
report outlining 20 years of Chinese espionage against the United 
States. A congressional panel, chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, 
concluded China has been involved in the theft of nuclear secrets 
from U.S. weapons labs -- including culling key military information 
from commercial purchases of high-powered computers and other 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials who spoke to the Times on condition of  
anonymity said the White House has not yet determined how much to 
ease controls on computer sales but generally agrees with industry 
assertions that technological advances have surpassed current 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials and others have contended the  
increasing availability of high-powered computers from foreign 
countries has prompted U.S. officials to consider a change in 
policy, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government regulates the overseas sale of computers  
based on their speed, measured by how many millions of theoretical 
operations the machines can perform per second. 
</P>
<P>
	To sell to the countries that would be included in the proposed  
export changes, computer makers have to get government licenses for 
any machine that can perform more than 10,000 of the operations per 
second, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the China report's release, Cox said tighter controls on  
technology exports are needed but warned unilateral U.S. action 
would only push China to get the technology elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found that China got some of its high-powered  
computers from third-party nations that resold American products.

<HEADLINE> Savior of USS Intrepid Eulogized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 1,000 military officers joined public  
officials, family and friends on the deck of the USS Intrepid to 
remember Zachary Fisher, who saved the battle-scarred World War II 
carrier and turned it into a floating historical museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he never served in the military, Fisher was eulogized  
Monday as a consummate American patriot. Fisher died Friday of 
complications from pneumonia. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	``We honor a true giant among men,'' said Gen. Henry Shelton,  
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``As Will Rogers once said, 
`We can't all be heroes. Some of us have to stand on the curb and 
clap as they go by.' Today we stand on the curb, and wave farewell 
as a genuine patriot goes by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, a builder and philantrophist who was rejected by the  
Marine Corps in 1942 because of bad knees from years as a 
bricklayer, purchased the Intrepid for $25 million in 1976, saving 
it from demolition. 
</P>
<P>
	He converted it into the world's largest sea-air-space museum.  
The Intrepid, its decks loaded with aircraft and historical 
exhibits, draws hundreds of thousands of visitors a year to its 
Hudson River pier. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher set up scholarships for children of slain military  
personnel, and built 28 Fisher Houses on the grounds of military 
hospitals to house families visiting sick or injured service 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Former FBI assistant director James Kallstrom, chairman of the  
Marine Corps Law Enforcement Association, said Fisher, who sat on 
the group's board, was noted for his kindness toward others. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was what Zach was all about,'' Kallstrom said. ``And  
because of the size of his heart and his wealth he could spread 
that goodness in so many locations, and he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Gov. George Pataki, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Navy  
Secretary Richard Danzig, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, and Cardinal John 
O'Connor spoke at the three-hour memorial, emceed by former CBS 
newsman Walter Cronkite. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stern, a longtime friend of Fisher, told how Fisher worked  
to have a black sailor properly credited nearly 50 years later for 
heroism during the 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	The man had received a lesser medal while several white men  
involved in the same incident were awarded the Navy Cross, the 
second-highest award for valor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, former President Reagan pinned the Navy Cross on the  
man's chest, and praised Fisher for fighting to see that justice 
was done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say to you, Zach Fisher, `well done, soldier,''' Reagan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Colin Powell, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs,  
read from Ecclesiastes over Fisher's flag-draped casket, and a 
Marine Corps bugler played ``Taps.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wilander Finds Tennis Is Fun Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Mats Wilander reached the top of the tennis  
world, he sounded like the old Peggy Lee song: Is that all there 
is? 
</P>
<P>
	At the age of 17, Wilander became the youngest player to win a  
Grand Slam tournament men's singles title when he captured the 1982 
French Open. Later the same year, he faced John McEnroe for 6 
hours, 39 minutes on carpet in St. Louis -- the longest Davis Cup 
match in history at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The quiet Swede added two more French Open titles, three  
Australian Opens and a U.S. Open crown. In 1988, he won three of 
the four Grand Slam tournaments and was No. 1 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened so fast,'' Wilander said from his home in  
Greenwich, Conn. ``It happened easy once. I was motivated to try to 
make it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fall was even quicker.  
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the following year, he was ranked 12th in the  
world. In December 1990, he was 41st, having skipped the French 
Open and Wimbledon and losing in the first round at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	He hung around for a few more years, never a threat in a major  
tournament. Now, he's on the seniors circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, Wilander says he has had fun.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was never really driven to become No. 1 in the world,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he had a beer with Matt Doyle, a native of Redwood, Calif.,  
who played Davis Cup for Ireland and, with Wilander, was a member 
of the ATP board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt said I could become No. 1 if I practiced a little harder  
and trained more,'' Wilander remembered. ``I had never given it a 
thought before. But after that I was more focused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoyed winning. Ivan Lendl liked to beat guys 0-and-1. I  
just liked to beat guys. 
</P>
<P>
	But life at the top wasn't really what Wilander expected -- or  
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew what it took to become No. 1,'' he said. ``Could I keep  
working this hard and keep focused when I couldn't go up any 
higher. Once you are No. 1, there's only one direction you can 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were other things in his life besides tennis. He married a  
fashion model, Sonya, in 1987, just before his big year. If those 
were his highs, he was soon to have a deep loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad got cancer in 1989 and died five months later,''  
Wilander said. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the French Open and Wimbledon in 1990, skipped  
Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 1991, sat out the 1992 season before 
playing only the U.S. Open in 1993. It wasn't a career in decline; 
it wasn't even a career at that point. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Wilander showed up again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I played 1993 through '95 and '96,'' he said. ``So I didn't  
expect to do that. I enjoyed that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from the ATP Tour in 1996 -- ``I'm happy I quit,'' he  
said -- and began playing the senior circuit last year. Tennis is 
fun for him once again as he prepares for the Citibank Champions in 
Purchase, N.Y., which begins play tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillermo Vilas, who lost to Wilander in the 1982 French Open,  
takes on Mansour Bahrami in the opening match. Wilander begins 
singles play Wednesday night against John Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to all the senior tournaments,'' he said.  
``The level (of play) is getting better and better. McEnroe has 
driven the level up a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the Citibank Champions field includes fellow Swedes  
Joakim Nystrom and Mikael Pernfors, McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Johan 
Kriek, Henri Leconte, Eddie Dibbs, Jose Luis Clerc, Tim Wilkison, 
Mel Purcell, Gene Mayer and Andres Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilander, Connors and McEnroe will be joined by Bjorn Borg on  
June 17-20 for the Quality Challenge in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started playing on the senior tour, I thought we'd play  
a little golf and then a little tennis. But I got beat 0-and-2 
indoors in Croatia with 6,000 people watching. That's no fun. You 
don't like to lose, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilander said the competitive juices quickly flow when play  
begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thought is you want to give the people something  
they enjoy,'' he said. ``After the first 15 minutes, I don't care 
what the people think. I want to win. It is more fun to get more 
focused. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do if you really care.''

<HEADLINE> Johnston Hired As Ottawa Senators GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Two days after celebrating his 58th birthday,  
Marshall Johnston was hired as general manager of the Ottawa 
Senators on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston was an assistant to Senators GM Rick Dudley last  
season. Dudley was given permission Monday to leave the Senators 
and take over the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston joined the Senators in July 1996 as director of player  
personnel after spending the previous season scouting for the New 
York Islanders. He was director of player personnel for the New 
Jersey Devils from 1983-93. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was a teen-ager, Johnston passed on major junior hockey  
in Canada to attend the University of Denver. After graduating, he 
played for Canada's national team for four years, including the 
1968 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston had a seven-year NHL playing career that did not begin  
until he was 26 in 1968 with the Minnesota North Stars. A 
defenseman, he also played for the California Golden Seals. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached the Golden Seals from 1974-75, then became coach at  
his Denver alma mater for four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He was made assistant general manager and assistant coach of the  
Colorado Rockies in May 1981 and served as head coach for the final 
56 games in 1981-82. He coached Canada's team at the 1982 World 
Championships, then moved to New Jersey when the Colorado franchise 
shifted that year.

<HEADLINE> Texas Town Changes Name From Buffalo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, Texas (AP) -- For the third time in five years, this  
town is changing its name for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993 and 1994, when the Buffalo Bills played the Dallas  
Cowboys in the Super Bowl, city officials ordered all signs with 
``Buffalo'' to be covered up and replaced by the temporary new 
name, ``Blue Star, Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's the Buffalo Sabres who are playing the Dallas Stars  
for the National Hockey League championship. While the Stanley Cup 
finals are in progress, the town has unofficially been renamed 
``Green Star, Texas,'' and a green star now adorns City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo is on Interstate 45, about 100 miles southeast of  
Dallas.

<HEADLINE> Hormone Benefits May Outweigh Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A study of 37,000 women found that taking  
hormones after menopause does not increase the risk of breast 
cancer, except for some uncommon forms of the disease that are 
slow-growing and highly treatable. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the findings are good news because they add to  
evidence that the benefits of hormone supplements outweigh any 
increased risk of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of women take hormones to ease the symptoms of  
menopause, such as hot flashes. The hormones are also known to 
reduce the risk of heart disease, brittle bones and possibly even 
mental decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have indicated that women who take hormones --  
specifically estrogen -- after menopause are more likely to develop 
breast cancer. Other studies have found no link. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first hormone study to categorize cases of breast  
cancer according to whether they were slow-growing or fast-growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a woman weighs the risk of breast cancer vs. the benefit  
of possibly reducing cardiovascular disease and reducing risk of 
osteoporosis, this just provides further evidence for the 
benefit,'' said Dr. Susan M. Gapstur, a cancer epidemiologist at 
Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago who led the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study appears in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical  
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	It may help explain the conflicting data in other studies and  
why hormone takers survive breast cancer more often than 
non-takers. 
</P>
<P>
	``One possible explanation is that they develop more favorable  
tumor types,'' said Dr. Melody A. Cobleigh, director of the 
Comprehensive Breast Center at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical 
Center in Chicago. She was not involved in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers analyzed data on 37,105 subjects enrolled at  
ages 55 to 69 in the Iowa Women's Health Study. Over 11 years 
ending in 1996, a total of 1,520 cases of breast cancer developed 
among the women. 
</P>
<P>
	Women who took hormones and women who didn't had no difference  
in their risk of getting the fast-growing, life-threatening tumors 
that make up 85 percent to 90 percent of all cases of breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Women who used hormones for five years or less were 1.8 times  
more likely to have slow-growing, highly curable tumors than women 
who never took hormones. Those who had used hormones for more than 
five years were 2.6 times more likely to have the least-threatening 
tumors.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Tops $250 Million Mark / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Jedi Knights might be unbeatable in  
theaters now, but they could face their first real competition this 
weekend, when retro-secret agent ``Austin Powers'' swaggers into 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	On the last weekend it enjoyed the young male audience all to  
itself, ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' grossed $32.9 
million, topping $250 million in just three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star Wars'' prequel has so far earned $255.8 million at  
North American theaters. 
</P>

real match for the Force, opens Friday. Studios had steered clear 
of the space blockbuster or counter-programmed with romances and 
art films. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> FCC Long-Distance Ruling Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court has upheld a decision  
by federal regulators to block US West and Ameritech from selling 
the long-distance service of Qwest Communications Corp. to local 
phone customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnerships were blocked last September by the Federal  
Communications Commission, which said the alliances were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	US West Communications Inc. and Ameritech Corp., had briefly  
marketed Qwest's long-distance service until they were ordered to 
stop last year. Under pacts between the companies, Qwest paid US 
West and Ameritech an undisclosed recruiting fee for each client in 
the Baby Bells' local phone regions that chooses Qwest for 
long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, MCI and other carriers argued that the alliances violated  
a 1996 telecommunications law that forbids Bell companies from 
providing long-distance service to their own customers. The FCC 
agreed, ultimately ruling that the Qwest deals were 
anti-competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opinion released Tuesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for  
the District of Columbia, a three-judge panel concluded that the 
FCC had acted reasonably. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the (Bell operating companies) could secure this advantage  
without opening their local service markets, the blunting of the 
intended incentive would be considerable -- or so the Commission 
could reasonably find,'' wrote Judge Stephen Williams in the 
group's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	To provide long-distance service to local customers, a Bell  
company must open its markets to competitors and get FCC approval. 
No Bell has done so.

<HEADLINE> James C. Kopp on Most Wanted List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- James C. Kopp's name and picture will now  
appear all over the world as one of the country's most sought-after 
alleged criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject of a 7-month-old international manhunt, Kopp was  
added Monday to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. The anti-abortion 
activist's face will appear in police stations, post offices and on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are doing is using everything at our disposal,'' U.S.  
Attorney Denise O'Donnell said, ``including now probably the most 
lucrative way of finding a fugitive ... There is little more that 
we can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp has eluded authorities since the sniper slaying of Dr.  
Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician who performed abortions, in the 
doctor's suburban Buffalo home on Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp, 44, was sought as a witness in the case almost  
immediately, after authorities identified his car in the doctor's 
Amherst neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, investigators identified Kopp as the suspected  
shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp is charged in state and federal complaints with  
second-degree murder and violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic 
Entrances Act by using deadly force against an abortion doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the shooting, Kopp traveled the country and world,  
authorities said, spending time in China, Mexico, South America, 
Africa, Poland, England, India, Canada and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been arrested more than a dozen times during abortion  
protests in New York, Missouri, Georgia, Florida, Pennsylvania, 
West Virginia, Virginia, and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Since October, authorities have uncovered more than two dozen  
aliases and determined Kopp most recently lived in Vermont, but his 
whereabouts since the shooting are a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite honestly, we don't know where he is,'' said Bernard  
Tolbert, special agent-in-charge of the FBI's Buffalo office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp is average in height and weight, with red or brown hair and  
blue or gray eyes. He is described as a devout Roman Catholic who 
attends daily Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Amherst Police Chief Frank Olesko said the FBI listing ``puts to  
the forefront how serious a crime we think this is... This person 
is not a hero of any group. He's a criminal. He's a murderer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities noted that of the 454 fugitives placed on the list  
since 1950, 427, or 94 percent, have been captured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-four percent,'' Erie County District Attorney Frank  
Clark repeated. ``Those are odds I'd bet on any day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average time spent on the list before capture is 316 days.  
</P>
<P>
	Even with the addition of Kopp, the FBI has room for one more  
fugitive on its list. On Monday night, the leader of the Outlaw 
Motorcycle Club -- also among the Ten Most Wanted -- was captured in 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry ``Taco'' Bowman, 49, the Outlaws' international president,  
was arrested in the Detroit area, said FBI special agent Bill Cheek 
in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	A Tampa-based federal grand jury indicted Bowman in August 1997.  
He was charged with murder, bombing, drug dealing, racketeering and 
conspiracy. Bowman faces several life sentences if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Kasich: Slow Social Security Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich would slow the growth of  
Social Security benefits by no longer adjusting the tables for 
calculating them to reflect wage increases in society, sources 
familiar with the GOP presidential candidate's plan, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
proposal Kasich is scheduled to unveil Wednesday would change the 
initial calculation of Social Security benefits made when a person 
first retires based on their average lifetime wages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio congressman is alone among the GOP presidential  
hopefuls to call for trimming Social Security benefits to future 
retirees in exchange for letting them divert a portion of their 
Social Security taxes to personal retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals with different earnings histories would continue to  
get different-sized benefit checks, the sources familiar with his 
proposal said Tuesday. And the benefits would continue to rise 
annually based on price inflation as measured by the Consumer Price 
Index. 
</P>
<P>
	But the entire sliding scale of benefits would no longer shift  
upward as wages rise over-all, the sources said. They wouldn't 
offer more details. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kasich's goal is to provide a retirement system for the baby  
boom that Generation X can still afford,'' said one source close to 
the House Budget Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republican presidential candidates and congressional  
leaders also have endorsed the idea of letting workers invest some 
of their Social Security taxes in private accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kasich is the only one suggesting that baby boomers accept  
smaller benefit checks in exchange for being allowed to divert part 
of their Social Security taxes to potentially more lucrative but 
also riskier stock market accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich's plan would allow workers now under age 55 to  
voluntarily divert some of their Social Security taxes into private 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest-wage workers would be allowed to divert up to 3.5  
percent of their wages -- or about half of their employee Social 
Security taxes -- into the private retirement accounts. Workers 
earning more than the maximum income taxed by Social Security -- 
$72,600 in 1999 -- would be allowed to divert only 1 percent of 
their wages. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefit changes in Kasich's proposal would affect the Social  
Security checks of baby boomers and younger Americans, but not 
anyone now over age 55. Annual cost-of-living increases retirees 
get based on price inflation would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his strategy to set himself apart from the crowded  
GOP field, Kasich again called for Republicans to begin targeting

	``As I like to say, we reformed welfare for poor people, we  
ought to reform it for the rich,'' he said. ``It's a matter of 
will; it's a matter of attitude.''

<P>
	Kasich appeared with the head of the anti-spending group  
Citizens Against Government Waste, which unveiled the latest 
installment of its annual ``Prime Cuts'' list of recommended fat to 
cut from the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	High on this year's list was the Advanced Technology Program,  
Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the Trade and Development 
Agency, which the taxpayer group said could be eliminated at a 
savings of $2 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The taxpayer group characterized the Advanced Technology Program  
as ``welfare for techies'' that funnels millions of taxpayer 
dollars to Fortune 500 companies every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing but corporate welfare,'' Kasich said. ``I don't  
think there's one single project that has ever gone from the 
Advanced Technology Program to reality.''

<HEADLINE>  India Offers To Hold Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- India offered today to hold peace talks with  
Pakistan this weekend, a move that came as its warplanes and troops 
struck against hundreds of fighters India says Pakistan has sent 
into the mountains of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	A Foreign Ministry statement said Pakistan's foreign minister  
would be welcome on Saturday, countering a proposal by Islamabad 
for Sartaj Aziz to come to New Delhi on Monday, which India called 
``inconvenient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh is scheduled to leave for  
China on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Islamabad, Pakistani Information Minister Mushahid Hussein  
informed the upper house of parliament of India's offer. He did not 
say if Pakistan would accept the date. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said his government would  
reply to the Indian offer later today. And he said the one-point 
agenda for the talks set by India was a problem and that there 
should be ``no preconditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee made clear the talks  
would be confined to ending the confrontation on India's northern 
frontier and not other issues dividing the two rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a televised speech to the nation Monday, Vajpayee accused  
Pakistan of sending its soldiers across the cease-fire line ``to 
occupy our territory'' in Indian-held Kashmir. Pakistan accused 
India of going ``on the warpath'' by spurning its earlier offer of 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over  
Kashmir, since they won independence from Britain in 1947. India 
now controls two-thirds of the former princely state. 
</P>
<P>
	Islamabad denies its troops are involved in the fighting and  
claims the fighters are secessionist Kashmiri rebels from India. 
</P>
<P>
	Western nations have asked the two new nuclear powers to show  
restraint, fearing the fighting could escalate. 
</P>
<P>
	Artillery shells continued to rain on both sides of the  
Himalayan frontier. India has kept reporters away from the battle 
zone amid preparations for what front-line officers described as an 
all-out assault to push the intruders off the snow-peaked mountains 
they have occupied since early May. 
</P>
<P>
	India's casualty toll stood at 60 dead, 217 wounded and 14  
missing since early May. The military says 221 Pakistani soldiers 
and an unknown number of others have also been killed so far in air 
and ground strikes around Kargil. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting is taking place 440 miles north of New Delhi, the  
Indian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	In his address, Vajpayee demanded Pakistan remove the guerrilla  
fighters or have Indian troops evict them forcibly. ``It is our 
duty to rid our Motherland of every single intruder,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Choose Life' License Plates in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- ``Choose Life,'' two words carrying an  
emotionally charged message about abortion, will be on some Florida 
license plates under a bill signed today by Gov. Jeb Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised by sales of the $20 specialty plate, which bears a  
crayon drawing of children, will go to support organizations that 
serve pregnant women who plan to put their babies up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea had been vetoed last year by the late Gov. Lawton  
Chiles, a Democrat, but Bush had promised to sign it into law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows the complete difference in leadership we have  
here,'' said Matt Ozolnieks, vice president of Florida Right to 
Life, which lobbied for the plate. ``This is a real good 
opportunity for those concerned for women in crisis pregnancies to 
offer help and hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents argue it bears a divisive political message, one  
some feel so strongly about it could even spark road rage. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't put a political slogan on a license plate,''  
Democratic state Sen. Howard Forman. ``Now the taxpayers are paying 
for a political slogan with the imprimatur of the state of 
Florida.''

<HEADLINE> USBL Team Called 'Unprofessional' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOMAC, Md. (AP) -- In front of 35 spectators, including the  
security guard, the Washington Congressionals took the court at a 
small high school gym wearing another team's practice jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	Admission was supposed to be $8, but the Congressionals' owner --  
who had planned to take the money at the door -- had to leave 30 
minutes before tipoff to pick up his statistician. So, the fans got 
in for free. 
</P>
<P>
	The gym didn't have a 24-second clock and the 3-point line was a  
crooked arc of black tape. But at least the game took place. 
</P>
<P>
	The last home game was postponed because there was nowhere to  
play. The game before that was scheduled for a YMCA gym in downtown 
Washington, but the other team showed up late and the time slot 
reserved for the court had expired. 
</P>
<P>
	The road doesn't provide any refuge. A car carrying some of the  
players to a recent game against the New Jersey Shorecats never 
arrived because of a flat tire, leaving five players to play the 
entire 48 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressionals are a member of the United States Basketball  
League, a low-key but respected 13-team league that draws an 
average of about 1,000 fans to its games. While USBL teams play far 
from the glitz of the NBA playoffs, they do supply a handful of 
players each year to the world's best basketball league. 
</P>
<P>
	But even on this small scale, the Congressionals are an  
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the bottom of the barrel,'' said forward Lonnie  
Harrell, who played for Georgetown and Northeastern and, like most 
of his teammates, has spent the last few years in minor pro leagues 
trying to get noticed by the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so difficult to play basketball where there's no  
organization. We're not practicing. We're not sure if we're going 
to play or not. On road games, we're not sure of transportation. We 
can be out here physically, but mentally it's not together. I've 
played in a lot of minor leagues and semipros, and this is one of 
the most unprofessional ones I've ever been on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressionals are owned and run by Larry Arnold, a  
Washington lobbyist. Last year the team had a respectable debut 
season playing at the University of the District of Columbia and 
made the playoffs under former Howard coach Mike McLeese. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, penny-pinching and lack of planning have made the  
team a nonstop folly with a 1-14 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Unsignable players, such as NBA-bound Shawnta Rogers, were  
chosen in the draft. McLeese wasn't re-signed for the season until 
days before the first game. Arnold secured the Smith Center at 
George Washington University for the first four home games, but 
that was all. Hotel reservations for the season opener in New York 
weren't made in advance, so the team had to drive around looking 
for vacancies and ended up staying in Jersey City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	McLeese, who finally got fed up when a van showed up three hours  
late to take the team to a game in Pennsylvania, quit May 7. Since 
he had secured the team's uniforms, and since Arnold wouldn't pay 
him anything for them, McLeese took them with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were going backwards,'' McLeese said. ``We weren't making  
any progress, nickel and diming the guys in per diem, no place to 
play. It felt like the Congressionals were pulling me down instead 
of helping me. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a bush-league operation. Somebody has to take over  
that team and run it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Jacob Jonas took over, but some players thought the  
season was over because Arnold couldn't find a place to play. 
Finally, he struck a deal with The Heights School in Potomac, which 
seats maybe 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressionals, who each earn $300-$500 a week, debuted at  
their new home in front of the crowd of 35 last Friday, wearing the 
Connecticut Skyhawks' dowdy white practice jerseys. They were 
beaten 140-128 by defending champion Atlantic City in a game that 
wasn't as close as the final score indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold, chatting with fans during the game, played down the  
team's problems. He said that the inability to find a home court 
was a ``mix-up'' and that he has new uniforms on the way. He said 
the game at the YMCA should have been a Congressionals victory by 
forfeit because of the other team's late arrival from Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're as up to snuff as several other teams in the  
league,'' Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USBL doesn't think so. The league wants the franchise to get  
its act together during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not up to the standards the USBL set forth,'' league  
spokesman Sean Fisher said. ``But the bottom line now is that we 
want the games played. At this point, we'll take what we can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For players such as Harrell, shaking his head after another  
loss, it all seems as far away from the NBA as one can get. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not getting a whole lot out of this,'' Harrell said. ``I  
need to move on.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Speech to Hungary Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The text of President Clinton's remarks Tuesday at a White House  
welcoming ceremony for Hungarian President Arpad Goncz: 
</P>
<P>
	President and Mrs. Goncz, ladies and gentlemen: In the early  
1850s the great Hungarian patriot, Royas Konshud, came to this 
country and to this house to seek support for restoring liberty to 
his nation. He said then: To find the sunlight of freedom, we must 
come to America. 
</P>
<P>
	Konshud would be proud today that his statement no longer holds,  
that the sunlight of freedom shines in Hungary and all across the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year I have had the privilege to welcome to the  
White House extraordinary leaders who risked their lives in the 
struggle for liberty, were imprisoned for their beliefs and 
activism, and now have emerged in freedom's sunlight as the 
presidents of their nations: Kim Dae-jung of South Korea, Vaclav 
Havel of the Czech Republic, Nelson Mandela of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Today with freedom at last shining brightly in Hungary, I have  
the great honor and pleasure to welcome President Arpad Goncz: our 
friend, our partner, our ally. 
</P>
<P>
	Let me begin with a few words about our common enterprise in  
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	For 77 days we have been working to achieve a simple set of  
objectives there: the return of refugees with safety and 
self-government, the withdrawal of all Serbian forces, the 
deployment of an international security force with NATO at its 
core. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, Serb authorities accepted a peace plan that  
embodies those conditions. Today in Bonn we took another important 
step forward. The G-8 countries now have agreed to language of a 
United Nations Security Council resolution that will help us to 
realize these basic goals: peace with security for the people of 
Kosovo and stability for the region as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	The key now, as it has been from the beginning of this process,  
is implementation. A verifiable withdrawal of Serb forces will 
allow us to suspend the bombing and go forward with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO is determined to bring the Kosovars home, to do so as an  
alliance acting together, and in a way that ultimately can 
strengthen the relationship between Russia and the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Our great writer, E.L. Doctorow, once said, ``The devastating  
history of 20th century Europe, which you and I might study in a 
book or look at as tourists, is housed in the beam of our peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In World War II, he fought in resistance and was wounded by Nazi  
fire. In 1956, he rose with fellow citizens against Stalinist 
oppression. 
</P>
<P>
	And after Soviet tanks crushed the uprising, he was sentenced to  
life in prison. Released after six years, he became a translator, 
bringing Western ideas to Hungary. And through his own plays and 
stories, challenged Hungarians to think about the nature of tyranny 
and the meaning of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	After NATO's resolve and the courage of Central Europeans helped  
to bring down the Iron Curtain, the Hungarian people chose this 
great man to lead them. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Hungary is one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe  
with America its largest foreign investor. Hungary has acted to 
protect the rights of its own minority groups and worked for the 
rights of ethnic Hungarians in other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungary has stood with the United States as a NATO ally against  
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and for a more positive future for all 
of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungary is leading the way toward what people dreamed of  
throughout the long Cold War. I am very proud of the alliance 
between our countries, the friendship between our peoples. I am 
grateful for the contributions of Hungarian Americans to the fabric 
of our present greatness and good fortune. And I am very honored to 
welcome here the president of Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	President Goncz, welcome back to America and to the White House.

<HEADLINE> Safety Device Unlocks Car Trunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to avoid deaths in car trunks, General  
Motors Corp. will equip most of its four-door family cars with an 
infrared sensing device that automatically unlocks the trunk if 
anyone is trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year during extreme summer heat, 11 children died after  
crawling into trunks to play and shutting the lids. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's automatic trunk-opening feature will be standard on the  
Chevrolet Impala next year and will be phased in on most of GM's 
four-door cars by 2002, GM officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The GM system uses infrared technology to detect both motion in  
the trunk and the ``heat signature'' of humans by searching for 
objects that are a different temperature than the trunk. The 
infrared system would pop open the trunk lid only if both the 
motion and heat sensor indicated a person could be in the trunk and 
the car is in park. 
</P>
<P>
	The GM cars also will have a handle inside the trunk for trapped  
passengers to release the trunk lid manually. And engineers plan to 
include a distinctive horn sequence -- perhaps three honks in a row 
from the driver horn followed by a pause -- to signal a passenger is 
trapped in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1970, 1,175 people have been victims in 992 trunk  
entrapments -- mostly adults locked in by criminals or children who 
unintentionally locked themselves in, according to a recent study. 
At least 260 people have died. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of the deaths involved a violent abduction. But it  
was the tragic deaths of children playing in trunks last year that 
prompted a federal safety agency, the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration, to start searching for ways to prevent trunk 
entrapment deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The expert panel appointed by the agency to study the problem  
recommends that all new cars have a release mechanism inside the 
trunk by 2001. The panel's study said temperatures inside a trunk 
could soar over 130 degrees after being parked only 15 minutes in 
the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	GM, Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG are all working on  
some sort of standard trunk-release system. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. will have a T-shaped handle that glows inside the  
trunk as a standard feature on most of its 2000 models. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March, GM has been installing manual handles into the  
trunks of cars already on the road as optional equipment at the 
dealership for about $50. GM's yellow handle is illuminated in the 
dark cargo area. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler and Dodge cars will have a  
similar optional kit within a month. DaimlerChrysler also plans to 
make trunk releases a standard feature for new cars by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	However, GM said that in its research to develop a trunk handle  
children could easily identify and use, company officials 
discovered that some children would not try very hard to get out of 
the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Children ages 3 to 7 successfully found the handle on their own  
and escaped only about half the time. The youngest children 
experienced the most trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	So GM decided to use the infrared technology to create an  
automatic system to help kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like a good idea, a good approach,'' said William  
Boehly, a member of the panel on trunks and a former top NHTSA 
official. ``We're dealing with a lot of unknows,'' he said, when it 
comes to determining how children will react in trunks. 
</P>
<P>
	Alma Rohan -- the aunt of four young cousins, ages 2 to 6, who  
died in the trunk of a Pontiac Grand Am last July in New Mexico -- 
said an infrared automatic trunk release was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children that age don't know to look for a handle,'' she said  
in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rohan also said most people do not believe their children  
would be trapped in a trunk, so they would be unlikely to teach 
them to look for a release mechanism. ``You teach kids about drugs 
and weapons, not to look for a button in the trunk,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once GM's system detects motion, there is a short time delay,  
roughly 2 minutes, before the trunk pops open. The wait is designed 
in part to allow adults who are forced into trunks at gunpoint a 
chance to escape by delaying the opening of the trunk until after a 
criminal has fled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're concerned not only about entrapped children but adults  
abducted at gunpoint against their will. We had to balance those 
needs,'' said GM spokesman William J. Kemp Jr.

<HEADLINE> Monk Punished for Scratching Coffin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMER, Mass. (AP) -- A monk was ordered to perform 100 hours of  
community service for scratching a cross on a young man's coffin 
before it was lowered into the grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with prosecutors, Dell Scott Goodwin, 42,  
acknowledged today that they had enough evidence to convict him of 
vandalizing a gravesite and destruction of property. The charges 
will be dismissed within a year if he stays out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have gotten five years in jail if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin is known as Father Lazarus at St. Nectarios Monastery in  
Brimfield, which follows many Eastern Orthodox traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The monk said he used a rock to carve a cross and Greek  
religious letters into the coffin of 17-year-old Christopher Martel 
after a graveside Roman Catholic service for the young man in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's family was appalled by what it considered to be the  
coffin's desecration. 
</P>
<P>
	Martel had been killed by a hit-and-run driver, and Goodwin, who  
knew the young man, had been one of the first on the scene of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin's lawyer, Gregory Hession, said the monk was overcome  
with grief and should have asked the family's permission.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Day Care To Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The best of day care can help children do well  
later in school, but those in low-quality care tend to have poorer 
language and math skills, says a six-year study by a team of 
college researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, which followed more than 400 children from day care  
through second grade, also found that high-quality day care helped 
children in the long run as well as short term. Saying that good 
day care helped needy children the most, the research team 
recommended that the states and Congress spend more money on day 
care programs, worker training and salaries and tax credits for 
working parents, especially those leaving welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The full day care centers, which included Head Start, nonprofit  
and for-profit centers, were scored by how much attention a child 
got from workers, how much and how well they played with other 
children, and whether the children had plentiful and safe 
furnishings, toys, books and other learning materials, said Ellen 
Peisner-Feinberg, a University of North Carolina researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The success in early learning and school readiness report was  
released Tuesday at a news conference, with Education Secretary 
Richard Riley and the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality of experiences in the early years matters,'' Riley  
said. But, he added, ``child care facilities that meet high 
standards and offer employees a livable wage remain woefully 
inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers from the University of North Carolina; the  
University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Colorado; 
and Yale University found that children in low-quality care tended 
to score lower on tests measuring their language and math skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest-quality care accounted for about 11 percent of the  
day care studied. Nearly a quarter was judged high quality. 
Concrete factors such as child-teacher ratio or teacher salary can 
predict a good setting, but not guarantee it, said 
Peisner-Feinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Without offering exact dollar figures, Richard Clifford, another  
UNC researcher, said the best day care tended to cost twice as much 
as the worst. Good programs could be found in the public and 
private sectors, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also concluded that good day care:  
</P>
<P>
	--Made children less likely to misbehave in later years,  
particularly if they were in centers where most children got along. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gave children better social and learning skills regardless of  
the quality of their kindergarten and second-grade classes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Made the most difference for children who were poor or whose  
mothers were less-educated than other children's mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration wants to increase tax breaks that  
moderate-income parents get for paying child-care expenses for 
children under 13 and create a new tax credit for employers to 
provide daycare for their workers. Republican leaders have similar 
proposals.

<HEADLINE> Charity Theft Prompts Cameras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The charity Feed the Children will  
install surveillance cameras to prevent employee theft at its 
Nashville warehouse after staff members were videotaped by a TV 
station taking boxes of donated goods home. 
</P>
<P>
	Feed the Children fired all 14 Nashville employees a week ago,  
and the warehouse has been closed while the charity takes an 
inventory of how much is missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up to this point it was like considering putting a camera in a  
church,'' Feed the Children spokeswoman Emilee Truelove said 
Tuesday. ``We've just had a level of trust that's no longer 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Nashville alarm company is donating the nearly $20,000  
security system and installing it for free. 
</P>
<P>
	During a four-month investigation, WTVF secretly videotaped  
administrative staffers carting boxes of clothes, food, toiletries 
and more to their cars and homes. The items had been donated to the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Torry Johnson said he is awaiting the results  
of a state investigation before deciding whether to file charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Truelove said that Feed the Children will also increase  
security at its Oklahoma warehouse but that the charity knows of no 
thefts there. 
</P>
<P>
	The closure of the Nashville office has prevented 201 agencies  
in 20 states from getting food from the charity. The states are 
Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky, Georgia, Illinois, Virginia, 
Alabama, Arkansas, New York, Texas, Oklahoma, California, Missouri, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Massachusetts, Mississippi, 
South Dakota and Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> US Didn't Obtain Lab Visit Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department has failed to issue  
required licenses for extended laboratory visits by foreign 
nationals who may come in contact with sensitive information, a 
report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's inspector general found that the system isn't  
working because it relies on U.S. sponsors of the foreign visitors 
to apply for the licenses. The sponsors often are confused about 
when a license is needed, said the report, obtained Tuesday by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was prepared for the Senate Governmental Affairs  
Committee, which has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on department 
export controls. 
</P>
<P>
	A special House committee last month detailed a 20-year campaign  
by China to steal nuclear secrets and criticized lax security at 
the Energy Department laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department, in a response attached to the inspector  
general's findings, said it is updating its export guidelines, 
which ``will, among other things, clarify requirements'' for the 
laboratory visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new policy will clarify where export control review  
responsibility lies ... and ensure that consideration of export 
license requirements is part of the visits and assignments 
process,'' the response said. 
</P>
<P>
	A so-called ``deemed export license'' is required for visits by  
foreign nationals who might gain access to information or 
technology that would require a license if shipped to the foreign 
country. Examples are information that could have a dual military 
and civilian use, and technologies that are regulated by the State 
Department through placement on a ``munitions list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report reviewed the license system for visits of at least 30  
days to four laboratories: Los Alamos and Sandia in New Mexico, 
Lawrence Livermore in California and Oak Ridge in Tennessee. The 
report did not consider whether the foreigners should have been at 
the labs in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspector General Gregory H. Friedman found that neither Energy  
nor Commerce Department guidance ``was clear regarding when a 
deemed export license would be required for an assignment involving 
a foreign national.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors of the visitors, known as ``hosts,'' were relied  
upon to determine whether export concerns were raised by the visits 
-- but ``several hosts were not aware of, or did not understand, the 
requirements,'' the report found. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found ... that 13 of the 17 hosts we interviewed said that  
they were not responsible for making this determination,'' Friedman 
found. ``In addition, when asked who certifies that no license is 
required, four of the 17 hosts said that they did not know or were 
not sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the uncertainty over the need for licenses, five hosts  
at Oak Ridge said the six foreign nationals they were hosting were 
affiliated with a nuclear facility or ``nuclear end-user in their 
home countries,'' the report said. ``However, none of these hosts 
had considered applying for deemed export licenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A contractor at the Livermore lab told investigators that  
laboratory employees ``routinely struggle to try to determine if 
and when a deemed export license might be required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others said their names were officially listed as the hosts of  
record, but the actual sponsors were others. In one case a Chinese 
national was the actual host of another Chinese national, despite a 
requirement that the host be a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an advisory board said in a report Tuesday that the  
Energy Department's foreign visitor program ``is invaluable to this 
country'' and should be continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``International scientific collaborations with foreign  
governments and scientists for research and development ... support 
the department's diverse mission areas of national security, energy 
resources, science and environmental quality,'' said the secretary 
of energy's advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in March asked the advisory  
panel to examine the issue of foreign visitor exchanges involving 
the government's research laboratories.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Farmers Oppose Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Gray with age, a group of farmers who've been  
blocking efforts to build and expand a Tokyo airport for more than 
30 years are vowing to fight on against government plans to 
complete the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers -- some of whose land stands in the path of a planned  
second runway for the overcrowded airport 40 miles from Tokyo in 
Narita -- said it was unlikely they'd ever sell the plots where they 
grow organic crops like cucumbers, onions and peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they should give up on Narita,'' said landowner Shoji  
Shimamura, 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Shimamura, an egg farmer, and the others have resisted the  
airport ever since the government announced in 1966 that it wanted 
to build an international travel hub in what was then a sleepy 
village. 
</P>
<P>
	Clashes erupted back then between police and hundreds of farmers  
who opposed the project, backed by hundreds of leftist students. 
</P>
<P>
	The airport finally opened in 1978 -- seven years behind schedule  
and with only one of three planned runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have been trying ever since to buy or force out the  
farmers to make way for a badly needed second runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Many farmer's have given in and left. Only nine still refuse to  
budge, maintaining their farms in the shadows of the hulking 
terminals and roaring jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the airport's use has surged. More than 340 flights  
arrive and depart every day, carrying 70,000 passengers and 4,000 
tons of freight. 
</P>
<P>
	After promising to finish the runway in time for the 2002 World  
Cup soccer tournament, the government said last month that it had 
enough land to go ahead with a shortened version. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers point out that at 7,200 feet, the runway won't be  
long enough for the bigger jets used on international flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, the proposed runway is an act of intimidation, a crude  
attempt by the government to coerce farmers opposing the airport 
into leaving their community,'' said farmer Noriko Ishii, who 
declined to give her age. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers said they'll carry on despite the inconvenience it  
means for the area's 30 million other residents because they want 
to teach the government a lesson for using heavy-handed tactics to 
force them off their land. 
</P>
<P>
	``The single biggest cause is the fact that the government never  
once consulted residents before going ahead with the airport,'' 
said Kiyonori Hirano, 53, who works at a pickle plant that the 
government hopes to tear down to make way for the second runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see ourselves as fighting for democracy in Japan.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mob Lawyer Now Las Vegas Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar Goodman, a flamboyant lawyer who defended  
mobsters like Meyer Lansky and Tony ``The Ant'' Spilotro, was 
elected mayor of Las Vegas tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman defeated Arnie Adamsen, a veteran city councilman,  
completing his transformation from mob mouthpiece to a populist 
figure promising to solve the burgeoning city's growth problems. 
</P>
<P>
	With eight of 204 precincts reporting, Goodman had 14,124 votes,  
or 65.1 percent, to Adamsen's 7,573 votes, or 34.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make things happen overnight,'' Goodman said earlier  
in the evening. ``Unlike other people, I'm impatient. I'm ready to 
get going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, 59, came within 277 votes of winning the mayor's post  
outright against Adamsen and seven others in the May 4 primary. 
</P>
<P>
	He entered the race expecting he would have to defend his past  
with the same zeal he once used to defend his mob clients. Instead, 
he found out that Las Vegas voters didn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a non-issue as far as Las Vegas is concerned,''  
Goodman said Tuesday during some last-minute campaigning. ``It was 
always a non-issue with me. I love my past. I don't apologize for 
one day in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman campaigned with bluster and bravado, calling for  
developers to be assessed fees to help pay for road and air-quality 
improvements made necessary by the city's runaway growth. Donations 
from casinos poured in to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamsen prided himself on paying attention to more mundane  
matters such as crossing guards and stop signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm colorful. That's what got me in the limelight,'' said  
Goodman, who played himself in Martin Scorsese's movie ``Casino.'' 
``But I honestly believe I'm going to be the best mayor Las Vegas 
ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls showed Goodman with a 19-point lead over Adamsen, whose  
warnings that Goodman would be dangerous for Las Vegas' image 
failed to take hold with the voters. Sixty-nine percent said in a 
newspaper poll last week that Goodman would not hurt the city's 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Jan Jones is retiring.  
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, two state legislative primaries became unusually  
interesting because of spiteful party infighting. 
</P>
<P>
	In one primary for the House of Delegates, Democrat William P.  
Robinson easily defeated challenger Luther C. Edmonds, a former 
friend who allegedly pistol-whipped Robinson in 1997. Edmonds' 
trial ended in a mistrial when a jury deadlocked last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In another House race, Republican Anne G. ``Panny'' Rhodes was  
nominated for a fifth term even after party leaders took the rare 
step of supporting her conservative challenger. Gov. Jim Gilmore 
and others in the GOP establishment were upset that she had bucked 
them on tax cuts, welfare reform and abortion restrictions.

<HEADLINE> IBM-Microsoft Relations Outlined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stung by courtroom claims that it sought  
illegally to pressure IBM Corp., Microsoft will point to IBM's 
efforts to disparage its Windows software at the same time IBM was 
scrambling to secure a contract to sell Windows on its computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp. argues that IBM's apparently contradictory  
behavior illustrates the complex relationship between the two 
companies, which worked closely as partners in some areas but 
remained bitter rivals in others. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected today to begin questioning Garry Norris,  
an IBM manager and the government's next-to-last witness in its 
antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris accused the software company Monday of offering IBM  
discounts worth tens of millions of dollars to sacrifice its rival 
OS/2 computer operating system. He said Microsoft also urged IBM to 
stop distributing software from key competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, in turn, argued outside court that it never sought to  
have IBM to embrace Windows exclusively, and that IBM continues to 
this day to distribute rival software on its popular line of 
desktops and portable Thinkpad machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris testified that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates was so angry  
about IBM's defiance that he overheard Gates screaming during a 
private phone call in July 1995 to another IBM executive in the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty loud,'' Norris said, eliciting laughter from a  
crowded federal courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who negotiated key agreements in 1995 and 1996,  
testified that IBM saw the total fees it pays to Microsoft rise 
from $40 million in 1996 to $440 million last year because it 
rejected Microsoft's alleged overtures not to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will decide the  
verdict later this year, appeared to follow Norris' testimony 
closely. He frequently took notes, asked minor questions for 
clarification and studied e-mails and other documents on a large 
projection screen in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris is a crucial witness because none of the nation's major  
computer makers previously had been willing to testify in court in 
support of government allegations that Microsoft uses the prices 
for its dominant Windows operating system to punish enemies and 
reward allies. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Microsoft opens its cross-examination of Norris, it wants  
the judge to consider its overall relationship with IBM, not just 
its dealings with IBM's personal computer division. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft says that even as IBM was negotiating a lower price  
for Windows, it launched a national advertising campaign to 
disparage the operating system by comparing it to the latest 
versions of its own OS/2 software, which it considered more robust. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, during the same period, IBM purchased Lotus Development  
Corp. -- one of Microsoft's biggest software rivals -- and promised 
to distribute the Lotus SmartSuite software, not Microsoft's 
lucrative Office software, on IBM computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government showed IBM e-mail describing Microsoft's Joachim  
Kempin as ``definitely worried about SmartSuite being given away 
and eating into their 'Office heartland.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Other IBM initiatives have included Lotus Notes, which competes  
with Microsoft's Exchange mail software; Java, the programming 
language that Microsoft believed threatened to undermine Windows; 
and Network Computers, which deliberately don't require Microsoft's 
operating system to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It becomes very clear that Microsoft and IBM are direct  
competitors in at least 85 percent of Microsoft's total business,'' 
Kempin wrote to his counterpart at IBM in January 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The government accuses Microsoft of illegally wielding its  
influence over Windows to arm-twist lucrative concessions from 
IBM's PC Co. and other computer makers. But Microsoft, in turn, 
describes the IBM computer division as caught between loyalty to 
other IBM initiatives and its own efforts to negotiate low prices 
for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's top executives ``were sensitive to the challenges  
that the (IBM) PC Company were experiencing,'' said Mark Baber, the 
former Microsoft employee in charge of negotiations with IBM. 
``They had a very complex set of issues to deal with on their 
side.''

<HEADLINE> Aspects of Rental Car Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I plan on doing a lot of traveling this summer, which will  
include renting a car. Should I buy the collision damage waiver, 
which covers theft or damage to the vehicle? 

</P>
<P>
	A: That usually depends on your regular auto insurance policy --  
and how you decide to pay for your rental. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever coverage you have on your own car, in most cases,  
applies when you rent a car,'' says Jeanne Salvatore, spokeswoman 
for the Insurance Information Institute in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she notes that some insurance companies don't extend  
regular policy coverage to business rentals. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're paying for your car rental on a credit card, there's  
also a good chance that insurance coverage is provided. However, in 
most cases, it only applies after your primary policy, and its 
deductible, have been tapped. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other caveats.  
</P>
<P>
	If you have an older car and don't carry comprehensive and  
collision coverage, you may want to opt for that coverage from the 
rental company, or risk being liable for a huge bill if the rental 
car is damaged or stolen, Salvatore says. 
</P>
<P>
	She also notes that the rental car company may waive coverage if  
you were speeding, driving off-road or driving under the influence 
of drugs or alcohol when the damage to the car occurred.

	Salvatore recommends contacting both your insurance agent and  
credit card company to see what's covered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't assume you have a lot of coverage and don't assume you  
have none,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``When in doubt, take the coverage, if you haven't bothered to  
check all this. It is expensive, but it's not worth the risk that 
if you get into a really horrific accident, you could be sued for 
hundreds of thousands of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two most important forms of insurance are liability and  
collision. 
</P>
<P>
	Liability insurance generally costs $7 to $9 per day for up to  
$1 million coverage, according to the Insurance Information 
Institute. Collision damage runs between $9 and $19 per day.

<P>
	If you're looking to save money, Salvatore says, consider  
waiving coverage for personal effects that might be stolen from or 
with the car. Those items typically are covered under a homeowner's 
or renter's policy anyway, she notes. Such coverage usually runs 
$1.25 a day on a rental car. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, personal injury protection insurance, which would cover  
accident-related medical expenses for you and your passengers, can 
be waived if you have that coverage through your regular auto 
insurance policy, or even your regular healthcare plan, she says. 
This type of insurance typically costs $3 per day.
