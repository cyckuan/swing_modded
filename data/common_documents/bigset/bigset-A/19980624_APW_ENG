Europe expects increase in Asian exports: Brittan 
</HEADLINE>
By ALAN THORNHILL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The European Union will accept more
exports from Asia as long as the region keeps its markets open
during its economic crisis, European Commission vice president Leon
Brittan said Wednesday.
	   Brittan said Europe expected that Asia will inevitably try to
export its way out of its present crisis, although he noted the
increased flow of Asian goods has not yet started.
	   ``We will show understanding of the fact that your exports are
bound to grow,'' Brittan told reporters after meeting Australian
government officials. ``We will not react in a hostile way to that,
provided that you do not close your own markets.''
	   He said weaker Asian currencies which makes the region's
products cheaper abroad would spur exports in the months ahead.
	   Keeping trade open during the economic downturn could contribute
to recovery in the region, Brittan said.
	   ``If we do that, I think we can see the beginning of the end of
this crisis,'' Brittan said. ``We are only seeing the end of the
beginning, so far.''
	   Brittan is in Australia for annual talks between the Australian
government and the European Commission.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the world must
not close its markets to Asian exports as they expand in the months
ahead.
	   ``Asia has to partly export its way out of this crisis,'' he
said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Televisions had barely dimmed from
showing Hong Kong's much-hyped transfer to Chinese rule last July 1
when celebrating Asians were hurled into the real event of 1997.
	   On the other side of Southeast Asia, Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh of Thailand gave up a six-month defense of the baht
against speculators and severed its peg to the U.S. dollar.
	   It fell. The date was July 2, 1997. The Asian Crisis had begun.
Currencies, markets and banks collapsed. Eventually, so did the
governments of hard-hit Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia.
	   A year later, the upheaval shows no let-up. Asian nations are in
recession or heading there and the pain is making itself felt
worldwide.
	   Now, contrary to initial hopes the crisis would be short, few
believe in a turnaround for at least three years _ an inauspicious
debut to what was once billed as the coming Asian Century.
	   ``I think the crisis has already spread beyond Asia,'' said
Miron Mushkat, one of the region's top economic analysts.
	   ``It has not induced a recession-like condition anywhere else
yet,'' Mushkat said. ``But exports from the U.S. and Europe are
beginning to suffer and that will continue. Eventually, there could
be rising manufacturing unemployment there.''
	   The U.S. Commerce Department has been reporting record trade
deficits _ the latest figure, for April, was dlrs 14.5 billion _ as
Asia buys less of everything from aircraft to farm products.
	   That doesn't equal a new Great Depression for Americans. Few
experts predict that Asia's problems will deliver such a blow to
the United States. But Wall Street's high levels strikes them as
highly dangerous.
	   For Asians, a 1929-style disaster is already here. Currency
upheavals wiped out dlrs 2 trillion of the region's stock market
capitalization over the past year, equivalent to a 20 percent fall
in the U.S. stock market, according to Standard Chartered Bank.
	   Rioting and looting in Indonesia that toppled Suharto, Asia's
longest-serving leader, in May was simply the most dramatic example
of the uncertainty affecting millions who lost their jobs and
hundreds of millions made poorer.
	   A typical case is Nouphen Chartsri. She is not a broke
high-flier forced to sell sandwiches, but an ordinary Thai farm
woman with a few years' education. A life in the tropical sun has
aged her beyond her 30 years.
	   When Asia was booming, Nouphen and her husband left their
village, Ban Meng, in Thailand's poor northeast and worked for
three years in a factory making door locks near Bangkok.
	   The monthly 8,000 baht (at the time dlrs 320) they earned was
twice their previous income from farming rice and cutting cane. For
Nouphen, the certainty of daily wages made up for living in a tiny
company hostel room.
	   Those were good times for the 600 families in Ban Meng. The
young adults went to the city to work. Old folks stayed home, cared
for the kids and compared rising living standards with neighbors as
money sent home paid for cinder-block latrines and installments on
motorcycles, TVs and refrigerators.
	   Most of those migrants are now back. Nouphen and her husband
lost their jobs last August when half of the 200 workers at their
factory were laid off.
	   ``Globalization? I've heard of it, but I don't know what it
means,'' Nouphen said. ``Probably, it means a troubled world.''
	   She's cutting cane again, for free, since her family has gone
into debt to the growers to survive. But cane cutting is irregular.
	   The rice crop has been withered by drought. Fish that used to
supplement their diet have disappeared as irrigation canals filled
with pesticides _ part of Asia's leap into the modern world.
	   Can her family last three years for an economic turnaround?
	   ``I doubt it,'' she said. ``We'll be broken. People will steal,
commit crimes.''
	   Quick fixes to the crisis have failed. The first epidemic of the
globalized economic age has consistently outraced traditional cures
prescribed by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Many Asians accuse the International Monetary Fund, which
organized bailouts totaling dlrs 120 billion for Thailand, South
Korea and Indonesia, for making events worse by forcing governments
to jack up interest rates, driving wobbling companies into
bankruptcy.
	   In hindsight, the currency crisis _ the sudden withdrawal of
speculative billions investors placed in Asia during boom years
when 8 percent annual growth seemed normal _ seems simply the most
vulnerable tip of an over-leveraged iceberg.
	   Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed is not alone in
viewing the Washington-based IMF as a front for Western powers to
flatten Asian competition and pick up assets for a bargain.
	   So far, though, few foreign investors are rushing back to buy.
Stock markets keep sinking with no bottom in sight and the real
risk of most firms isn't known and factored into prices.
	   That reflects what many see as the real roots of the crisis _
the culture of corruption and cozy deals between politicians and
businessmen operating without accountability or oversight.
	   Demands for reform are coming from the IMF on down, but
entrenched elites are generally yielding only the minimum they
think they need to hang on and get back to business as usual.

	   Says Bruce Gale, regional manager of the Hong Kong-based
Political and Economic Risk Consultancy:
	   ``If they get their way, we might find ourselves taking a long
time to crawl out of this crisis.''
	   No one has been punished in Thailand for blatant banking-sector
fraud, linked to influential politicians, and government and
central bank mismanagement that helped bring on the crisis.
	   In South Korea, prosecutors have indicted two top economic
advisers to former President Kim Young-sam charged with mishandling
the crisis, lying about its severity, and corruption. They are in
prison awaiting trial.
	   The biggest threats to Asia now lurk in Japan and China.
Japanese investment fueled the boom. Now, Japan's economy _ in its
deepest recession since World War II _ hobbles the region.
	   The collapse of Japan's banks would rock far more than Asia.
Eight years after the country's economic bubble burst, the banks
are buried under an estimated dlrs 550 billion in bad loans, a
figure greater than entire national economies of its troubled
neighbors.
	   ``The stability of the yen is important to every country around
the world, because after all, (Japan) is the second largest economy
in the world,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive.
	   China has resisted devaluing its own money, fearing the Hong
Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. currency would fall in the backlash
and the rest of Asia's currencies be thrown into fresh chaos.
	   But investment from now-broke Asian neighbors, a key element in
China's super-charged growth in the past decade, has plunged.
	   Beijing is aiming for 8 percent growth in 1988 _ once the norm
for superstars like Thailand and Malaysia.
	   That's what is believed to be the minimum needed to create
enough jobs to keep a lid on worker unrest as communist-era
state-owned enterprises are closed. Signs are the target will be
difficult to meet.
	   Social problems are rising. Almost no Asian countries have
Western-style unemployment relief. Families traditionally get
individuals through hard times.
	   But the pressure can be unbearable. In South Korea, some
laid-off men dress in suits and leave home every morning,
pretending to go to work rather than tell their families the truth.
Suicides have increased 36 percent, to 25 a day.
	   ``I told my husband I was thinking about getting a job,'' said
Choi Bun-soon, 42, a mother of three. ``He just laughed. Who is
going to hire a housewife with no work experience?''

World Cup: Flonaldo again outshines Ronaldo AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Whenever Ronaldo's Brazil faces Norway,
that tall striker called Flonaldo steals the show from the world's
best soccer player.
	   Tore Andre Flo, nicknamed Flonaldo after scoring twice in a 4-2
exhibition win over Brazil a year ago in Oslo, did it again
Tuesday.
	   First, he got the Norwegians back into the game they needed to
win by netting the equalizer with seven minutes left.
	   Taking a long pass from defender Stig Inge Bjornebye, Flo
dribbled around defender Junior Baiano and shot into the left
corner past a diving Taffarel to make it 1-1.
	   ``I got the ball. I was lucky I guess,'' said Flo, who has the
same jersey number, 9, as Ronaldo.
	   ``I took a shot and it went into the corner. It was a good goal,
but we knew we needed one more. Then we got the penalty and it was
a very cool finish by Kjetil (Rekdal).''
	   With a minute left, Junior Baiano collided with Flo in the
penalty area, and American referee Esse Baharmast whistled the
foul. Rekdal fired it into the left side for the clincher, taking
Norway to the second round for the first time.
	   Flo, at 193 centimeters (six foot three inches) one of the
tallest strikers in the World Cup, helped Chelsea win the Cup
Winners' Cup last month. Goalie Frode Grodas won the English FA Cup
final with the London side last year.
	   But beating Brazil, which has already clinched first place in
Group A, was even bigger for the Norwegians.
	   ``I've never been happier than tonight,'' said Flo. ``I won the
Cup Winners' Cup and other prizes, but you just can't compare it
with this.''
	   Grodas agreed.
	   ``Finally we had some luck in the World Cup,'' he said. ``This
was probably our best performance in a match when it really
counted.''
	   Flo, whose brother Jostein also saw action for the first time in
this tournament as a substitute late in the second half, failed to
score in the two previous matches against Morocco (2-2) and
Scotland (1-1).
	   For Brazil, it was the first defeat in this World Cup and its
first loss in the tournament's preliminary round in 32 years.
	   ``It's incredible. I'm amazed at what happened,'' said Norwegian
coach Egil ''Drillo'' Olsen, whose team is unbeaten in their last
17 matches and was ranked fourth in the world by FIFA going into
the tournament.
	   The game actually meant little for Brazil, who took the lead in
the 78th minute on a header by Bebeto, one of their heroes in the
1994 Cup in the United States.
	   After victories over Scotland and Morocco, the team already was
qualified in first place in Group A. Norway, with two points going
in, needed a win to qualify after Morocco jumped to four points
with a 3-0 victory over Scotland in their final match.
	   ``We came in overconfident against a rival we didn't know how
would play against us,'' Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said. ``But
we developed our soccer and will continue to do so.
	   ``But they scored and then came the penalty which I don't really
know what happened there. We played well. We now have to keep
going.''
	   Brazil, winner of the World Cup four times, will play Chile next
in Paris. Norway, which failed to make it to the second round in
two previous World Cup finals, will face Italy next in Marseille.
Both games are set for Saturday.
	   ``If we play like tonight anything can happen (against Italy)''
Rekdal said.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thousands of Thai farmers descended
Wednesday on Parliament to demand relief from poverty made worse by
Asia's economic crisis, but tens of thousands more stayed home
after a deal was reached to suspend their debt payments.
	   The last-minute compromise reached by Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai's government with one of the largest farm groups robbed
what would have been the biggest protest against his
eight-month-old government of its punch.
	   The deal with the Thai Farmers Association, still pending
approval from debt authorities, involves 31,496 households and some
1.4 billion baht (dlrs 33 million) borrowed from state agricultural
banks. Association leaders said they had achieved their goals and
withdrew from the protest. About 10 smaller groups went ahead.
	   Chuan told reporters that the deal would not translate into a
debt moratorium for businesses who borrowed from local and foreign
banks during Thailand's collapsed economic boom and are now unable
to pay back their loans.
	   ``The private sector can deal with its own loans themselves,''
Chuan said. ``Thailand cannot order private lenders not to take
back what they're owed from private debtors. Doing that will only
damage the country.''
	   Police said about 5,000 people had gathered by late morning
outside Parliament, a fraction of the 50,000 initially projected.
Inside, legislators opened three days of debate over the 1999
budget.
	   The protesters arrived by buses, trucks, pickups and cars and
indicated they could stay awhile, carrying sleeping mats, rice
sacks, cooking oil and charcoal. Protests by groups of the poor in
recent years have lasted for months.
	   One banner read, ``George Soros and IMF go to hell,'' referring
to the U.S. financier whose currency attacks against the Thai baht
many blame for triggering the economic crisis.
	   About 500 riot police were on hand. There was no immediate
violence, but Bangkok's notorious traffic was made even worse by
the milling protesters.
	   Chuan has won a reputation for fiscal rectitude since taking
office in November, adhering closely to conditions laid down by the
International Monetary Fund in exchange for a dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout of the recession-bound Thai economy.
	   But critics say high-interest rates aimed at stabilizing the
currency are killing businesses and delaying recovery. Farmers who
have been suffering years of drought and other woes are especially
hard hit.
	   Since May, Chuan has been under attack from opposition
politicians who accuse him of concentrating on the financial sector
_ the rich _ at the expense of the poor. Many of Wednesday's
protesters came from opposition strongholds.
	   Bamrung Kayotha, leader of the Assembly of the Poor, one of the
protesting groups, said that the government did not deserve to be
called democratic.
	   ``It's their intention to buy off our movement,'' Bamrung said.
	   Leaders submitted a proposal for a farm relief law with at least
50,000 signatures to Parliament officials. Among the demands is a
five-year suspension of debt payments for farmers.

Gambler arrested in slaying of Thai entertainment figure 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An unemployed man seeking to pay off
soccer gambling debts has confessed to killing a prominent figure
in the Thai show business world during a botched robbery attempt.
	   Kachornsak Klinfueng, 32, was charged Tuesday with the murder of
Boonliang Adulrithikul, who was shot and killed in the condominium
building where his mistress lived Sunday.
	   Boonliang had pioneered entertainment cafes in Bangkok that
launched the careers of several popular Thai comedians. He normally
visited his mistress after the clubs closed.
	   Kachornsak told police that he tried to rob Boonliang on the
elevator leading to his mistress' flat. Boonliang refused to hand
over his money and valuables and was shot.
	   Police said they were still investigating the possibility other
people were involved. They initially suspected Boonliang's murder
was motivated by jealousy or a business dispute.

Military blocks labor union protest in Indonesia

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of soldiers blocked workers
from staging an anti-government protest at the national Parliament
on Wednesday.
	   A standoff with the military developed after about 200
demonstrators gathered at the office of the Indonesian Prosperity
Trade Union, or SBSI.
	   The army stopped a fleet of buses that had been chartered to
take them to the legislature about 10 kilometers (6 miles) away.
	   Soldiers also blocked a main road and prevented another 100
workers from reaching the union's office.
	   Protesters chanted and waved banners at the troops, but the
situation remained peaceful.
	   ``We want to go to the Parliament. But the army won't give us
permission. We are negotiating with them,'' said Agus Edi, a
protest organizer.
	   The protest had been called by the union's leader, Muchtar
Pakpahan, a former political prisoner released by new President
B.J. Habibie last month.
	   Earlier this week, organizers predicted that thousands of
workers would take part.
	   But only a fraction of the predicted number turned out on
Wednesday after the army warned that it would ``cripple'' the
demonstration.
	   Those who showed up wore blue headbands and carried dozens of
banners. ``Habibie step down,'' read one.
	   Protests have become an almost daily occurrence in Jakarta in
recent weeks.
	   Habibie replaced longtime autocrat Suharto as president in May.
Since then Habibie has promised sweeping political and economic
changes as the world's fourth most populous nation grapples with
its worst financial crisis in decades.
	   Unemployment and inflation are soaring and poverty rates are
predicted to rise dramatically.
	   Organizers of Wednesday's protest said they wanted Habibie, a
close associate of Suharto, to step down so that the process of
reform could be accelerated.

Injured toll in Indian train blast raised to 40 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS pvs to UPDATE with new injured toll
<TEXT>
	   AMRITSAR, India (AP) _ Indian police raised the toll of people
injured in a northern train blast to 40 Wednesday as workers plowed
through overturned cars and twisted metal to look for survivors.
	   There were no immediate reports of deaths or any claim of
responsibility for Tuesday's blast in India's Jammu-Kashmir state.
In the past, police have blamed Muslim guerrillas allegedly armed
and trained by neighboring Pakistan for such attacks.
	   Explosives were planted on the train and set off by remote
control, senior state police official S.K. Mishra said Wednesday by
telephone from the state's winter capital of Jammu. Earlier, police
had said the explosives were on the tracks.
	   The explosion occurred as the Jammu-New Delhi Shalimar Express
was passing though a forest past the Bari Brahmana railroad
station, 10 kilometers (six miles) south of Jammu, police said.
	   At least 10 passengers were hospitalized with serious injuries,
Mishra said. Local doctor Shabnam Abthai said the injured included
three women and two children.
	   The passengers were mostly pilgrims returning from the Himalayan
cave shrine of Vaishno Devi near Jammu, visited by millions of
Hindus every year.
	   Some injured passengers said rescue operations were hampered
because there were no lights in the thick forest.
	   ``The train shook as if there was a storm and then it was all
dark,'' said Poonam, a New Delhi resident who was among the
injured. Poonam uses only one name.
	   Rescue efforts on Wednesday focused on finding survivors and
clearing debris from the track _ the main rail route into
Jammu-Kashmir state.
	   Mishra said the blast blew up 500 meters (yards) of track.
	   Militants have been fighting Indian security forces since 1989
demanding independence for Kashmir, predominately Hindu India's
only Muslim-majority state.
	   Officially Islamic Pakistan says it lends the insurgency only
moral and political support. Pakistan and India have fought two
wars over Kashmir since both nations gained independence from
Britain in 1947. The region is divided between them, and both claim
it in its entirety.

Indonesian says country needs time to wipe out corruption 
</HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE _ Wiping out corruption and cronyism in Indonesia's
banking, business and legal systems will take time, the country's
minister in charge of state-owned enterprises said Friday.
	   Tanri Abeng, speaking at an international gathering here of
business and political leaders, gave no estimate on how long it
would take to nurture ``a culture of treating the law as being
above politics.''
	   But he did not object when an Indonesian businessman on a panel
with him said it would take about two years.
	   ``We must start making legal and judicial reforms that will
enable us to provide all investors, both local and foreign, with
greater transparency and fairness in their transactions,'' Abeng
said in a speech to the Business Week Asian Leadership Forum.
	   The priorities are working out new legal frameworks for contract
law, competition policy, anti-trust legislation and intellectual
property rights, he said.
	   Also in the forefront are closing, recapitalizing or merging
weak banks and implementing new laws to create a sounder banking
system.
	   ``As with our transition to a democracy, which must come
hand-in-hand with the rule of law, these legal and judicial reforms
will take some time before having any discernible impact,'' Abeng
said.
	   ``The people who are responsible for running our legal and
judicial systems must be trained to conduct their affairs with
higher professional and moral standards than before.''
	   Abeng also said that most, but not all, of the nation's poorly
run and uncompetitive state companies will be privatized.
	   He said that Indonesia's 160 state-owned enterprises, with more
than 1,000 subsidiaries, are poorly managed and only 30 percent are
financially healthy.
	   ``Returns on equity are extremely low and most of their product
and service offerings are uncompetitive by world standards,'' he
said.
	   Although the task of reforming the sector is urgent, it is
politically sensitive, not least because 800,000 people are
employed in the state companies, Abeng said.
	   During the 1998-99 fiscal year, the government will sell its
stake in 12 of the enterprises, hoping to generate dlrs 2 billion
in revenue to finance the national budget deficit.
	   A master plan detailing which of the rest will be restructured,
closed or privatized is due in October, he said.
	   Some will be kept under state ownership or management control,
he said, but in those cases there will be changes in regulations,
managements and financing.
	   Abeng also said he was optimistic about reform because President
B.J. Habibie, though criticized for his former role as minister of
research and technology, ``knows that its rice and other basic food
commodities that count right now, not airplanes.''
	   New electoral laws should be ready for public review by August,
Abeng said, and for fair and open elections will probably be held
within one year.

Arrest warrants for 17 in Mexican rebel shootout 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A judge has issued arrest warrants for 17
people accused of rebellion and conspiracy stemming from a
firefight between government forces and leftist rebels.
	   The federal attorney general's office announced the action
involving a June 7 clash in the rural village of El Charco in which
11 people died.
	   Six of those named Tuesday were already in custody.
	   Officials say troops on an anti-drug patrol stumbled across a
meeting of a rebel group at a schoolhouse in El Charco and that a
gunbattle ensued.
	   Some villagers claimed that troops surrounded the rebels and
massacred them _ an account repeatedly denied by the government.
	   The attorney general's office said in a news release that the
arrest warrants were based on interrogation of those arrested after
the clash. It accused them of trying to cause an armed rebellion
and said tests showed that those in custody had fired weapons.
	   One of those arrested, 21-year-old Erika Zamora Pardo, claimed
in a message given to reporters by her family that she had been
tortured to falsely implicate peasant groups in the rebel action.
	   Prosecutors denied those claims.
	   The rebels apparently were members of the Revolutionary Army of
the Insurgent People, a recent offshoot of the Popular
Revolutionary Army, which first appeared in 1996.

Bureaucrats, developer sentenced in Japanese bribery scandal 
</HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FACKLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Tokyo court handed down prison sentences to two
former top bureaucrats and a nursing home developer Wednesday for a
bribery scandal that exposed corruption at the highest levels of
Japan's government.
	   The Tokyo District Court sentenced Nobuharu Okamitsu, the
highest ranking bureaucrat in the Health and Welfare Ministry
before his arrest, to two years in prison, a court official said.
Okamitsu, 59, faced a maximum of seven years.
	   The court also fined him 63.7 million yen (dlrs 460,000), almost
the exact amount that Okamitsu admitted receiving from the
developer between 1992 and 1995.
	   The ruling drew national attention as Japan has grown weary of
almost incessant scandals involving its once vaunted bureaucracy.
Once seen as paragons of selfless service to the nation, they are
increasingly viewed as corrupt.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who has made reforming the
bureaucracy a key plank of his administration, called on officials
to strive to regain the public trust, a news report said.
	   ``In order to prevent the recurrence of such cases, we have to
change the (administrative) system and every single (public
servant) must take the seriousness of the case to heart,'' he was
quoted as saying by Kyodo News.
	   The ruling comes as the trials begin of four Ministry of Finance
bureaucrats and a Bank of Japan official, also charged with
bribery.
	   In Wednesday's ruling, the court handed another health ministry
official, Shigeru Chatani, a suspended sentence of one and a half
years and a fine of 11 million yen (dlrs 80,000).
	   The nursing home developer, Hiroshi Koyama, received a sentence
of one and a half years and a 2 million yen (dlrs 15,000) fine.
	   Okamitsu admitted taking about 60 million yen (dlrs 430,000),
but insisted the money was a friendly gift from Koyama that he
intended to repay.
	   In its ruling, the court accepted the prosecution's argument
that Okamitsu received the money in exchange for funneling
government subsidies to Koyama's company, the Aya Welfare Group.
	   Okamitsu also admitted accepting two cars and a membership at a
private golf course from Koyama, 53.
	   Okamitsu's arrest in December 1996 filled newspaper headlines
and dominated evening news programs.
	   Chatani, 41, was found guilty of taking 12 million (dlrs 85,000)
from Koyama between 1993 and 1996.
	   It was the second major scandal to hit the health ministry in
the past two years. In 1996, a former top official was arrested
over the ministry's failure to prevent thousands of hemophiliacs
from being infected with the AIDS virus through blood transfusions
in the 1980s.

Japan's auto production down for 8th straight month 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses
tumbled 19.7 percent in May, falling for the eighth straight month
due to the sluggish domestic economy and the financial crisis in
Asia.
	   Output totaled 714,887 units, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers' Association said Wednesday.
	   The 19.7 percent drop in May follows a 14.1 percent drop in
April and 10.6 percent fall in March.
	   Production of passenger cars plunged 18.1 percent to 569,910,
truck output sank 25.4 percent to 140,329 and bus output tumbled
17.8 percent to 4,648.
	   Domestic vehicle demand in May fell 7.5 percent from a year
earlier to 396,173.
	   The association estimated vehicle exports in May fell 3 percent.
It will release complete figures later this month.

CHICAGO: seven innings. Mets 6, Orioles 3 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Baltimore, the New York Mets got a victory worth waiting for.
The Mets scored three runs off Arthur Rhodes in the seventh inning
after a lengthy rain delay to beat Baltimore.
	   The game was halted by rain for 1 hour, 26 minutes in the middle
of the sixth with Baltimore holding a 3-2 lead. After John Hudek
(1-4) pitched a scoreless sixth, the Mets came back.
	   Rhodes (3-3) came in for Alan Mills, who pitched 2 1-3 scoreless
innings before the rain came. Matt Franco led off with a single and
took second on a one-out single by Edgardo Alfonzo. After Mike
Piazza flied out to deep right, Bernard Gilkey hit a two-run double
into the right-field corner.
	   Butch Huskey followed with an RBI single for a 5-3 lead. Rey
Ordonez added a run-scoring single off Armando Benitez in the
eighth.
	   John Franco, the sixth New York pitcher, worked the ninth for
his 17th save.
 &UR; Rangers 16, Diamondbacks 5
	   In Arlington, Texas, Juan Gonzalez's two-run double increased
his major league-leading RBI total to 91 and Rusty Greer added a
three-run homer during an 11-run fifth to power Texas over Arizona.
	   Roberto Kelly added a pair of RBI singles in the fifth and Will
Clark had an RBI double in the inning, when the Rangers sent 14
batters to the plate.
	   Texas was shut out for the first time this season on Monday
night in a 6-0 loss to the Diamondbacks.
	   Aaron Sele (11-4) became the majors' first 11-game winner. Sele
(11-4) went seven innings, allowing four runs and 10 hits. Brian
Anderson (5-7) allowed 10 runs and eight hits over four innings.
 &UR; Giants 4, Athletics 2
	   At Oakland, California, Barry Bonds and J.T. Snow hit home runs
and Mark Gardner pitched seven solid innings as San Francisco bea
Oakland.
	   Gardner (6-3) fell behind 2-0 after three innings before
settling down to hold the A's scoreless on three hits over the next
four innings. Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his 23rd save.
	   Tom Candiotti (4-10) pitched four perfect innings before Snow
finally solved his knuckleball, driving his sixth home run of the
season over the right field fence to cut Oakland's 2-0 lead in
half.
 &UR; Angels 6, Dodgers 4
	   At Anaheim, California, Cecil Fielder singled home two runs in
the seventh as Anaheim again rocked Los Angeles' bullpen and kept
new Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman winless in two games.
	   Los Angeles starter Dave Mlicki, shaken up in a collision with
teammate Wilton Guerrero in the fifth inning, left after six
innings with the Dodgers leading 3-2.
	   Reliever Will Brunson gave up a single and two walks and was
replaced by Jim Bruske with one out. Fielder greeted Bruske with
his single, then Matt Walback singled in another run to chase
Bruske and put the Angels up by two.
	   Pep Harris (1-0) pitched one-plus innings for the win, and Rich
DeLucia got the final out for his second save. Brunson (0-1) took
the loss in his second major league appearance.

World Heritage Committee to investigate mining plans in sensitive park 
</HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
Associated press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Debate about the impact of mining in a
remote region of Australia reopened Wednesday after UNESCO's World
Heritage Bureau decided to investigate claims the area is under
threat.
	   Construction begun one week ago at Jabiluka, a uranium mining
lease lying within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park, listed
by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural
Organization on its World Heritage list of important cultural and
environmental sites.
	   The park is almost 12,000 square miles (19,000 sq. kms) of
largely untouched floodplains and plateau on Australia's north
coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile
(200 kms) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species
including many that are rare or endangered.
	   The park is also recognized for the cultural values of the
Aborigines who have lived there continuously for at least 40,000
years and their cave paintings, rock carvings and other
archaeological sites. Thousands of tourists visit the park every
year.
	   The bureau resolved in Paris overnight to send a high-level
mission to Australia after receiving submissions from Aboriginal
traditional owners of the area and others that Jabiluka will put
Kakadu's world heritage values at risk.
	   The Australian government has assured the bureau its
environmental safeguards will not let the region's world heritage
or natural or cultural values be affected by the mine, the bureau
resolution says.
	   ``Because of the importance, complexity and sensitivity of the
issue however ... the World Heritage Committee should visit
Australia and examine the situation further,'' the resolution says.
	   World Heritage Committee chairman Prof. Francesco Francioni will
lead the delegation, which will report to the committee's meeting
in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
	   While in Australia earlier this year, advisor to the committee
Jim Thorsell said Kakadu could be put on UNESCO's ``in danger''
list, indicating the organization believes the values of the site
are in jeopardy.
	   Such a listing is not binding on the Australian government and
would not necessarily prevent the mine from going ahead.
	   Environment Minister Robert Hill said the government will
cooperate with the investigation, but that it is unnecessary
because ``there is no evidence that the world heritage values are
at risk.''
	   Mining company Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. has
consistently said its environmental record has been proven by the
16-year operation of the Ranger uranium mine. Both mining leases
are within Kakadu's boundaries, but are technically not part of the
park.
	   Independent scientific studies have found no adverse impact on
the environment from uranium mining at Ranger, ERA chief executive
Philip Shirvington said, welcoming the prospect of further
international scrutiny.
	   ``If they are genuine and open in their objectives then we have
nothing to fear,'' he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.

Japan tries to block Chinese nationalists from disputed islands 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES to show activists continuing toward island in dingy
AP Photo TPE101 of June 23

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's coast guard on Wednesday tried to block a
small flotilla of boats that were carrying Chinese nationalists to
a chain of islands at the center of a territorial dispute.
	   While the six ships from Taiwan and Hong Kong heeded warnings to
stop from Japanese patrol boats, four activists clambered onto a
rubber dingy and sped on toward the islands, a coast guard official
said.
	   The coast guard dispatched more than 30 cutters and other ships
to intercept the activists, said Yusuke Ono, a spokesman for
Japan's Maritime Safety Agency. It also erected a rope fence to
prevent them from landing, he said.
	   Most of the activists turned back after briefly entering
Japanese waters about 22 kilometers (14 miles) southwest of the
disputed archipelago, known as the Senkaku in Japan but the Diaoyu
by Chinese speakers.
	   The uninhabited, rocky islets lie midway between Taiwan and
Japan's southern island of Okinawa. They are administered by Japan
but claimed by China and Taiwan.
	   Ono said Japanese coast guard ships were pursuing the dingy,
blaring warnings to turn back. He said Japanese ships may try to
block or encircle the tiny boat.
	   The dingy was launched from a ship carrying 25 protesters from
Hong Kong, Japanese news reports said.
	   The other five vessels were Taiwanese and likely left the
northern Taiwanese port of Keelung on Tuesday night, Ono said.
While he didn't know how many people were on board the boats, news
reports here said about 25 people left Taiwan, including local
politicians.
	   Ethnic Chinese nationalists from Hong Kong and Taiwan have tried
repeatedly in the past to land on the islands to protest Japanese
control.
	   In a heated confrontation in May of last year, Japanese coast
guard ships blocked, nudged and collided with a fleet of 28 boats
carrying Hong Kong and Taiwan protesters who wanted to land on the
islands and tear down a lighthouse and markers put up by Japanese
nationalists.
	   The confrontation followed a visit to the islands by a Japanese
right-wing lawmaker that incited a surge of nationalism in Hong
Kong and Taiwan, where many still carry bitter anti-Japanese
memories.
	   Japan occupied Hong Kong during World War II and colonized
Taiwan for 50 years until 1945.
	   In 1996, a Hong Kong activist drowned after jumping into waters
near the islands from one of several protest boats that had come
from Taiwan and Hong Kong.
	   The last attempt to reach the islands by Chinese nationalists
was in September 1997, when rough seas forced a vessel from Hong
Kong carrying eight protesters to turn back.

Report: Japan's Sanyo Securities decides to liquidate business 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sanyo Securities Co., an ailing medium-sized
Japanese brokerage, has decided to go out of business after judging
that it would not find a corporate rescue partner, a major Japanese
economic newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Masamitsu Hattori, a spokesman for Tokyo-based Sanyo, refused to
confirm the report that appeared in the evening edition of the
Nihon Keizai newspaper.
	   A news conference by Sanyo officials was planned at 6:00 p.m.
(0900 GMT), Hattori said.
	   Sanyo applied for court protection from creditors under the
nation's Corporation Rehabilitation law last November.
	   According to the Nihon Keizai and other reports, Sanyo will
return all client assets, the amount of which has dropped to some
400 billion yen (dlrs 2.85 billion) from more than 2 trillion yen
(dlrs 14.28 billion) at the time of its collapse last year.
	   Kyodo News Service and public television broadcaster NHK also
reported the brokerage's decision to liquidate.
	   The company will also close relatively profitable branches that
have been kept open in case a viable partner was found and dismiss
all remaining employees, the reports said.
	   About 1,100 of its more than 2,000 workers have already left the
second-tier brokerage.
	   Last November, the company filed for court protection with debts
of 373.6 billion yen (dlrs 2.66 billion), much of which was
attributed to real estate-related soured loans held by nonbank
affiliates.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Danish man and a Thai woman, both
mute, have exchanged wedding vows before more than 1,000 people.
	   Gert Mikkelsen, 44, a technician for a Danish company, plans to

in France to catch a World Cup soccer match, The Nation newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The couple have been communicating with each other through sign
language for 12 years, The Nation said, and overcame early problems
because they had used slightly different signing techniques.
	   The Nation said that Tuesday's wedding in the historic Thai
capital of Ayutthaya, 70 kilometers (44 miles) north of Bangkok,
was attended by the provincial governor and police chief.

Philippine stocks end mixed, peso weakens further 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks ended mixed
Wednesday as some investors hunted for bargains among oversold
blue-chip stocks and others took advantage of Tuesday's mild rally
to take profits, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, weakened further in morning trading,
dragged down again by the yen's slide against the dollar.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index rose 17.02 points, or 1 percent, to 1,712.88, following
Tuesday's 0.4 percent rise.
	   Decliners, however, edged out gainers, 49 to 48, while 49 issues
were unchanged.
	   Tuesday's rise followed a two-day losing streak for the main
index which wiped out 138.90 points, or 7.6 percent of its value,
and sent prices of blue-chip stocks to bargain levels.
	   Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales of Abacus Securities
Corp., said big foreign fund managers were evident Wednesday and
all positioned behind blue-chips.
	   Fanning interest in blue-chip issues was the Dow Jones
Industrial Average's surge overnight, traders said.
	   Traders, however, doubt interest in Manila shares can be
sustained.
	   ``The whole picture (in Asia) hasn't really changed. Japan is
still in a recession and other Asian economies are also
weakening,'' said Siao.
	   Wednesday saw the dollar hitting 140 yen in Tokyo from late
Tuesday's 137.85 yen. Traders said there is growing impatience over
Japan's financial reform policies, which have yet to be made clear.
	   News that credit rating agency Fitch IBCA was concerned about
Japan's sovereign credit rating also contributed to the yen's weak
showing Wednesday.
	   ``Investors shouldn't get excited with the gains experienced
Wednesday,'' said James Ortiz-Luis, analyst for R. Coyuito
Securities Inc.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 41.449 pesos in morning
trading, compared to Monday's 41.329 pesos.
	   Traders said the peso was following the weaker trend of regional
currencies.

Tests help doctors identify drug-resistant HIV, tailor treatment AP Medical Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BRENDA C. COLEMAN
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ New tests are helping identify
treatment-resistant strains of the AIDS virus, allowing doctors to
customize the drug cocktails given to their patients.
	   The AIDS virus rapidly mutates, or changes genetically, to
resist the drugs thrown at it. As a result, some patients get no
prolonged relief from their first try on the powerful combinations
of drugs now available against HIV.
	   To help doctors find an effective combination, scientists are
developing resistance tests and marketing them.
	   But the tests do not have a long enough track record to be used
routinely, a panel assembled by the International AIDS Society-USA
said in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
	   Until more study, the tests are appropriate only in certain
situations, said the team, led by Dr. Martin S. Hirsch, director of
clinical AIDS research at Massachusetts General Hospital.
	   There are two types of tests: one that looks for genetic
mutations that have known drug resistance, and another that
directly measures whether a drug will kill the AIDS virus taken
from an individual patient.
	   HIV treatment usually involves two older drugs and one of the
newer class of medicines called protease inhibitors. Such cocktails
have revolutionized therapy, reducing the virus to nearly
undetectable levels in the body.
	   Resistance to such cocktails is still relatively rare, and
routinely screening HIV-positive patients before starting them on
treatment is not justified, the panel said.
	   Resistance tests are best used to guide therapy after initial
treatment fails and all other possible causes of treatment failure
are ruled out, the panel said.
	   The International AIDS Society-USA is an independent, nonprofit
organization in San Francisco.

Police patrol streets after night of violence leaves 6 dead 
</HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunmen with automatic rifles shot and
killed a policewoman as she stepped out of her home in an
ethnically troubled southern neighborhood of Karachi on Wednesday,
police officials said.
	   The slaying occurred as police in armored vehicles patrolled
several violent neighborhoods after a night of ethnically motivated
violence left six people dead and several people injured, including
a small boy caught in the crossfire, police said.
	   The motive for Wednesday's slaying of the former head of
Pakistan's all-women police force, Farukh Sultana, was not
immediately clear, but police say it was linked to the relentless
ethnic violence terrorizing the country's financial capital.
	   In recent weeks ethnically motivated violence has led to the
deaths of 150 people, many of them civilians caught in the
crossfire.
	   The combatants, rival members of the Mohajir Qami Movement, roam
the city's congested streets, often at night, attacking their
rivals with automatic rifles.
	   The movement, which represents Indian Muslims who settled in
Pakistan after 1947, split into two groups several years ago. In
recent weeks a third group emerged and members of all three groups
attack each other.
	   Late on Tuesday gunmen attacked an office of the movement's
largest faction led by exiled leader Altaf Hussein, killing two
people and injuring two others.
	   By early Wednesday bands of armed men were roaming the streets
of the area forcing shop keepers to close and warning people to
stay in doors.
	   In a separate incident gunmen broke into the home of another
Hussein supported and killed two people.
	   A fifth Hussein activist was killed in a shootout in the
troubled Korangi neighborhood in eastern Karachi. A young boy was
hit by a stray bullet and was in hospital in satisfactory
condition, said police.
	   A sixth person, who was not been identified, was killed in a
southern neighborhood in the old part of the city.
	   On Tuesday police swept through several neighborhoods of Karachi
arresting an estimated 200 people, most of them young men.
	   No charges have been brought and it wasn't immediately clear
whether any of the people who were arrested had been involved in
the latest round of violence.
	   Most of the Muslims who came to Pakistan from India settled in
southern Sindh province, mostly in the major urban centers,
including the provincial capital of Karachi.
	   Calling themselves mohajirs, meaning refugees, they have accused
successive governments of treating them unfairly and giving job and
education preference to the country's established ethnic groups of
Pathans, Punjabis, Sindhis and Baluch.

Indonesian official says letter of intent to be signed with IMF 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Indonesia plans to sign a letter of
intent Thursday with the International Monetary Fund for resumption
of a dlrs 43 billion bailout package, the government said.
	   IMF loans were suspended in May because of political turmoil
that led to the resignation of President Suharto after 32 years in
power. Indonesia is suffering a year-long economic crisis that has
driven up prices and pushed millions of people out of work.
	   IMF representatives and Indonesian officials have been revising
terms of the rescue deal as well as the national budget, which is
expected to include more subsidies for the poor.
	   As many as 1,200 people died in riots over price increases last
month in the capital, Jakarta.
	   Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's chief economics minister,
said Wednesday that talks with the IMF were going well and he hoped
to sign a letter of intent Thursday.
	   Hubert Neiss, the IMF's director for Asia and Pacific affairs,
has been in Jakarta for two weeks conducting a review of the
assistance program to Indonesia. Neiss has said aid would be
resumed in early July.

Indonesian president to meet Nobel prize winner about East Timor GMT 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous cycle; news conference expected after 0900
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In a sign of Indonesia's new openness,
President B.J. Habibie and Nobel peace laureate Bishop Carlos Belo
were to meet Wednesday to discuss the conflict in
Indonesian-controlled East Timor.
	   The talks at Jakarta's presidential palace were expected to
center on a peace offering made by Habibie last week.
	   The president has said he's willing to free imprisoned East
Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao and grant special status to the
disputed territory. In exchange the world community must recognize
Indonesian sovereignty over the former Portuguese colony, he said.
	   The offer represents a major shift in policy compared with the
intransigence of former President Suharto, whom Habibie replaced
last month.
	   Nevertheless, a solution to the 23-year-old conflict in East
Timor seems distant.
	   Portugal, Gusmao and other critics of Indonesian policy have
rejected Habibie's suggestion, saying East Timorese should decide
their political future through a referendum.
	   Indonesian forces invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a
year later. A small group of separatist rebels continues to fight
and many East Timorese want a vote on independence, which Habibie
has ruled out.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, a vigorous defender of Indonesian
control of East Timor, will attend the meeting between Belo and
Habibie at the presidential palace, State Secretary Akbar Tanjung
said.
	   Belo shared the Nobel prize in 1996 with East Timorese activist
Jose Ramos-Horta for their efforts to bring peace to their
homeland.
	   Belo is the spiritual leader of East Timor, which is
predominately Catholic in comparison with the rest of
overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia.
	   Habibie, who is pursuing an agenda of democratic reform, took
office May 21 after Suharto resigned amid political and economic
turmoil.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Macaulay Culkin, star of the ``Home Alone''
movies, won't be alone any more.
	   Culkin and Broadway actress Rachel Miner, both 17, married
Sunday at a small stone church in Washington, Connecticut, in front
of family and friends, according to Culkin's publicist, Paul Bloch.
	   Because the newlyweds were under 18, they had to present a
notarized statement of parental consent for a marriage license.
Town Clerk Sheila Anson said the couple were issued a license
Saturday.
	   Miss Miner starred in the recent Broadway production of ``The
Diary of Anne Frank'' in the role of Margot, Anne's sister.
	   Culkin's film credits include two ``Home Alone'' movies, ``My
Girl,'' ``The Good Son'' and ``Richie Rich.'' He made the Forbes
magazine richest entertainer list in 1993 after earning dlrs 23
million over two years.

Brunei appoints commission to ward off Asian economic contagion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Brunei's sultan has appointed
his brother to head a fledgling economic council tasked with
ensuring that the tiny oil-rich kingdom remains insulated from the
shocks of the Asian economic crisis.
	   Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah named his brother, Prince Mohamed
Bolkiah, to preside over the newly-formed Ministerial Economic
Council, the Prime Minister's office said Tuesday in a statement.
	   The MEC will evaluate ``the current economic situation of the
country and the region'' and plan ``short and long-term action
necessary for the country as a whole,'' it said.
	   The statement provided no other details about how the council
will operate. It was not immediately clear how Brunei felt
threatened by the Asian downturn but some big Brunei-based private
companies appeared to be in trouble.
	   The announcement came just a day after the country's deputy
finance minister, Ahmad Wally Skinner, stressed that Brunei wasn't
in financial distress.
	   In fact, he said Monday that the nation's economic situation was
under control and that the government would boost its development
budget in 1998 from dlrs 600 million to dlrs 1 billion.
	   The additional spending would be used by Brunei to host the
Southeast Asian Games in 1999 and the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation Summit in the year 2000, he said.
	   Brunei's vast oil reserves have sheltered the wealthy nation
from a deepening economic crisis that has disabled its neighboring
countries, analysts say.
	   The tiny strip of territory wedged in against the South China
Sea is among the richest nations in the world with a per-capita GNP
of dlrs 20,400.
	   None of its 300,000 people pay taxes and medical care is free.
Members of Brunei's royal family count among the richest people in
the world.

Dollar surges in Tokyo, Japanese stocks finish higher prices 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar surged against the yen Wednesday
amid renewed pessimism after a British rating agency said it may
downgrade Japan's credit rating. Tokyo stocks closed higher.
	   The dollar bought 140.86 yen at mid-afternoon, up 3.11 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate of 139.15
overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
gained 68.58 points, or 0.46 percent, closing at 15,123.18. On
Tuesday, the average fell 254.49 points, or 1.66 percent.
	   The rating agency Fitch IBCA warned Tuesday that Japan's credit
rating could be downgraded, citing reasons such as its recession,
the slumping stock market, the weakening yen and the beleaguered
banking system.
	   The warning follows last week's downgrade of the Long-Term Bank
of Japan Ltd. by Moody's Investors Services, which sent shares of
the once mighty industrial lender tumbling to half their value in
just two trading sessions.
	   LTCB shares recovered slightly Tuesday, rising 9 yen to 71 yen,
after government officials promised support for the troubled bank.
On Wednesday, LTCB shares closed 1 yen lower at 70 yen.
	   Traders said the dollar moved higher during Wednesday amid no
sign of central bank intervention. Last week joint action by the
U.S. and Japanese central banks helped push the yen back below 140
yen.
	   ``Nobody expected the dollar to rise above 140 yen'' so quickly,
said Eiji Takane, deputy treasury manager at Asahi Bank.
	   Traders said that unless Japanese leaders take action to fix
their country's financial ills, the dollar will likely keep rising.
	   Meanwhile, gains in export-oriented, high technology issues in
the afternoon session helped leave the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main
index in positive territory. Some of major bank issues, which were
early winners, fell into negative territory at the close.
	   But many investors were waiting for more details of the
government's promised ``total plan'' to revive the economy and
accelerate reform of the banking industry, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 5.51 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,180.93
points. The TOPIX closed down 11.89 points, or 1.00 percent, the
previous day.
	   Key to any reform package would be measures to help banks write
off some 76 trillion yen (about dlrs 500 billion) in bad loans left
on their books from the collapse of the real estate market in the
early 1990s.
	   Governing Liberal Democratic Party officials have said the party
will come up with a plan by July 8 for a ``bridge bank'' to handle
bad loans.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.200 percent from Tuesday's 1.260 percent, driving
its price up to 111.97 yen from 111.53 yen.

Mexican congressmen angered by U.S. counterparts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican congressmen accused their U.S.
counterparts of violating a spirit of cooperation between the two
countries with a resolution supporting U.S. drug agents who carried
out a sting operation in Mexico.
	   The U.S. House of Representatives voted 404-3 on Monday in favor
of a non-binding resolution endorsing the Operation Casablanca
money-laundering sting that Mexico claims violated its sovereignty.
	   It also said the United States ``should not extradite to
Mexico'' American law enforcement agents involved in the operation
that led to 167 arrests, including several Mexican bankers.
	   The House action came two days after Mexican and U.S.
congressmen met in Mexico to discuss common concerns _ a fact the
Mexican lawmakers noted with irritation.
	   ``These types of attitudes by the U.S. Congress gravely
contradict the spirit of collaboration which must animate the fight
against consumption, production and traffic of drugs, and resulting
money laundering,'' said a communique issued Tuesday by the
International Affairs Committee of Mexico's Chamber of Deputies.
	   Mexican officials have said the agents violated Mexican law by
operating here without permission and they have threatened to seek
their extradition.

China, U.S. to sign environmental agreements during Clinton's visit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ On the eve of President Clinton's visit, China's
environment minister appealed Wednesday for closer cooperation in
tackling deadly pollution created by the nation's rush for
modernization.
	   Xie Zhenhua, head of the State Environmental Protection Agency,
said environmental agreements would be signed during Clinton's
state visit, the first by a U.S. president in almost 10 years.
	   The United States wants China's support in efforts to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. China is
looking to U.S. technology and investment to help control its
worsening pollution problems.
	   ``As two major players in the environmental field the two
countries have broad prospects for cooperation,'' Xie said at a
pre-summit news conference.
	   Apart from its advanced environmental technology, U.S. successes
and failures in tackling pollution offer lessons on environmental
protection, he said.
	   So far, the two countries were not cooperating as fully as they
could, Xie said.
	   China ``has quite a few environmental problems,'' he said. ``I
hope that through the visit, further cooperation in the
environmental field between the two countries can be
strengthened.''
	   Chinese economic plans for 1996 to 2000 called for a 450 billion
yuan (dlrs 54 billion) investment in the environment.
	   Xie welcomed foreign companies to take part, saying ``the market
is extremely big.''
	   ``We hope these foreign enterprises can make money by investing
in the environmental protection field in China,'' he said.

Bangldesh prime minister arrives with message of peace 
</HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina brought a message of peace Wednesday to her larger South
Asian neighbors who recently declared themselves nuclear powers.
	   Hasina, who arrived here Wednesday, is expected to offer to host
talks between the leaders of India and Pakistan with an eye to
reducing tensions in the region, media reports said.
	   Since conducting tit-for-tat nuclear tests last month, Pakistan
and India have vacillated between accusations and offers of peace
talks.
	   The two leaders are expected to meet next month in Sri Lanka
during a summit of South Asian leaders. If the talks go ahead, it
will be their first face-to-face talks since the nuclear
explosions.
	   Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been demanding
international intervention in the Kashmir dispute, which Pakistan
says has to be solved if relations with India are to improve.
	   Both Pakistan and India lay claim to a united Kashmir, divided
between the two countries since the British left the subcontinent
in 1947.
	   India has flatly rejected mediation. Hasina was in India on June
16.
	   While in Pakistan, she is expected to meet Pakistan President
Rafiq Tarar and also push for greater trade with Pakistan before
returning to Bangladesh later in the day.

New problems force Russia to postpone satellite launch again 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia postponed the launch of six satellites for
the second time on Wednesday after new problems were discovered
with the cranky Zenit-2 booster rocket, officials said.
	   The launch from Russia's Baikonur cosmodrome had originally been
scheduled for Tuesday, but was postponed until Wednesday because of
a failure in the launching equipment.
	   The malfunction was repaired, but on Wednesday morning more
problems arose, said Alexander Buchin, spokesman for Russia's
Strategic Missile Forces.
	   A commission was to meet later Wednesday to review the problem
and set a new launch date, Buchin said.
	   The malfunction was in ``one of the rocket's devices,'' Buchin
said, adding that he did not know any details.
	   Space experts have been cautious with the Zenit-2 booster since
it has been involved in more than a half dozen accidents and
failures since 1985.
	   Last year, a Zenit-2 booster crashed less than a minute after
launch from Baikonur, which is located in neighboring Kazakstan.
Last week, a faulty booster put six ``spy mailbox'' satellites in
the wrong orbit.
	   The booster is to carry into orbit satellites from Russia as
well as Germany, Israel, Chile, Australia and Thailand.
	   The Russian Resurs-0 satellite will relay ecological and
meteorological information, while the others will take measurements
of the Earth's surface.
	   Russia has been pushing commercial satellite launches as a way
to help fund its space program, which is struggling after the loss
of Soviet-era subsidies. Russia launched 48 commercial satellites
last year.

New Zealand youngsters set for England 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ One of the youngest and most
inexperienced New Zealand backlines in recent test rugby union
history will line up against England in Saturday's return
international at Eden Park.
	   A foot injury sustained in last Saturday's first test in Dunedin
ruled 28-year-old center Walter Little out Wednesday, leaving the
All Black midfield backline light in terms of international
experience.
	   Little, who played his 48th international for the All Blacks in
the 64-22 first test win, will be replaced by 20-year-old Caleb
Ralph, known more as a sevens player.
	   Ralph will move to standoff, pushing Mark Mayerhofler back to
his familiar center role.
	   Mayerhofler, 25, made his All Black debut last week at center
for the axed Frank Bunce, capped 55 times.
	   The All Blacks have lost most of their experienced players from
last year's unbeaten team.
	   While injury forced Sean Fitzpatrick out, Zinzan Brooke retired
from representative rugby and Michael Jones suffered a concussion
against England, which put him out of all rugby for 21 days.
	   Meanwhile, England nearly lost its second lock Wednesday when
Garath Archer rolled an ankle at training.
	   England manager Roger Uttley said his medical team was confident
23-year-old Archer would be able to play. (djp)

returning Wednesday to a hero's welcome in the Gaza Strip.
	   Well wishers gathered at the Gaza City home of the 62-year-old
quadriplegic. A freshly spray painted graffiti on a nearby wall
proclaimed: ``The Islamic nation is very proud of Ahmed Yassin who
... can lead the nation to victory from his wheelchair.''
	   During a four-month fundraising tour of nearly a dozen Arab
capitals, Yassin had raised millions of dollars for the Islamic
militant group Hamas that vehemently opposes peace with Israel.
	   Yassin also made fiery statements _ widely reported in Israel _
praising suicide bombers and calling on Palestinians to carry on an
armed struggle against the Jewish state.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai left it open until
the last minute whether he would allow Yassin to return to the Gaza
Strip. Israel controls Gaza's external borders.
	   However, Israeli officials have said they considered Yassin more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his movements can be
monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The frail white-bearded Yassin was to fly by helicopter from
Cairo to the Rafah border at around noon Wednesday.
	   Yassin, who is the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, left
Gaza in late February, ostensibly on a short trip to obtain medical
treatment. Instead, he embarked on a tour of the Arab world.
	   In recent months, Yassin has posed a growing challenge to
Arafat's authority. Public opinion polls suggest Palestinian
support for Hamas has crept upward in recent months as the peace
process _ supported by Arafat's Palestinian Authority _ has
remained at an impasse.
	   This marks Yassin's second triumphal homecoming to Gaza in nine
months. Israel was forced to release him from prison in September
to buy the freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents who were caught
trying to kill another Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
	   Yassin, who is almost completely paralyzed and nearly blind, had
served eight years of a life term for ordering the killings of
Israeli soldiers and Palestinians accused of collaborating with the
Israelis.
	   In recent months, there has been an increasing rift between
Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.
	   Arafat's camp blamed an internal Hamas feud for the death of
chief Hamas bombmaker Mohiyadine Sharif, who was found dead March
29 at the scene of a massive car-bomb blast in the West Bank town
of Ramallah.
	   But Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz Rantisi blamed the Palestinian
Authority and several high-ranking Palestinian officials and
security chiefs for collaborating with Israel in Sharif's death.
	   Rantisi was arrested in April and charged with endangering
national security. Earlier this month, the Palestinian Supreme
Court Rantisi released for lack of evidence, but he remains jailed.
	   Palestinian security forces routinely ignore court orders and
keep detainees in custody until their release is personally
approved by Arafat.
	   Last week, Hamas spurned an offer to join Arafat's Cabinet.

Despite abuses, Cambodian elections get international go-ahead

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Campaigning for Cambodia's elections
officially begins Thursday after months of abuses fueling debate
over whether the polls July 26 will be good for democracy _ or a
cynical farce.
	   Opposition leaders and human rights and election watchdog groups
have condemned a political environment of violence and coercion,
urging that, at the least, the vote should be delayed pending
minimum conditions for credibility.
	   But the international community, which wants the vote to return
Cambodia to a semblance of democracy after last year's bloody coup,
holds the ultimate stamp of approval and has decided despite its
own long list of concerns to go ahead.
	   Underlying the apparent acquiescence to tactics used by
strongman Hun Sen to ensure his victory is an unspoken recognition
that a flawed election is the best Cambodia can expect.
	   ``We can't expect an absolutely perfect situation on the 26th of
July,'' said Sven Linder, chief European Union election observer.
``But we can hope for and expect clear signals to be sent that
Cambodia is taking further steps toward democracy.''
	   The European Union, which is allocating dlrs 11.5 million to
help the elections, will pay a key role in deciding if the world at
large can call the polls credible once they're held.
	   The United States is giving dlrs 2.3 million to private groups
involved in the process, but none to Hun Sen's government.
	   That's peanuts compared to the dlrs 2 billion spent by the
international community in 1993, when some 20,000 United Nations
peacekeepers helped create a climate where Cambodians could vote,
most for the first time in their lives.
	   Cambodia was then a higher-profile international problem, still
torn by war with Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who boycotted the vote and
vowed to kill people taking part.
	   The Khmer Rouge, which caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
people between 1975 and 1979, now appears to be on its last legs.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party won the vote. But Hun
Sen, who ruled in the 1980s with the backing of Vietnam, forced his
way into a co-premiership by threatening more war.
	   Tensions erupted in fighting July 5, 1997, and Ranariddh was
toppled. After months of diplomatic pressure, Hun Sen allowed him
to return to contest the vote.
	   Hun Sen hopes to win back international aid and legitimacy, but
has stacked the electoral bodies with his supporters and denied the
opposition access to the all-important broadcast media.
	   The killings of some 100 of his opponents since the coup have
gone unpunished, and opposition parties regularly complain of
attacks and intimidation against their supporters.
	   ``There is no chance that a deeply flawed and rushed electoral
process will help Cambodia either establish democracy or bring an
end to disruptive military activities,'' the U.S.-based Human
Rights Watch said.
	   But while the vote appears to be a foregone conclusion, the wild
card remains the Cambodian people. In 1993, Hun Sen's victory was
also widely predicted.

Two former soldiers on peace mission barred entry to U.S., Canada 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two Japanese World War II veterans who had planned
to give talks on Japan's wartime atrocities have been refused entry
to the United States and Canada, the delegation's leader said
Wednesday.
	   Yoshio Shinozuka and Shiro Azuma were to give talks in North
America on war crimes committed by Japan during its brutal conquest
of China in the 1930s and 1940s, said Kohken Tsuchiya, a lawyer who
organized the tour.
	   Both men have since the war become well-known anti-war activists
in Japan, and have traveled widely to apologize and lecture on
Japan's wartime atrocities.
	   Azuma, 86, was to give testimony on the ``Rape of Nanking,'' the
Japanese army's massacre and rape of thousands of civilians in the
Chinese city now known as Nanjing.
	   Shinozuka, 74, was part of Japan's notorious Unit 731, which
conducted biological weapons experiments on prisoners of war and
civilians.
	   But the United States and Canada refused them entry because they
are suspected of having participated in war crimes, such as the
testing of biological weapons on prisoners of war, Tsuchiya said.
	   ``The purpose of the visit is to shed light on the truth,
confess everything that happened during the war, and to apologize
in the interest of promoting peace,'' he said.
	   The Canadian Embassy in Tokyo said the two were refused entry
because Canadian immigration law forbids visits by known war
criminals.
	   Neither Shinozuka or Azuma have been indicted by a war crimes
tribunal, but ``we have sufficient reason to believe they were war
criminals,'' said embassy spokesman Stephane Jobin.
	   U.S. government officials were not immediately available for
comment. Canada refused entry for the two on Monday, and the United
States made its decision Tuesday.
	   The two were to travel Thursday with a 20-member Japanese
delegation that will give talks at war exhibitions organized by the
Global Alliance for Preserving the History of World War II in Asia,
an organization of Chinese residents in the United States and
Canada.

Kenyan deported after appeal to stay in New Zealand rejected 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A Kenyan musician, the first
person jailed in New Zealand for knowingly infecting sexual
partners with HIV, was deported Wednesday after a final court
appeal was rejected.
	   Peter Mwai was released from prison Wednesday after serving four
years of a seven-year sentence following his conviction on charges
of deliberately having unprotected sex with partners while
knowingly being infected with HIV.
	   Mwai, 33, claimed he did not realize the significance of his HIV
infection. Two of at least five women with whom Mwai had
unprotected sex have become infected with HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS.
	   Immigration officials held Mwai at Auckland airport during the
day, and then put him aboard a flight back to Kenya after the
Appeal Court rejected his claim that humanitarian circumstances had
not been properly considered when his deportation was ordered.
	   A nurse accompanied the HIV patient on his trip, to ensure he
remained well during the flight.
	   Mwai left behind him a de facto wife and a 6-year-old daughter.
	   In 1994, he became part of New Zealand legal history when he was
found guilty of having unprotected sex with several women despite
knowing he carried the virus.
	   Mwai entered New Zealand on a Kenyan passport in 1990, but is
thought to have been born in Uganda. He was convicted in 1996 on
four counts of producing a fraudulent passport and of making a
false immigration statement.
	   Police say Peter Mwai is not his real name, and his true
identity is still a mystery.

	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin, a thorn in

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thousands of Thai farmers descended on
Parliament Wednesday to demand relief from poverty worsened by
Asia's economic crisis, but tens of thousands more stayed home
after a deal was reached to suspend their debt payments.
	   The last-minute compromise reached by Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai's government with one of the largest farm groups robbed
what would have been the biggest protest against his 8-month-old
government of its punch.
	   The deal with the Thai Farmers Association, still pending
approval from debt authorities, involves 31,496 households and some
1.4 billion baht (dlrs 33 million) borrowed from state agricultural
banks. Association leaders said they had achieved their goals and
withdrew from the protest. About 10 smaller groups went ahead.
	   Chuan told reporters that the deal would not translate into a
debt moratorium for businesses that borrowed from local and foreign
banks during Thailand's collapsed economic boom and are now unable
to pay back their loans.
	   ``Thailand cannot order private lenders not to take back what
they're owed from private debtors,'' Chuan said. ``Doing that will
only damage the country.''
	   Police said about 5,000 people had gathered outside Parliament,
a fraction of the 50,000 initially projected. Inside, legislators
opened three days of debate over the 1999 budget.
	   Chuan proposed a budget of 825 billion baht (dlrs 19.6 billion),
with at least 25 billion baht (dlrs 595,000) in deficit spending.
He predicted economic growth of up to 2 percent in 1999, a sharp
rise from an economy shrinking up to 5.5 percent this year.
	   Outside, the protesters arrived by buses, trucks, pickups and
cars and indicated they could stay awhile, carrying sleeping mats,
rice sacks, cooking oil and charcoal.
	   One banner read, ``George Soros and IMF go to hell,'' referring
to the U.S. financier whose currency attacks against the Thai baht
many blame for triggering the economic crisis.
	   About 500 riot police were on hand. There was no violence.
	   Chuan has won a reputation for fiscal rectitude for meeting
conditions set by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a
dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of the recession-bound economy.
	   But critics say high interest rates aimed at stabilizing the
currency are killing businesses and delaying recovery. Farmers who
have been suffering years of drought are especially hard hit.
	   Chuan has been under attack from opposition politicians who
accuse him of concentrating on the financial sector _ the rich _ at
the expense of the poor. Many of Wednesday's protesters came from
opposition strongholds.
	   Bamrung Kayotha, leader of the Assembly of the Poor, one of the
protesting groups, said the government did not deserve to be called
democratic.
	   ``It's their intention to buy off our movement,'' Bamrung said.
	   Leaders submitted a proposal for a farm relief law with at least
50,000 signatures to Parliament officials. Among the demands is a
five-year suspension of debt payments for farmers.

Truth Commission suggests reopening Machel crash investigation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South AFrica (AP) _ The Truth and Reconciliation
Commssion says new evidence suggests reopening the investigation of
a 1986 plane crash that killed President Samora Machel of
Mozambique.
	   The panel would not revel the nature of the new evidence it had
gathered during a special hearing into the crash.
	   However, Dumisa Ntsebeza, the chief investigator for the panel,
told South African television Tuesday night that ``our
investigation gives a suggestion that elements of the South African
Defense Force, Military Intelligence or Special Forces were not
uninvolved in the crash.''
	   An inquiry by the former apartheid government found that pilot
error caused the Russian-made Tupelov plane to crash into a hill in
eastern South Africa while on a flight from Malawi to Maputo,
Mozambique's capital.
	   But Russian experts concluded the pilots were following a decoy
signal, thinking it was transmitted from the airport in Maputo,
when the plane plowed into the ground.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, who is romantically
involved with Machel's widow Graca, has vowed to find the truth
about his death. Mrs. Machel was to share the results of her own
inquiries into the death of her husband, the panel said.
	   Mrs. Machel spent four hours testifying before a closed hearing
of the Commission on Tuesday and emerged to thank South Africa for
investigating her husband's death, which she referred to as an
assassination.
	   Truth Commission spokesman Vuyani Green said recently that
evidence links activities of the apartheid-era South African
Defence Force to the crash. He did not elaborate.
	   The panel's investigation began earlier this month with
witnesses who went unnamed because of fears for their safety,
officials said.
	   South Africa's apartheid government denied it used false signals
from navigation beacons to lure the plane off course. An
International Civil Aviation Organization team said there was
nothing mysterious or sinister about the accident.
	   Machel and South Africa's government had been at odds.
	   Mozambique gave refuge to South African anti-apartheid
guerrillas.
	   South Africa's white-minority government backed a rebel movement
in Mozambique _ RENAMO, the Portuguese acronym for the Mozambique
National Resistance _ that tried to unseat Machel's socialist
government.
	   The Truth Commission is investigating apartheid-era atrocities,
and can give amnesty to those who fully confess to human rights
abuses.

First Japanese Cabinet minister visits disputed Kurils 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese Cabinet member arrived on the island of
Kunashiri on Wednesday, becoming the first Cabinet minister to do
so since Russia occupied the island and several others claimed by
Japan at the end of World War II.
	   The visit by Muneo Suzuki underscores efforts by Moscow and
Tokyo to improve bilateral relations, which have long been stalled
over their rival claims to the islands in the southern Kurils.
	   The islands are just off the coast of Japan's northernmost main
island and Russia's east coast.
	   While on Kunashiri, known in Russian as Kunasir, Suzuki will
offer 450 million yen (dlrs 3.2 million) for the reconstruction of
a pier damaged in a 1994 earthquake, according to a Japanese
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   After arriving in Yuzhno-Kurilsk, the island's biggest town,
Suzuki met with Vladimir Zema, head of Russia's Southern Kuril
district, and Mikhail Tereshko, director of the Regional Kurils
Department.
	   Suzuki was also scheduled to meet with other local officials and
residents before moving on to the island of Etorofu, or Iturup in
Russian, later Wednesday.
	   Suzuki will return to Kunashiri Friday morning before returning
to Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido. Suzuki is head of the
Hokkaido Development Agency.
	   Last November, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed to work toward resolving the
territorial issue so that a World War II peace treaty may be
concluded by 2000.

Mahathir's daughter's house goes without water 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ While authorities say the water
supply situation in the Malaysian capital is improving, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's daughter complained Wednesday that her
tap had been dry for two days.
	   ``I returned from a much needed retreat to a house with no
water,'' Marina Mahathir wrote in her regular column in the Star
newspaper.
	   ``For two whole days. Without any warning. Not pleasant,'' she
said.
	   She criticized officials for promising that the water situation
would be rectified in December. ``Pardon me if I am not exactly
thrilled.''
	   Nearly 2 million residents of Kuala Lumpur and suburbs haven't
had regular water supply for three months. Many neighborhoods are
dependent on water trucks that arrive a few times each week.
	   Marina Mahathir, 41, is often boldly critical of policies of her
father's government and Malaysian society in her column. Mainstream
Malaysian papers don't often directly criticize senior government
leaders.
	   In Wednesday's piece, she took a swipe at Malaysian officials
dubbing criticism of the government or its leaders as unpatriotic.
Mahathir, 72, at last week's convention of his United Malays
National Organization party, said those trying to raise the issue
of nepotism and cronyism were influenced by Westerners.
	   ``Here the very idea that you don't always think that things are
being handled the right way is looked on with horror, at least by
those doing the handling,'' she wrote.
	   ``Worse, sometimes you are accused of being the patsy of some
sinister `foreign element.'''

German man stabbed to death at Thai seaside resort 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Mueller's hometown not available
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A German man was found stabbed to death
in his hotel room at a Thai seaside resort town popular with
foreigners, police said Wednesday.
	   Juergen Gerhard Mueller, 47, was found Tuesday with stab wounds
in his chest in a hotel room in Pattaya, about 110 kilometers (68
miles) southeast of Bangkok, police said.
	   Police believe Mueller had been killed about three days earlier
during a robbery by a male prostitute.
	   A hotel security guard was quoted in the Bangkok Post as saying
he had seen a good-looking teen-ager arrive at the hotel to meet
Mueller Friday evening.
	   Police said Mueller has been visiting Pattaya for the past few
years and had bought a condominium in the city. He was known to
engage male prostitutes, an officer said.
	   Pattaya is a popular destination for foreign tourists and has
long had a reputation as a ``sin city'' with a large sex industry.

Car bomb explodes in Dagestan, wounding two 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bomb exploded in the car of a local parliament
deputy and factory boss from Russia's restive republic of Dagestan
on Wednesday, injuring the man and one of his bodyguards, news
reports said.
	   Magomet-Rasul Omarov, lawmaker and deputy director of the
Dagestan Lights glassworks, was hospitalized with light injuries
after the explosion in the center of Dagestan's capital
Makhachkala, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported.
Interfax said Omarov's bodyguard was also hurt.
	   Authorities said they had not determined a motive for the
attack.
	   Contract killings occur regularly throughout Russia, and the
Caucasus region is especially volatile. Violence also often spills
over into Dagestan from its neighbor, the separatist republic of
Chechnya.
	   Omarov was scheduled to take part in a session of Dagestan's
Constitutional Assembly on Friday, when elections of Dagestan's
leader will be held, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In another part of Dagestan, an explosive device went off on a
road side as a Russian military convoy was passing by, ITAR-Tass
said. The blast that occurred Tuesday on the road between the towns
of Buinaksk and Kaspiisk caused no injuries or damage, the report
said.
	   Attacks on Russian servicemen in Dagestan, often using road
mines, have grown frequent in recent years.

Nokia to expand GSM network in southern China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finnish telecommunications group Nokia
has won a dlrs 150 million contract to expand a digital mobile
phone network in southern China.
	   The contract is the fifth expansion of Nokia's Global System of
Mobile communications network with Yunnan PTA, increasing the
network's capacity to 1 million subscribers, Nokia said Wednesday.
	   The initial GSM 900 network was opened in 1996. Deliveries for
the extended network will begin in the summer, and it is scheduled
to be in operation by spring 1999.
	   Nokia views China as one if its most promising mobile phone
markets. Last year, it announced deals worth more than dlrs 750
million to supply mobile phone networks and equipment to Chinese
customers.
	   Last year, Nokia had a record pretax profit of 8.4 billion
markkaa (dlrs 1.55 billion) with net sales of 52.6 billion markkaa
(dlrs 9.8 billion) in 130 countries. It employs more than 38,000
people worldwide.

Thai premier proposes 1999 budget, predicts 2 percent growth 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Thailand-Farmers Protest
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai predicted
Wednesday that Thailand would leave a deep economic recession
behind this year and achieve growth of up to 2 percent in 1999.
	   Chuan issued the forecast, brighter than those offered by
private economists, in proposing to Parliament a government budget
of 825 billion baht (dlrs 19.6 billion) for fiscal 1999.
	   The budget would add deficit spending of 25 billion baht (dlrs
600,000) to the current spending blueprint of 800 billion baht
(dlrs 19 billion).
	   Thailand's economy is in recession a year after the currency was
floated following speculative attacks, a move that triggered Asia's
economic crisis. The International Monetary Fund has organized a
dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of the economy.
	   The economy, which posted annual growth of around 8 percent
during a boom between 1985 and 1995, is expected to shrink by 4 to
5.5 percent this year.
	   Chuan told Parliament that in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1,
inflation should drop to 6 to 7 percent from the projected 10.5
percent this year.
	   Chuan's government has been widely praised for trying to clean
up the collapsing finance sector after taking over from former
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh in November.
	   Chavalit, now opposition leader, said Wednesday that Chuan has
concentrated too much on the financial sector and should bring down
interest rates to help businesses.
	   About 5,000 poor farmers from Chavalit's strongholds in
northeastern Thailand demonstrated outside Parliament, demanding
that Chuan do more to help the poor.

South Korean navy tries to salvage North Korean submarine Korea is...'

<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ With warships circling, South Korean
navy frogmen began attaching air bags to a sunken North Korean
submarine Wednesday, hoping to raise the captured craft and look
inside for signs of life and clues to its mission.
	   The small submarine broke loose from a tow line and sank in 33
meters (110 feet) of water a mile (1.6 kilometers) off shore
Tuesday while being towed to this major east coast naval base by a
South Korean frigate.
	   Fearing the submarine's capture might derail his fragile efforts
to entice the North to open up its society, President Kim Dae-jung
ordered his hawkish Defense Ministry to refrain from any
retaliatory rhetoric, his aides said.
	   ``North Korea is revealing two or three faces in its dealings
with us,'' the president told officers at an air force base east of
Seoul Wednesday.
	   ``But our principles should not be shaken each time,'' Kim said,
reaffirming his policy of prying open the North through more
exchanges and economic cooperation.
	   The president visited the air base and an army command post in
an apparent effort to counter criticism from some domestic news
media that he was being too soft on North Korea.
	   ``We will not tolerate an armed provocation,'' Kim told the
airmen. ``But we have wait and see if the submarine was drifting,
as the North says, or it was spying on us. Then we will act.''
	   Navy Capt. Park In-yong, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said the
navy salvage teams planned to raise the submarine by Wednesday
evening.
	   ``Then we will use cranes to haul it on to the pier and take a
close look,'' he said.
	   Park declined comment on the possible fate of the submarine's
crew. But he had said earlier that the North Koreans, if still
inside, were probably dead.
	   Other Defense Ministry officials speculated that the crew
managed to escape before their vessel was seized Monday while
entangled in a mackerel fishing net just a half mile (one
kilometer) south of the North Korean border.
	   North Korea said Tuesday one of its submarines was missing on a
training mission after experiencing mechanical problems.
	   Authorities described the craft seized Monday as a ``midget
submersible,'' which can carry up to six crewmen and is used
primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct coastal surveillance.
	   When the submarine was first spotted by South Korean fishermen,
three crewmen were struggling desperately to free it from the net.
	   Navy divers got no response when they pounded on the sub's hull
with a hammer. They also used sonar scans but detected no signs of
life inside.
	   The discovery of the sub on the coast 200 kilometers (125 miles)
northeast of Seoul renewed concerns that North Korea was trying to
infiltrate spies despite the South's efforts to help the
famine-stricken North with humanitarian aid.
	   The submarine was found just miles (kilometers) away from where
another, larger North Korean sub ran aground off the east coast two
years ago. The 1996 incursion triggered a 53-day manhunt that left
24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans dead and
relations between the two Koreas at their worst in years.
	   The South cut off aid and jacked up diplomatic pressure until
the North apologized.
	   This time, presidential aides have said the incident will not
derail their new policy of engagement toward the North.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived
in Kosovo early Wednesday for ``traveling negotiations'' with
ethnic Albanian leaders, after warning Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic time for a peaceful end to the violence in the region was
running out.
	   ``We are at a critical moment in the crisis surrounding
Kosovo,'' Holbrooke said Tuesday in Belgrade after four hours of
talks with Milosevic.
	   The visit by Holbrooke, the next U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, is seen as a last attempt to get Milosevic to stop his
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the secessionist Yugoslav
province.
	   In Kosovo Wednesday, Holbrooke was meeting with negotiators
close to ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, while touring
regions west of the capital Pristina that have seen some of the
heaviest fighting.
	   Following the tour Holbrooke said he would talk with Rugova. On
Thursday he was to return to Belgrade, before traveling to Greece.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Holbrooke met in Skopje, capital of neighboring
Macedonia, with Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and
President Kiro Gligorov, as well as Rugova.
	   Holbrooke called his meeting with Rugova ``very productive,''
but declined details. He was to meet with the ethnic Albanian
leader again Wednesday
	   After meeting Milosevic, Holbrooke reaffirmed an earlier promise
to allow foreign diplomats to observe the situation in Kosovo, but
the envoy refused to reveal anything else about the meeting, saying
it was confidential.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between Serb-led army and police forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is gaining in public support in
predominantly Albanian Kosovo.

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Negotiations to end the crippling strikes
against General Motors Corp. have intensified, but a United Auto
Workers leader said it was too early to declare that progress had
been made.
	   After nearly three weeks of daily talks that have yielded only
acrimony from both sides, any sign that the negotiations have
become more serious is reason for optimism. But Richard Shoemaker,
the UAW vice president in charge of GM relations, was wary about
giving any false hope.
	   ``If you're asking me if we had any discussions with them today
that would suggest they're prepared to settle all of the issues,
the answer is no, we haven't had any discussions like that,''
Shoemaker said at the union's constitutional convention late
Tuesday.
	   GM spokeswoman Mary Irby said negotiations would resume
Wednesday, but she declined further comment.
	   Shoemaker said talks at the Flint Metal Center, the stamping
plant in Flint, Michigan, where workers went on strike June 5,
focused on ``production standards'' and the 200 jobs that the union
says GM wants to cut.
	   The dispute at the stamping plant is considered tough to settle.
GM wants major changes made in what it considers overly restrictive
work rules, but the union says that would involve reopening the
local contract that was just negotiated last year.
	   The UAW also has been on strike at the Delphi Flint East parts
plant since June 11. Shoemaker said there has been ``no meaningful
progress'' in talks there.
	   Shoemaker said there would be no negotiation over the so-called
``pegged rates'' at the stamping plant, a key issue to GM. Pegged
rates allow workers to get paid for a full day after less than
eight hours work if they reach a production quota. GM says they
make the plant's engine-cradle operations a money-loser.
	   The UAW says GM should have sought to change the rates during
local contract talks last year, but didn't.
	   UAW President Stephen Yokich, who was expected to be re-elected
to a second term Wednesday, said GM still had not shown that it was
ready to negotiate a comprehensive settlement.
	   ``They went out and did their spin doctor stuff, that they're
ready to meet 24 hours around the clock and all that nonsense,''
Yokich said. ``It hasn't happened, they're not ready.''
	   The strikes by about 9,200 workers have led to the layoffs of
about 142,600 other GM workers at 26 assembly plants and about 100
parts plants across North America. The latest plants affected were
in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where the Chevrolet Corvette is made,
and a truck chassis plant in Detroit.

Tokyo stocks rebound moderately on buying of blue chips, dollar rises 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices rebounded moderately in sluggish
trading Wednesday as the market awaited details of government steps
to revive the economy. The U.S. dollar rose sharply against the
yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 68.58 points, or 0.46
percent, closing at 15,123.18. On Tuesday, the average had fallen
254.49 points, or 1.66 percent.
	   The Nikkei average was up some 150 points at one point, but shed
some of its gains as investors were discouraged by the yen's
weakening in the afternoon.
	   Among gainers were high-technology issues, including Sony and
Pioneer, and some major automakers such as Honda Motor and Mazda
Motor as investors bought blue chips after an overnight
117.33-point climb in the Dow Jones industrial average.
	   But many investors held back, awaiting details of the
government's promised ``total plan'' to revive the economy and
speed up reform of the banking system.
	   Trading was light, with an estimated 373 million shares changing
hands on the first section, down from Tuesday's 421 million.
Declines outnumbered advances 575 to 530, with 154 issues
unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 5.51 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,180.93. It
had slipped 11.89 points, or 1.00 percent, the previous day.
	   Analysts say the key to any reform package would be measures to
help banks write off some 76 trillion yen (dlrs 500 billion) in bad
loans left on their books from the collapse of the real estate
market in the early 1990s.
	   Governing Liberal Democratic Party officials have said the party
will come up with a plan by July 8 for a ``bridge bank'' to handle
bad loans.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 140.36 yen, up 2.61 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate of
139.15 overnight. It ranged between 138.89 yen and 141.20 yen in
Wednesday's trading.
	   The yen came under selling pressure amid lingering concerns over
the health of Japan's economy and the government's ability to
restore trust in the ailing banking system.
	   Fitch IBCA, a British rating agency, said Tuesday that Japan's
credit rating could be downgraded, citing reasons such as its
recession, the slumping stock market, the weakening yen and the
beleaguered banking system.
	   The warning follows last week's downgrade of the Long-Term Bank
of Japan Ltd. by Moody's Investors Services, which sent shares of
the once mighty industrial lender tumbling to half their previous
value in just two trading sessions.
	   LTCB shares recovered slightly Tuesday, rising 9 yen to 71 yen,
after government officials promised support for the bank. On
Wednesday, LTCB shares closed 1 yen lower at 70 yen.
	   ``Nobody expected the dollar to rise above 140 yen'' so quickly,
said Eiji Takane, deputy treasury manager at Asahi Bank.
	   Last week, the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board
jointly intervened to stop the yen's slide after the U.S. currency
hit an eight-year high of 146.57 yen. It then sank below 135 yen
before starting back up.
	   Traders said that unless Japanese leaders take action to fix
their country's financial ills, the dollar will likely keep rising.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.205 percent from Tuesday's 1.260 percent, driving
its price up to 111.98 yen from 111.53 yen.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Traffic police foiled a kidnapping attempt on
the 6-year-old daughter of Mexican pop singer Alejandra Guzman,
according to authorities.
	   Guzman's secretary Victor Bonilla was attacked Tuesday while
taking Frida Sofia to visit friends of the child's grandmother,
actress Silvia Pinal. Bonilla was beaten with a bat and the
attackers grabbed the child, police said in a statement.
	   Officers on patrol nearby chased the attackers, who had fled in
a car with Frida Sofia. The four suspects were captured a few
blocks away, the statement said.
	   Guzman is one of Mexico's most popular singers.

	   NADI, Fiji (AP) _ A gamble paid off as France scored a 36-32 win
over the Fiji Warriors in the opening game of their two-match rugby
union tour on Wednesday.
	   Both teams scored five tries with the accurate goalkicking of
David Aucagne proving the difference at Prince Charles Park.
	   France led 22-15 at halftime but the Fiji Warriors held the
upper hand in the dying minutes of the game, leading 32-29 until an
indiscretion committed by captain Ifereimi Tawake.
	   He was penalized 12 metres from his line for jersey pulling.
	   France ignored the opportunity to kick a penalty goal for a draw
and took a scrum which led to right winger Christophe Diminici
breaking through the defense and scoring the winning try.
	   Both were essentially second-string national teams with leading
players saved for the one-off test in Suva on Saturday.
	   France No. 8 Philippe Benetton scored two tries and was named
named man of the match.
	   Scores:
	   FRANCE 36 (Philippe Benetton 2, Christophe Dominici, Didier
Plana, Jean-Marc Aue tries; David Aucagne 4 conversions, 1 penalty)
def. FIJI WARRIORS 32 (Manasa Bari 2, Leveni Duvuduvukula 2 Waisale
Serevi tries; Serevi 2 conversions, 1 penalty).

	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ Australian heavyweight champion Joe
Bugner and American James (Bonecrusher) Smith squared off outside
the ring Wednesday in the leadup to their World Boxing Federation
title fight in July.
	   A minister with a North Carolina church, Smith, 45, said he
spent seven weeks at a camp _ praying as well as training.
	   ``I'm an older guy . . . but I have the strength and the power
coming from above,'' Smith said of the July 4 fight at the Carrara
Sporting Complex.
	   Smith, with 43 wins, 15 losses and one draw, held the World
Boxing Association title before losing it in 1987 to a rising Mike
Tyson.
	   However he said past records would count for nothing in the
fight against the 48-year-old Bugner.
	   ``It's about what's going to happen between Joe and I,'' Smith
said. ``Does he have enough at 48 to stop me? And do I have enough
at 45 to stop him?
	   ``He's a big, strong guy and an ugly guy and I'll try and get
him out of there as quickly as possible.''
	   Former WBA light heavyweight champion Eddie Mustafa Muhammed,
who is Smith's trainer for the fight, predicted Bugner would resume
his retirement after the fight.
	   ``Two hits _ James hits Joe and Joe hits the canvas,'' Mustafa
Muhammed said.
	   Bugner (67-13-1), said he has been waiting since 1975, when he
was defeated by Muhammad Ali on points, for another crack at a
world title.
	   He said he was focused and had completed 40 rounds of sparring
with undefeated New Zealand heavyweight Kali Meehan.
	   ``I have a very high respect for this man (Smith) but at the
same time my record speaks for itself,'' Bugner said.
	   ``I'm here to do the job and for Australia to have its first
heavyweight title would be a great feat.'' (djp)

Sydney wants no street stalls during Olympics 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Sydney Olympics will not be
turned into a country fair with street stalls and junk cluttering
up the city, the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games
(SOCOG) said Wednesday.
	   Committee marketing general manager John Moore said Australia
had learned from the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and would do some
things differently.
	   ``The issue that was most striking for me as a marketer in
Atlanta was what in fact happened on the streets of Atlanta, with
many of the empty parking lots and empty building lots being filled
with what we would call a country fair or a bazaar or street
stalls,'' Moore told the National Press Club.
	   ``Why would a city and a country spend billions and billions of
dollars to then just at that final moment when the world is
watching you throw up a stall _ a fifty-cent stall _ and present
that as an image?'' (djp)

British minister urges continued business commitment in Asia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Urging British business to stay engaged in Asia
despite the economic crisis, Britain's trade and industry minister
said Wednesday that good investment opportunities have emerged amid
the region's turmoil.
	   ``We still very much believe that, despite the economic crisis,
the region still has a lot to offer,'' Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry Margaret Beckett told a gathering of businessmen.
	   On a two-day visit to this Southeast Asian city-state, Beckett
has been meeting senior Singapore ministers to discuss
international and bilateral trade issues, and speaking to local and
British businessmen about opportunities in Britain and Asia.
	   She said that although volatile exchange rates will make direct
exporting from Britain more difficult, ``new opportunities arise
because of the crisis and investment opportunities have become very
attractive.''
	   Many companies across Asia are in dire need of renewed
investment and foreign capital. Equity values and local currencies
have dropped dramatically throughout the region, providing good
bargains for foreign investors.
	   Beckett urged British companies already present in Asia to ride
out the storm: ``The strong message I give to companies in the U.K.
is to stay with your partners in Asia.''
	   She also said two-way trade between her country and Singapore
has doubled in the last five years.
	   Britain exported goods worth more than 2 billion pounds (dlrs
3.3 billion) to Singapore last year, placing the small island
republic among its top 20 export markets. Singapore's exports to
Britain exceeded 2.5 billion pounds (dlrs 4.2 billion) in 1997.
	   Beckett noted that Britain remains the largest European investor
in Singapore, with total investments exceeding 5 billion pounds
(dlrs 8.3 billion), though reverse investments only amounted to
about 1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.7 billion).
	   ``I welcome all this, but there is plenty of scope for more in
the U.K.'s direction,'' she said.
	   At an earlier event, the British minister said her country
offers a world-class research base for potential Singapore
investors, while its new government is committed to long-term
policies to strengthen productivity and the economy in general.

More than 400 Indonesians deported 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two ferries crammed with 438
deported Indonesians sailed Wednesday from the southern port of
Malacca, the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   The 320 men, 97 women and 21 children were rounded up in the
last few weeks in several operations nationwide to track down
workers without valid documents.
	   The last big deportation had been on May 13, when 900
Indonesians were sent back to their homeland in wooden trawlers.
	   Since the worsening of the Asian economic crisis, Malaysia has
deported more than 30,000 Indonesians found working without valid
papers this year.
	   At the height of Malaysia's economic prosperity and construction
boom, 700 Indonesian workers a day sneak in illegally. Since the
crackdown on migrant workers, the number has dropped to 50,
authorities say.
	   Malaysia is in the process of deporting 200,000 illegal
immigrants from Indonesia by Aug. 15.

NATO soldier, civilian killed in car accident 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A NATO soldier and a Bosnian
civilian employed by the peace force were killed in a car accident
in northwestern Bosnia, officials said Wednesday.
	   The accident occurred Tuesday afternoon near the town of Sanski
Most, 140 kilometers (87.5 miles) northwest of the Bosnian capital,
when an armored peace force vehicle slipped off the road and
overturned, NATO said in a statement.
	   Four other occupants of the vehicle suffered minor injuries and
were taken to a nearby NATO medical facility. No further details
regarding the accident were given.
	   The northwestern Bosnia is controlled by British and Canadian
soldiers, serving in the NATO-led peace force.
	   Since the multinational peace force deployed in Bosnia after the
end of fighting in late 1995, 83 soldiers have been killed, mostly
in car or land mine-related accidents.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military chief Gen.
Wiranto made big changes in his command structure Wednesday,
replacing the heads of the navy, air force and police.
	   Wiranto announced the changes after a meeting with President
B.J. Habibie.
	   Wiranto has repeatedly pledged support for Habibie, who took
office after former President Suharto quit last month, ending 32
years of autocratic rule following a wave of riots and protests.
	   Speaking to reporters, Wiranto said the reshuffle of commanders
was in line with standard procedure that limits the tenure of
service chiefs to two years.
	   ``It is time for them to be replaced. They have served two
years,'' he said.
	   The military plays an important role in Indonesia, not only in
security and defense matters, but also politically.
	   Rumors of splits in its ranks were rife in the days just prior
to and after Suharto resigned. Not long after the former president
quit, Wiranto made several key changes to the command of elite
troop divisions.
	   The process of change was expected to strengthen Wiranto's
position as Habibie presses on with sweeping political and tough
financial reforms needed to overcome the worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   Wiranto named Rear Adm. Widodo A.S. as the new head of the navy,
replacing Adm. Arief Kusharyadi.
	   The new air force chief is Air Marshal Hanafie Asnan, who
replaces Air Marshal Sutria Tubagus. Maj. Gen. Roesmanhadi replaces
Gen. Dibyo Widido as police chief.

Researchers claim breakthrough in EPO testing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian researchers are claiming a
breakthrough in the fight against drugs in sport with the discovery
of a test to detect an artificially-administered substance that
increases the capacity of red blood cells to retain oxygen.
	   Erythropoietin, or EPO, has been linked to endurance sports like
cycling, triathlon, marathon running and cross-country skiing.
	   There is no test to differentiate artificially-administered EPO
from that occurring naturally in the body.
	   Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) scientists will conduct
screening tests on 24 club athletes and design a standard test
which could be in place by the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
	   The screening process being developed by the AIS would show
changes in the blood profile caused by the presence of artificially
administered EPO. Differences when taking on hemoglobin and
interacting with iron could be used as markers.
	   Introduced in the 1980s, EPO has been linked to several deaths
in sport and is considered dangerous because it can thicken the
blood when injected, causing heart attacks.
	   The International Cycling Union has been conducting action
random tests and excluding athletes from competition if their
hematocrit or hemoglobin levels are above 50 percent.
	   But that means athletes with naturally high levels may be
banned, while others can boost their EPO levels and still be under
the limit.
	   Australian Federal Sports Minister Andrew Thomson said Wednesday
the discovery had major implications for drugs in sport, with the
results of a successful trial to be taken to the International
Olympic Committee.
	   Thomson said the IOC does not test blood samples but has
indicated it would be prepared to if a method of detecting EPO was
discovered.
	   ``EPO is another front in the war and it's one we must win
before the Sydney Games,'' Thomson said.
	   ``Where administered by way of cheating it is undetectable, so
you could postulate that it is widespread, we don't really know. It
is a pernicious form of cheating.''
	   The trials, which will take place off the AIS campus, will be
conducted over nine weeks with likely completion by the end of the
year.
	   The Australian Sports Drug Agency welcomed the announcement,
saying the current state of play on EPO was of great concern to
elite athletes.
	   ``We have heard anecdotal evidence about this from cycling and
the sport of triathlon, but not too much from track and field,''
said drug agency chief executive Natalie Howson.
	   ``It (the test) would be a phenomenal breakthrough.''

Military blocks labor union protest in Indonesia

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of soldiers blocked workers
from staging an anti-government protest at the national Parliament
Wednesday.
	   A standoff with the military developed after about 200
demonstrators gathered at the office of the Indonesian Prosperity
Trade Union.
	   The army stopped a fleet of buses that had been chartered to
take them to the legislature, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) away.
	   Soldiers, armed with automatic weapons, tear gas and sticks,
also blocked a main road and prevented another 100 workers from
reaching the union's office. Unable to get to the office, some
protesters threatened to stage a street march.
	   ``We've blocked them because they want to march to the
Parliament,'' said south Jakarta military chief Lt. Col. Ibrahim
Saleh.
	   Protesters chanted and waved banners at the troops, but the
situation remained peaceful.
	   At one stage, a line of workers stood within five meters (16
feet) of a line of soldiers.
	   ``We want to go to the Parliament. But the army won't give us
permission. We are negotiating with them,'' said Agus Edi, a
protest organizer.
	   The protest had been called by the union's leader, Muchtar
Pakpahan, a former political prisoner released by new President
B.J. Habibie last month.
	   Earlier this week, organizers predicted that thousands of
workers would take part.
	   But only a fraction of the predicted number turned out Wednesday
after the army warned that it would ``cripple'' the demonstration.
	   Those who showed up wore blue headbands and carried dozens of
banners. ``People are hungry now,'' read one.
	   The protest broke up after about four hours. There were no
injuries or arrests.
	   Protests have become an almost daily occurrence in Jakarta in
recent weeks.
	   Habibie replaced longtime autocrat Suharto as president in May.
Since then, Habibie has promised sweeping political and economic
changes as the world's fourth most populous nation grapples with
its worst financial crisis in decades.
	   Unemployment and inflation are soaring and poverty rates are
predicted to rise dramatically.
	   Organizers of Wednesday's protest said they wanted Habibie, a
close associate of Suharto, to step down so that the reform process
could be accelerated.
	   Despite the blocking of the workers' protest, police and troops
allowed about 500 students to stage an hour-long demonstration at
Parliament.
	   The student protesters demanded the resignation of lawmakers
they accused of being corrupt.

An overnight summary of Caribbean news GUYANA: Firebombs, explosion mark continued protests 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Demonstrators hurled firebombs at
police and officials reported a small explosion in a government
office as anti-government street protests continued in Georgetown
Tuesday.
	   Two bombs exploded near police during a clash near Stabroek
Public Market, but no one was hurt. Police countered with tear gas
grenades and fired guns into the air to clear demonstrators.
	   Some vendors near the market were treated at hospitals for
inhalation of tear gas and released.
	   Police reported a small explosion late Monday night inside the
headquarters of the Health Ministry, about a block away from
President Janet Jagan's offices. There were no injuries.
	   Guyanese of African descent are demanding new elections, saying
the Dec. 15 vote won by Jagan's People's Progressive Party was
rigged.
 &UR; GRENADA: Cuban president to visit Grenada, 15 years after invasion
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro will
visit Grenada this summer, 15 years after the United States
invaded, fearing Havana would take advantage of a leftist coup on
the island.
	   Prime Minister Keith Mitchell announced the visit at a rally
Monday.
	   ``President Fidel Castro will visit Grenada very soon, sisters
and brothers, most likely at the end of July or early August,''
Mitchell said. He called it ``a very special visit.''
	   Not all Grenadians want to befriend communist Cuba and some
fiercely criticized Mitchell when he visited Havana last year.
	   It will be Castro's first visit to Grenada.
	   The two countries have not been this close since the early
1980s, when the Marxist government of former Prime Minister Maurice
Bishop allied Grenada with the Soviet Union and Castro.
	   Mitchell was labeled a counter-revolutionary because he opposed
the alliance.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Lawmakers approve sale of state phone company
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Undeterred by sometimes-violent
protests and the growing threat of a general strike, Puerto Rico's
legislature approved the dlrs 1.9 billion privatization of the
island's telephone company Tuesday.
	   The House of Representatives vote dealt another blow to a labor
movement that has suffered a wave of privatizations of state-owned
companies and properties under Puerto Rico's pro-statehood
governor, Pedro Rossello.
	   Under the deal, a consortium led by U.S. telecommunications
giant GTE Corp. will acquire a controlling stake in the Puerto Rico
Telephone Company.
	   Hundreds of protesters marched outside the capitol building,
chanting ``No to the sale!'' They continued demonstrating after the
House voted 35-17 to approve five of six bills clearing the sale.
The sixth bill, one granting municipal tax breaks to the company,
passed 30-20 with two representatives abstaining.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Protesters cut phone lines to U.S. Navy base
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Protesters fighting the sale of
Puerto Rico's telephone company cut fiber optic lines serving the
sprawling U.S. Navy base at Roosevelt Roads Tuesday, leaving its
7,600 people without local service.
	   Telephone officials blamed the sabotage on striking workers who
are trying to stop the government from selling control of Puerto
Rico Telephone Co. to private investors for dlrs 1.9 billion. Union
leaders fear mass layoffs.
	   Operations at the Navy base in northeastern Puerto Rico weren't
affected, and calls to the U.S. mainland were getting through, said
base spokesman Roberto Nelson. Staff used cellular phones for local
calls.
	   Since the strike began Thursday, sabotaged telephone lines have
affected more than 75,000 customers, shut down automated bank
machines and slowed electronic cash transfers. Some cellular phone
antennas are out.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Coast Guard readies floating booms in attempt to free
tanker
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Coast Guard officials prepared
Tuesday to deploy absorbent booms around environmentally sensitive
shoreline before pumping oil out of a Russian ship stranded off
southern Puerto Rico.
	   The 600-foot (180-meter) Kapitan E. Egorev ran aground on a sand
bar in about 30 feet (10 meters) of water on Sunday while
approaching a refinery near Guayanilla. None of the 12 million
gallons (45 million liters) of oil has leaked so far, the U.S.
Coast Guard said.
	   There are coral reefs about a half a mile (800 meters) away from
the ship, and mangroves where endangered manatees live are about
one mile (1.6 kilometers) away.
	   A beach where endangered hawksbill turtles lay eggs is about one
mile (1.6 kilometers) downwind, Coast Guard commander Brian Salerno
said. The floating booms will be strung in front of those areas, he
said.
	   Officials plan to pump the oil into a barge to lighten the ship,
a process that could take several days. They planned to install
10-foot-thick (3-meter-thick) boat fenders on Wednesday to keep the
two vessels from bumping.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Boaters disappear, boat found full of cocaine
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A boat that left Puerto Rico Sunday
with two pleasure boaters aboard was found capsized, abandoned and
packed full of cocaine on Tuesday.
	   U.S. Coast Guard officials said the two men aboard, 39-year-old
Joaquin Diaz and 38-year-old Rafael Oquendo, left Naguabo, in
southeastern Puerto Rico, on Sunday morning. Oquendo's wife
reported them missing that evening.
	   Coast Guard planes began searching for the 23-foot motorboat and
found it Tuesday morning capsized off the southern coast of Puerto
Rico. About 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of cocaine worth around dlrs
6 million were found inside.
	   The bales of cocaine were tied together as if they had been
dropped from an airplane, said Coast Guard Commander Norman
Henslee.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A NATO soldier and a Bosnian
civilian employed by the peace force were killed in a car accident
in northwestern Bosnia, officials said Wednesday.
	   The accident occurred Tuesday afternoon near the town of Sanski
Most, 140 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of the Bosnian capital.
An armored peace force vehicle slipped off the road and overturned,
NATO said in a statement.
	   Four other occupants of the vehicle suffered minor injuries and
were taken to a nearby NATO medical facility.
	   Northwestern Bosnia is controlled by British and Canadian
soldiers serving in the NATO-led peace force.
	   Since the multinational force was deployed in Bosnia after the
end of fighting in late 1995, 83 soldiers have been killed, mostly
in car or land mine-related accidents.

Japan's finance minister says stability important in foreign exchange 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Japan-Markets
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Wednesday
stability is crucial in the foreign exchange market, and reiterated
that Japan would take ``appropriate'' action if needed on the
dollar-yen rate.
	   Asked about the dollar's sharp rise to 141 yen in Asian trading
Wednesday, Matsunaga said stability is ``the most important thing''
for the foreign exchange.
	   ``We will watch carefully moves in the foreign exchange market,
and react in an appropriate manner at an appropriate time,'' he
added.
	   Last week, the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board
jointly intervened to stop the yen's slide after the U.S. currency
hit an eight-year high of 146.57 yen. It then sank below 135 yen
before starting back up.
	   On Wednesday in Tokyo, the dollar bought 140.36 yen, up 2.61 yen
from late Tuesday and also above its late New York rate of 139.15
overnight. It ranged between 138.89 yen and 141.20 yen.
	   The dollar was strong because of continuing concern over the
health of Japan's economy, which is stuck in one of its worst
recessions since World War II.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived
Wednesday in Kosovo for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders after
warning Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that time for a
peaceful end to the violence in the region was running out.
	   ``We are at a critical moment in the crisis surrounding
Kosovo,'' Holbrooke said Tuesday in Belgrade after four hours of
talks with Milosevic.
	   The visit by Holbrooke, nominated to be the next U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, is seen as a last attempt to get Milosevic
to stop his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the secessionist
Yugoslav province.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between Serb-led army and police forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is gaining in public support in
predominantly Albanian Kosovo.
	   In Kosovo on Wednesday, Holbrooke was meeting with negotiators
close to ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, while touring
regions west of the capital Pristina that have seen some of the
heaviest fighting.
	   Following the tour, Holbrooke said he would talk with Rugova. On
Thursday he was to return to Belgrade before traveling to Greece.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Holbrooke met in Skopje, capital of neighboring
Macedonia, with Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski and
President Kiro Gligorov, as well as Rugova.
	   Holbrooke called his meeting with Rugova ``very productive,''
but declined details.
	   During his talks with Holbrooke, Milosevic reaffirmed an earlier
promise to allow foreign diplomats to observe the situation in
Kosovo. Holbrooke refused to reveal anything else about the
meeting, saying it was confidential.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses
tumbled 19.7 percent in May, falling for the eighth straight month
due to the sluggish domestic economy and Asia's financial crisis.
	   Output totaled 714,887 vehicles, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers' Association said Wednesday.
	   The 19.7 percent drop in May follows a 14.1 percent decline in
April and 10.6 percent fall in March.
	   Production of passenger cars plunged 18.1 percent to 569,910,
truck output sank 25.4 percent to 140,329 and bus output tumbled
17.8 percent to 4,648.
	   Domestic vehicle demand in May fell 7.5 percent from a year
earlier to 396,173.
	   The association estimated vehicle exports in May fell 3 percent.
It will release complete figures later this month.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sanyo Securities Co., an ailing medium-size
Japanese brokerage, has decided to go out of business after giving
up on finding a corporate rescue partner, a major Japanese economic
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Masamitsu Hattori, a spokesman for Tokyo-based Sanyo, refused to
confirm the report that appeared in the evening edition of the
Nihon Keizai.
	   Sanyo applied for court protection from creditors under the
nation's Corporation Rehabilitation Law last November.
	   The Nihon Keizai and other reports said Sanyo will return all
client assets, the amount of which has dropped to some 400 billion
yen (dlrs 2.85 billion) from more than 2 trillion yen (dlrs 14.28
billion) at the time of its collapse last year.
	   The company will also close relatively profitable branches that
have been kept open in case a viable partner was found and dismiss
all remaining employees, the reports said.
	   About 1,100 of its more than 2,000 workers have already left the
second-tier brokerage.
	   Last November, the company filed for court protection with debts
of 373.6 billion yen (dlrs 2.66 billion), much of which was
attributed to real estate-related soured loans held by non-bank
affiliates.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The European Union will accept more
exports from Asia as long as the region keeps its markets open
during its economic crisis, European Commission vice president Leon
Brittan said Wednesday.
	   Brittan said Europe expected that Asia will inevitably try to
export its way out of its present crisis, although he noted the
increased flow of Asian goods has not yet started.
	   He said weaker Asian currencies, which make the region's
products cheaper abroad, would spur exports in the months ahead.
	   Keeping trade open during the economic downturn could contribute
to recovery in the region, Brittan said.
	   ``If we do that, I think we can see the beginning of the end of
this crisis,'' Brittan said. ``We are only seeing the end of the
beginning, so far.''
	   Brittan is in Australia for annual talks between the Australian
government and the European Commission.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's gross domestic product is forecast to
have grown 6 to 7 percent in the second quarter of the year from
the year-ago period, the state-run Economic Information Daily
reported.
	   The figure is below the government target of 8 percent GDP
growth for the year and less than the first quarter's GDP growth of
7.2 percent.
	   April GDP is estimated to have increased 7 percent from the
year-earlier month, the newspaper said.
	   It said the Asian financial crisis, which has already begun to
hurt China's export growth, is expected to place even further
pressure on the country's GDP growth throughout this year.
	   China's exports rose 8.6 percent in the first five months of the
year, significantly slower than export growth of 21 percent in
1997.
	   However, the government's pledge to channel more investment into
infrastructure and housing projects this year may boost China's GDP
growth to 8 percent in the third quarter and to double digits in
the fourth quarter, thus averaging 8 percent GDP growth for 1998,
the report said.
	   ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A survey of local companies by Bank of
Korea, South Korea's central bank, has shown a continued lack of
confidence in the South Korean economy for the third quarter.
	   The central bank's business survey index, or BSI, stood at 54
for the coming quarter, compared with 52 during the second quarter,
the survey report said Wednesday. The index is a measure of local
business confidence in the economy.
	   A score of 100 or below on the BSI indicates jittery economic
sentiment by the majority of companies surveyed, the bank said.
	   The bank surveyed 2,893 companies whose annual sales surpass 1.5
billion won (dlrs 1.09 million).
	   The central bank said paper, cars, publishing and printing
industries are expected to be particularly sluggish while domestic
consumption-oriented sectors such as beverage companies suffer more
heavily than exporters.
	   Government officials said the economy is expected to shrink
about 1 percent this year as the country undergoes IMF-sanctioned
economic programs calling for high interest rates, reduced spending
and reforms.

Hong Kong shares close higher

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed slightly
higher Wednesday as investors scooped up shares on signs of a
stabilizing Japanese currency.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 77.10 points, or 0.9 percent, closing at 8,296.77. On Tuesday,
it had edged up 15.46 points.
	   Hong Kong stocks were trading lower at midday as investors
closely monitored Japan's efforts to restructure the economy and
its banking sector. Brokers said the index reversed its slide
during the last hour of trading as the yen stabilized at about 140
to the dollar.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.24 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
543 million), down from Wednesday's 6.41 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 821 million).
	   Banking and utility shares were up. The day's biggest gainer was
HSBC Holdings, which rose 2.50 Hong Kong dollars to 180.50. Cheung
Kong Infrastructure rose 0.80 to 14.80, Hang Seng Bank rose 0.40 to
43.20, and Hong Kong and China Gas rose 0.40 to 8.80.
	   Among the losers were Hutchison Whampoa, which dropped 0.30 to
37.50, and Hong Kong Electric, which dropped 0.20 to 23.80.
	   Hong Kong's flag air carrier Cathay Pacific remained unchanged
at 5.45.

Mahathir may create new economic supervisory Cabinet post 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is
expected to create a new Cabinet-level post for economic policy and
name his chief economic adviser to the position.
	   As a minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Daim
Zainuddin, a former finance minister, would have special functions
to oversee the country's battered economy, according to sources
quoted by the Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The sources said an announcement is expected within days.
	   Officials from Mahathir's office couldn't be reached for
immediate comment. Daim was also unavailable for comment.
	   It was unclear how Daim's proposed position would coordinate
with the functions of the Finance Ministry, headed by Anwar
Ibrahim, who is also Mahathir's deputy.
	   There have been increasing signs of policy differences between
Mahathir and Anwar, with the premier pushing strongly for lower
interest rates to revive Malaysia's stumbling economy.
	   Anwar has backed the central bank's tight monetary policy to
curb inflation and protect the ringgit.
	   The two men appeared together in public over the weekend to
allay speculation of a rift.

China remains World Bank's largest borrower 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The World Bank granted dlrs 2.62 billion in
investment loans to China in the fiscal year ended June 30, the
largest share of its lending to any one country, the bank said
Wednesday.
	   Loans to China accounted for about 9 percent of the bank's
overall loans for the year, the World Bank Resident Mission in
China said.
	   China's cumulative loans from the World Bank reached dlrs 30.36
billion _ dlrs 20.58 billion from the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and dlrs 9.78 billion from the
International Development Agency. The World Bank has financed a
total of 200 projects, the bank said.
	   Lending for the construction of infrastructure such as
transportation, energy, industry and urban development accounts for
more than half of the cumulative loans. Agricultural loans made up
28 percent of the total, transportation 24 percent, energy 22
percent and industrial loans 10 percent.
	   Other loans were for health, education, environment and water
supply and sanitation.
	   ``In the midst of the Asian crisis, it is encouraging to note
that China's overall economic performance remains strong and that
the bank's portfolio of projects (in China) continues to be one of
the best in the bank,'' Yukon Huang, director of the World Bank
China program, said in the statement.

Indonesian says country needs time to wipe out corruption 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS day to Wednesday, 1st graf
By LAURINDA KEYS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE _ Wiping out corruption and cronyism in Indonesia's
banking, business and legal systems will take time, the country's
minister in charge of state-owned enterprises said Wednesday.
	   Tanri Abeng, speaking at an international gathering of business
and political leaders, gave no estimate on how long it would take
to nurture ``a culture of treating the law as being above
politics.''
	   But he did not object when an Indonesian businessman on a panel
with him said it would take about two years.
	   ``We must start making legal and judicial reforms that will
enable us to provide all investors, both local and foreign, with
greater transparency and fairness in their transactions,'' Abeng
said in a speech to the Business Week Asian Leadership Forum.
	   The priorities are working out new legal frameworks for contract
law, competition policy, anti-trust legislation and intellectual
property rights, he said.
	   Also in the forefront are closing, recapitalizing or merging
weak banks and implementing new laws to create a sounder banking
system.
	   ``As with our transition to a democracy, which must come
hand-in-hand with the rule of law, these legal and judicial reforms
will take some time before having any discernible impact,'' Abeng
said.
	   ``The people who are responsible for running our legal and
judicial systems must be trained to conduct their affairs with
higher professional and moral standards than before.''
	   Abeng also said that most, but not all, of the nation's poorly
run and uncompetitive state companies will be privatized.
	   He said that Indonesia's 160 state-owned enterprises, with more
than 1,000 subsidiaries, are poorly managed and only 30 percent are
financially healthy.
	   ``Returns on equity are extremely low and most of their product
and service offerings are uncompetitive by world standards,'' he
said.
	   Although the task of reforming the sector is urgent, it is
politically sensitive, not least because 800,000 people are
employed in the state companies, Abeng said.
	   During the 1998-99 fiscal year, the government will sell its
stake in 12 of the enterprises, hoping to generate dlrs 2 billion
in revenue to finance the national budget deficit.
	   A master plan detailing which of the rest will be restructured,
closed or privatized is due in October, he said.
	   Some will be kept under state ownership or management control,
he said, but in those cases there will be changes in regulations,
managements and financing.
	   Abeng also said he was optimistic about reform because President
B.J. Habibie, though criticized for his former role as minister of
research and technology, ``knows that it's rice and other basic
food commodities that count right now, not airplanes.''
	   New electoral laws should be ready for public review by August,
Abeng said, and fair and open elections will probably be held
within one year.

Despite abuses, Cambodian elections get international go-ahead international community to take tougher line, threatening pullout

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh threatened Wednesday to pull his party out of Cambodia's
upcoming elections if the international community fails to tackle
complaints of vote-rigging and violence.
	   The threat came on the eve of official campaigning for the July
26 polls after months of abuses fueling debate over whether the
election will advance democracy _ or be a cynical farce.
	   Ranariddh, toppled as co-premier by strongman Hun Sen in a
violent coup last year, issued a statement urging nations helping
to organize the polls to tackle concerns raised by his FUNCINPEC
party and human rights groups.
	   ``Failure to do so will make it very difficult for FUNCINPEC and
the democratic opposition to remain engaged in the process,''
Ranariddh said.
	   Ranariddh set no date for action. Another opposition chief, Sam
Rainsy, has issued a similar threat with a July 5 deadline.
	   Critics have urged at least delay in the voting. But the
international community holds the ultimate stamp of approval and
has decided to go ahead.
	   Underlying the apparent acquiescence is an unspoken recognition
that a flawed election is the best Cambodia can expect.
	   ``We can't expect an absolutely perfect situation on the 26th of
July,'' said Sven Linder, chief European Union election observer.
``But we can hope for and expect clear signals to be sent that
Cambodia is taking further steps toward democracy.''
	   The European Union, which is allocating dlrs 11.5 million to
help the elections, will pay a key role in deciding if the world at
large can call the polls credible once they're held.
	   The United States is giving dlrs 2.3 million to private groups
involved in the process, but none to Hun Sen's government.
	   That's peanuts compared to the dlrs 2 billion spent by the
international community in 1993, when some 20,000 United Nations
peacekeepers helped create a climate where Cambodians could vote,
most for the first time in their lives.
	   Cambodia was then a higher-profile international problem, still
torn by war with Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who boycotted the vote and
vowed to kill people taking part.
	   The Khmer Rouge, which caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
people between 1975 and 1979, now appears to be on its last legs.
	   FUNCINPEC won the vote. But Hun Sen, who ruled in the 1980s with
the backing of Vietnam, forced his way into a co-premiership by
threatening more war.
	   Tensions erupted in fighting July 5, 1997, and Ranariddh was
toppled.
	   Hun Sen hopes to win back aid and legitimacy, but has stacked
the electoral bodies with his supporters and denied the opposition
access to the media. The killings of some 100 of his opponents
since the coup have gone unpunished.
	   Foreign powers apparently hope that by keeping the electoral
process alive in Cambodia, democracy can be pushed forward.
	   But critics say turning a blind eye to a rigged election betrays
Cambodians who believe their vote can make a difference.
	   ``There is no chance that a deeply flawed and rushed electoral
process will help Cambodia either establish democracy or bring an
end to disruptive military activities,'' the U.S.-based Human
Rights Watch said.
	   While the vote appears to be a foregone conclusion, the wild
card remains the Cambodian people. In 1993, Hun Sen's victory was
also widely predicted.

Kosovo situation worsening, Rugova says; Urges NATO to end violence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian political leader
Ibrahim Rugova told NATO Secretary General Javier Solana Wednesday
the situation in Kosovo was worsening and urged the military
alliance to end to the violence.
	   ``I urged for some kind of protection in Kosovo so that massive
massacres and massive ethnic cleansing is prevented,'' Rugova told
reporters after his meeting with Solana.
	   A NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Rugova appealed to Solana for a NATO presence in Kosovo and the
enforcement of a no-fly zone.
	   He said Serb forces were still shelling villages in the southern
province whose population is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed
this year in fighting between Serb forces and separatist fighters
in the province.
	   Rugova, who represents the more moderate branch of separatism in
Kosovo, reiterated 8the best solution was independence, with
guarantees for the local, minority Serb population.
	   ``Kosovo has the right to become independent as it's part of a
country that has dissolved,'' he said.
	   The NATO official said that at the meeting with Rugova, Solana
insisted forcefully that both parties should return to the
negotiating table, without conditions.
	   The NATO allies support a return to the autonomy Kosovo had
until 1989 but they they do not want to see an independent Kosovo.
They have also repeatedly condemned the violence in the region.
	   Western powers have issued threats, but taken no action so far
against Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who pledged to resume
stalled talks with Rugova but refuses to pull back his forces from
Kosovo.
	   Rugova was to meet later Wednesday with the European Union's
Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans Van den Broek and Belgian Foreign
Minister Erik Derycke.

U.N. report: Limited AIDS awareness putting have-nots in danger 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS pvs
By GEIR MOULSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Declining HIV infection rates in some countries
are being eclipsed by huge rises in others where AIDS awareness and
access to new drug therapies are lacking, according to a new U.N.
report.
	   In parts of Africa, one adult in four is infected with the virus
that causes AIDS while the figure is less than 1 percent in the
United States and across Western Europe, experts said in the report
released Tuesday.
	   The report provided country-by-country statistics to back up a
study released in November, which estimated that 2.3 million people
died of AIDS in 1997, up 50 percent from 1996. About 16,000 people
a day contract HIV.
	   The latest study, by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS,
comes ahead of Sunday's opening of the 12th World AIDS Conference
in Geneva, where 12,000 specialists and others will discuss
advances in HIV research.
	   Limited education about the virus is a major hurdle,
particularly because an effective cure may be at least 10 years
away, UNAIDS Director-General Peter Piot said at a news conference.
	   ``Let's be very aware AIDS is with us to stay for a very long
time,'' Piot said.
	   Access to new therapies for AIDS-related infections such as
tuberculosis and diarrhea is the ``overwhelming issue'' for 90
percent of those living with the AIDS virus, the report said.
	   Zimbabwe and Botswana, where UNAIDS estimates around one in four
adults carry HIV, had the highest infection rates.
	   The United States figure was 0.76 percent _ 820,000 people in
all. It was less than 1 percent across Western Europe.
	   North Africa and the Middle East are ``the great unknown,'' with
cultural difficulties in talking about the epidemic hampering
collection of statistics, UNAIDS said.
	   Political courage to prevent the spread of AIDS is the key to
narrowing the ``AIDS gap,'' Piot said, praising HIV prevention
efforts in Uganda, Thailand and Senegal.
	   The November study said 5.8 million people were infected with
HIV in 1997, up from 5.3 million people the year before. Globally,
30.6 million live with HIV or AIDS, two-thirds of them in
sub-Saharan Africa, it said.

Philippine Airlines: poor market, upset lessors hamper disposal of 40 planes 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Strike-ravaged Philippine Airlines is
having difficulty disposing of 40 of its 54 planes because of a
weak aircraft market and opposition from plane makers and lessors,
an official said Wednesday.
	   PAL is trying to dispose of the planes as part of a drastic
reduction of its operations following a pilots' strike that has
brought Asia's oldest airline to the brink of closure.
	   Jaime Bautista, PAL's chief financial officer, said many other
Asian carriers hurt by the regional currency crisis are also trying
to sell airplanes, flooding the market and causing prices to drop.
	   At least one aircraft manufacturer, Boeing Co. of the United
States, has declared PAL in default for deferring three orders of
747-400 jets scheduled for delivery early this month, Bautista
said.
	   He said PAL will cancel the orders and is negotiating with
Boeing officials on the amount of penalty it must pay.
	   Bautista spoke to reporters about PAL's plight in an open field,
beside a huge airline hangar at Manila's airport, crammed with more
than a dozen grounded PAL planes.
	   ``It's really a disaster,'' he said of PAL's ambitious dlrs 4
billion modernization program, which was derailed by Asia's
financial crisis and the pilots' strike.
	   PAL's 625-member pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest
an airline plan to retire certain pilots who have reached 20 years
of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   PAL now has 83 pilots, including some union members who have
returned to work, but needs a total of 200 to handle its reduced
operations, airline officials said. The airline said it is also
considering hiring Indonesian pilots laid off by financially
troubled Indonesian carriers.
	   PAL said the pilots' strike has worsened financial problems
caused by the regional currency crisis and has cost the airline
more than 2 billion pesos (dlrs 50 million) in lost revenue.
	   Last week, PAL laid off 5,000 of its more than 13,000 workers in
an effort to scale down its operations and stave off more losses,
causing the airline's flight attendants and ground personnel to
threaten to strike as well.
	   Nearly 1,000 pilots, flight attendants and ground personnel
staged a noisy rally Wednesday against the layoffs in front of
PAL's offices, clogging traffic in the Makati financial district in
metropolitan Manila.
	   ``I'm here to fight for job security. This is not about money,''
said Cynthia Tangutian, 30, who was laid off after working as a
flight attendant for eight years.
	   Bautista, however, suggested more PAL personnel may be laid off
under an airline rehabilitation plan that calls for a leaner work
force, disposal of the 40 planes, suspension of more than
two-thirds of its routes and sale of some subsidiaries.
	   ``For us to be able to implement this program, we need to really
downsize the airline to the barest minimum number of employees,''
Bautista said, adding that a 8,000-member work force is still
``big'' if PAL operates just 14 planes.

Legal advisers: Israel cannot escape West Bank troop withdrawal 
</HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is legally bound to carry out a West
Bank troop withdrawal even if such a step is not approved in a
referendum, the Foreign Ministry legal adviser and the author of
the peace agreements with the Palestinians said Wednesday.
	   Despite those warnings, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
appears to favor holding a non-binding referendum, or nationwide
opinion poll. On Wednesday, he convened several Cabinet ministers
for a new round of consultations.
	   The prime minister was expected to make a final decision on
Wednesday or Thursday, said Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan.
	   A referendum would delay an Israeli troop pullback by at least
two more months and has been denounced by the Palestinians and
Israeli opposition leaders as a waste of time.
	   U.S. officials have not yet commented on the referendum idea.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged
Netanyahu to deliver a decision soon on a U.S. plan for an Israeli
troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   On Tuesday evening, Albright spoke by phone to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who had asked her in a letter to step up
pressure on Israel and make the U.S. plan public.
	   Albright told Arafat that she was continuing her efforts to win
Israeli agreement to the U.S. plan, which was first presented in
January and has been accepted by the Palestinians.
	   In a 1995 interim agreement with the Palestinians, Israel agreed
to withdraw troops from the West Bank in three stages ahead of
talks on a permanent peace accord. Netanyahu renewed his commitment
to the pullbacks in a U.S.-brokered agreement in January 1997 that
was overwhelmingly approved by parliament.
	   Yoel Singer, a former Foreign Ministry legal adviser who wrote
the 1995 accord, said Israel would have to carry out the
withdrawals regardless of the outcome of a referendum.
	   ``If the result (of a referendum) is non-approval, Israel cannot
argue that it is released from the obligation to carry out this
redeployment because it did not receive approval for it in a
referendum,'' Singer told Israel Radio.
	   ``It would be a violation of the Oslo agreement.''
	   Singer's successor, Alan Baker, raised the same concerns in a
Foreign Ministry debate, ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron said. The
ministry has not yet adopted a position on a referendum, Shiron
said.
	   Recent opinion polls have suggested that a majority of Israelis
favor the U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback.
	   However, Netanyahu is expected to require a special majority _ a
60 percent hurdle is being proposed _ for approval of a withdrawal,
and it is by no means certain he will get that.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu needed overwhelming approval to silence
far-right coalition partners who have threatened to topple his
government over a troop withdrawal.
	   ``He wants a strong majority to indicate that the whole public
supports the redeployment,'' Bar-Illan said. ``It would be a way to
eliminate the threat to the government from those who oppose it.''
	   Opposition leaders said they would try to block a referendum by
voting against preparatory legislation.
	   Jewish settlers, the most vocal opponents of a troop pullback,
launched a protest campaign Wednesday. On a gravelly field across
from the prime minister's office, a few dozen families from the
Jewish settlement Maale Levona camped in tents beneath banners
declaring ``Netanyahu Don't Cross the Red Line'' and ``You Were
Elected to Protect the State of Israel''
	   ``I'm here to fight for a greater Israel,'' said Uri Fischer,
holding his two young sons in either hand. ``It's not comfortable
here _ in tents and on the stones _ but we are prepared to fight
for the land of Israel even if it means sleeping on stones.''

Dutch singer sentenced to six months in prison for vehicular homicide 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Marco Bakker, one of the country's
most famous singers, was found guilty of vehicular homicide and
sentenced to six months in prison, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   According to the District Court verdict, the operetta singer had
at least twice the legal limit of alcohol in his blood when the car
he was driving hit and killed a 38-year-old female pedestrian.
	   Prosecutor's office spokesman Geroen Steenbrink said the jail
sentence could be exchanged for 240 hours of community service,
adding Bakker was also banned from driving for one year.
	   The singer blamed a car malfunction for the accident last
October and maintained he only had three glasses of vodka at most.
	   In an earlier newspaper interview, Bakker said his car simply
``went out of control'' in the garage of Amsterdam's Arena sports
stadium where the accident occurred.
	   ``The judge didn't believe that,'' said Steenbrink.

Hoping for new aid, Russian premier presents plan to IMF 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A day after presenting a detailed austerity plan,
Premier Sergei Kiriyenko submitted it to the International Monetary
Fund on Wednesday in the hope it would earn Russia enough new
lending to finance an economic recovery.
	   The IMF's first deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer,
described his meeting with Kiriyenko as ``highly constructive,''
but did not elaborate on the chances of a bailout, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The meeting came after Kiriyenko detailed the plan to parliament
on Tuesday. The measures are designed to do largely what the IMF
has demanded and Russia has resisted: cut government spending,
boost tax collections, and tighten control over customs and tax
authorities.
	   Russia has been taking such measures already, but the IMF has
said the cuts did not go deep enough, and tax collections have
failed to raise government revenues enough. The international
lender has insisted the country do more or it will not qualify for
a new loan estimated between dlrs 10 and 15 billion.
	   Kiriyenko has said the new money is needed to replenish the
Central Bank's reserves, to back up Russian bonds and prevent a run
on the national currency, the ruble. The Kremlin fears that
devaluation of the ruble could lead to higher consumer prices and
widespread social unrest.
	   Russia also wants the IMF to release the latest dlrs 670 million
installment of an existing loan, which was held up last week in an
effort to press Russia to meet the IMF's criteria.
	   Russia's new deputy prime minister for international lending,
Anatoly Chubais, said the meeting ``managed to remove the main
problems'' holding up the loan installment, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Russia's economy has been troubled since the beginning of the
year when it began losing ground after posting its first
post-Soviet growth last year. Stocks have lost about half their
value, but the crisis has not yet spurred inflation.
	   Kiriyenko's austerity measures were greeted with mixed reactions
by the Russian media. Many analysts accepted that austerity
measures are needed, but expressed reservations about the
government's ability to carry them out fairly and effectively.
	   ``Many of the proposals in the anti-crisis program, which are
generally correct, will either not have any beneficial effect, or
in the current atmosphere could prove ruinous,'' said the daily
Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
	   Some newspapers pointed out that the economic crisis is taking
place on a financial sphere far removed from the ordinary trials of
ordinary Russians, who are unlikely to be happy about paying more
taxes.
	   ``The technocrats' logic is simple: `There's no money, so find
some,''' wrote the respected Kommersant daily. ``But Russian
citizens are unlikely to understand this logic. (In their view,)
the government's finances are the government's problem. Citizens
have their own problems. And they are not obligated to help out.''
	   Parts of the program _ big cuts in the government workforce, a
revamped tax code _ are certain to run into strong resistance in
the Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of parliament.
	   Kiriyenko has asked parliament to pass the necessary legislation
to implement the plan before it recesses on July 3. But even
pro-government deputies said Wednesday that the legislature was
unlikely to act with such dispatch.
	   ``It will be impossible to pass the legislation before the
holidays,'' said Alexander Shokhin, leader of the pro-government
Our Home is Russia faction. Parliament is scheduled to be in recess
until Sept. 20.

Legal advisers: Israel cannot escape West Bank troop withdrawal 
</HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is legally bound to carry out a West
Bank troop withdrawal even if such a step is not approved in a
referendum, the Foreign Ministry legal adviser and the author of
the peace agreements with the Palestinians said Wednesday.
	   Despite those warnings, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
appears to favor holding a non-binding referendum or a nationwide
opinion poll. On Wednesday, he convened several Cabinet ministers
for a new round of consultations.
	   The prime minister was expected to make a final decision on
Wednesday or Thursday, said Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan.
	   In a 1995 interim agreement with the Palestinians, Israel agreed
to withdraw troops from the West Bank in three stages ahead of
talks on a permanent peace accord. Netanyahu renewed his commitment
to the pullbacks in a U.S.-brokered agreement in January 1997 that
was overwhelmingly approved by parliament.
	   A referendum would delay an Israeli troop pullback by at least
two more months and has been denounced by the Palestinians and
Israeli opposition leaders as a waste of time.
	   U.S. officials have not yet commented on the referendum idea.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged
Netanyahu to deliver a decision soon on a U.S. plan for an Israeli
troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   On Tuesday evening, Albright spoke by phone to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who had asked her in a letter to step up
pressure on Israel and make the U.S. plan public.
	   Albright told Arafat that she was continuing her efforts to win
Israeli agreement to the U.S. plan, which was first presented in
January and has been accepted by the Palestinians.
	   Yoel Singer, a former Foreign Ministry legal adviser who wrote
the 1995 accord, said Israel would have to carry out the
withdrawals regardless of the outcome of a referendum.
	   ``If the result (of a referendum) is non-approval, Israel cannot
argue that it is released from the obligation to carry out this
redeployment because it did not receive approval for it in a
referendum,'' Singer told Israel Radio.
	   ``It would be a violation of the Oslo agreement.''
	   Singer's successor, Alan Baker, raised the same concerns in a
Foreign Ministry debate, ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron said. The
ministry has not yet adopted a position on a referendum, Shiron
said.
	   Recent opinion polls have suggested that a majority of Israelis
favor the U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback.
	   However, Netanyahu is expected to require a special majority _ a
60 percent hurdle is being proposed _ for approval of a withdrawal,
and it is by no means certain he will get that.
	   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu needed overwhelming approval to silence
far-right coalition partners who have threatened to topple his
government over a troop withdrawal.
	   ``He wants a strong majority to indicate that the whole public
supports the redeployment,'' Bar-Illan said. ``It would be a way to
eliminate the threat to the government from those who oppose it.''
	   Opposition leaders said they would try to block a referendum by
voting against preparatory legislation.
	   Jewish settlers, the most vocal opponents of a troop pullback,
launched a protest campaign Wednesday. On a gravelly field across
from the prime minister's office, a few dozen families from the
Jewish settlement Maale Levona camped in tents beneath banners
declaring ``Netanyahu Don't Cross the Red Line'' and ``You Were
Elected to Protect the State of Israel''
	   ``I'm here to fight for a greater Israel,'' said Uri Fischer,
holding his two young sons in either hand. ``It's not comfortable
here _ in tents and on the stones _ but we are prepared to fight
for the land of Israel even if it means sleeping on stones.''

Nervous Taiwan watching summit, promises to 'cry out' if hurt 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A jittery Taiwan will be scrutinizing the
U.S.-Chinese summit for signs Washington is sacrificing Taipei's
interests to better ties with Beijing. If it sees anything
worrying, Taiwan promises to kick up a fuss.
	   Officials express confidence Clinton won't give in to demands
that he formally reiterate pledges not to support Taiwan's
sovereignty _ a move that could make it easier for China to control
the fate of the island.
	   There also are no indications Clinton will agree to declare that
Washington will not sell Taiwan advanced weapons, they say.
	   Meetings of senior U.S. and Chinese leaders always leave Taiwan
feeling nervous, and somewhat ambivalent. This time, the Foreign
Ministry has set up a 24-hour response center to deal with public
fears.
	   Taiwan has no diplomatic relations with Washington, and no input
into the discussions. It resents having its fate brokered by third
parties.
	   On the other hand, officials here say better U.S.-Chinese ties
make Beijing more reasonable. That could speed resumption of
negotiations that Beijing suspended in 1995 over Taiwanese moves to
assert itself internationally.
	   Washington cut diplomatic relations in 1979 with Taiwan, its
Cold War ally, to recognize China. But unofficial ties remain
close, and Washington is bound by law to ensure Taiwan can defend
itself.
	   Ding Mou-shih, a top presidential aide, said this week that
Clinton's visit, which begins this week, aims at increasing
regional stability and bringing China more closely into
international society.
	   ``The United States has said openly on more than one occasion
that the visit will not affect our relations, or harm our
interests,'' Ding said.
	   Taipei will loudly protest any backtracking.
	   ``We will cry out,'' Foreign Minister Jason Hu said this week.
``We will let you know if we are feeling insecure.''
	   Taiwanese officials are reminding Washington of the island's
importance.
	   Taiwan imports nearly twice as much from the United States as
China does, and its economy supports four times as many American
jobs, the Foreign Ministry says. Officials argue that after decades
of authoritarian rule, the island is a model young democracy and
capitalist economy _ a flattering contrast with the mainland.
	   ``Whether you consider democracy, freedom, human rights, or
economic markets, Taiwan is America's true friend,'' Vice Foreign
Minister David Lee said.
	   Taiwan is most concerned about China's effort to extract a
pledge from Clinton not to support Taiwan's independence or entry
into the United Nations. Though the island has been unified with
the mainland for just four of the last 100 years, China considers
Taiwan a breakaway province with no right to international
recognition. Taiwan's Nationalist government fled here in 1949
after losing a civil war to Communist forces on the mainland.
	   U.S. officials have made such pledges at least three times, but
a statement from Clinton would give them more weight. Putting them
into writing would be even more of a concession, and permit Beijing
to dictate what defines Taiwan independence, Taiwan says.
	   Recent comments by American scholars and former administration
officials have favored China, such as advocating a freeze on
weapons sales to Taiwan or urging it to repudiate the idea of
independence in return for Chinese pledges not to attack the
island. Those statements support the belief among some officials
that Taiwan is an obstacle to improved U.S.-China ties.
	   U.S. officials have sought to assuage Taiwan's fears, pointing
out that the last U.S.-Chinese summit in Washington inflicted no
harm to the island's interests.

Kosovo situation worsening, Rugova says; Urges NATO to end violence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The leader of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo appealed Wednesday to NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
to use the military alliance to end to the violence in the Yugoslav
province.
	   ``I urged for some kind of protection in Kosovo so that massive
massacres and massive ethnic cleansing is prevented,'' Ibrahim
Rugova told reporters after his meeting with Solana.
	   A NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Rugova appealed to Solana for a NATO presence in Kosovo and the
enforcement of a no-fly zone.
	   He said Serb forces were still shelling villages in the southern
province whose population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed
this year in fighting between Serb forces and separatist fighters
in the province.
	   Rugova, who represents the more moderate branch of separatism in
Kosovo, reiterated his position that the best solution for Kosovo
was independence, with guarantees for the local, minority Serb
population.
	   ``Kosovo has the right to become independent as it's part of a
country that has dissolved,'' he said.
	   The NATO official said that during the meeting with Rugova,
Solana insisted forcefully that both sides should return to the
negotiating table without conditions.
	   NATO allies support a return to the autonomy Kosovo had until
1989 but do not want to see an independent Kosovo. They have also
repeatedly condemned the violence in the region.
	   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped the province
of its autonomy nine years ago, has pledged to resume stalled talks
with Rugova but refuses to pull back his forces.

Police suspect deadly terrorist group in bank bombing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police kept the deadly terrorist group
November 17 atop the list of suspects in a bank bombing, although a
lesser-known organization claimed responsibility Wednesday.
	   A powerful pipe bomb fitted with a timer and placed in a plant
holder exploded outside an Alpha Credit Bank office Monday, causing
damage but no injuries.
	   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were still seeking to establish links between the bombing and
November 17, Greece's deadliest group. November 17 has killed 22
people since their 1975 assassination of the CIA station chief in
Athens.
	   Most recently, the group took responsibility for a rocket attack
on a Citibank branch in Athens in April. No one was injured.
	   In an anonymous call to Athens daily newspaper Eleftherotypia, a
little-known leftist group calling itself May '98 claimed
responsibility for the attack. But police sources said they doubted
the authenticity of the claim.

Sports minister: Bookies offered match-fixing in women's soccer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Some members of the Vietnamese women's
soccer team have been approached by bookies about fixing matches,
Sports Minister Ha Quang Du says.
	   Du made the comment Tuesday at a conference to review the
national soccer tournament. He said the women reported to the
Vietnam Football Federation and the National Sports Authorities.
	   The players, training at the national sports training center
near Hanoi, are preparing for the national championship in August
and the Asian Games.
	   The men's national competition has been stung by allegations of
match-fixing last year. Local press reports have said at least 74
players and managers were involved. Several players have been
arrested or suspended.

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities fighting World Cup violence
have placed two German fans under formal investigation, a step shy
of charging them with beating a police officer into a coma in
northern France.
	   The men, both 27, have denied the allegations stemming from a
clash after Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia match in Lens, just
southwest of Lille. Three others were given one-year jail terms.
	   Scores of fans and police officers have been injured in violence
in French cities hosting the five-week soccer championship that
began June 10.
	   More than 250 people have been arrested; some have been
sentenced to jail terms or deported. An English fan has been
hospitalized in critical condition.
	   As a result, tighter security, alcohol restrictions and early
bar closings have been planned for some matches, including
Germany-Iran in Montpellier on Thursday and England-Colombia in
Lens on Friday.
	   The Germans placed under formal investigation Tuesday night were
Markus Warnecke, owner of a tattoo shop and body-piercing parlor,
and Karl-Heinz Elschner, a record salesman. Both are from Hanover.
	   Warnecke, who was ordered to remain in jail, has refused to talk
to police, said his lawyer, Bertrand Wambeke.
	   He was described as a high-school graduate from a well-off
family. He sometimes worked as a bouncer in a red-light district
club in Hanover.
	   Police also were questioning a 17-year-old Austrian they believe
may have taken photos of the attack on the policeman and sold them
to the German press, French radio reported Wednesday. It wasn't
clear if the Austrian was being accused of any crime.
	   The policeman, 43-year-old Daniel Nivel, remained hospitalized
in Lille, where doctors on Wednesday said his condition was stable.
	   ``He is still in a serious coma and on a respirator,'' a morning
medical bulletin said. He was to undergo a brain scan later in the
day.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon.
	   In Toulouse, meanwhile, an English fan was in ``very serious
condition'' and on life support Tuesday after being stabbed in the
stomach and lungs, hospital officials said.
	   Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge, West Midlands,
underwent three hours of surgery after being attacked Monday night,
as England played Romania.

Legal advisers: Israel cannot escape West Bank troop withdrawal consultations

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is legally bound to carry out a West
Bank troop withdrawal even if such a step is not approved in a
referendum, the Foreign Ministry legal adviser and the author of
the peace agreements with the Palestinians said Wednesday.
	   Despite those warnings, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
appears to favor holding a non-binding referendum or nationwide
opinion poll. On Wednesday, senior government officials, including
Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi, met for another round of
consultations on the issue.

World Cup: Pressure on Nakayama to save scoreless Japan 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos planned
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Back home, Masashi Nakayama is used
to driving in so many goals, they're called ``Gon goals'' after his
nickname. At the World Cup, the 30-year-old Japanese striker has
delivered none.
	   When Japan plays its final match Friday against fellow novice
Jamaica, Nakayama will have his last chance to spare his team the
embarrassment of leaving the tournament without a single goal.
	   Nakayama, who holds a J-League record of netting four
consecutive hat tricks this season, knows too well how much harder
it is to score at the World Cup.
	   ``I sure would like to give them one blast,'' he said.
	   With the other starting striker, 23-year-old Shoji Jo, not
coming anywhere close in his attempts in the first two games _ both
1-0 losses to Argentina and Croatia _ the pressure is heavy on the
more experienced Nakayama.
	   Nakayama almost scored his 13th goal in his 29th international
match last Saturday against Croatia, when he was able to evade the
opponent to kick toward the net, but the ball struck the sure hand
of keeper Drazen Ladic.
	   ``Maybe I needed to make my kick stronger,'' he recalled. ``But
that's where I aimed.''
	   Nakayama, signed with J-League's Jubilo Iwata alongside Brazil's
Dunga, is quick to add that Japan has played better with each game.
	   ``We did much better than I expected. We weren't crushed,'' he
said. ``It's not that we didn't have a chance.''
	   To make up for the lack of individual talent and physical power,
Japan has been forced to play a more defensive game. And that has
made it a big challenge for Nakayama and others to move up to
score.
	   Nakayama earned his nickname ``Gon'' during his university days
when he was chubbier than his 74 kilograms (163 pounds) and he was
a dead ringer for a character played by Japanese comedian-film
director Beat Takeshi.
	   Nakayama has shed his pounds but not his humorous, witty
personality. During practice, he is the loudest with his claps and
cheers.
	   In contrast to his more reserved teammates, he is not afraid to
display his emotions. Should he score against Jamaica, Nakayama
won't hide his jubilation.
	   When he scored during qualifiers, Nakayama pulled up his shirt
to show another jersey he was wearing underneath _ the No. 11 of
his longtime friend Kazuyoshi Miura, who was forced to sit out that
game.
	   Miura, 31, the only Japanese to have played in Europe, has since
been dropped from the team.
	   But for Nakayama, the rejoicing that he now remembers most
clearly is that of Argentine Gabriel Batistuta in Japan's opener
after he scored the winning goal.
	   ``You'd think he would shrug it off. It's just Japan, a weak
island nation, but he was really happy,'' Nakayama said
thoughtfully. ``It's that big of a tournament.''

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities fighting World Cup violence
have placed two German fans under formal investigation, a step shy
of charging them with beating a police officer into a coma in
northern France.
	   The men, both 27, have denied the allegations stemming from a
clash after Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia match in Lens, just
southwest of Lille. Three others were given one-year jail terms.
	   Scores of fans and police officers have been injured in violence
in French cities hosting the five-week soccer championship that
began June 10.
	   More than 250 people have been arrested; some have been
sentenced to jail terms or deported. An English fan has been

Hanoi bans some traffic

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Hanoi has banned some slow-moving vehicles
in an effort to improve the capital's chaotic traffic, the
newspaper Thanh Nien reported Wednesday.
	   The ban, effective July 1, affects two-wheeled carts and
trolleys, except for motorized wheelchairs; three-wheeled,
foot-powered ``cyclo'' taxis with registration plates from other
provinces; and bicycles mounted with loudspeakers for advertising.
	   Bicycles used to transport goods will be allowed to operate from
8 p.m. to 6 a.m. on streets where they are not already banned.
Container trucks will be allowed to operate during the same hours
on major roads.
	   About 95 percent of Vietnam's traffic is on two wheels.

Germany: Stopping soccer hooligans at border impossible 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Interior Minister Manfred Kanther told
lawmakers Wednesday recommended that local authorities increase
efforts to identify soccer hooligans believed to be planning
violence and to prevent their travel abroad.
	   In comments to federal lawmakers, Kanther said police crackdowns
would be more effective than having German border guards try to
stop hooligans heading for World Cup games in France, a task he
deemed almost impossible.
	   Hooligans travel in small groups to avoid detection and cannot
easily be distinguished from other travelers, especially during the
summer vacation season, he said.
	   ``This is like looking for a needle in a haystack,'' Kanther
told members of the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, during
a regular meeting on internal security.
	   Germany is looking for ways to curb soccer hooliganism after
about 180 German thugs clashed with French police on Sunday during
the World Cup match between Germany and Yugoslavia. One hooligan
beat a police officer with an iron bar, leaving him comatose.
	   The German Sports Federation has proposed setting up a data bank
on soccer hooligans.

Iraq will take action if U.N. sanctions not lifted 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will take action against the United
Nations unless sweeping U.N. sanctions are lifted immediately,
Iraq's top leaders warned in a statement published Wednesday.
	   The threat comes a day after reports that a U.S. Army laboratory
found traces of VX, a deadly nerve agent, on Iraqi warheads. Iraq
acknowledges experiments with VX, but says its scientists never
succeeded in transforming the agent into a weapon.
	   If true, though, the finding could undermine efforts by Russia,
France and China to end the seven-year inspection program and lift
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   The Iraqi statement, signed by President Saddam Hussein and
others, warned Iraq would reconsider its relations with inspectors
if the sanctions were not lifted. The statement said Iraq would
follow through on a threat of ``grave consequences'' it made May 1.
	   ``When other means to lift the sanctions fail due to the
hostility and evil of some parties, there will be no alternative to
the strategy ... to get rid of the unfair embargo,'' it said.
	   Iraq has the right to get ``the sanctions lifted completely and
comprehensively without delay and without conditions,'' it said.
	   Iraq has never spelled out what that strategy entails. But since
May, it has threatened to take action against U.N. weapons
inspectors whom it accuses of being British and American spies.
	   The statement followed a meeting of Iraq's two top
decision-making bodies, the Revolutionary Command Council and the
Baath Party Command, which met Tuesday night.
	   Although not referring to the reports of VX found in warheads,
the statement accused the inspectors of using lies and fabrications
to back hostile stands adopted by the United States.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency dismissed the reported findings
of the lab analysis as ``baseless and mere fabrications.''
	   The agency, quoting an official spokesman, said that the
fragments should have been sent for analysis to another country
``harboring no political hostility vis-a-vis Iraq.''

Mediation efforts continue in Guinea-Bissau, despite battles 
</HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Heavy shelling battered the capital of
Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday, but religious leaders stuck to plans to
meet with soldiers attempting to depose the West African nation's
president.
	   Government troops, supported by forces from neighboring Senegal,
began an artillery bombardment at dawn against a breakaway military
faction's positions around the airport and in a nearby suburban
military garrison, the Portuguese ambassador said.
	   ``Apparently, the shelling was from the government side, then
the rebels responded,'' Ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva
told Portuguese radio RDP-Africa.
	   The bombardment was continuing four hours later as Senegalese
infantry units moved up to the front line, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   Heavily-armed renegades have been dug into the positions since
launching their revolt in the former Portuguese colony June 7.
	   Henriques da Silva said the religious leaders who are seeking to
mediate an end to the conflict aimed to meet with a rebel
delegation at Nhoma, 30 kilometers (19 miles) outside the capital
Bissau.
	   They intended to skirt the city on foot, passing through swamp
areas, and then continue by vehicle to the meeting place, according
to Henriques da Silva.
	   ``It's going to be very difficult from the outset,'' he said.
	   The leaders of the local Roman Catholic, Muslim and Evangelical
communities tried to meet with the rebels in Bissau on Tuesday, but
said they were turned back by Senegalese troops with tanks.
	   Two previous attempts at mediation, by a Gambian government
minister and by local politicians, failed last week.
	   Some 1,300 Senegalese troops are supporting President Joao
Bernardo Vieira against an unknown number of rebel forces led by
former armed forces chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane.
	   The rebels have accused Vieira of corruption and abuse of power
and have called on him to step down so that fresh elections can be
held.
	   Most of Bissau's population of about 300,000 people have fled
the city and are short of food and medicine, humanitarian
organizations reported.

Ex-Israeli agent wanted by Norway in botched 1973 Mossad murder 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A quarter-century after Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency killed the wrong man in a botched
assassination, Norway has issued an arrest warrant for a retired
Israeli agent suspected in the murder.
	   On July 21, 1973, Moroccan waiter Ahmed Bouchikhi was shot and
killed as he returned from the movies with his pregnant Norwegian
wife in the town of Lillehammer.
	   A small team of Israeli hit men apparently mistook Bouchikhi for
Hassan Salameh, a PLO intelligence chief suspected of masterminding
the killing of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
Five men identified as Mossad agents served brief prison terms for
the shooting and were then pardoned.
	   However, Norway has long suspected that the mastermind of the
killing was a top Mossad agent named Mike Harari, who was never
charged.
	   Public prosecutor Lasse Qvigstad on Friday said Norway was
seeking the arrest of Harari, now 71 and retired, through the
international police organization Interpol on charges of being an
accessory to murder.
	   ``We will ask that he be sought internationally as someone who
is suspected in the Lillehammer murder 25 years ago,'' Qvigstad
said. ``There is reason to suspect him and the statute of
limitation was about to run out.''
	   A 25-year statute of limitations on the crime expires in less
than one month. By charging Harari now, prosecutors extended the
time limit by another 25 years under Norwegian law.
	   In November 1997, Norway asked Israeli for permission to take a
formal deposition from Harari in an Israeli court. That request
came weeks after the investigation was reopened because of reports
that top Norwegian officials had been told of Harari's possible
involvement a month after the killing, but failed to act.
	   Since that request did not lead to a court inquiry, Qvigstad
said Norway has now issued an arrest warrant for Harari.
	   About two years ago, the Israeli government agreed to pay
compensation to Bouchikhi's family, but stopped short of accepting
responsibility for the attack.

Russia supports state of emergency in Chechnya 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Russia's interior minister expressed
support Wednesday for Chechnya's decision to declare a state of
emergency, saying he welcomes any anti-crime measures in the
separatist republic, a news report said.
	   However, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin refused to comment
on whether Chechen leaders had the right to make the declaration
without conferring with Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Some officials, including Russia's chief negotiator with
Chechnya, complained that only the Russian president has the right
to introduce a state of emergency in any of the country's regions,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Even so, negotiator Ivan Rybkin said that Chechnya's move should
be ``regarded with understanding,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov announced the state of
emergency to help Chechen police carry out a campaign against oil
and fuel thieves, said Maskhadov's spokesman, Malbek Vachachayev.
	   Chechnya has become a center of violent crime, including rampant
kidnappings and shootings, since the end of its independence war
against Russia two years ago. Its government has not been able to
restore order or rebuild the economy.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent, although the Kremlin
views it as a renegade Russian republic.
	   Maskhadov announced the state of emergency on Tuesday and
imposed a curfew, to be in effect daily from 10 p.m. 6 a.m. The
state of emergency will last until July 18, Maskhadov's spokesman
said.

if the sanctions are not lifted. The statement said Iraq would
follow through on a threat of ``grave consequences'' it made May 1.
	   ``When other means to lift the sanctions fail due to the
hostility and evil of some parties, there will be no alternative to
the strategy ... to get rid of the unfair embargo,'' it said.
	   Iraq has never spelled out what that strategy entails. But since
May, it has threatened to take action against U.N. weapons
inspectors Baghdad accuses of being British and American spies.
	   The statement followed a meeting Tuesday night of Iraq's two top
decision-making bodies, the Revolutionary Command Council and the
Baath Party Command.
	   The statement didn't refer directly to the reports of VX in
warheads. But it accused the inspectors of using lies and
fabrications to back hostile stands adopted by the United States.
	   Iraq has the right to get ``the sanctions lifted completely and
comprehensively without delay and without conditions,'' it said.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency dismissed the reported findings
of the lab analysis as ``baseless and mere fabrications.''
	   The agency, quoting an official spokesman, said that the
fragments should have been sent for analysis to another country
``harboring no political hostility vis-a-vis Iraq.''

Italian controllers strike blocks air traffic 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A strike by air traffic controllers at Italian
airports forced airlines to cancel dozens of domestic and foreign
flights Wednesday.
	   The strike was called from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., but Italy's flag
airline Alitalia said air traffic was expected to be disrupted
throughout the afternoon.
	   The controllers walked off their jobs to protest the government
failure's to appoint new officials of the air traffic control
agency as promised in their contract.

Committee announces package of memorials to Princess Diana 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A ``Diana medal'' for school children, a new
five-pound coin and a memorial garden are among the ways Britain
will commemorate Princess Diana, the government's advisory
committee announced Wednesday.
	   Ten months after the princess was killed in a car crash in
Paris, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown unveiled the
government's Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Committee's
``preliminary'' advice on five memorials to mark the princess' work
and life.
	   Choosing from more than 10,000 suggestions, the committee also
endorsed a proposal for developing community nursing teams to help
children with life-threatening or severely disabling illnesses.
	   ``The proposals which we have announced today were amongst the
most popular and appropriate we received, and we expect
	   them to be widely acknowledged as a fitting tribute to her
	   life and work,'' said Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown,
who chaired the advisory committee.
	   ``They recognize her concern for children and their families in
times of sickness, when practical support and advice can often be
as important as medical treatment. They also encourage children and
young people, whatever their own circumstances, to take an active
and exemplary part in the life of their local communities,
particularly in helping the more vulnerable,'' Brown said.
	   The five-pound coin (worth dlrs 8.30 at current rates) is
intended to be in wide circulation next year in time for Diana's
birthday of July 1, he said.
	   Members of the committee include Diana's sister Sarah
McCorquodale, her butler Paul Burrell and her lawyer Anthony
Julius.

Nuclear expert warns of Ukrainian nuclear dangers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A nuclear expert warned Wednesday that the
safety of Ukraine's atomic power plants has deteriorated to a
dangerous level.
	   Georgy Kopchynsky, head of a consultative council on nuclear
safety at Ukraine's Ecology Ministry, charged the government with
``very bad'' implementation of a program to increase the safety of
nuclear power plants.
	   The safety of Ukraine's nuclear industry is nearing a
``dangerous point,'' Kopchynsky said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   He said planned repairs have been canceled at some reactors due
to the lack of funds, while repairs that do take place sometimes
become limited in scope and quality.
	   ``Such actions are considered inadmissible in international
practice,'' said Kopchynsky, who also serves as an International
Atomic Energy Agency's expert.
	   Many nuclear experts are worried about nuclear power plants in
Ukraine, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident _ the 1986
explosion and fire at a reactor in Chernobyl. Ukraine says it
cannot close some aging reactors because it has no funds for
alternative energy sources.

World Cup: Italy's winning formula based on rotation of players 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Call it imaginative tactics, timely
substitutions, rotation of players. Whatever the name, it's a
successful formula in the World Cup for Italy so far.
	   By alternating team stars Alessandro Del Piero and Roberto
Baggio, strikers Christian Vieri and Filippo Inzaghi and some key
midfielders, coach Cesare Maldini has taken the Italian team into
the second round with a record of two wins and one draw and Italy's
highest scoring rate since 1978 in Argentina.
	   ``It's important that substitute players are prepared to enter
the field at any moment of the match,'' said Maldini.
	   Vieri, the Spanish league leading scorer with Atletico Madrid,
tallied four goals in three games to share the individual scoring
lead with Gabriel Batistuta of Argentina.
	   Veteran star forward Roberto Baggio added two goals and
midfielder Luigi Di Biagio one for a total of seven scored and two
allowed in the initial four-team round.
	   In the World Cup in Argentina, the team including such strikers
as Paolo Rossi and Roberto Bettega had tallied six goals in three
first-round matches.
	   Del Piero, just recovered from a thigh strain which hampered his
preparation, hasn't scored yet but made decisive moves against
Cameroon and Austria after missing the opening match against Chile.
	   Targeted by rival defenders aware that he's the player
masterminding Italy's offense, Del Piero is often fouled and sent
sprawling into the field.
	   But he still fed Vieri for Italy's opening goal in Tuesday's
decisive 2-1 victory against Austria at St. Denis and was a steady
threat for the rival defense.
	   ``I helped to keep Austrian defenders under pressure and make
them weary. Then Roberto (Baggio) entered the field and knocked
them out,'' Del Piero said.
	   ``I was lucky to leave the field on my feet. Austrian defenders
treated me like a ball. They kicked me throughout,'' said Del
Piero, the Champions Cup all-time leading scorer with 10 goals this
year.
	   Baggio scored a late goal at St. Denis to give Italy a 2-0 lead
and survive the usual Austrian goal in injury time. He had also
tallied the late equalizer against Chile, on a penalty.
	   The questionable form of Del Piero somehow forced Maldini to
rotate him with Baggio, who had been taken to France as the
substitute of the younger star. The coach suggested the rotation,
which has been a key to Italy's success in the initial round, was
likely to continue.
	   ``Don't call it a perfect formula. In soccer that doesn't exist.
But tactical changes during the match are an added weapon for a
coach and it's useful to take advantage of them,'' Maldini said
after Italy's qualification.
	   On Saturday the ``Azzurri'' will play Norway which earned a
second-round berth by stunning defending champion Brazil in a Group
A match.
	   Inzaghi, Del Piero's teammate with league champion Juventus,
replaced Vieri in the second half both against Chile and Austria.
	   An agile forward _ the opposite of the strongly-built powerful
Vieri _ Inzaghi fed Baggio for Italy's second goal against Austria
and went close to scoring himself twice.
	   At midfield Di Biagio has taken over the place of Chelsea's
Roberto Di Matteo while Juventus defender Gianluca Pessotto
unexpectedly replaced Demetrio Albertini in Tuesday's match.
	   Quite surprisingly, those substituted have never complained
about Maldini's decisions.
	   ``I was really tired in the second half and the coach did the
right thing by sending Pippo (Inzaghi) in,'' Vieri said.
	   ``The starting 11 must be decided on the basis of tactical needs
of the team, against different opponents. You can't use the same 11
for the entire competition. When a player looks tired, or is in
trouble, better to substitute him,'' Maldini explained.
	   A forced substitution was that of defender Alessandro Nesta with
veteran Giuseppe Bergomi, when the young player of Lazio of Rome
tore his right knee ligaments in a collision with an Austrian
defender after only four minutes of play.
	   Nesta is out for the rest of the competition and was returning
home Wednesday.
	   Bergomi, the Inter Milan sweeper who debuted with the Italian
World Cup team in Spain in 1982, is the oldest player on the
roster, at 34.

Lion cub stolen from Ukrainian zoo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Panic gripped zoo workers in the Ukrainian
town of Novaya Kakhovka when they discovered that a lion was
missing from its cage.
	   Actually, it was a very small lion -- a four-day-old cub brought
to the southern town by a traveling Russian zoo from the city of
Tula, the daily Kievskiye Vedomosti reported Wednesday.
	   The town's criminal police began to investigate the lion's
disappearance and soon concluded that the cub slipped through the
bars of the cage, where it had been kept with its mother, and fell
outside.
	   Police also closed in on the suspects, two 18-year-old Novaya
Kakhovka residents who found the baby lion Sunday and decided to
demand dlrs 500 in ransom from zoo workers.
	   Realizing that police were about to arrest them, they returned
their find to the zoo, Kievskiye Vedomosti reported.

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities fighting World Cup violence
have placed two German fans under formal investigation, a step shy
of charging them with beating a police officer into a coma in
northern France.
	   The men have denied the allegations stemming from a clash after
Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia match in Lens, just southwest of Lille.

hospitalized in critical condition.
	   As a result, tighter security, alcohol restrictions and early
bar closings have been planned for some matches, including

Ukrainian town authorities complain of stray dogs 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The number of stray dogs in Ukraine's
Crimean port of Sevastopol has reached threatening dimensions, and
some 594 residents have been bitten in the first five months of
1998, authorities said Tuesday.
	   Eight of the victims, who included 190 children, had to be
hospitalized as a result of the dog bites, the city's sanitary
service said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Officials said about 7,000 Sevastopol residents have been bitten
by stray dogs over the past four years.
	   Only one group, comprising two city workers, is working to
capture stray animals, while several years ago there were four such
brigades, the report noted.
	   The number of stray dogs also has mounted in the capital Kiev,
where they often aggravate residents by barking all night long.
Animal shelter workers say they have no place for more animals. At
least one shelter has reportedly been closed recently.

WTO: Nigeria needs reform to regain international confidence 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1300 GMT June 24
By PHILIP WALLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Its footballers may be impressing soccer fans by
reaching the final stages of the World Cup, but Nigeria needs major
reforms to regain international political and business confidence,
according to a report out Wednesday.
	   The continuing political uncertainty and weakening of the rule
of law in the sprawling West African nation is discouraging foreign
investment and trade, according to the 132-page World Trade
Organization review.
	   The country's oil business, which represents more than 95
percent of Nigeria's export trade and three quarters of government
revenue, is dynamic compared to other parts of the economy.
	   But even this has been hindered by ``inappropriate policies''
contributing to the rundown of oil refineries and causing serious
shortages of petroleum products in the home market, the report
says.
	   Nigeria's new government, led by General Abdulsalam Abubakar,
should reduce import restrictions and implement its proposed
program to privatize state industries, thereby reducing the
economy's dependence on oil, it says.
	   ``Recent steps to increase transparency and accountability in
government, and thus combat allegations of fraud and corruption,
must be pursued,'' it adds.
	   The study says the stability and predictability of Nigeria's
institutions and its opaque constitution remain major concerns and
``increase the risk of doing business'' with the country.
	   Since he took power on June 8, Abubakar has sent mixed messages
to activists and opponents of his late predecessor Sani Abacha.
	   Nigeria's critics have praised Abubakar for releasing a string
of political prisoners who had opposed Abacha's harsh rule.
	   But he has angered Nigeria's political opposition by moving
quickly to quash pro-democracy protests and making only vague
pledges to follow through on Abacha's flawed political transition
program, due to culminate in an Oct. 1 transition to civilian rule.
	   Little in Nigeria functions these days, from the water supply to
the telephones, and crime is rampant.
	   Attempts to use the country's large oil revenue to expand the
economic base ``have been mostly unsuccessful'' and the economy
remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices, the study
adds.
	   It says Migeria, a founding member of the WTO, should try to
reduce its high external debt and prevent arrears accumulating.
	   This would increase its ability to attract much needed foreign
investment outside the oil business.
	   The report acknowledges the military government's efforts to
liberalize Nigeria's foreign exchange and investment regimes and
establish a stable and predictable structure of import tariffs.
	   But it says concerns remain among WTO members about tariff
changes and quantitative import restrictions, saying these should
be eliminated.
	   ``A wide array of export incentive schemes has failed to offset
the anti-export bias resulting from the import regime, cumbersome
export procedures and failing infrastructure,'' says the review.

Philippine peso weakens further; stocks end mixed 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with peso closing lower
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso was dragged down
again Wednesday by the weakening Japanese yen, while stocks ended
mixed on a combination of selective buying and profit-taking,
traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.443 pesos for the day compared to 41.329
pesos Tuesday. It was last traded at 41.450 pesos.
	   Traders said the market remained cautious because of the lack of
a clear solution to Japan's weakening economy.
	   They said the peso's depreciation was tempered by dollar selling
by two foreign banks and some investment inflows. Without the ample
dollar supply, the peso would have fallen further, they said.
	   The peso is likely to continue to take its cue from the yen,
they said.
	   Wednesday saw the dollar climbing to 140 yen in Tokyo from late
Tuesday's 137.85 yen. Traders said there is growing impatience over
Japan's financial reform policies, which have yet to be made clear.
	   News that credit rating agency Fitch IBCA was concerned about
Japan's sovereign credit rating also contributed to the yen's weak
showing Wednesday.
	   Other regional concerns also weighed on the peso, particularly
worries over losses in Malaysia's banking and corporate sectors and
the effects of anti-government demonstrations by Thai farmers in
Bangkok.
	   In stock trading, the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index
rose 17.02 points, or 1 percent, to 1,712.88, following Tuesday's
0.4 percent rise.
	   Declines, however, edged out gains 49 to 48, while 49 issues
were unchanged.
	   Tuesday's rise followed a two-day losing streak for the main
index that wiped out 138.90 points, or 7.6 percent, of its value,
and sent prices of blue-chip stocks to bargain levels.
	   Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales of Abacus Securities
Corp., said big foreign fund managers were evident Wednesday and
all bought blue chips.
	   Fanning interest in blue-chip issues was the Dow Jones
Industrial Average's surge overnight, traders said.
	   Traders, however, doubt interest in Manila shares can be
sustained.
	   ``The whole picture (in Asia) hasn't really changed. Japan is

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A day after presenting a detailed austerity plan,
Premier Sergei Kiriyenko submitted it to the International Monetary
Fund on Wednesday in the hope it would earn Russia enough new
lending to finance an economic recovery.
	   The IMF's first deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer, told
The Associated Press that fund analysts will need several weeks to
study the plan.
	   ``We have read the headlines, we've read the speeches, we got
descriptions of the measures,'' he said as he prepared to depart
the country. ``Precisely what they will amount to in terms of the
budget we will have to discuss.''
	   However, he said that in the mean time he will recommend that
the fund release the latest, dlrs 670 million installment of an
existing loan that was held up last week in an effort to press
Russia to meet the IMF's criteria.
	   Kiriyenko detailed the austerity plan to parliament on Tuesday.
The measures are designed to do largely what the IMF has demanded
and Russia has resisted: cut government spending, boost tax
collections, and tighten control over customs and tax authorities.
	   Russia has been taking such measures already, but the IMF has
said the cuts did not go deep enough, and tax collections have
failed to raise government revenues enough. The international
lender has insisted the country do more or it will not qualify for
a new loan estimated between dlrs 10 and 15 billion.
	   Fischer told The AP that in his view, Russia's chronic
tax-collection problem is the biggest obstacle to a new loan. The
country has no tax-paying tradition, and officials have said that
fewer than 5 million of the country's 147 residents filed income
tax forms last year.
	   Kiriyenko has said the IMF loan is needed to replenish the
Central Bank's reserves, to back up Russian bonds and prevent a run
on the national currency, the ruble. The Kremlin fears that
devaluation of the ruble could lead to higher consumer prices and
widespread social unrest.
	   Russia's new deputy prime minister for international lending,
Anatoly Chubais, said the meeting ``managed to remove the main
problems'' holding up the loan installment, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Fischer was less sanguine, saying only that ``we went through
all the things that need to be done.''
	   Russia's economy has been troubled since the beginning of the
year when it began losing ground after posting its first
post-Soviet growth last year. Stocks have collapsed to about half
their value, but the crisis has not yet spurred inflation.
	   Kiriyenko's austerity measures were greeted with mixed reactions
by the Russian media. Many analysts accepted that austerity
measures are needed, but expressed reservations about the
government's ability to carry them out fairly and effectively.
	   Some newspapers pointed out that the economic crisis is taking
place on a financial sphere far removed from the ordinary trials of
ordinary Russians, who are unlikely to be happy about paying more
taxes.

</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with FIFA saying no protest received
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The power of a referee's whistle could hardly be
more profound.
	   Two controversial fouls _ two cases of apparent incidental
contact _ in two games Tuesday at the World Cup led to street
celebrations on the other side of the world, sent teams to
unprecedented levels of success and left losing coaches angry,
bitter or perplexed.
	   Norway _ not Morocco _ is in the second round because of a
penalty in the 89th minute that gave the Norwegians a stunning 2-1
victory over defending champion Brazil. It's the first time Norway
has ever made it past the first round.
	   ``We made history in Norway today,'' Norwegian striker Tore
Andre Flo said.
	   The game didn't matter to Brazil, which had already clinch first
place in Group A, but even coach Mario Zagallo couldn't help but
raise the proverbial eyebrow to American referee Esse Baharmast's
decision that Junior Baiano's bump with Flo as the two battled for
position on a high ball was worthy of the most decisive of fouls.
	   ``I don't really know what happened there,'' said Zagallo,
shrugging his shoulders. ``The referee is FIFA's problem, not
Brazil's problem.''
	   It was a problem for the Moroccans, who thought they had
qualified with a 3-0 victory over Scotland _ until they learned
that Norway had staged its amazing comeback.
	   Morocco's players wept on the field. Coach Henri Michel kicked
the bench, then hugged each of his stars. And he hadn't even heard
about the dubious penalty that did his team in.
	   ``All of us, we and the players are extremely disappointed,''
Michel said. ``I want to pay tribute to an excellent and an
outstanding team, and I want to thank them from the bottom of my
heart.''
	   For truly bitter words, turn to Cameroon's Claude Le Roy, whose
tirade went straight to the top over a call that cost his team a
probable winning goal and a second-round berth in a 1-1 draw with
Chile.
	   ``I can accept a lot of things, but I can't accept that one,''
Le Roy said. ``I'm sorry we were eliminated, especially on a
decision that was an incompetent one.''
	   The foul came in the 58th minute, when Hungarian referee Laszlo
Vagner claimed Patrick Mboma pushed Ronaldo Fuentes just before
Francois Omam Biyick put the ball in the net.
	   ``We can't really accept this unfair decision,'' midfielder
Salomon Olembe said. ``The referee will not be welcome in Cameroon
if he wanted to spend a holiday there.''
	   Le Roy launched into repeated verbal attacks on FIFA president
Sepp Blatter, who last week told referees to call more fouls.
	   ``If this is what football is all about, I hope Mr. Blatter was
watching,'' Le Roy said. ``There wasn't a shove or a foul.
	   ``Perhaps the Figaro newspaper in France will complain I'm a
sore loser. I hope FIFA will discuss the issue of what happened
today. Perhaps he should listen to (World Cup organizing head
Michel) Platini more often. Mr. Platini is the one who knows about
football. Perhaps he should stick to administrative tasks.''
	   FIFA said Wednesday it had not received any official complaints
about the refereeing and planned no emergency action, although each
match will be routinely reviewed with the officials involved.
	   Keith Cooper, the federation's chief spokesman, said FIFA
remained pleased with the overall level of refereeing in the
tournament, which has been marked by controversial calls on fouls
and expulsions.
	   ``The standard remains very, very high,'' he said. ``If there
were two errors in all those games, and I'm not saying they were
errors, that is a very, very low error rate.''

Mahathir creates new economic supervisory Cabinet post 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS more background
By RANJAN ROY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a surprise move, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad appointed his chief economic adviser Wednesday to
a new Cabinet-level post for economic policy, an official statement
said.
	   As a minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Daim
Zainuddin, a former finance minister, will have special functions
to oversee the country's battered economy.
	   Daim will be called minister of special functions in the Prime
Minister's Department, the national news agency Bernama reported.
He is to be sworn in later this week.
	   It was unclear how Daim's position would coordinate with the
functions of the Finance Ministry, headed by Anwar Ibrahim, who is
also Mahathir's deputy.
	   There have been increasing signs of policy differences between
Mahathir and Anwar, 51, with the premier pushing strongly for lower
interest rates to revive Malaysia's stumbling economy.
	   Anwar has backed the central bank's tight monetary policy to
curb inflation and protect the ringgit.
	   The two men appeared together in public over the weekend to
allay speculation of a rift. Both denied any serious disagreements,
but governing party officials said differences existed.
	   Daim has consistently backed Mahathir on the issue of lowering
interest rates. They have argued that Malaysian businesses needed
easier loans to aid their survival through the Asian financial
crisis.
	   Last week, Mahathir had said a new formula was being considered
to calculate new interest rates.
	   Daim told reporters later: ``We've been doing well all this
while because interest rates are reasonable. If interest rates are
too high, which private sector can succeed?
	   ``If the private sector does well it is good for the country.
Now the private sector is not doing well.''
	   But Daim declined to disclose details of the plan, which was
clearly designed to lower interest rates, currently ranging from 12
to 20 percent.
	   Malaysia's economy shrank 1.8 percent in the first three months
of 1998, compared with 6.9 percent growth in the previous quarter.
Many private economists predict it could contract 3 percent this
year, with non-performing loan levels reaching more than 30
percent.
	   Daim was finance minister from 1984 to 1991 and helped Malaysia
overcome a recession in the mid-1980s.
	   Last year, Mahathir named Daim, widely regarded as the architect
of modern corporate Malaysia, as the executive director of the
National Economic Action Council, a group created to devise
strategies to fight the economic turmoil.
	   Analysts said the move might help give more teeth to the NEAC by
making its chief executive more powerful. Mahathir is the chairman
of NEAC.
	   But most people will be keenly watching the relationship between
the new powerful minister and the finance minister, said an
analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Another appointment announced Wednesday was that of Kasitah
Gaddam as the land and cooperative development minister.

Japanese delegation visits disputed Kuril islands 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Japanese delegation arrived on the Kuril Islands
Wednesday to sign deals connected with informal meetings between
President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
	   Japan has agreed to build a pier on Kunashir Island worth 450
million yen (dlrs 3.2 million). The country may also provide diesel
generators to some of the impoverished islands.
	   The delegation's journey was part of conciliation efforts
between the two countries to ease tensions over the islands.
	   Japan and Russia have never signed a peace treaty formally
ending World War II because of the dispute over four islands in the
Kuril chain which were seized by Soviet forces at the end of the
war.

World Cup: Scoring dearth, referee's call send Cameroon home 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Pierre Njanka's bold run past two
Austrian defenders and rocket shot remains the goal of the World
Cup so far.
	   But Cameroon's inability to score more often, along with a
questionable referee's decision, have sent the Indomitable Lions
home early for a second straight World Cup.
	   Tuesday night's 1-1 draw with Chile left Cameroon with a record
of two draws and a loss in its three Group B matches, only good for
third place and a ticket back to Africa.
	   Coach Claude Leroy and his players insisted they were robbed by
Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner's refusal to allow a second-half
goal by Francois Omam Biyick that gave Cameroon the lead. A victory
would have propelled the Indomitable Lions into the second round.
	   Vagner ruled Patrick Mboma fouled a Chilean defender in getting
the ball to Omam Biyick on the play.
	   ``I have no idea why the referee refused it,'' Mboma said.
``It's difficult not to be disappointed when you leave a World Cup
in such a way.''
	   Leroy also slammed the call but said it was time for the team,
and himself, to move on.
	   ``It has been a two-month long adventure,'' said Leroy, who
began his second stint as Cameroon's coach in April. ``We must let
bygones be bygones. It's the end of the road for me here. Now, I
will work with Pierre Mankowski on the management of the Strasbourg
Racing Club.''
	   Cameroon shocked the soccer world and forever raised the profile
of African soccer by reaching the quarterfinals of the 1990 World
Cup in Italy. But since then, the team has been rocked by political
battles over the coaching and players.
	   The Indomitable Lions qualified for the 1994 World Cup but
failed to win a match. They also have failed to reach the final
stages of the last two African Nations Cup tournaments.
	   Its players showed impressive skills in France, with Njanka's
stirring goal against Austria considered the highlight play of the
first round.
	   But that was only one of two goals the Cameroonians scored, as
players struggled to finish effectively and maintain discipline. A
lack of self control brought three red cards in the last two
matches.
	   Despite those problems, Cameroon was one goal _ perhaps the
disallowed one _ away from reaching the second round.
	   ``It will take us some time before we accept such a slip, but
we're a strong team and we'll get over it,'' said goalkeeper
Jacques Songo'o. ``Cameroon leaves the World Cup with their heads
held high.''

Precede LISBON Guinea-Bissau's parliamentary speaker meets with rebel leaders other details. CHANGES byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW throughout with government meeting renegade soldiers,
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NHOMA, Guinnea-Bissau (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's parliamentary
speaker is meeting Wednesday with leaders of the breakaway military
faction to discuss a cease-fire and the possible return of
government to this battered West African country.
	   The speaker, Malam Bacai Sanha, was meeting in Nhoma with
representatives of former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane,
who staged a failed coup June 7.
	   The talks were underway Wednesday morning in this town, about 30
kilometers (19 miles) north of the capital, Bissau, which was
battered by heavy shelling Wednesday.
	   Religious leaders were also reportedly planning to meet with
renegade soldiers in Nhoma.
	   Government troops, supported by forces from neighboring Senegal,
began an artillery bombardment at dawn against the breakaway
faction's positions around Bissau's airport and in a nearby
suburban military garrison, according to Portugal's ambassador to
Guinea-Bissau.
	   ``Apparently, the shelling was from the government side, then
the rebels responded,'' Ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva
told Portuguese radio RDP-Africa.
	   The bombardment was continuing four hours later as Senegalese
infantry units moved up to the front line, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   Heavily-armed renegades have been dug into the positions since
launching their revolt in the former Portuguese colony June 7.
	   Henriques da Silva said the religious leaders who are seeking to
mediate an end to the conflict also aimed to meet with a rebel
delegation at Nhoma.
	   They intended to skirt the city on foot, passing through swamp
areas, and then continue by vehicle to the meeting place, according
to Henriques da Silva.
	   The leaders of the local Roman Catholic, Muslim and Evangelical
communities tried to meet with the rebels in Bissau on Tuesday, but
said they were turned back by Senegalese troops with tanks.
	   Two previous attempts at mediation, by a Gambian government
minister and by local politicians, failed last week.
	   Some 1,300 Senegalese troops are supporting President Joao
Bernardo Vieira against an unknown number of rebel forces led by
former armed forces chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane.
	   The rebels have accused Vieira of corruption and abuse of power
and have called on him to step down so that fresh elections can be
held.
	   Most of Bissau's population of about 300,000 people have fled
the city and are short of food and medicine, humanitarian
organizations reported.
	   The United Nations refugee agency has warned that without
immediate assistance, Guinea-Bissau will face a massive
humanitarian crisis within days.

World Cup: Rueful Brazilians seek lessons from defeat 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ As Brazilians groped to explain their
stunning 2-1 loss to Norway, a word they used often was ``lesson.''
	   ``This will serve as a great lesson to us not to lose our
concentration,'' coach Mario Zagallo said.
	   ``There's no question we all learned a lesson from this,'' added
a subdued Bebeto.
	   So what did defeat teach the defending world champions, as they
head into a final-16 game with Chile on Saturday?
	   Lesson One probably is: It isn't over 'till it's over.
	   Brazil coasted until the 83rd minute of the game Tuesday night
in this Mediterranean seaport. As the crowd jeered their slow,
methodical play, the Brazilians turned up the pressure just enough
to score, with Bebeto heading in a cross from Denilson in the 78th
minute.
	   It seemed more than enough. For Brazil, already qualified in
first place in Group A, the game didn't change the standings. And
while the Norwegians needed a win to qualify, they seemed incapable
of reaction.
	   But Norway's lone striker, Andre Tore Flo, wasn't ready to quit.
In the 83rd minute, he evened the score with a shot from the left
side after a back-breaking dribble on fullback Junior Baiano. Then
he was the beneficiary of a penalty called against Baiano, which
Kjetil Rekdal converted in the 89th.
	   ``There was a relaxation, a let-down in concentration,'' said
Zagallo,'' ``We lost a game that was won.''
	   ``We forgot everything we know how to do well, which is move the
ball,'' said team captain Dunga.
	   Another lesson from the Norwegians: Soccer isn't fair.
	   Brazil was superior and probably deserved a better fate. Even if
it wasn't art _ much of it was downright boring _ the Brazilians
nevertheless controlled the tempo and tried in vain to lure the
Norwegians into a more aggressive attack.
	   ``We didn't let the Norwegians do anything,'' Rivaldo said of
the first 80 minutes.
	   ``We were better, we created the chances, we deserved to win,''
added Bebeto.
	   ``We felt infinitely superior,'' agreed Junior Baiano.
	   A third lesson: Play cool, play smart.
	   Brazilians let the boos get under their skin. Even after
Bebeto's goal, they wanted to put on the showtime fans have come to
expect.
	   ``It wasn't enough,'' Baiano said of the 1-0 lead. ``Foolishly
we wanted to humiliate our opponent, score a lot of goals, and at
the end we were beaten.''
	   ``We should have just traded passes in the midfield and let the
Norwegian fans boo,'' said Zagallo. ``But one goal wasn't enough
for us and we went looking for the second.''
	   That's the same lesson Brazil got in the 1982 World Cup and
apparently didn't learn.
	   A brilliant team led by Zico, Socrates and Falcao wasn't
satisfied with a 2-2 tie against Italy that would have qualifed
Brazil for the quarterfinals. In pursuit of victory, the team took
a third goal on a counterstrike and was eliminated.
	   Brazil still isn't satisfied with the minimum. For soccer
lovers, maybe that's a good thing.

56 Russian peacekeepers killed in Abkhazia since 1994

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fighting in the breakaway Georgian republic of
Abkhazia has killed 56 Russian peacekeepers since 1994, a news
agency reported Wednesday.
	   ``Russia is paying a very dear price for peace between Georgians
and Abkhazians,'' the Interfax news agency reported, citing an
interview between Russian Maj. Gen. Sergei Korobko and the Krasnaya
Zvezda newspaper.
	   Korobko said that periodic acts of terrorism by both sides and
the persecution of refugees made it unlikely that Russian
peacekeepers would leave the region any time soon, Interfax said.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
civilians in a 13-month war.

Asian markets mostly higher 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed slightly higher
Wednesday as investors waited for details of government measures to
boost Japan's financial sector.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 68.58 points, or
0.46 percent, closing at 15,123.18. On Tuesday, the average had
plunged 254.49 points, or 1.66 percent.
	   The Nikkei average was up some 150 points at one point, but shed
some of its gains as investors were discouraged by the yen's
weakening in the afternoon and were still waiting for government
initiatives to revive the financial sector.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar climbed to a midday high of 141.18
yen, its highest level since last Wednesday, when the Bank of Japan
and the U.S. Federal Reserve joined forces to prop up the yen. The
dollar later retreated to 140.36 yen in late Tokyo trading, up 2.61
yen from late Tuesday.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed slightly higher as investors
scooped up shares on signs of a stabilizing Japanese currency.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 77.10 points, or 0.9 percent, closing at 8,296.77.
	   South Korean shares closed lower on the Japanese yen's fall
against the dollar, as well as a possible early listing of
state-owned Korea Telecom shares and fears that some banks may be
forced to shut down after banking reforms are carried out.
	   Analysts have said that a listing of Korea Telcom shares would
be expected to further hurt the bearish market because it would
sharply increase stock supply in an already oversupplied market.
	   The Seoul Stock Exchange's Korea Composite Stock Price Index was
down 2.02 points to 301.29.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Shares ended higher as overnight gains on U.S. stock
markets encouraged investors to look for bargains. The market's key
Weighted Stock Price Index rose 37.35 points, closing at 7,670.71.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed higher as the market
reacted positively to current account data released during the
day's session. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 16.50 points, closing
at 1,970.18.
	   MANILA: Shares ended mixed as investors hunted for bargains
among oversold blue-chip stocks, and others took profits on the
market's mild rally Tuesday. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index rose 17.02 points, or 1 percent, closing at 1,712.88.
	   SYDNEY: Share prices ended slightly higher as bargain hunting by
local institution pushed up some stocks. The All Ordinaries Index
rose 10 points, closing at 2,592.8
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices ended lower on weakness in the
Japanese yen, which prompted fears for the stability of the Thai
baht. The benchmark Stock Exchange of Thailand index lost 6.32
points, or 2.3 percent, closing at 267.74.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices were slightly higher despite caution over
Indonesia's economic future. The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite
index was up 7.875 points, or 1.9 percent, closing at 430.96.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed lower as investors were spooked by
weaker currencies and waited for the government's off-budget
measures. The Straits Times Industrials Index lost 7.40 points,
closing at 1,074.85.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares at the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange finished
lower on persistent worries over the Japanese yen and economy. The
Composite Index was down 1.88 points, or 0.4 percent, at 455.37.

World Cup: Pressure on Nakayama to save scoreless Japan 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING TO INCLUDE BC- DESIGNATOR

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Back home, Masashi Nakayama is used
to driving in so many goals, they're called ``Gon goals'' after his
nickname. At the World Cup, the 30-year-old Japanese striker has
delivered none.
	   When Japan plays its final match Friday against fellow novice
Jamaica, Nakayama will have his last chance to spare his team the
embarrassment of leaving the tournament without a single goal.
	   Nakayama, who holds a J-League record of netting four
consecutive hat tricks this season, knows too well how much harder
it is to score at the World Cup.
	   ``I sure would like to give them one blast,'' he said.
	   With the other starting striker, 23-year-old Shoji Jo, not
coming anywhere close in his attempts in the first two games _ both
1-0 losses to Argentina and Croatia _ the pressure is heavy on the
more experienced Nakayama.
	   Nakayama almost scored his 13th goal in his 29th international
match last Saturday against Croatia, when he was able to evade the
opponent to kick toward the net, but the ball struck the sure hand
of keeper Drazen Ladic.
	   ``Maybe I needed to make my kick stronger,'' he recalled. ``But
that's where I aimed.''
	   Nakayama, signed with J-League's Jubilo Iwata alongside Brazil's
Dunga, is quick to add that Japan has played better with each game.
	   ``We did much better than I expected. We weren't crushed,'' he
said. ``It's not that we didn't have a chance.''
	   To make up for the lack of individual talent and physical power,
Japan has been forced to play a more defensive game. And that has
made it a big challenge for Nakayama and others to move up to
score.
	   Nakayama earned his nickname ``Gon'' during his university days
when he was chubbier than his 74 kilograms (163 pounds) and he was
a dead ringer for a character played by Japanese comedian-film
director Beat Takeshi.
	   Nakayama has shed his pounds but not his humorous, witty
personality. During practice, he is the loudest with his claps and
cheers.
	   In contrast to his more reserved teammates, he is not afraid to
display his emotions. Should he score against Jamaica, Nakayama
won't hide his jubilation.
	   When he scored during qualifiers, Nakayama pulled up his shirt
to show another jersey he was wearing underneath _ the No. 11 of
his longtime friend Kazuyoshi Miura, who was forced to sit out that
game.
	   Miura, 31, the only Japanese to have played in Europe, has since
been dropped from the team.
	   But for Nakayama, the rejoicing that he now remembers most
clearly is that of Argentine Gabriel Batistuta in Japan's opener
after he scored the winning goal.
	   ``You'd think he would shrug it off. It's just Japan, a weak
island nation, but he was really happy,'' Nakayama said
thoughtfully. ``It's that big of a tournament.''

Holbrooke arrives to make `last-chance' demands on Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived
Wednesday in Kosovo for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders after
warning Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that time for a
peaceful end to the violence in the region was running out.
	   ``We are at a critical moment in the crisis surrounding
Kosovo,'' Holbrooke said Tuesday in Belgrade after four hours of
talks with Milosevic.
	   The visit by Holbrooke, nominated to be the next U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, is seen as a last attempt to get Milosevic
to stop his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the secessionist
Yugoslav province.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between Serb-led army and police forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is gaining in public support in
predominantly Albanian Kosovo.
	   In Kosovo on Wednesday, Holbrooke was meeting with negotiators
close to ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, while touring
regions west of the capital Pristina that have seen some of the
heaviest fighting.
	   Due to fighting and numerous police blocks along the province's
main Pristina-Pec road, Holbrooke and the U.S. delegation were
forced to detour through surrounding villages.
	   During his talks with Holbrooke, Milosevic reaffirmed an earlier
promise to allow foreign diplomats to observe the situation in
Kosovo. Holbrooke refused to reveal anything else about the
meeting, saying it was confidential.
	   Holbrooke returns to Belgrade Thursday before traveling to
Greece.
	   He met Tuesday with leaders of neighboring Macedonia, and
Rugova, saying the latter meeting was ``very productive.''
	   In Brussels Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana met
Rugova and insisted Serbs and Albanians return to the negotiating
table without conditions. Solana also stressed the NATO allies
support a return to the autonomy in Kosovo, but not the
independence sought by both Rugova and Albanian militants.
	   In 1989, Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy and has since
ruled the province with virtual martial law.

Artillery exchanges ends 12-day lull in fighting

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopian and Eritrean forces
exchanged artillery fire early Wednesday, ending a 12-day lull in
fighting over disputed territory that began eight weeks ago, a
government spokeswoman said.
	   Eritrea denied any fighting had taken place, but residents in
Adigrat, 600 kilometers (372 miles) north of Addis Ababa, said they
heard shelling for several hours Wednesday morning.
	   Selome Taddesse said the clash occurred near the border town of
Zala Ambessa _ now held by the Eritreans _ while two other fronts
remained quiet. Zala Ambessa is 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of
Adigrat.
	   She said the Eritreans lobbed artillery shells into Ethiopian
territory early Wednesday, and the Ethiopians responded in kind.
	   ``The shelling ended when the Eritrean forces stoppped firing,''
Selome said, adding she had no information on casualties.
	   But in Eritrea, Yemane Gebremeskel, an adviser to President
Isaias Afwerki, denied any fighting had taken place.
	   ``They (Ethiopians) have become pathological liars. There has
been no fighting of any kind at the front,'' he said. ``It's been
quiet for about 10 days now.''
	   He said the Ethiopians had begun raising their voices again
after a period of calm.
	   ``I think this may be a strategy. Maybe this is their way to put
pressure on the international community to find a solution by
indicating that otherwise war will break out,'' Yemane said.
	   The two countries seem to have been on close terms until a May 6
skirmish over disputed territory that left several Eritrean
officers dead.
	   Ethiopia demands that Eritrea withdraw to positions held prior
to May 6 as a precondition for direct talks. Eritrea says it is on
its own territory.
	   Eritrean rebels joined forces with Ethiopian rebels to oust the
17-year military regime of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. In
exchange, the Eritreans were granted independence in 1993 after a
30-year war with Ethiopia.

failed.

	   The ministry also said Ethiopia had detained 1,000 Eritrean
military reservists in Fitche, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northwest of Addis Ababa, because they posed ``a threat to national
security and peace.''

Russia to sell oil equipment to Iraq 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian company will sell oil-drilling equipment
worth dlrs one million to Iraq, a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The contract between oil trader Zarubezhneft and the Iraqi state
company SOMO is the first such deal for Iraq since an international
trade embargo was imposed on the country in 1990.
	   The deal will be carried out under a United Nations resolution
passed on Friday, which allows Iraq to buy dlrs 300 million of oil
equipment, Interfax reported, citing Zarubezhneft deputy general
director Yuri Agababov.
	   Iraq needs the equipment to boost oil production to meet raised
export quotas under the ``oil for food'' program.
	   The U.N. Security Council decided recently that Iraq may now
export oil worth dlrs 5.25 billion every six months. Previously,
Iraq's quotas did not exceed dlrs 2 billion.
	   Zarubezhneft also recently signed a contract with Iraq to
purchase 18 million barrels of oil under the new quota agreement.

World Cup: Playing for a draw too risky for Dutch 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ For the Dutch, a draw will do. For
Mexico, only a win will guarantee qualification for the second
round.
	   So the Netherlands, which can't afford to lose its last Group E
match Thursday, is taking no chances.
	   ``We are not going to try to play calculated football. It's too
dangerous,'' said coach Guus Hiddink. ``We will just play our game
and try to control the Mexicans.''
	   The two teams met earlier this year in a World Cup warmup in
Miami, when the Netherlands won 3-2.
	   Hiddink is expecting a tough in Saint-Etienne.
	   ``If you look at their team, they have a lot of experience and a
number of very skilled players'' Hiddink said.
	   Mexico could qualify with a draw, but not if Belgium beats South
Korea by three goals or more. If Belgium wins and Mexico beats the
Netherlands, the Dutch are out.
	   After a frustrating goalless draw with low countries neighbor
Belgium in its World Cup opener, the Netherlands got into its
stride against the outclassed South Koreans, firing in five
unanswered goals last Saturday.
	   Mexico began its campaign with a 3-1 win over South Korea, a
match Mexico only got a grip on after the Koreans were reduced to
10 men following the sending off of goalscorer Ha Seok-ju for a
tackle from behind.
	   Mexico had to come from behind again against Belgium, losing two
goals before regrouping to fight out a 2-2 draw in which both teams
had a player sent off.
	   Mexican defender Pavel Pardo was given the red card for a tackle
from behind in the 29th minute and will miss Thursday's encounter.
	   The Netherlands is still without striker Patrick Kluivert,
suspended for two matches after elbowing Belgium's Lorenzo
Staelens. But Phillip Cocu filled Kluivert's boots with style
against Korea, scoring the match's opening goal. Hiddink is
unlikely to announce any major changes to the team that thrashed
South Korea.
	   Spirits and confidence are high in the Dutch camp following the
destruction of South Korea, and although the Dutch are one of the
serious title contenders, Hiddink knows Mexico cannot be
underestimated.
	   ``We must be very sharp and careful at the beginning of the
game,'' he cautioned his players.
	   He particularly pointed out Luis Hernandez, who scored twice in
Mexico's opening match against South Korea. ``He's hot,'' Hiddink
said.
	   But Hernandez has not recovered from a swollen ankle and may
miss the match.
	   Hernandez has not been training with the rest of the team, but
Tuesday he told reporters that he is ready to play if Lapuente
wants him and the team's medical staff gives the green light.
	   If Hernandez can't play, coach Manuel Lapuente said he would
start with Ricardo Pelaez.
	   ``Holland is indeed one of the favorites in this tournament but
you will see a very good match because we are ready to go for
victory,'' Lapuente said. ``Do not expect us to go seeking a
draw.''
	   ``The Dutch will not be overconfident against us despite its
impressive 5-0 win against Korea. It knows that a defeat to Mexico
may mean elimination.'' (mc/ae)

Court sentences 96-year-old woman to three years for killing son 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese court sentenced a 96-year-old woman
Wednesday to three years in prison for murdering her 63-year-old
mentally handicapped son while he was on a New Year visit from a
nursing home.
	   Although a prison sentence for such an elderly person is
extremely rare in Japan, Kazuki Ishida, a spokesman of the Supreme
Court, said there were no records to show whether defendant Shisa
Kawai was the oldest ever to receive such punishment.
	   Police said Mrs. Kawai strangled her son with a kimono cord as
he slept, and then tried unsuccessfully to hang herself in her
bedroom. Six other family members in the house were not immediately
aware of what happened, they said.
	   Kyodo News said Mrs. Kawai heard the sentence from her
wheelchair, and the judge had to use a microphone because of her
weak hearing.
	   She already had been in jail since Jan. 2, when she was arrested
for the killing at her home in Toyohashi, 250 kilometers (150
miles) west of Tokyo, said an official of the Nagoya District
Court, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   He quoted presiding Judge Takuya Otsu as saying in his ruling
that Mrs. Kawai ``must bear a grave responsibility for murdering a
defenseless person.''
	   The official said the judge held that ``it is understandable
that a mother, worrying about her son's future because of her age,
came to feeling that she had no choice but to murder him.''
	   But, the judge added, the son was able to take meals and go to
the bathroom on his own, and ``he hasn't caused any trouble for
other people.''

Cholera found in several regions of Ukraine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Bacteria that cause cholera have been found
in several regions of Ukraine, health officials said Wednesday.
	   The bacteria, known as vibrios, were discovered in water ponds
and rivers in the eastern region of Mariupol and the southeastern
Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhya regions, according to Anatoly
Padchenko, Ukraine's deputy chief sanitary medic.
	   Officials have imposed restrictions on the use of water from two
rivers in the Mariupol area and were monitoring the situation, he
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   No actual cholera cases have been reported, and no vibrios were
found in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula where tens of thousands of
people were spending their summer vacations.
	   Ukraine has been plagued by water crises in recent years. Heavy
flooding and crumbling septic tanks have prompted outbreaks of
cholera and other diseases related to unclean water, while neglect
of pipelines has severely limited the water supply for many
Ukrainians.
	   In the Black Sea port of Odessa, meanwhile, authorities have
ordered all city beaches closed to swimmers. They cited ``heavy
bacterial pollution'' and said water quality failed to correspond
to sanitary norms, the Kievskiye Vedomosti newspaper reported.
	   Such closures are frequent in Odessa, where sea waters are
polluted by city sewage.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos left
Moscow on Wednesday, concluding his first visit to Russia in a

	   The two sides traded messages of goodwill and signed cooperation
and trade agreements during the three-day visit.
	   Angolan leaders praised the trip as a ``turning point in

Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Sylva Moura.

Indonesian president promises improvements in East Timor on autonomy; ADDS byline

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie pledged
Wednesday to withdraw some troops from disputed East Timor and
allow its people greater freedom, said a Nobel peace laureate from
the Indonesian-controlled territory.
	   But Bishop Carlos Belo, who met Habibie at the presidential
palace, said he and Indonesia's new leader did not debate a key
issue: the demand of many East Timorese for a vote on independence.
	   Habibie has ruled out a referendum in the former Portuguese
colony, which was invaded by Indonesian forces in 1975. Instead, he
has offered special status that would grant an undefined measure of
autonomy while keeping East Timor as Indonesia's 27th province.
	   Still, Habibie's decision to meet Belo, a longtime critic of
Indonesia, was a sign of new government openness in the wake of the
May 21 resignation of authoritarian President Suharto.
	   ``He's ready, through his government, to improve the situation
in East Timor,'' Belo said at a news conference. ``Many suggestions
that I presented, he supported them fully.''
	   Belo's proposals included a reduction of Indonesia's heavy
military presence in East Timor, greater freedom of movement for
East Timor's 800,000 people and the release of political prisoners.
Habibie, he said, agreed.
	   ``Little by little, they (the Indonesian military) will
withdraw,'' Belo said.
	   Currently, a small band of separatist rebels stages sporadic
hit-and-run attacks on military patrols, and resentment toward
Indonesian authority runs deep among many civilians.
	   In a conciliatory gesture, Habibie has released at least 16 East
Timorese political prisoners and said others will be freed in
stages. But Belo said he and Habibie did not discuss East Timor's
most prominent detainee, jailed rebel Xanana Gusmao.
	   ``He's not the only man of East Timor. We are 800,000,'' Belo
shot back at a reporter who asked about prospects for Gusmao's
freedom. ``Why do you ask about Xanana? Why not all the people?''
	   The guerrilla chief is revered by many East Timorese, who chant
his name at pro-independence rallies in Dili, the capital of the
half-island territory.
	   Habibie has suggested special status for East Timor as well as
freedom for Gusmao in exchange for world recognition of Indonesia's
authority. Portugal, Gusmao and other critics reject the offer,
saying a vote is the only solution.
	   Belo shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 with East Timorese
activist Jose Ramos-Horta for their efforts to bring peace to their
homeland. The bishop is the spiritual leader of East Timor, which
is predominantly Catholic in overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Indonesia would be willing to
grant East Timor some autonomy over education, economic and
cultural affairs. But foreign affairs, security and defense would
be the domain of the national government.
	   Alatas appealed to Portugal and the United Nations, which does
not recognize Indonesian authority in East Timor, to take part in
any discussions on autonomy.

Turkey calls on Britain to stop military build up in Cyprus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey called Wednesday on Britain to stop
what it called the ``tension building'' military activities on
Cyprus by the Greek Cypriots and Greece.
	   Relinquishing its colonial rule over Cyprus in 1960, Britain
became a guarantor of the island's independence together with
Greece and Turkey.
	   ``It has been requested from the guarantor state Britain to
spend every possible effort to stop these activities,'' a Foreign
Ministry statement said.
	   Tension has been running high on the Mediterranean island since
the Greek Cypriot government announced plans last year to deploy
Russian anti-aircraft missiles. Greek and Turkish warplanes flew to
the the island last week in a show of force.
	   The statement said the opening of an air base by Greek Cypriots
for the use of Greek warplanes and the building of a naval base
have added to the tensions.
	   Turkey, which keeps 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus, has
threatened to take military action to prevent the arrival of the
missiles, saying their deployment poses a threat to its security.
	   Such action could lead to retaliation from Greece, which has a
defense pact with the Greek Cypriots.
	   The Greek Cypriot government argues that it would only cancel
the missile deal if tangible progress was made in efforts to
reunite the island or if its long-standing proposals for
demilitarization were accepted.
	   Both the United States and Britain have opposed the missile deal
as unhelpful to the division of Cyprus.
	   Cyprus has been divided since Turkey sent in troops in 1974
after an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed slightly higher
Wednesday as investors waited for details of government measures to
boost Japan's financial sector. Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average gained 68.58 points, or 0.46 percent, closing at 15,123.18.
On Tuesday, the average had plunged 254.49 points, or 1.66 percent.
The U.S. dollar climbed to a midday high of 141.18 yen, its highest
level since last Wednesday, when the Bank of Japan and the U.S.
Federal Reserve joined forces to prop up the yen. The dollar later
retreated to 140.36 yen in late Tokyo trading, up 2.61 yen from
late Tuesday.
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Premier Sergei Kiriyenko submitted Russia's
austerity plan to the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday in
the hope it would earn Russia enough new lending to finance an
economic recovery. The IMF's first deputy managing director,
Stanley Fischer, said fund analysts will need several weeks to
study the plan. He said that in the mean time he will recommend
that the fund release the latest, dlrs 670 million installment of
an existing loan that was held up last week in an effort to press
Russia to meet the IMF's criteria. Kiriyenko detailed the austerity
plan to parliament on Tuesday. The measures cut government
spending, boost tax collections, and tighten control over customs
and tax authorities.
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers worked Wednesday to cut
more barrels of oil from the glutted market, and prices crept
higher in early London futures dealings. Some ministers say OPEC
should remove at least 1 million barrels a day to help prices
recover from their recent 12-year lows, and various members of the
group were holding bilateral sessions Wednesday to try to find a
workable formula. Prices have risen about dlrs 1 per barrel this
week on anticipation of big cutbacks, but one prominent OPEC
delegate told reporters early Wednesday that the producers want an
increase of at least dlrs 4 per barrel.
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a surprise move, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad appointed his chief economic adviser Wednesday to
a new Cabinet-level post for economic policy, an official statement
said. As a minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Daim
Zainuddin, a former finance minister, will have special functions
to oversee the country's battered economy. It was unclear how
Daim's position would coordinate with the functions of the Finance
Ministry, headed by Anwar Ibrahim, who is also Mahathir's deputy.
There have been increasing signs of policy differences between
Mahathir and Anwar, 51, with the premier pushing strongly for lower
interest rates to revive Malaysia's stumbling economy. Anwar has
backed the central bank's tight monetary policy to curb inflation
and protect the ringgit.
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a bid to expand its reach to millions of
customers, AT-and-T Corp. announced Wednesday it is buying
Tele-Communications Inc. for dlrs 32 billion, a deal that would
pair two of the United States' largest telecommunications and cable
television companies. The all-stock transaction would allow
AT-and-T to provide digital and Internet services to TCI's 14
million cable customers across the United States. AT-and-T is the
largest U.S. telecom company; TCI has access to millions of homes
in dozens of states. In addition to paying dlrs 32 billion in
stock, AT-and-T would assume dlrs 16 billion of TCI's debt. The
deal must be approved by stockholders and government regulators.

Hamas leader to return after successful fundraising drive edits to conform 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Yassin reportedly leaving Cairo, arrival delayed;
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin, a
thorn in the side to both Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israel, was set to return Wednesday to the Gaza Strip.
	   However, the sheik's departure from Cairo, where he had been
receiving medical treatment, was delayed by several hours, and he
was not expected to arrive at the border crossing until early
evening.
	   In Gaza City, well-wishers gathered at the home of the
62-year-old spiritual leader, who is quadriplegic and has hearing
and vision problems.
	   A freshly spray-painted graffiti on a nearby wall proclaimed:
``The Islamic nation is very proud of Ahmed Yassin who ... can lead
the nation to victory from his wheelchair.''
	   During a four-month fundraising tour of nearly a dozen Arab
capitals, Yassin had raised millions of dollars for the Islamic
militant group Hamas that vehemently opposes peace with Israel.
	   Yassin also made fiery statements _ widely reported in Israel _
praising suicide bombers and calling on Palestinians to carry on an
armed struggle against the Jewish state.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai left it open until
the last minute whether Israel would allow Yassin to return to the
Gaza Strip. Israel controls Gaza's external borders.
	   However, Israeli officials have said they considered Yassin more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his movements can be
monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The frail white-bearded Yassin left Cairo by car in the early
afternoon for the Rafah border crossing, Israel radio reported.
	   Yassin, who is the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, left
Gaza in late February, ostensibly on a short trip to obtain medical
treatment. Instead, he embarked on a tour of the Arab world.
	   In recent months, Yassin has posed a growing challenge to
Arafat's authority. Public opinion polls suggest Palestinian
support for Hamas has crept upward in recent months as the peace
process _ supported by Arafat's Palestinian Authority _ has
remained at an impasse.
	   This marks Yassin's second triumphal homecoming to Gaza in nine
months. Israel was forced to release him from prison in September
to buy the freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents who were caught
trying to kill another Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
	   Yassin had served eight years of a life term for ordering the
killings of Israeli soldiers and Palestinians accused of
collaborating with the Israelis.
	   It remained to be seen whether Yassin's return would worsen the
rift between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.
	   Arafat's camp blamed an internal Hamas feud for the death of
chief Hamas bombmaker Mohiyadine Sharif, who was found dead March
29 at the scene of a massive car-bomb blast in the West Bank town
of Ramallah.
	   But Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz Rantisi blamed the Palestinian
Authority and several high-ranking Palestinian officials and
security chiefs for collaborating with Israel in Sharif's death.
	   Rantisi was arrested in April and charged with endangering
national security. Earlier this month, the Palestinian Supreme
Court Rantisi released for lack of evidence, but he remains jailed.
	   Palestinian security forces routinely ignore court orders and
keep detainees in custody until their release is personally
approved by Arafat.
	   Last week, Hamas spurned an offer to join Arafat's Cabinet.

Indonesian says country needs time to wipe out corruption return 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS 2 grafs with Abeng saying laws must encourage Chinese to
By LAURINDA KEYS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Wiping out corruption and cronyism in
Indonesia's banking, business and legal systems will take time, the
country's minister in charge of state-owned enterprises said
Wednesday.
	   Tanri Abeng, speaking at an international gathering of business
and political leaders, gave no estimate on how long it would take
to nurture ``a culture of treating the law as being above
politics.''
	   But he did not object when an Indonesian businessman on a panel
with him said it would take about two years.
	   ``We must start making legal and judicial reforms that will
enable us to provide all investors, both local and foreign, with
greater transparency and fairness in their transactions,'' Abeng
said in a speech to the Business Week Asian Leadership Forum.
	   The priorities are working out new legal frameworks for contract
law, competition policy, anti-trust legislation and intellectual
property rights, he said.
	   Also in the forefront are closing, recapitalizing or merging
weak banks and implementing new laws to create a sounder banking
system.
	   ``As with our transition to a democracy, which must come
hand-in-hand with the rule of law, these legal and judicial reforms
will take some time before having any discernible impact,'' Abeng
said.
	   ``The people who are responsible for running our legal and
judicial systems must be trained to conduct their affairs with
higher professional and moral standards than before.''
	   Abeng also said that most, but not all, of the nation's poorly
run and uncompetitive state companies will be privatized.
	   He said that Indonesia's 160 state-owned enterprises, with more
than 1,000 subsidiaries, are poorly managed and only 30 percent are
financially healthy.
	   ``Returns on equity are extremely low and most of their product
and service offerings are uncompetitive by world standards,'' he
said.
	   Although the task of reforming the sector is urgent, it is
politically sensitive, not least because 800,000 people are
employed in the state companies, Abeng said.
	   During the 1998-99 fiscal year, the government will sell its
stake in 12 of the enterprises, hoping to generate dlrs 2 billion
in revenue to finance the national budget deficit.
	   A master plan detailing which of the rest will be restructured,
closed or privatized is due in October, he said.
	   Some will be kept under state ownership or management control,
he said, but in those cases there will be changes in regulations,
managements and financing.
	   Abeng also said he was optimistic about reform because President
B.J. Habibie, though criticized for his former role as minister of
research and technology, ``knows that it's rice and other basic
food commodities that count right now, not airplanes.''
	   New electoral laws should be ready for public review by August,
Abeng said, and fair and open elections will probably be held
within one year.
	   Singapore government television quoted Abeng as saying laws must
be prepared to encourage ethnic Chinese businessmen, who were
targeted by looters and rioters, to return home.
	   ``The priority now is to convince the ethnic Chinese that they
are Indonesians and they should be coming and doing their usual
businesses,'' the state-run text television service quoted Abeng as
saying to reporters after his speech. ``Obviously there have to be
laws prepared and also actions taken by the government to ensure it
is happening.''

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police on Wednesday detained a dissident
who had been on the run. Determined to prevent disruptions during
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit, police also tightened
surveillance on other democracy campaigners. Li Xiaolong, a
dissident in southern Guangxi province who had been hiding from
police for fear of arrest for pro-democracy activities, was
detained after he went home to see his two children, said his wife,
Jiang Hangxia. As Clinton's arrival Thursday neared, authorities
stepped up surveillance of dissidents across the country. At the
same time, dissidents and human rights groups reminded Clinton they
would be watching to see if his summit will do anything to further
their cause.

peaceful end to the violence in the region was running out. ``We
are at a critical moment in the crisis surrounding Kosovo,''
Holbrooke said Tuesday in Belgrade after four hours of talks with
Milosevic. The visit by Holbrooke, nominated to be the next U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, is seen as a last attempt to get
Milosevic to stop his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the
secessionist Yugoslav province.
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will take action against the United
Nations unless sweeping U.N. sanctions are lifted immediately,
Iraq's top leaders warned in a statement Wednesday. The threat
comes a day after reports that a U.S. Army laboratory found traces
of VX, a deadly nerve agent, on Iraqi warheads. If true, the
finding could undermine efforts by Russia, France and China to end
the seven-year inspection program and lift sanctions imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The Iraqi statement, signed by
President Saddam Hussein and others, warned Iraq would reconsider
its relations with inspectors if the sanctions are not lifted. The
statement said Iraq would follow through on a threat of ``grave
consequences'' it made May 1. Iraq has never spelled out what that
entails.
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities fighting World Cup violence
have placed two German fans under formal investigation, a step shy
of charging them with beating a police officer into a coma in
northern France. The men have denied the allegations stemming from
a clash after Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia match in Lens, just
southwest of Lille. Three others were given one-year jail terms.
Scores of fans and police officers have been injured in violence in
French cities hosting the five-week soccer championship that began
June 10. More than 250 people have been arrested; some have been
sentenced to jail terms or deported. An English fan has been
hospitalized in critical condition.

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities fighting World Cup violence
have placed two Germans under formal investigation, a step shy of
charging them with beating a police officer into a coma in northern
France.
	   The men have denied the allegations stemming from a clash after
Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia match in Lens, just southwest of Lille.
Three others were given one-year jail terms.
	   Scores of fans and police officers have been injured in violence

	   More than 250 people have been arrested; some have been
sentenced to jail terms or deported. An English fan has been
hospitalized in critical condition.
	   As a result, tighter security, alcohol restrictions and early
bar closings have been planned for some matches, including
Germany-Iran in Montpellier on Thursday and England-Colombia in
Lens on Friday.
	   The Germans placed under formal investigation Tuesday night were
Markus Warnecke, 27, owner of a tattoo shop and body-piercing
parlor in Hanover, and Steffen Karl Elschner, 26, a record salesman
from Braunschweig.
	   Warnecke, who was ordered to remain in jail, has refused to talk
to police, said his lawyer, Bertrand Wambeke.
	   He was described as a high-school graduate from a well-off
family. He sometimes worked as a bouncer in a red-light district
club in Hanover.
	   Police also were questioning a 17-year-old Austrian they believe
may have taken photos of the attack on the policeman and sold them
to the German press, French radio reported Wednesday. The Austrian
was being detained, though it wasn't clear what crime, if any, he
was being accused of.
	   The policeman, 43-year-old Daniel Nivel, remained hospitalized
in Lille, where doctors on Wednesday said his condition was stable.
	   ``He is still in a serious coma and on a respirator,'' a morning
medical bulletin said. He was to undergo a brain scan later in the
day.
	   In Germany, various donation campaigns have been started to help
the family of the policeman, among them one by Berlin police, by
Bavarian businessmen, and by the ARD broadcast network.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon.
	   In Toulouse, meanwhile, an English fan was in ``very serious
condition'' and on life support Tuesday after being stabbed in the
stomach and lungs, hospital officials said.
	   Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge, West Midlands,
underwent three hours of surgery after being attacked Monday night,
as England played Romania.

Izetbegovic: OSCE too soft on parties that neglect peace terms 
</HEADLINE>
AP photo BRU103
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Bosnia's Muslim president insisted
Wednesday that political parties that oppose full implementation of
the Dayton peace agreement should be barred from standing in
September's elections.
	   Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of Bosnia's joint presidency,
criticized international monitors from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe for being too lenient in
deciding who could run.
	   ``I don't think any party has been excluded,'' Izetbegovic told
the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee.
	   ``We need a stricter approach ... About half the parties should
be excluded from these elections, if they do not support the Dayton
agreement.''
	   The U.S. brokered peace-deal was signed in Dayton, Ohio, in 1995
to end the 3 1/2-year war among Bosnia's Muslims, Croats and Serbs.
	   Izetbegovic repeated his assertion that the Dayton agreement
should be revised if it is not fully implemented. He accused the
Bosnian Serbs of only selectively applying the peace terms.
	   ``The Serb side, for example, in my opinion, chooses those
provisions that it likes,'' he told the committee.
	   Izetbegovic said the Dayton agreement could be a model for
ending the violence raging in nearby Kosovo.
	   He said the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo could be given
autonomy from Serbia in the way the Bosnian Serbs have their own
republic within Bosnia. As Dayton allows the Bosnian Serbs to have
special relations with Serbia, so the Kosovo Albanians could have
special relations with Albania, he added.
	   ``Kosovo is in our neighborhood, we are very interested in
seeing this resolved.''
	   Izetbegovic appealed for the West to supply more funds to repair
war damaged-homes in Bosnia and encourage refugees to return.
	   ``Nobody wants to return to a house without a roof,'' he said.
``You have to give us the funds first, then we can have them
return.''
	   Izetbegovic urged the European Union assembly members to back
Bosnia's bid to join international bodies including the Council of
Europe and the World Trade Organization. He said Bosnia also hoped
to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program of military
cooperation with eastern Europe.

Bushy, thin, upturned _ every moustache has meaning in Turkey 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ From a pile of books at his barber shop,
Goksel Ayrancigil picks out a catalogue of moustache styles.
	   ``The leftists will go for this one. ... This one is more for
the intellectual,'' Ayrancigil said, pointing at models.
	   Turkish men wear their moustaches not only to show off their
manhood but also to express their political ideology: long and
pointy for the right wing, scruffy for the left and beard-attached
for the Islamic.
	   ``A lot of thought goes into the shape of a moustache,''
Ayrancigil said. ``We have to be careful because customers do not
want to be identified with the wrong crowd!''
	   Facial hair long has been a popular way for Turkish men to show
their political leanings. Lately, however, their barbershop
requests have become even more significant.
	   Turkey, overwhelmingly Muslim, has had a secular system for the
past 75 years. But growing calls for a larger Islamic role in
government have led to tension among secular and religious Turks.
Last year, the secular military forced Turkey's first Islamic-led
government to resign.
	   Since then, the state has taken measures to curb Islamic
influences, including banning women from wearing headscarves in
public offices and schools and cracking down on suspected members
of radical Islamic groups.
	   Earlier this month, pro-Islamic students clashed violently with
security forces in protesting a ban on wearing their style of beard
at universities.
	   Islamic supporters can be spotted a mile away from their full
moustache and beard, trimmed in a semicircle at the bottom. Others
go for the thin, short moustache worn by former Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan, who was pressured out of power last year.
	   Many leftists will, on the other hand, keep their moustaches
long and scruffy, Stalin-style. Another favorite of the left-wing
intellectual is the thin and slightly upturned moustache, usually
accompanied by a goatee.
	   Kenan Sivaci, a fitness instructor, for years wore a long pointy
moustache that drooped downward. It's a nostalgic style once worn
by the old Turkic warriors of Asia.
	   ``I was a right-wing student then,'' he explained.
	   Moustaches and beards are forbidden in the military, while
public servants can wear only smartly kept moustaches.
	   ``The moustache serves as a uniform,'' said Coskun San, a
sociology professor at Ankara University. ``It allows the wearer to
show the outside world that he belongs to a community, and to prove
to his community that he is committed to its norms.''
	   The recent ban on Islamic-style beards at universities wasn't
the first time the state stepped in on Turks' shaving habits.
	   After a coup in 1980, the generals banned university professors
from growing beards, then the symbol of left-wing intellectuals.
Several professors resigned in protest of the decision.
	   There are, of course, some Turkish men who choose no moustache
at all.
	   But the clean-shaven look also can carry meaning; it remains a
favorite with Western-looking pro-secular youth and businessmen.

World Cup: Shaken Germans talk big, but Iran confident 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Shaken by their poor performance against
Yugoslavia, German players held an emergency meeting and have come
out talking big before the crucial match against Iran on Thursday.
	   But the Iranians are not exactly showing signs of fear.
	   The match in Montpellier is Iran's chance to make history and
produce one of the most stunning upsets in World Cup history.
	   If it beats Germany, the European Champion and three time World
Cup winner, Iran will make the second round for the first time. By
beating he United States 2-1 on Sunday, Iran scored its first World
Cup victory.
	   The last time Germany failed to clear the first round was 60
years ago _ when the World Cup was also held in France. Then,
Germany lost 4-2 to Switzerland.
	   ``We have no fear of losing,'' said Iran's coach Jalal Talabi.
``If we lose that's no surprise. But if we win that will be a
surprise and we hope to create that surprise.''
	   ``Because we have nothing to lose, we'll go into the match to
win,'' Talabi said.
	   Iran is in its second World Cup, while Germany has been to the
final six times.
	   Germany has four points after beating the United States 2-0 and
drawing 2-2 with Yugoslavia, and leads Group F on goal difference.
Yugoslavia, a 1-0 winner over Iran, also has four points and plays
pointless United States at the same time on Thursday in Nantes.
	   The Germans look vulnerable and there is tension in and around
the team.
	   They only salvaged a draw against Yugoslavia by scoring twice in
the last 16 minutes after being thoroughly outplayed for the first
two-thirds of the match.
	   This has led coach Berti Vogts to reshuffle his team. Lothar
Matthaus, the 37-year-old who made a World Cup record of 22 matches
when he came on as a substitute against Yugoslavia, will start
against Iran.
	   Matthaeus is likely to play libero, with Olaf Thon moving into
midfield. Thomas Helmer, recovered from a thigh injury, is likely
to take the defensive midfield place of Dietmar Hamman. Other
changes are possible, including Thomas Haessler in midfield instead
of Andy Moller.
	   German reserve striker Ulf Kirsten was doubtful for the game
because of a cut in his right foot.
	   As always, Vogts is not revealing his lineup. But in times of
trouble he seems to be turning to his veterans and his team against
Iran could average more than 31 years of age.
	   Vogts said that some of his players were simply awed by
Yugoslavia's superior skill.
	   ``We were like a rabbit before a snake,'' Thon said of the game.
	   ``It was necessary to have a team meeting, without the coach. We
talked mostly about our performance against Yugoslavia,'' he said.
	   ``We must improve and we believe we will. Iran has nothing to
lose, but we have a better team, we go into the match with
confidence,'' Thon said.
	   ``We want to win and we will. But you must not underestimate
anyone. A draw will suffice but it doesn't make things any
easier,'' Thon said.
	   If Germany comes second in the group, it is likely to face the
Netherlands in the second round, something that the Germans are
keen to avoid.
	   Apart from suspect form, other things have shaken up the team.
After German hooligans rampaged in Lens and left a policeman in
coma, German delegation officials briefly considered withdrawing
the team from the World Cup. This stunned Vogts and his players.
	   Erich Reutemoeller, assistant coach who has ``spied'' on Iran,
said Iran could counter dangerously. ``They have very fast players.
Fear would be a false word, but we have to have absolute respect.''
	   Iran's trumps are the three players who play in the German
league _ strikers Ali Daei and Khodadad Azizi and midfielder Karim
Bagheri.
	   ``We know how to handle the Germans. We'll win this match,''
Daei said.

Young Democrats and Smallholders sign coalition pact 
</HEADLINE>
By EVA KEKES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's Young Democrats, winners of
last month's elections, signed a coalition pact Wednesday with the
agrarian-based Independent Smallholders Party, paving the way for
four years of center-right government.
	   Under the agreement, the Smallholders get four cabinet seats,
including the key defense and agriculture portfolios, environmental
protection and a post for overseeing European Union funds. The
party also gets the right to name the next president, when Arpad
Goencz' term in that largely ceremonial post expires in 2000.
	   The Smallholders' populist leader Jozsef Torgyan is set to be
agriculture minister. His profile has risen sharply in Hungary
since May elections left him the kingmaker in forming a coalition
with either the Young Democrats, who won 148 seats in the 386-seat
parliament, or the Socialists of Gyula Horn, who finished second.
	   With the Smallholders' 48 seats, and 17 seats with their smaller
partner, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the Young Democrats and
their prime minister designate Viktor Orban have a comfortable
213-seat majority.
	   ``This step is of historical importance to enable Hungary to
move on on the path of European integration,'' Torgyan told The
Associated Press in an interview just before the signing.
	   ``We are planning long-term cooperation, not just for one
governmental term,'' he added.
	   In the past four years of Socialist government, Hungary gained
its coveted invitation to join NATO and got into the first group of
post-communist nations to open talks on joining the EU _ at the
earliest, in 2002.
	   Torgyan stressed how important it will be to harmonize Hungary's
legal system with EU rules ``to work off our decades' long lag.''
	   ``EU integration will be like a marriage,'' he said. ``Both
parties will gain and give up rights.''
	   Torgyan said the government's most important task is to boost
the economy and attract investors who will produce goods and create
jobs, rather than just acquiring shares of Hungary's market.
	   State spending must also be cut, he said, noting that ``half of
the budget spending goes to social security, which is a clear proof
that there's no real market economy yet.''
	   In the election campaign, Torgyan's party strongly opposed
foreign ownership of arable land, highway tolls, the crawling-peg
devaluation of the Hungarian forint and demanded large tax cuts.
	   This approach was widely seen as fiscally irresponsible. Now,
with power in reach, Torgyan says these issues are subject to
coalition negotiations.
	   ``Obviously, we didn't want to abandon the crawling-peg
devaluation overnight,'' he said, referring to Orban's recent
comment that it can't be abolished before the end of this year.
	   Regarding foreign land ownership _ a touchy topic in other EU
candidate countries such as Slovenia, Torgyan told The AP that
allowing foreigners to buy arable land freely right now ``would be
equal to looting the country.
	   ``First, the economy has to get stronger _ and then I also
wouldn't mind to buy a vineyard in Bordeaux,'' he joked.
	   Torgyan declined to comment on widespread speculation that he
will seek the presidency in 2000.

	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Mats Lanner, who won the Madeira
Island Open last weekend and collected a 50,000 pound (dlrs 83,500)
winner's purse, moved into the 59th spot on the PGA European Tour
money list.
	   The 37-year-old Swede, who also won the event in 1994, had not
won any money on the 1998 European tour before Madeira.
	   The Madeira Island Open had no effect on the European Tour money
list top 10 as the bulk of the top players took part in the U.S.
Open, which has no impact on European earnings.
	   As a result, Lee Westwood still tops the European money list
with 383,629 pounds (dlrs 625,315), ahead of South Africa's Ernie
Els with 368,954 pounds (601,395).
	   Denmark's Thomas Bjorn, 327,470 pounds (dlrs 533,776), Sweden's
Patrik Sjoland, 317,034 pounds (dlrs 516,776), and Spain's Jose
Olazabal, 305,517 pounds (dlrs 497,993), make up the top five.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Premier Sergei Kiriyenko submitted his new
austerity plan to the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday in
the hope it would earn Russia enough new lending to finance an
economic recovery.
	   The IMF's first deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer, told
The Associated Press that fund analysts will need several weeks to
study the plan.
	   ``We have read the headlines, we've read the speeches, we got
descriptions of the measures,'' he said as he prepared to depart
the country. ``Precisely what they will amount to in terms of the
budget we will have to discuss.''
	   However, Fischer said that in the meantime he will recommend
that the fund release the latest, dlrs 670 million installment of
an existing loan that was held up last week to press Russia to meet
the IMF's criteria.
	   Kiriyenko detailed his austerity plan to the Cabinet and
parliament on Tuesday. The measures are designed to do largely what
the IMF has demanded and Russia has resisted: cut government
spending, boost tax collections, and tighten control over customs
and tax authorities.
	   Russia has been taking such measures already, but the IMF has
said the cuts did not go deep enough, and tax collections have
failed to raise government revenues enough. The international
lender has insisted that the country do more or it will not qualify
for a new loan estimated between dlrs 10 and 15 billion.
	   Fischer told The AP that in his view, Russia's chronic tax
collection problem is the biggest obstacle to a new loan. He said
that the country's biggest companies, especially oil companies, are
the greatest tax evaders.
	   But Russia will have to do more than just crack down on large
firms. It will also have to force average Russians to become
taxpayers.
	   The country has no tax-paying tradition, and officials have said
that fewer than 5 million of the country's 147 million residents
filed income tax forms last year.
	   ``People, companies, should pay the taxes that the law says they
should pay,'' Fischer said. ``This is the habit in most
countries.''
	   Kiriyenko has said the IMF loan is needed to replenish the
Central Bank's reserves, to back up Russian bonds and prevent a run
on the national currency, the ruble. The Kremlin fears that
devaluation of the ruble could lead to higher consumer prices and
social unrest.
	   Russia's economy has been troubled since the beginning of the
year, when it began losing ground after posting its first growth of
the post-Soviet period last year. Stocks have collapsed to about
half their value.
	   Kiriyenko's austerity measures were greeted with mixed reactions
in the Russian media. Many analysts accepted that austerity
measures are needed, but expressed reservations about the
government's ability to carry them out fairly and effectively.
	   Some newspapers pointed out that the economic crisis is far
removed from the ordinary trials of ordinary Russians, who are
unlikely to be happy about paying more taxes.
	   ``The technocrats' logic is simple: `There's no money, so find
some,''' wrote the respected Kommersant daily. ``But Russian
citizens are unlikely to understand this logic. (In their view,)
the government's finances are the government's problem. Citizens
have their own problems. And they are not obligated to help out.''
	   Parts of the program _ big cuts in the government work force, a
revamped tax code _ are certain to run into strong resistance in
the Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of parliament.
	   Kiriyenko has asked parliament to pass the necessary legislation
to implement the plan before it recesses on July 3 for more than
two months. But even pro-government deputies say the legislature
was unlikely to act with such dispatch.

Blast injures bus passengers in southern Philippines 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines (AP) _ A homemade bomb injured at
least 15 mini-bus passengers in this southern Philippine city late
Wednesday, police said.
	   The mini-bus was bound for the village of Labuan, west of
Zamboanga City, when the blast ripped through the middle part,
victims told reporters at a hospital where they were treated for
burns and shrapnel wounds.
	   Police took at least 15 of the injured to one hospital in
Zamboanga and said there were more casualties because the vehicle
was packed with about 50 passengers.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but regional
police chief Dominador Resos blamed former Muslim rebels under
pressure from a military and police operation against their group
in Tungawan town, northeast of Zamboanga, about 880 kilometers (550
miles) south of Manila.
	   ``This is an act of terrorism,'' Resos said.
	   Soldiers have battled members of the ``lost command'' of the
Moro National Liberation Front for the last two weeks in Tungawan,
where at least eight former rebels have been killed and three
soldiers injured in clashes.
	   Troops have been pursuing about 200 former guerrillas believed
responsible for a series of highway robberies.
	   The MNLF has signed a peace accord with the government, but many
former guerrillas still carry their weapons and some have turned to
banditry.
	   Resos said authorities have recovered bombs in Tungawan and
police were trying to determine whether they were similar to the
one that exploded on the mini-bus.

Guinea-Bissau's parliamentary speaker meets with rebel leaders pickup

<TEXT>
	   NHOMA, Guinnea-Bissau (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's parliamentary
speaker is meeting Wednesday with leaders of the breakaway military
faction to discuss a cease-fire and the possible return of
government to this battered West African country.
	   The speaker, Malam Bacai Sanha, was meeting in Nhoma with
representatives of former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane,
who staged a failed coup June 7.
	   The talks were underway Wednesday morning in this town, about 30
kilometers (19 miles) north of the capital, Bissau, which was
battered by heavy shelling Wednesday.
	   Religious leaders were also reportedly planning to meet with
renegade soldiers in Nhoma.
	   Government troops, supported by forces from neighboring Senegal,
began an artillery bombardment at dawn against the breakaway
faction's positions around Bissau's airport and in a nearby
suburban military garrison, according to Portugal's ambassador to
Guinea-Bissau.
	   ``Apparently, the shelling was from the government side, then
the rebels responded,'' Ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva
told Portuguese radio RDP-Africa.
	   The bombardment was continuing four hours later as Senegalese
infantry units moved up to the front line, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   Heavily-armed renegades have been dug into the positions since
launching their revolt in the former Portuguese colony June 7.
	   Henriques da Silva said the religious leaders who are seeking to
mediate an end to the conflict also aimed to meet with a rebel
delegation at Nhoma.
	   They intended to skirt the city on foot, passing through swamp
areas, and then continue by vehicle to the meeting place, according
to Henriques da Silva.
	   The leaders of the local Roman Catholic, Muslim and Evangelical
communities tried to meet with the rebels in Bissau on Tuesday, but
said they were turned back by Senegalese troops with tanks.
	   Two previous attempts at mediation, by a Gambian government
minister and by local politicians, failed last week.
	   Some 1,300 Senegalese troops are supporting President Joao
Bernardo Vieira against an unknown number of rebel forces led by
former armed forces chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane.
	   The rebels have accused Vieira of corruption and abuse of power
and have called on him to step down so that fresh elections can be
held.
	   Most of Bissau's population of about 300,000 people have fled
the city and are short of food and medicine, humanitarian
organizations reported.
	   The United Nations refugee agency has warned that without
immediate assistance, Guinea-Bissau will face a massive
humanitarian crisis within days.
	   Some aid is making it to Guinea-Bissau, though.
	   A Portuguese aid team is arriving in Dakar on Wednesday and will
head Thursday for Gabu, where AMI _ a Portuguese acronym for
International Medical Assistance _ is centering its operations.
	   ``More refugees are arriving there each day. There are now an
estimated 6,000 to 7,000 people in need of aid,'' Leonor Nobre of
AMI said in Lisbon.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has
distributed basic foodstuffs to about 10,000 in and around Bissau,
is sending two more aid teams into the country shortly, where they
will concentrate on the cities of Gabu, Bafata, Nhacra and Mansoa.
	   The U.N. refugee agency officials believe as many as 250,000
people have fled Bissau for the the central towns of Canchungo,
Mansoa and Bafata.

Small protest as German chancellor gets honorary degree at Cambridge 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) _ Cambridge University awarded an
honorary doctorate to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at ceremonies
Wednesday which were marked by a small protest.
	   The university also awarded honorary degrees to Aung San Suu
Kyi, the pro-democracy leader in Myanmar who was honored in
absentia; Professor RIta Levi-Motalcini of Italy, who won the Nobel
Prize for medicine in 1986, and Natalie Zemon Davis, professor
emeritus of history at Princeton University.
	   There had been controversy over the award to Kohl, and in
February the university canceled plans for a degree. It changed its
mind when faculty members voted overwhelmingly in his favor.
	   ``We thought we would show Mr. Kohl that he is in a position to
score some good goals by canceling the debts of the Third World,''
said Penny Pereira, 21, one of the eight protesters at Wednesday's
ceremony.
	   Dissenting academics gave out leaflets to around 200 people
arriving for the ceremony. Ulrika Ryblack, an assistant history
lecturer from St. John's College, said ``there is a general
consensus of opinion that honorary degrees should not be given to
serving politicians.''
	   The university dropped Kohl from the list of honorees in
February, after 11 faculty members objected. But 52 faculty members
then signed a petition backing an honorary degree for Kohl, and the
issue was put to a vote of the entire faculty.
	   The honorary doctorate was supported by 1,089 while 321 voted
against.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh threatened Wednesday to pull his party out of Cambodia's
upcoming elections if the international community fails to tackle
complaints of vote-rigging and violence.
	   The threat came on the eve of official campaigning for the July
26 polls after months of abuses fueling debate over whether the
election will advance democracy _ or be a cynical farce.
	   Ranariddh, toppled as co-premier by strongman Hun Sen in a
violent coup last year, issued a statement urging nations helping
to organize the polls to tackle concerns raised by his FUNCINPEC
party and human rights groups.
	   ``Failure to do so will make it very difficult for FUNCINPEC and
the democratic opposition to remain engaged in the process,''
Ranariddh said.
	   Ranariddh set no date for action. Another opposition chief, Sam
Rainsy, has issued a similar threat with a July 5 deadline.
	   Critics have urged at least delay in the voting. But the
international community holds the ultimate stamp of approval and
has decided to go ahead.
	   Underlying the apparent acquiescence is an unspoken recognition
that a flawed election is the best Cambodia can expect.
	   ``We can't expect an absolutely perfect situation on the 26th of
July,'' said Sven Linder, chief European Union election observer.
``But we can hope for and expect clear signals to be sent that
Cambodia is taking further steps toward democracy.''
	   The European Union, which is allocating dlrs 11.5 million to
help the elections, will pay a key role in deciding if the world at
large can call the polls credible once they're held.
	   The United States is giving dlrs 2.3 million to private groups
involved in the process, but none to Hun Sen's government.
	   That's peanuts compared to the dlrs 2 billion spent by the
international community in 1993, when some 20,000 United Nations
peacekeepers helped create a climate where Cambodians could vote,
most for the first time in their lives.
	   Cambodia was then a higher-profile international problem, still
torn by war with Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who boycotted the vote and
vowed to kill people taking part.
	   The Khmer Rouge, which caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
people between 1975 and 1979, now appears to be on its last legs.
	   FUNCINPEC won the vote. But Hun Sen, who ruled in the 1980s with
the backing of Vietnam, forced his way into a co-premiership by
threatening more war.
	   Tensions erupted in fighting July 5, 1997, and Ranariddh was
toppled.
	   Hun Sen hopes to win back aid and legitimacy, but has stacked
the electoral bodies with his supporters and denied the opposition
access to the media. The killings of some 100 of his opponents
since the coup have gone unpunished.
	   Responding to such complaints, the government's newly created
Human Rights Commission _ which critics say is biased in favor of
Hun Sen _ released the preliminary findings of its first
investigations Wednesday.
	   It said the recent killings of two pro-Ranariddh activists and
one working for Sam Rainsy did not appear politically motivated.
	   Foreign powers apparently hope that by keeping the electoral
process alive in Cambodia, democracy can be pushed forward.
	   But critics say turning a blind eye to a rigged election betrays
Cambodians who believe their vote can make a difference.
	   The wild card remains the Cambodian people. In 1993, Hun Sen's
victory was also widely predicted.

Chemical weapons prohibition called necessary for world security 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The support of Middle Eastern countries for
a treaty banning chemical weapons is key to a campaign to rid the
world of their threat, an international group said Wednesday.
	   The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which
is based in The Hague, urged all countries to ratify the treaty.
	   ``Without the full political support of this region, it will be
impossible for the OPCW to realize its overriding objectives of
achieving the universal destruction of chemical weapons
stockpiles,'' said Jose Bustani, the group's director-general.
	   He told the opening session of a symposium on chemical weapons
that many Middle East countries, including Israel and Iraq, have
either not joined his organization or endorsed its goals.
	   Of 165 countries worldwide which signed the convention to ban
chemical weapons in Paris in 1993, only 110 _ including the United
States and Russia _ have ratified it, according to OPCW, which was
formed last year to oversee compliance with the convention.
	   Other nations that have not signed are Iraq, Syria and Libya,
which have chemical weapons programs or had them in the past.
	   The two-day symposium in Amman is discussing ways to promote
adherence to the convention, which prohibits the development,
production, stockpiling and use of the chemical weapons and sets
targets for their destruction.
	   Participants include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman,
Kuwait, Sudan, Israel, Turkey, Brunei, Indonesia, Pakistan,
Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and the Philippines.
	   Bustani, a Brazilian, said there was a ``remarkable and mounting
display of multilateral support'' for the convention. He urged
others to sign the convention ``without any further delay.''

World Cup: Croatian defender injured, team holds rare secret practice 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatia's buildup for the last group game
against Argentina intensified Wednesday with the team's first
secret practice at the World Cup, but it lost one of its most
experienced defenders due to injury.
	   Coach Miroslav Blazevic said it was the first time in more than
four years of directing the team that he decided to bar the media
and other spectators from a training session _ because he wanted to
practice moves for Friday's game at Bordeaux.
	   Absent was right back Slaven Bilic, who dropped out with a groin
strain that has bothered him since a World Cup warmup game last
month.
	   Blazevic said possible replacements for the 29-year-old Everton
defender include Zoran Mamic of Germany's Bochum and Igor Tudor,
20, the second-youngest man on the roster.
	   To add punch to Croatia's front line, left back Robert Jarni
will be shifted closer to midfield. Jarni, 29, of Spain's Betis
Sevilla, is among Croatia's speediest players.
	   Two-time world champion Argentina and World Cup newcomer Croatia
have both qualified for the second round after beating Japan and
Jamaica. Friday's game will decide the Group H winner, thus
determining the two teams' next opponent.
	   ``We will play better than against Jamaica and Japan,''
goalkeeper Drazen Ladic said. ``We want to finish first in the
group.''
	   Croatian playmaker Zvonimir Boban is expected to return to the
lineup against Argentina after sitting out Saturday's hard-won 1-0
victory over Japan with a pulled leg muscle.
	   The AC Milan midfielder resumed team practice Tuesday, and
Blazevic said afterwards that Boban had ``held up well in all
situations.''
	   Wednesday's practice, in which Blazevic apparently wanted to
rehearse set pieces, was the last before the Croatians head west to
Bordeaux in their chartered plane Thursday for the duel with
Argentina.

Russian prime Minister to visit Japan in July 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko will visit
Japan on July 13 and 14, a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The agenda for Kiriyenko's visit will be announced later,
Interfax reported, citing Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory
Karasin.
	   Karasin was in Tokyo to make arrangements for the trip as well
as a session of the Russian-Japanese intergovermental commission
for economic, scientific, and technical cooperation.
	   That commission will coincide with a September visit by Japanese
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi to Moscow to continue negotiations
for a peace treaty between Russia and Japan that would formally end
World War II.
	   The two countries have never signed a treaty ending the war
because of an on-going dispute over four islands in the Kuril chain
which were seized by Soviet forces at the end of the war.

After NATO approval, Prodi to test strength of his government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ After a small centrist party bailed the government
out on a crucial vote to approve NATO's eastward expansion, Italy's
president called on Premier Romano Prodi to test the health of his
majority.
	   On Tuesday night, the government won lower house approval for
the ratification of the inclusion of the Czech Republic, Poland and
Hungary in NATO.
	   The Senate, where the government enjoys a comfortable majority,
had earlier ratified the agreement.
	   The approval in the chamber, sparing the government an
embarrassing defeat, came thanks to an eleventh-hour decision of a
centrist opposition party, created by former President Francesco
Cossiga, to vote ``yes.''
	   Hardline Communists, who normally give Prodi's center-left
coalition a majority in the Chamber, led the opposition.
	   ``An in-depth examination'' with the Communists is necessary,
Prodi said in a statement released late Tuesday, after a brief
meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the outcome of the
vote.
	   There was no indication, however, that any major changes were
expected.
	   Prodi rejected opposition requests that he resign for his
failure to have full backing from the government's regular
supporters.
	   Communist leader Fausto Bertinotti said repeatedly that his
party's position was not a vote against the government and that he
would support Prodi in any confidence vote.

British minister urges continued business commitment in Asia British exports, exchange rate 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with minister's comments on Asian crisis,
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Urging British business to stay engaged in Asia
despite the economic crisis, Britain's trade and industry minister
said Wednesday that good investment opportunities have emerged amid
the region's turmoil.
	   ``We still very much believe that, despite the economic crisis,
the region still has a lot to offer,'' Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry Margaret Beckett told a luncheon gathering of
businessmen.
	   On a two-day visit to this Southeast Asian city-state, Beckett
has met senior Singapore ministers to discuss international and
bilateral trade issues, and spoken to local and British businessmen
about opportunities in Britain and Asia.
	   She said that although volatile exchange rates will make direct
exporting from Britain more difficult, ``new opportunities arise
because of the crisis and investment opportunities have become very
attractive.''
	   Many companies across Asia are in dire need of renewed
investment and foreign capital. Equity values and local currencies
have dropped dramatically throughout the region, providing good
bargains for foreign investors.
	   Beckett urged British companies already present in Asia to ride
out the storm: ``The strong message I give to companies in the U.K.
is to stay with your partners in Asia.''
	   Speaking to reporters later, Beckett conceded that the slowdown
in Asia may lead to some ``easing of investment interest'' in the
short term, but said she remained confident that it would be
sustained nevertheless.
	   She warned that the crisis ``is gradually rippling out and will
impinge on the world economy as a whole, because the Asia-Pacific
region has been such a driver of the world economy in recent
years.''
	   During her luncheon speech, she said that two-way trade between
her country and Singapore has doubled in the last five years.
	   Britain exported goods worth more than 2 billion pounds (dlrs
3.3 billion) to Singapore last year, placing the small island
republic among its top 20 export markets. Singapore's exports to
Britain exceeded 2.5 billion pounds (dlrs 4.2 billion) in 1997.
	   Beckett noted that Britain remains the largest European investor
in Singapore, with total investments exceeding 5 billion pounds
(dlrs 8.3 billion), though reverse investments only amounted to
about 1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.7 billion).
	   ``I welcome all this, but there is plenty of scope for more in
the U.K.'s direction,'' she said.
	   At an earlier seminar, the minister said her country offers a
world-class research base for potential Singapore investors, while
its new government is committed to long-term policies to strengthen
productivity and the economy in general.
	   Commenting later to reporters on Britain's current account
deficit, she admitted that the strength of the pound may be a
factor in Britain's worsening export performance, but argued that
``it's clearly not just a currency-related matter, but we do
recognize and keep that under review.''

Shinto priests perform rites on Sakhalin 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A group of Shinto priests performed rites on
Russia's Sakhalin Island on Wednesday to commemorate Soviet and
Japanese soldiers who died there during World War II, a news agency
reported.
	   The rites were performed at the site of a Shinto temple
destroyed during Soviet times, the ITAR-Tass agency reported,
citing a regional official.
	   It was the third time that Shinto priests held the ceremony in
honor of the fallen soldiers.
	   The Shinto religion is the former state religion of Japan, which
emphasizes worship of nature and ancient heroes. Its followers also
believe the Japanese emperor is a divine being.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie pledged
Wednesday to withdraw some troops from disputed East Timor and
allow its people greater freedom, said a Nobel peace laureate from
the Indonesian-controlled territory.
	   But Bishop Carlos Belo, who met Habibie at the presidential
palace, said he and Indonesia's new leader skirted a key issue: the
demand of many East Timorese for a vote on independence.
	   ``He supports how to improve first the internal situation,''
Belo said after the 1 1/2-hour meeting. ``The other thing ... maybe
it will come later.''
	   Habibie has ruled out a referendum in the former Portuguese
colony, which was invaded by Indonesian forces in 1975. Instead, he
has offered special status that would grant an undefined measure of
autonomy while keeping East Timor as Indonesia's 27th province.
	   Still, Habibie's decision to meet Belo, a longtime critic of
Indonesia, was a sign of new government openness in the wake of the
May 21 resignation of authoritarian President Suharto.
	   ``He's ready, through his government, to improve the situation
in East Timor,'' Belo said at a news conference. ``Many suggestions
that I presented, he supported them fully.''
	   Belo's proposals included a reduction of Indonesia's heavy
military presence in East Timor and greater freedom of movement for
East Timor's 800,000 people. Habibie, he said, agreed.
	   ``Little by little, they (the Indonesian military) will
withdraw,'' Belo said.
	   Currently, a small band of separatist rebels stages sporadic
hit-and-run attacks on military patrols, and resentment toward
Indonesian authority runs deep among many civilians.
	   In a conciliatory gesture, Habibie has released at least 16 East
Timorese political prisoners and said others will be freed in
stages. But Belo said he and Habibie did not discuss East Timor's
most prominent detainee, jailed rebel Xanana Gusmao.
	   ``He's not the only man of East Timor. We are 800,000,'' Belo
shot back at a reporter who asked about prospects for Gusmao's
freedom. ``Why do you ask about Xanana? Why not all the people?''
	   The guerrilla chief is revered by many East Timorese, who chant
his name at pro-independence rallies in Dili, the capital of the
half-island territory.
	   Habibie has suggested special status for East Timor as well as
freedom for Gusmao in exchange for world recognition of Indonesia's
authority. Portugal, Gusmao and other critics reject the offer,
saying a vote is the only solution.
	   Belo shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 with East Timorese
activist Jose Ramos-Horta for their efforts to bring peace to their
homeland. The bishop is the spiritual leader of East Timor, which
is predominantly Catholic in overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Indonesia would be willing to
grant East Timor some autonomy over education, economic and
cultural affairs. But foreign affairs, security and defense would
be the domain of the national government.
	   Alatas appealed to Portugal and the United Nations, which does
not recognize Indonesian authority in East Timor, to take part in
any discussions on autonomy.

World Cup: Morocco goes out with pride after big win over Scotland 
</HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT ETIENNE, France (AP) _ There was nothing left but the
tears.
	   In the second it took for news of Norway's 2-1 surprising
victory over Brazil to reach a triumphant Moroccan squad, elation
turned to devastation. Though for their best efforts, the Atlas
Lions _ the Arab world's sole remaining hope of success in the
World Cup _ was out.
	   ``I feel sorry for Morocco,'' Scotland's coach Craig Brown said
after Tuesday's match against Morocco. ``To win 3-nothing and fail
to qualify must be a great disappointment.''
	   A major understatement.
	   Striker Abdeljilil ``Camacho'' Hadda broke down in tears as
coach Henri Michel comforted him. Other players cut through scores
of waiting reporters, their silence the most fitting comment for a
match they won, but not early enough to make a difference.
	   It was Morocco's 2-2 draw with Norway in its first match which
cost the team the chance to move to the second round, Michel said.
Though they played a strong offensive game, defensive errors gave
Norway the breaks it needed, including an own-goal gift, courtesy
of midfielder Youssef Chippo.
	   Against Brazil, it was more of the same. Errors coupled with
feeling intimidated led to a 3-0 thrasing by the defending
champions.
	   The players said they wanted to forget that match. Michel did,
too, though he expressed frustration with the team's seemingly
unending series of defensive errors and complaints about feeling
overmatched by both Brazil and Norway.
	   ``I can't take on the role of psychologist,'' he told reporters
after one of the team's training sessions.
	   As it turned out, he didn't need to.
	   It may have been his jaded comments that roused the Lions into
action against Scotland. But more likely, it was the team's desire
to repeat their success in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico where they
qualified for the second round _ making them the first African team
to reach this level in Cup competition.
	   And, doubtless, their shoddy performance in the 1994 World Cup
added some fuel to their fire.
	   ``We trained for this (competition) for three years. To lose
this way is more than disappointing, it's, it's....,'' Rachid
Azzouzi told The Associated Press, finishing the sentence by
shaking his head and looking at the ground.
	   Moroccan fans, outnumbered but not outshouted during the
Scotland match Tuesday, gave voice to their anger. The drums that
pounded for victory, seconds after the match pounded for war.
Ironically, they had been yelling ``Brazil, Brazil'' throughout the
game _ a chant intended to show that Morocco was doing to Scotland
what Brazil had done to them about a week earlier.
	   Later, defender Youssef Rossi summed it up in two sarcastic
words: ``Thanks, Brazil.'' He walked off, silently fuming.
	   Fans fumed more openly.
	   ``To come all this way, to finally show what they (Morocco) can
do, and then to lose despite winning, is a tragedy,'' said
Salaheddine Moustafa, a fan.
	   ``But we came out of this proud _ of the team, of their
accomplishment and of having shown the world that Arab and African
football is something to be taken seriously,'' he said, searching
for something to lessen the disappointment.
	   The Lions may not have won a place in the second round, but
their roar was loud enough to be remembered as one of the
competition's most valiant efforts so far.
	   Coach Michel, thanking the team for its effort, said that
Morocco ``has shown the world that we were playing an excellent
World Cup and deserved to be here.''
	   ``We did our best,'' said midfielder Azzouzi. ``We didn't fail,
we didn't mess this (match) up, and can at least go home proud.''
	   ``We succeeded in proving that Arab and African football is a
rising force,'' he told The Associated Press. ``That's one of the
things we came here to do, and we did it.''

Zeman opens talks on center-left government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The winner of last weekend's
deadlocked early elections, Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman, met
Wednesday with his bitter rival and runner-up, former Premier
Vaclav Klaus, as efforts continued to form a government.
	   President Vaclav Havel asked Zeman on Monday to try and form the
cabinet, a process likely to take several weeks.
	   Both Zeman and Klaus repeatedly have ruled out a ``grand
coalition'' of their center-left and center-right parties.
	   Zeman's Social Democrats gained 74 seats in the new 200-member
parliament, and Klaus' Civic Democratic Party 63.
	   On Wednesday, Klaus again ruled out supporting any government
led by Zeman.
	   ``Two possible candidates for such a government are also
possible candidates for government of a different type,'' Klaus
told Czech radio after the meeting.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a government
coalition, Havel will likely ask Klaus to attempt the same.
	   The deadlock leaves two smaller parties, the Christian Democrats
with 20 seats, and the Freedom Union with 19, in the position of
deciding whether the Czech Republic sticks with liberal rule, or
leans further left.
	   While Zeman seems to prefer a minority two-party government with
the Christian Democrats, their leader Josef Lux fears the Cabinet
could then fall hostage to the old-guard Communists _ the only
other party to get into parliament, but not seen as a viable
coalition partner by any mainstream party.
	   Lux therefore wants Ruml to join a Zeman government. Ruml, who
has deep personal antagonism toward the Social Democrat, rejects
that.
	   While Lux clearly prefers a coalition with Zeman to joining
Klaus, Ruml indicates that an alliance with Klaus' party is just
possible.
	   ``But the Civic Democratic Party will have to change an awful
lot of things before we sit down and talk,'' Ruml said earlier.
	   The controversy goes back to last November, when Ruml accused
Klaus' party of accepting illegal campaign donations.
	   Lux, then vice-premier in the Cabinet, pulled out, saying he
could no longer cooperate with the premier. That effectively broke
up Klaus' coalition and forced his ouster.
	   Zeman is scheduled to meet Lux and Ruml on Thursday, when he
will also inform Havel of progress made.

Egypt will recognize a Palestinian state next year 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt will recognize an independent
Palestinian state once Yasser Arafat declares it next year, Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa was quoted as saying Wednesday.
	   ``Under no circumstances should the Palestinians be deprived of
their legitimate right to declare their state,'' Moussa said in an
interview with the government-run weekly Al-Mussawar.
	   ``We are in the forefront of those who support a Palestinian
state ... and President (Hosni) Mubarak himself will declare our
position at that time,'' he said.
	   Arafat has threatened to declare Palestinian statehood in May
1999, at the end of the five-year interim period of Palestinian
autonomy. Moussa said that Arafat would definitely do so because of
his frustration with the deadlock in peace talks with Israel.
	   ``President Arafat has reached the final limits after which
great harm will be done to both the Palestinian cause and himself
personally,'' Moussa said. ``Arafat is very much aware of this.''
	   Moussa's remarks were the strongest support yet from an Arab
state for a unilateral declaration by Arafat.
	   Moussa also accused Netanyahu's government of attempting to
impose a ``surrender on the Palestinians.''
	   Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979 but already cool relations have deteriorated further
over the stalemate in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

Czar family gravestones won't be nameless, Russian official says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The stones that will mark the graves of Czar
Nicholas II and his family will not be unmarked, the government
official in charge of planning the ceremony said Wednesday.
	   ``The names of them all will be indicated,'' said Viktor
Aksyuchits, an adviser to Vice-Premier Boris Nemtsov, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Some news reports have suggested that the names will not be
inscribed on the crypt to appease the Russian Orthodox Church,
which has expressed lingering doubts about the identities of the
bones.
	   Aksyuchits also denied reports that the grave markers would be
made of wood. He said temporary wooden plaques would be installed
first, to be replaced later with the same Italian marble
gravestones that adorn the tombs of all Russian emperors,
Aksyuchits said.
	   The burial next month in St. Petersburg's Peter and Paul
Cathedral is intended to put to rest one of the most painful
episodes in Russian history, the execution of the czar and his
family by Bolsheviks on July 17, 1918.
	   Originally planned as a grand ceremony that would symbolize a
renewal of Russian nationalism, the burial has since been scaled
back significantly and will be a relatively modest affair.
	   Neither President Boris Yeltsin nor Patriarch Alexei II, the
head of the Russian Orthodox Church, plan to attend. The church has
tried to distance itself from the burial, saying some believers
still doubt the authenticity of the bones despite repeated DNA
testing.

WTO: Nigeria needs major reform to regain international confidence 1300 GMT June 24 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CLARIFIES first and second grafs; EMBARGOED by source until
By PHILIP WALLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Nigeria's footballers may be impressing soccer
fans by reaching the final stages of the World Cup, but major
political and economic reforms are needed to revive international
confidence in the country, said a report out Wednesday.
	   Continuing political uncertainty and weakening respect for the
law in the sprawling West African nation is discouraging foreign
investment and trade, according to the 132-page World Trade
Organization review.
	   The country's oil business, which represents more than 95
percent of Nigeria's export trade and three quarters of government
revenue, is dynamic compared to other parts of the economy.
	   But even this has been hindered by ``inappropriate policies''
contributing to the rundown of oil refineries and causing serious
shortages of petroleum products in the home market, the report
says.
	   Nigeria's new government, led by General Abdulsalam Abubakar,
should reduce import restrictions and implement its proposed
program to privatize state industries, thereby reducing the
economy's dependence on oil, it says.
	   ``Recent steps to increase transparency and accountability in
government, and thus combat allegations of fraud and corruption,
must be pursued,'' it adds.
	   The study says the stability and predictability of Nigeria's
institutions and its opaque constitution remain major concerns and
``increase the risk of doing business'' with the country.
	   Since he took power on June 8, Abubakar has sent mixed messages
to activists and opponents of his late predecessor Sani Abacha.
	   Nigeria's critics have praised Abubakar for releasing a string
of political prisoners who had opposed Abacha's harsh rule.
	   But he has angered Nigeria's political opposition by moving
quickly to quash pro-democracy protests and making only vague
pledges to follow through on Abacha's flawed political transition
program, due to culminate in an Oct. 1 transition to civilian rule.
	   Little in Nigeria functions these days, from the water supply to
the telephones, and crime is rampant.
	   Attempts to use the country's large oil revenue to expand the
economic base ``have been mostly unsuccessful'' and the economy
remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices, the study
adds.
	   It says Migeria, a founding member of the WTO, should try to
reduce its high external debt and prevent arrears accumulating.
	   This would increase its ability to attract much needed foreign
investment outside the oil business.
	   The report acknowledges the military government's efforts to
liberalize Nigeria's foreign exchange and investment regimes and
establish a stable and predictable structure of import tariffs.
	   But it says concerns remain among WTO members about tariff
changes and quantitative import restrictions, saying these should
be eliminated.
	   ``A wide array of export incentive schemes has failed to offset
the anti-export bias resulting from the import regime, cumbersome
export procedures and failing infrastructure,'' says the review.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The European Union is working with the
United States to revive Israel's peace talks with Syria and
Lebanon, the EU's special envoy to the Middle East said Wednesday.
	   The envoy, Miguel Moratinos, said the United States is now
giving more attention to those negotiations.
	   ``A formula must be found to reactivate the Lebanese-Syrian
tracks. ... We are coordinating with the Americans,'' Moratinos
said after meeting Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz.
	   Moratinos arrived Tuesday on the third leg of a Middle East tour
aimed at breaking the deadlock in Arab-Israeli negotiations. He has
visited Syria and Israel and will travel to Egypt.
	   Moratinos, a Spanish diplomat, will also meet with Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri Thursday.
	   Arab states have called for a bigger EU role in the peace talks,
which have been backed largely by the United States since 1991.

Russia supports state of emergency in Chechnya 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Maskhadov comments.
<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Russia's interior minister expressed
support Wednesday for Chechnya's decision to declare a state of
emergency, saying he welcomes any anti-crime measures in the
separatist republic, a news report said.
	   However, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin refused to comment
on whether Chechen leaders had the right to make the declaration
without conferring with Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Some officials, including Russia's chief negotiator with
Chechnya, complained that only the Russian president has the right
to introduce a state of emergency in any of the country's regions,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Even so, negotiator Ivan Rybkin said that Chechnya's move should
be ``regarded with understanding,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov announced the state of
emergency to help Chechen police carry out a campaign against oil
and fuel thieves, said Maskhadov's spokesman, Malbek Vachachayev.
	   In an interview with Interfax, Maskhadov said that the state of
emergency was also intended to help free hostages.
	   ``Some forces, supported by criminal elements, are trying to
threaten the establishment of an independent, legitimate Chechen
state,'' Interfax quoted Maskhadov as saying.
	   ``The upsurge in crime spawned by postwar problems and the
emergence of tens of thousands of homeless and penniless people
have necessitated extraordinary, comprehensive measures.''
	   Chechnya has become a center of violent crime, including rampant
kidnappings and shootings, since the end of its independence war
against Russia two years ago. Its government has not been able to
restore order or rebuild the economy.
	   Maskhadov said the state of emergency was necessary to help
safeguard hundreds of new small businesses, which could generate
jobs for the needy.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent, although the Kremlin
views it as a renegade Russian republic.
	   Maskhadov announced the state of emergency on Tuesday and
imposed a curfew, to be in effect daily from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Unsanctioned rallies and marches were already banned in February.
The state of emergency will last until July 18, Maskhadov's
spokesman said.

Israel launches bone marrow drive to help leukemia patients 
</HEADLINE>
By MASHA HERBST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A nationwide bone marrow drive will be held in
Israel next week to help find a donor for a 44-year-old Israeli
design teacher suffering from leukemia, organizers said Wednesday.
	   Karen Ronnen Rosenberg was diagnosed with the disease in April
and is awaiting word on a possible match in a New York hospital,
said Orly Guttman of the London-based Sue Harris Bone Marrow Trust
that is sponsoring the drive.
	   The chance of finding a match among a patient's siblings is only
30 percent to 35 percent. A large-scale attempt to find bone marrow
donors among people from a similar ethnic background was first held
seven years ago in Israel and the United States.
	   At the time, 50,000 volunteers submitted to testing, and a U.S.
donor eventually was found for New Jersey leukemia patient Jay
Feinberg.
	   The current drive, which is to begin Monday, is the third to be
held in Israel, with organizers hoping that 3,500 to 4,000
volunteers will respond. Participants will be asked to undergo a
blood test.
	   All those tested will have their names entered into a worldwide
registry so that if they don't match a patient immediately, they
may be able to help a patient in the future.
	   In Israel, about 80 other patients are awaiting bone marrow
transplants.

Two-month old bear caught, to be returned to Italian diplomat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A two-month-old bear owned by an Italian
diplomat has been found three weeks after he fled the envoy's home
to prowl Zagreb, the manager of the city zoo said Wednesday.
	   Djuro, who weighs 15 kilos (33 pounds) and is less than a meter
(three feet) tall, is now at Zagreb zoo with his mother, undergoing
medical examination, said zoo manager Mladen Anic.
	   He will then be returned to his owner, Biaggio Sottile,
chancellor of the Italian embassy in Croatia, the Vecernji List
daily said, quoting Sottile as saying: ``I'll give him more
attention from now on.''
	   The zoo gave the bear to Sottile, who is said to be fond of wild
animals and reportedly already owns a lion, a puma and another bear
from missions in other countries.
	   Three weeks ago, Djuro managed to break the chain he was tied
with in the diplomat's garden. His prowls through Zagreb prompted
several panicked residents to call police.
	   The hunt for Djuro ended Tuesday, when he was spotted in the
residential district of Pantovcak, and caught after being hit with
a sedative bullet.
	   Vecernji List said Djuro was actually found on a tree in woods
surrounding the Pantovcak palace of President Franjo Tudjman.

World Cup: Norway's win reflected in betting 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British bookmaker Ladbrokes slashed the odds on
Norway winning the World Cup from 150-1 to 25-1 Wednesday.
	   Norway's thrilling 2-1 win over Brazil on Tuesday meant the end
of the road for Morocco and Scotland, which both failed to qualify
for the second round of the finals.
	   The loss did not do Brazil's odds any harm, remaining 11-4
favorites to win the tournament.
	   France, which plays Denmark Wednesday, moved into second
favorite at 5-1 followed by Argentina and the Netherlands, both
countries rated a 6-1 chance of winning the tournament.
	   Germany is rated a 7-1 chance, Italy 8-1 while England's loss to
Romania on Monday saw its odds fall from 8-1 to 20-1.
	   Romania, Yugoslavia and Nigeria are all 20-1 in the betting.

Iraq, Iran sign pact to resolve POW issue 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Iran have signed a deal that Iraq
says will resolve their longstanding dispute over prisoners of war.
	   The agreement was reached following a week of talks in Baghdad
between senior Iraqi officials and a visiting Iranian delegation
headed by Abdullah al-Najafi, head of Iran's POW commission, the
official Iraqi News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   But the agency gave no further details and al-Najafi, who left
Baghdad on Wednesday, declined to comment.
	   Al-Najafi arrived in Baghdad last week with a list of thousands
of Iranian POWs Tehran claims are still held by Iraq.
	   Iraq has long maintained that it has released all Iranian
prisoners and was reportedly angered by the new list.
	   In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three
POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees.
	   It was the largest repatriation of Iranian and Iraqi POWs since
1990, said the International Committee of the Red Cross, which
supervised the swap. The Red Cross says it knows of several
thousand Iraqis in Iran, but it is not aware of more Iranian POWs
in Iraq.
	   The Iran-Iraq war, in which more than more than 1 million people
were killed or wounded, ended in 1988.
	   The issue of POWs has long stood in the way of better ties.

Coast guard comes under fire from suspected smugglers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CORFU, Greece (AP) _ Two gunmen in an inflatable raft opened
fire on a coast guard vessel that apparently foiled a smuggling run
from nearby Albania, officials said Wednesday.
	   The raft was hit in the late Tuesday shootout and the two
occupants escaped after swimming to the Albanian shore. No one on
the Greek vessel was injured.
	   Coast guard officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
officers intercepted the small raft in the narrow straits
separating the northwestern island of Corfu from Albania, which is
frequently used by smugglers bringing weapons or illegal immigrants
into Greece.
	   Smuggling has been common for years across the straits, but the
coast guard increased patrols after Albania fell into lawlessness
last year.

Eds: Leads with 8 grafs to UPDATE with new Baghdad demand of
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq is challenging a report by a U.S.
laboratory that says traces of deadly VX nerve gas were found on
Iraqi missile warheads, saying the finding must be verified by
independent analysis.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, was scheduled
to brief the Security Council Wednesday on the analysis by the U.S.
Army laboratory at Aberdeen, Maryland.
	   Diplomatic sources said the lab reported finding traces of VX
and a stabilizer on shards of Iraqi warheads, despite Iraq's claims
that it never succeeded in transforming the deadly nerve agent into
a weapon.
	   If true, the finding could undermine efforts by Russia, France
and China to close the seven-year inspection program and lift
crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after
President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   ``If this allegation is correct ... that will set back Iraq's
efforts to try to lift sanctions,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson
said Tuesday. ``It shows that they've been concealing, they've been
lying, and it calls into question their commitment to
disarmament.''
	   In a statement published Wednesday in Baghdad, Saddam and other
Iraqi leaders demanded sanctions be lifted immediately. If not,
they warned they would reconsider relations with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The statement did not mention the VX findings, although the
official Iraqi News Agency dismissed them as ``baseless and mere
fabrications.''
	   Iraq's U.N. mission said in a statement Tuesday that Baghdad
rejects the results, adding they ``cannot be accurate since VX was
not used in any kind of munitions in Iraq due to continuous
production failure.''

Adultery no longer a crime in Turkey - at least for now 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Adultery is no longer a crime in Turkey,
at least until lawmakers agree on equal punishment for men and
women.
	   The Constitutional Court on Tuesday struck down a law regulating
adultery for women a year after it voided a law for male
adulterers, court officials said.
	   Under the old law, a married woman faced between six months and
three years in prison if caught with a man other than her husband.
A man would receive the same punishment only if he was in a long
term adulterous relationship.
	   The Court had annulled the male adultery law after complaints
that it was biased in favor of men and gave Parliament a year to
pass a new law, with equal punishment.
	   With no law passed, the court struck down the regulations on
female adultery.
	   Under the proposed legislation before parliament, male and
female adulterers would face up to two years in prison.

Final day of campaigning for Northern Ireland's most important election 
</HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant and Catholic
politicians spent a final frenetic day Wednesday scrambling for
votes before Northern Ireland selects its new cross-community
government, the most important election in the history of this
British-ruled territory.
	   Thursday's vote will determine how many seats each party holds
in a 108-member legislative Assembly, which would then appoint a
compromise multi-party administration.
	   If it works, Northern Ireland will largely govern its own
affairs for the first time since the British government imposed
``direct rule'' from London in 1972.
	   Results from the 18 six-seat constituencies will start coming in
Friday, but may not be completed until Saturday.
	   Crucially, decisions in the Assembly _ the bedrock of the peace
agreement struck in April _ will require majority support from both
its British Protestant and Irish Catholic blocs.
	   That ``double majority'' requirement, while ensuring that
neither side can impose sectarian policies on the other, also makes
the Assembly vulnerable to obstruction by Protestant politicians
opposed to implementing the agreement.
	   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble will be the favorite
to head the administration, if his Protestant party maintains its
traditional No. 1 position in Northern Ireland.
	   But the Protestant house is badly divided among a half-dozen
parties, two of whom vociferously oppose the agreement and are
hoping to win enough seats to veto progress. A half-dozen of
Trimble's own Ulster Unionist candidates say they support the
so-called ``wreckers'' led by Ian Paisley.
	   John Hume, leader of the north's traditional top Catholic
vote-getter, the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, has an
outside chance to end up on top for the first time in history.
Credited as a primary architect of the successful negotiations,
Hume predicted that voters would back the SDLP ``in record
numbers.''
	   Most Protestant politicians' greatest complaint is the prospect
of having to cooperate with the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, Hume's
militant rival for Catholic votes. Sinn Fein's support has been
growing steadily and the party already is staking a claim to two of
the 12 seats in the new administration.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, in his election eve appeal, called
on voters to back Sinn Fein in preference to Hume's SDLP, which
opposed the Irish Republican Army throughout its 28-year campaign
of violence.
	   ``The bigger our mandate, the better the deal'' for Catholics,
Adams said.
	   According to the peace plan, the Assembly would gradually take
control of six departments, ranging from education to economic
development, under direct British government control since 1972.
	   That year, the government abolished Northern Ireland's original
parliament, which the Ulster Unionists had run as a one-party
monolith since 1921. An attempt to share power between moderate
Protestant and Catholic politicians collapsed in 1974 under the
combined weight of a Protestant general strike and IRA violence.

Arafat says he considers Cabinet as having resigned 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
indicated for the first time Wednesday that he has accepted the
resignation of most of his Cabinet _ submitted nearly a year ago
amid allegations of widespread corruption.
	   In a letter to the Palestinian legislative council, Arafat
referred to the group of ministers as ``a Cabinet that has
resigned,'' said legislator Marwan Barghouti.
	   In the letter, Arafat requested and was given another two weeks
to form a new Cabinet, Barghouti said.
	   The legislators initially had set Thursday as a deadline for
Arafat to complete the reshuffle. The council has threatened to
vote on a motion of no-confidence in the government unless Arafat
presented a new Cabinet quickly.
	   Last August, 16 of 18 Cabinet ministers had submitted their
resignations to Arafat following reports of corruption in
government ministries. Arafat never said whether he accepted the
resignation and the makeup of the Cabinet remained largely the
same.

World Cup: Danish fans show positive face of soccer supporters 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ They drink beer, fanatically follow their
national team and gather in boisterous, chanting crowds, but these
fans are Roligans not hooligans and instead of blighting
tournaments, they light them up.
	   The rowdy, smiling, Danish fans _ along with Scotland's
good-natured ``tartan army'' _ are a stark contrast to the British
and German thugs who terrorized parts of Marseille and Lens in
separate incidents earlier in the World Cup.
	   The banks of the River Rhone were awash with red and white
Thursday as Denmark's Roligans hit town to party, sing, drink, and
_ if they get the time _ watch a World Cup soccer match.
	   ``For us, the party around the game is more important than the
game,'' said Jens Andresen, a 26-year-old accountant from
Copenhagen.
	   ``We want to drink some beer, enjoy life, go to the game and
meet other people. Of course the result is important, but it is not
the most important thing.''
	   That is the Scottish attitude too _ not surprising for a team
that has never qualified for the second round of a World Cup in
eight appearances.
	   Denmark also has little World Cup pedigree, although it did win
the 1992 European Championships.
	   ``We have a sense of humor,'' said Birgit Svendsen, a female
Roligan soaking up the sun _ and some beer _ ahead of Denmark's
final Group C match, against France on Wednesday.
	   Danish sports writers coined the term Roligan in the 1980s as a
contrast to England's hooligans. ``Rolig'' is Danish for quiet and
orderly.
	   Roligans are far from quiet. In Lyon on Tuesday night, knots of
chanting, laughing Danish fans drifted through downtown greeting
fellow Roligans at sidewalk cafe tables.
	   ``We are not always happy. Not when we lose,'' said Svendsen,
40, who traveled with a group of friends from the Danish town of
Randers to be at Wednesday's match. ``But we do not go crazy like
the English. Football is a sport, not a military exercise.''
	   That kind of positive attitude has earned the Roligans
international recognition. In September 1985, they became the first
soccer fans to be awarded UNESCO's Fair Play diploma for loyal and
sportsmanlike behavior.
	   The Roligans first came to international attention when some
20,000 Danes traveled from venue to venue in France during the 1984
European Championship finals. They earned a reputation for untiring
high spirits and nonviolence, even when the Danes lost to Spain in
the semifinal.
	   And this summer in France, they're at it again.
	   In Toulouse last week before the kickoff of Denmark's match with
South Africa, the French band cut the Danish national anthem short
_ the Roligans didn't miss a beat and just kept on singing a
capella.
	   In Lyon, Andresen was sporting classic Roligan headgear _ the
``clap hat,'' a baseball cap with hands that could be clapped by
pulling a string.
	   His friend, Rasmus Federsen, 26, a sergeant in the Danish army,
was wearing a Dr. Seuss-style floppy top hat emblazoned with the
Danish flag.
	   In a country where equality reigns, there is a large female
contingent in Roligan groups and the fans come from all strata of
society.
	   ``Maybe that's why we're so peaceful,'' Svendsen said. ``Women
are a calming influence.''

World Cup: Belgium and South Korea both desperate for win 
</HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Belgium and South Korea are heading into their
World Cup contest Thursday on the verge of desperation.
	   Third in the Group E standings after draws with against Mexico
and the Netherlands, Belgium must beat South Korea to keep its
second round hopes alive.
	   Though already eliminated from the tournament, South Korea is
desperately hanging on to its last chance of making up for a dismal
France 98 campaign by posting its first win in six World Cup
appearances _ its last opportunity before co-hosting the next World
Cup with Japan.
	   ``We decided when we got here to get one win before we return to
Korea,'' said Kim Pyung-seok, promoted to coach after Cha Bum-kun
was fired for the team's poor World Cup performance. ``Thursday is
our last chance.''
	   South Korea opened its World Cup with a bitter 3-1 defeat at the
hands of Mexico, before losing 5-0 to the Netherlands last
Saturday, prompting team officials to fire Cha.
	   Belgium's disastrous draw with Mexico last Saturday _ when its
opponents came back from a 2-0 deficit _ coupled with the
Netherlands' victory over South Korea the same night, left Mexico
and the Netherlands with four points apiece in Group E. Belgium has
two points and the Koreans are pointless.
	   The Netherlands face Mexico on Thursday in the other Group E
match.
	   ``This is what the whole World Cup comes down to for us,'' said
Belgium's coach Georges Leekens.
	   Both teams will enter the final showdown short-handed.
	   South Korea is again without star striker Hwang Sun-hong, one of
the nation's most prolific scorers with 43 goals in 74
international matches. Hwang suffered a knee injury just prior to
the tournament after being tackled in an exhibition match against
China.
	   Belgium is without winger Danny Boffin, out with a knee injury.
First-choice goalkeeper Filip De Wilde and team captain Franky Van
der Elst are also uncertain.
	   De Wilde has a pain in a buttock muscle, and ``every time he
goes up for a high cross, he doesn't feel good,'' Leekens said.
	   The coach explained that Van der Elst has been unwell since
playing against Mexico in temperatures of 37 Celsius (97
Fahrenheit).
	   Even a win may not necessarily secure Belgium a place in the
second round.
	   If the Netherlands and Mexico draw, a Belgian victory would
leave all three teams with five points. In such a case, Belgium
would probably need to defeat South Korea by a margin of at least
three goals to go through.
	   But a victory would lock up a place in the next round for
Belgium if either the Dutch or Mexicans win their match in
Saint-Etienne.

Japan keeps protesters away from disputed islands because of reported leak; two returning

Eds: UPDATES with protest ships standing off islands, one unmanned
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A protest boat from Hong Kong twice entered waters
claimed by Japan around a group of disputed islands Wednesday and
its occupants then abandoned ship, reporting a leak, Japan's coast
guard said.
	   The drifting, unmanned 100-ton trawler was one of four protest
ships from Taiwan and Hong Kong staying just outside Japanese
waters as of 8 p.m. (1100 GMT), said a coast guard official. Two
others were heading back to Taiwan, he added.
	   All but one of the 25 activists and crew members from the
trawler Diaoyutai went aboard other ships from Taiwan, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   A Japanese patrol boat picked up the remaining one, and the
coast guard was consulting with immigration officials about how to
return him home, the official said.
	   The six protest ships were making the latest in a series of
efforts to land on the uninhabited, Japanese-controlled islands to
dramatize claims to them by China and Taiwan. Protesters hoped to
plant a Chinese flag on one of the islands, expedition leader
Albert Ho has said.
	   ``We are prepared to respond appropriately to any illegal
entry,'' said Akira Suzuki, spokesman of the Okinawa regional
headquarters of the coast guard, known as the Maritime Safety
Agency.
	   The official who reported the latest activity said the agency
did not know how many protesters were aboard the protest ships.
	   He also declined to say how many Japanese patrol boats were
keeping watch around the islands, about 220 kilometers (136 miles)
northeast of Taipei in the East China Sea.
	   Kyodo News agency said about 50 were in the area.
	   The official said the Diaoyutai entered Japanese territorial
waters for periods of 17 minutes and slightly more than an hour,
with Japanese patrols asking it to leave each time.
	   The islands are known as Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in
Japanese.
	   Two years ago, a Hong Kong activist jumped overboard and drowned
on a similar expedition when Japanese coast guard vessels kept him
from landing on the islands.
	   On a later protest expedition, several activists from Taiwan and
Hong Kong succeeded in planting a flag briefly on one of the
islands.
	   Also, in May 1997, the coast guard prevented Japanese right-wing
activists from reaching one of the islands, where they have built
two lighthouses. One of the lighthouses later was reportedly
knocked down by a storm.

	   On Tuesday, supporters of both Eyadema and Olympio had claimed
victory.
	   But late Tuesday, Awa Nana, the president of national electoral
commission, resigned, saying she had been intimidated and harassed.
	   It was not immediately clear who was harassing her.
	   Sunday's vote was the first round of the presidential elections.
Any candidate who wins more than 50 percent automatically becomes
president. Otherwise, the two top vote-getters face off in the
second round.
	   Olympio, while the best known of Eyadema's five challengers, had
not been expected to reach the second round.
	   The son of Togo's first president _ who was killed in 1963 by a
military junta led by Eyadema _ Olympio fled to Ghana last year
after a series of attempts on his life, including one in 1992 that
seriously wounded him. It was not clear whether he returned to Togo
for the election.
	   Eyadema ruled this tiny French-speaking country wedged between
Ghana and Benin as a military dictator for 26 years, until he won
widely criticized elections in 1993.
	   In this campaign, the president relegated opposition candidates
to occasional slices of television and radio time.

Government criticized for exporting arms to 35 nations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An independent research group accused the
government Wednesday of selling arms to countries that might use
them for repression or aggression, in apparent violation of its
``ethical'' foreign policy guidelines.
	   According to a report by Saferworld, the government approved
2,181 licenses for British companies to export arms to 35 nations
of ``concern'' in the past year, including India, Pakistan,
Indonesia, China, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia. Only 24 applications
were refused, it said.
	   While some exports are legitimate, the foreign affairs think
tank said some appear to be at odds with government guidelines
adopted after the Labor Party swept to power in May 1997.
	   As part of Labor's new ethical foreign policy, which made human
rights a central plank, the government announced stricter criteria
last July aimed at halting arms sales to regimes that might used
weapons ``for internal repression or international aggression.''
Sales were not banned to any specific country.
	   The government, which is expected to publish its first annual
report of arms exports next month, stressed that each application
was dealt with on its own merits _ ``irrespective of destination.''
	   Cases were reviewed if there was a ``clearly identifiable risk
of repression or aggression,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said,
speaking with customary anonymity.
	   Saferworld's study was based on an analysis of information that
surfaced recently in the House of Commons in response to concerns
voiced by Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies
Campbell.
	   The lawmaker told BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday that Britain is
exporting arms to countries ``where there is concern about human
rights, about the abuse of power by governments, about repression,
about torture _ generally about the kind of behavior that is not
appropriate in civilized countries in the last part of this
century.''
	   Campbell condemned the 535 licenses granted for arms exports to
India between May 1 and May 10 this year, just before it conducted
five nuclear tests. And he criticized 15 export licenses granted to
Indonesia between March and May this year, saying they were
approved at ``a time of political, social and economic turmoil.''
	   ``We are clearly fueling an arms race ourselves,'' Campbell
said.
	   According to the Saferworld report:
	   _Thirty-six export licenses have been granted for China,
currently the subject of a European Union arms embargo.
	   _ Small arms and machine guns have been allowed to go to
Bahrain, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Turkey, Uganda, Yemen,
Zambia and Zimbabwe despite a government guideline that licenses
will not be granted if there is a ``clearly identifiable risk''
that the proposed export might be used for internal repression.
	   _Tanks have been licensed for sale to India and Pakistan, which
have fought three wars over Kashmir.
	   _Combat aircraft have been licensed to Eritrea, currently at war
with Ethiopia.

Philippines finance minister-designate outlines privatization plans 
</HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Philippines' postal service, airports,
seaports, roads and bridges are targets for privatization to earn
revenue and improve efficiency, the country's finance
minister-designate, Edgardo B. Espiritu, said Wednesday.
	   ``We will concentrate on government corporations rather than on
government lands and real property,'' Espiritu told the Business
Week Asia Leadership Forum. ``Privatization, particularly in the
case of entities providing basic services, will bring not only cash
proceeds but also improvements in efficiency.''
	   The extra money would be used to finance development, said
Espiritu, who also outlined a refocus of anti-poverty programs
toward more market-driven job creation.
	   ``The government is committed to the full privatization of the
power sector; hopefully, within a year,'' Espiritu said.
	   He said the administration of President Joseph Estrada, who
takes office June 30, will also look seriously at a constitutional
amendment to relax the ban on foreign ownership of land.
	   The government will ``move toward further liberalization of
foreign equity investments in certain areas, such as, within the
immediate future, in retail trade,'' he said. Pension and mutual
funds will be reformed, and there will be a faster liberalization
of the insurance, finance and investment business as well as
banking.
	   ``What may be considered the distinctive feature of the Estrada
administration's economic agenda is its emphasis on programs that
directly attack the problem of poverty,'' Espiritu said. ``The
objective here is not income or wealth distribution per se, but the
significant reduction of poverty.''
	   He said, ``The chief means of attacking poverty will be job
creation through an expanding business sector ... . ''
	   Noting that wasteful, short-term, fiscally burdensome programs
would actually be ``anti-poor in the long run,'' Espiritu said the
programs will be focused, fiscally disciplined and easily monitored
for concrete results.
	   Espiritu also said that high interest rates, encouraged by the
International Monetary Fund as a way to support currencies during
crises, need to go back to the 14 percent level of last July, just
before the Southeast Asian currency devaluations began.
	   ``One year is too long to protect the currency when all the
businessmen are ready to go on strike and to close shop,'' Estrada
said.
	   The interest rate is at 15.5 percent, taking into account a 1.5
percent spread over 91-day treasury bills, he said. Rates had gone
as high as 34 percent during the past year.
	   ``It's still high, but we aim to bring this down even further,''
Espiritu said. ``Our objective is to bring this down to the July
(1997) level of 14 percent. If we bring it down to that level,
we'll be OK.''
	   He declined to comment on when that would be achieved.

EU sues France over EU birds law 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission launched two
court cases against France Wednesday for violating a 1979 EU wild
birds habitats law.
	   In one case, it wants a fine of dlrs 116,050 for each day France
continues to ignore that legislation.
	   The EU head office charges France ignores opening and closing
dates of the hunting season ``thereby failing to protect migrating
and nesting birds,'' said EU spokesman Peter Jorgensen.
	   The second case is a repeat offense: France must yet comply with
a 1988 EU court to respect other aspects of the habitats
legislation, Jorgensen said.
	   The European Commission wants the EU high court to fine France
105,500 European currency units (dlrs 116,050) a day for each day
it continues to ignore the 1988 ruling.
	   Under the EU treaty, the Commission can ask the EU court to fine
governments that flout the court's rulings. Jorgensen said ``the
point was not to enrich the coffers of the European Union'' but to
force member states to comply with laws they themselves helped
enact.
	   He added the Commission considers hunting ``a legitimate
activity.'' But in France, the hunting season for water birds is
set annually by the government and the length of the season
fluctuates from one region to the next.
	   EU law sets no hunting season dates but requires governments to
respect specific conservation requirements. France fails these
norms because of how it sets its hunting seasons, said Jorgensen.
	   The EU's Wild Birds Directive was unanimously adopted in 1979
when France had the EU presidency. It is the ``oldest piece of
nature conservation legislation (creating) a comprehensive scheme
of protection for the Union's wild birds,'' the Commission said in
a statement.

World Cup: new action taken against German soccer violence 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES final grafs with English fan's condition improving
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities fighting World Cup violence
have placed two Germans under formal investigation, a step shy of
charging them with beating a police officer into a coma in northern
France.
	   The men have denied the allegations stemming from a clash after
Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia match in Lens, just southwest of Lille.
Three others were given one-year jail terms.
	   Scores of fans and police officers have been injured in violence
in French cities hosting the five-week soccer championship that
began June 10.
	   More than 250 people have been arrested; some have been
sentenced to jail terms or deported. An English fan has been
hospitalized in critical condition.
	   As a result, tighter security, alcohol restrictions and early
bar closings have been planned for some matches, including
Germany-Iran in Montpellier on Thursday and England-Colombia in
Lens on Friday.
	   The Germans placed under formal investigation Tuesday night were
Markus Warnecke, 27, owner of a tattoo shop and body-piercing
parlor in Hanover, and Steffen Karl Elschner, 26, a record salesman
from Braunschweig.
	   Warnecke, who was ordered to remain in jail, has refused to talk
to police, said his lawyer, Bertrand Wambeke.
	   He was described as a high-school graduate from a well-off
family. He sometimes worked as a bouncer in a red-light district
club in Hanover.
	   Police also were questioning a 17-year-old Austrian they believe
may have taken photos of the attack on the policeman and sold them
to the German press, French radio reported Wednesday. The Austrian
was being detained, though it wasn't clear what crime, if any, he
was being accused of.
	   The policeman, 43-year-old Daniel Nivel, remained hospitalized
in Lille, where doctors on Wednesday said his condition was stable.
	   ``He is still in a serious coma and on a respirator,'' a morning
medical bulletin said. He was to undergo a brain scan later in the
day.
	   In Germany, various donation campaigns have been started to help
the family of the policeman, among them one by Berlin police, by
Bavarian businessmen, and by the ARD broadcast network.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon.
	   In Toulouse, meanwhile, an English fan stabbed in the stomach
and lungs by a local attacker was improving Wednesday after being
reported in ``very serious condition'' a day earlier.
	   The status of Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge, West
Midlands, was ``more reassuring,'' a terse hospital statement said
Wednesday. It did not list his precise condition but said he
remained in intensive care because of ``the extent of the treatment
carried out.''
	   Clarke's attacker remained at large.

EU sues France over EU insurance law violations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission took France to
court Wednesday for breaching EU laws on the sale of insurance
policies.
	   ``The French authorities continue to require insurance companies
to file an information sheet before new policies are placed on the
market,'' the Commission said in a statement. It said this
``violates the directives liberalizing insurance services.''
	   Two 1994 laws _ covering life and non-life insurance policies _
prohibit EU states from requiring prior approval or systematic
notification of general and special policy conditions.
	   French rules pre-dating the European laws force insurers to give
this prior notice before launching new insurance products, the
Commission said.

Blair has conversation with Nigerian leader 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke by telephone
Wednesday with Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, and the government announced that it was sending a
minister to Nigeria this week to pursue contacts.
	   Blair raised concerns about human rights abuses, political
prisoners and the need to establish democracy, according to a
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd will visit Nigeria later this
week as a representative of the European Union, the Foreign Office
said.
	   It will be the first visit to Nigeria by a British government
minister since 1996, when Britain was part of a Commonwealth
delegation.
	   ``Following contact with Gen. Abubakar, the prime minister has
asked Tony Lloyd to visit Nigeria later this week as the Presidency
representative. The purpose of the visit will be to make contact
with Gen. Abubakar, to hear about his plans for the political
process in Nigeria and to encourage moves towards democracy,'' said
a written statement released by the Foreign Office.

</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes from Fischer, Central Bank deputy's
AP Photos MOSB102-103
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Premier Sergei Kiriyenko submitted his new
austerity plan to the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday in
the hope it would earn Russia enough new lending to finance an
economic recovery.
	   The IMF's first deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer, told
The Associated Press that fund analysts will need several weeks to
study the plan.
	   ``We have read the headlines, we've read the speeches, we got
descriptions of the measures,'' he said as he prepared to depart
the country. ``Precisely what they will amount to in terms of the
budget we will have to discuss.''
	   However, Fischer said that in the meantime he will recommend
that the fund release the latest, dlrs 670 million installment of
an existing loan that was held up last week to press Russia to meet
the IMF's criteria.
	   Noting that any bailout would be ``negotiated very hard,'' he
noted with satisfaction that Russian officials seemed at last ready
to tackle the very tough problems plaguing the economy.
	   ``We have one criterion,'' Fischer said. ``We don't have any
possibility of doing this again.''
	   Kiriyenko detailed his austerity plan to the Cabinet and
parliament on Tuesday. The measures are designed to do largely what
the IMF has demanded: cut government spending, boost tax
collections, and tighten control over customs and tax authorities.
	   Russia has been taking such measures already, but the IMF has
said the cuts did not go deep enough, and tax collections have
failed to raise government revenues enough. The international
lender has insisted that the country do more or it will not qualify
for the dlrs 10 to 15 billion bailout they are asking for.
	   Fischer told The AP that in his view, Russia's chronic tax
collection problem is the biggest obstacle to a new loan. He said
that the country's biggest companies, especially oil companies, are
the greatest tax evaders.
	   But Russia will have to do more than just crack down on large
firms. It will also have to force average Russians to become
taxpayers, he said.
	   The country has no tax-paying tradition, and officials have said
that fewer than 5 million of the country's 147 million residents
filed income tax forms last year.
	   Kiriyenko has said the IMF loan is needed to replenish the
Central Bank's reserves, to back up Russian bonds and prevent a run
on the national currency, the ruble.
	   The Kremlin fears that devaluation of the ruble could lead to
higher consumer prices and social unrest. Sergei Alexashenko, the
first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, reiterated the bank's
opposition to any devaluation on Wednesday, saying it wouldn't help
a single problem in the economy.
	   Russia's economy has been troubled since the beginning of the
year, when it began losing ground after posting its first growth of
the post-Soviet period last year. Stocks have collapsed to about
half their value.
	   Parts of the program _ big cuts in the government work force, a
revamped tax code _ are certain to run into strong resistance in
the Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of parliament.
	   Kiriyenko has asked parliament to pass the necessary legislation
to implement the plan before it recesses on July 3 for more than
two months. But even pro-government deputies say the legislature
was unlikely to act with such dispatch.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said that his faction
would insist on seeing every document that the government had shown
to the IMF to ensure that Russia would not be saddled with
unacceptable conditions.

Hundreds of thousands Securitate files destroyed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, an
intelligence officer admitted that some 300,000 files of Romania's
feared communist secret police have been destroyed, media reported
Wednesday.
	   Mircea Gheordunescu, deputy director of the Romanian Information
Service, told Parliament Tuesday that 270,000 Securitate files were
burned between 1971 and 1979, Cotidianul daily reported.
	   A further 27,000 files were burnt by Securitate officers
immediately after the 1989 revolt, he said. The Romanian
Information Service succeeded the communist-era Securitate
following the revolution.
	   The files destroyed between 1971 and 1979 documented movements
of Communist Party Securitate collaborators and informers who died
in that period.
	   Romanians are still preoccupied with the Securitate. Over the
last two weeks, several prominent politicians including Health
Minister Francisc Baranyi were exposed as collaborators of the
former secret police controlled by late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   The statement by Gheordunescu marks the first time that a
government officious has begun to confront this dark part of
Romania's past. Previous intelligence officers have tried to
confound and mystify matters in good Securitate fashion.
	   According to Romanian intelligence reports, there are still
100,000 Securitate informers living in Romania. An additional 125
million pages of files are still locked away in the vaults of the
Romanian Information Service.

Small protest as German chancellor gets honorary degree at Cambridge 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with Kohl declining to wear velvet bonnet
<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) _ Cambridge University awarded an
honorary doctorate to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at ceremonies
Wednesday which were marked by a small protest.
	   The university also awarded honorary degrees to Aung San Suu
Kyi, the pro-democracy leader in Myanmar who was honored in
absentia; Professor RIta Levi-Motalcini of Italy, who won the Nobel
Prize for medicine in 1986, and Natalie Zemon Davis, professor
emeritus of history at Princeton University.
	   Kohl broke with ceremony by declining to wear the black velvet
bonnet signifying the degree.
	   ``It was quite hot in there and Mr. Kohl held the bonnet in his
hand _ but he knew about the meaning of the hat,'' said a
spokesman. ``He was very pleased with the ceremony.''
	   The robes and bonnet were specially made for the chancellor and
although he was not obliged to wear the headgear, recipients of the
honour traditionally put it on.
	   There had been controversy over the award to Kohl, and in
February the university canceled plans for a degree. It changed its
mind when faculty members voted overwhelmingly in his favor.
	   ``We thought we would show Mr. Kohl that he is in a position to
score some good goals by canceling the debts of the Third World,''
said Penny Pereira, 21, one of the eight protesters at Wednesday's
ceremony.
	   Dissenting academics gave out leaflets to around 200 people
arriving for the ceremony. Ulrika Ryblack, an assistant history
lecturer from St. John's College, said ``there is a general
consensus of opinion that honorary degrees should not be given to
serving politicians.''
	   The university dropped Kohl from the list of honorees in
February, after 11 faculty members objected. But 52 faculty members
then signed a petition backing an honorary degree for Kohl, and the
issue was put to a vote of the entire faculty.
	   The honorary doctorate was supported by 1,089 while 321 voted
against.

Prostitute accused of killing Viagra-taking client in Taiwan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A prostitute confessed Wednesday to
killing a 70-year-old client, saying she could not bear his
excessive sexual demands after he took two tablets of the impotence
drug Viagra, police said.
	   Police said they arrested Hsieh Hui-ling, 31, early Wednesday at
her home in Taipei after she confessed to stabbing Hsiao Ke-chun 13
times with a knife at a hotel two days earlier.
	   Police quoted Hsieh as saying Hsiao choked her and beat her at
the hotel after she rejected his request to have sex for a second
time.
	   Hsiao had been her regular customer since she became a
prostitute six months ago because her husband earned little as a
house guard, police quoted her as saying.
	   The United Evening News quoted Hsieh as saying Hsiao had bought
four Viagra tablets on the black market for 6,000 Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 170), and she had warned him earlier about the drug's
possible side effects.
	   ``He turned into a different man and was unusually excited''
after taking the drug, the newspaper quoted her as saying.
	   Taiwan has yet to approve the marketing of Viagra, but doctors
say the impotence drug has been smuggled in and sold for exorbitant
profits.

World Cup: Belgium and South Korea both desperate for win BULMAN 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Corrects Korean appearances in third paragraphBy ERICA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Belgium and South Korea are heading into their
World Cup contest Thursday on the verge of desperation.
	   Third in the Group E standings after draws with against Mexico
and the Netherlands, Belgium must beat South Korea to keep its
second round hopes alive.
	   Though already eliminated from the tournament, South Korea is
desperately hanging on to its last chance of making up for a dismal
France 98 campaign by posting its first win in five World Cup
appearances _ its last opportunity before co-hosting the next World
Cup with Japan.
	   ``We decided when we got here to get one win before we return to
Korea,'' said Kim Pyung-seok, promoted to coach after Cha Bum-kun
was fired for the team's poor World Cup performance. ``Thursday is
our last chance.''
	   South Korea opened its World Cup with a bitter 3-1 defeat at the
hands of Mexico, before losing 5-0 to the Netherlands last
Saturday, prompting team officials to fire Cha.
	   Belgium's disastrous draw with Mexico last Saturday _ when its
opponents came back from a 2-0 deficit _ coupled with the
Netherlands' victory over South Korea the same night, left Mexico
and the Netherlands with four points apiece in Group E. Belgium has
two points and the Koreans are pointless.
	   The Netherlands face Mexico on Thursday in the other Group E
match.
	   ``This is what the whole World Cup comes down to for us,'' said
Belgium's coach Georges Leekens.
	   Both teams will enter the final showdown short-handed.
	   South Korea is again without star striker Hwang Sun-hong, one of
the nation's most prolific scorers with 43 goals in 74
international matches. Hwang suffered a knee injury just prior to
the tournament after being tackled in an exhibition match against
China.
	   Belgium is without winger Danny Boffin, out with a knee injury.
First-choice goalkeeper Filip De Wilde and team captain Franky Van
der Elst are also uncertain.
	   De Wilde has a pain in a buttock muscle, and ``every time he
goes up for a high cross, he doesn't feel good,'' Leekens said.
	   The coach explained that Van der Elst has been unwell since
playing against Mexico in temperatures of 37 Celsius (97
Fahrenheit).
	   Even a win may not necessarily secure Belgium a place in the
second round.
	   If the Netherlands and Mexico draw, a Belgian victory would
leave all three teams with five points. In such a case, Belgium
would probably need to defeat South Korea by a margin of at least
three goals to go through.
	   But a victory would lock up a place in the next round for
Belgium if either the Dutch or Mexicans win their match in
Saint-Etienne.

Beer sponsorship for Commonwealth Games to end 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The organizers of the Commonwealth
Games were asked Wednesday to terminate their sponsorship contract
with the beer maker Carlsberg because of objections to the public
display of the beer advertisements.
	   Sports Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said the decision was made by
the Cabinet, the national news agency, Bernama, reported.
	   ``The decision took into consideration the sensitivity of the
matter and it would be in the best interest of all parties. ... The
Cabinet also feels that besides Carlsberg, there may be other
sources of sponsorship for Sukom,'' the minister said.
	   Sukom is the official organizing committee of the games, which
start Sept. 11 in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Last month, Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Mohamed Ali
Rustam reportedly objected to the beer advertisements on public
buses, wondering how they were allowed.
	   ``We do not encourage such advertisements,'' he said.
	   Advertisements for liquor and cigarettes were not allowed on
commuter transport, newspapers quoted the minister as saying. But
the city's transport company had argued that Carlsberg
advertisements splashed across the sides of commuter buses promoted
the games, and not the product.
	   Although Malaysian liquor laws are liberal, the Islamic country
discourages Muslims from drinking in public.
	   Carlsberg is one of the main sponsors of the Commonwealth Games.
The company has contributed 5 million ringgit (dlrs 1.3 million) to
the organizers, Bernama said.
	   On Wednesday, Sports Minister Muhyiddin said the government was
deeply concerned about such sensitive matters and hoped there would
be no confusion over the decision.
	   Sukom executive chairman Hashim Mohd Ali had already been
informed about the matter and he would convey the Cabinet's
decision to Carlsberg, he said.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Danish beer company.
	   The latest decision will exacerbate the financial woes of the
organizers, who are struggling to raise money for the games amid
Malaysia's worst economic crisis in a decade.

EU clears Citicorp-Travelers Group merger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union on Wednesday cleared
the mega-merger, announced on April 6, of Travelers Group and
Citicorp.
	   The European Commission said in a statement the ``biggest merger
in corporate history but does not create a dominant player on the
European market.''
	   Travelers presence in Europe focuses on securities and
derivatives trading investment banking services whereas Citicorp's
activities ``are focused mainly on commercial banking services,''
the Commission said.
	   ``Thus, in Europe the transaction will combine highly
complementary operations and result in only minor overlaps of
fragmented markets with numerous, large and well-established
multinational competitors.''
	   Under EU rules, the European Commission has broad powers to
order changes in corporate ventures of European and non-European
companies if it feels these will harm fair trade within the
15-nation EU.

Mahathir says he is ready to resign if he causes distress 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-Economy
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
says he is prepared to step down if he is the cause of ``distress''
to people.
	   ``I don't think the world needs to sacrifice millions of jobs
just to flush me out because I will go if I cause a lot of distress
to so many people,'' he said in an interview with the Hong
Kong-based weekly Far Eastern Economic Review.
	   Excerpts from the interview will be published in the issue
coming out Thursday. Parts of the interview were released on
Wednesday.
	   Mahathir, 72, who became Asia's longest-serving leader after
Indonesia's President Suharto was ousted last month, had said
earlier that he would consider quitting once the economy revives.
	   Mahathir also said that megaprojects like Malaysia's new airport
at Sepang and the Petronas twin towers, the world's tallest
building, are ``good for the ego'' of a developing country.
	   ``It is important because small people always like to appear
tall. If you can't get tall enough you put a box under you.''
	   Malaysia has often been criticized for spending too lavishly on
grandiose projects.
	   Mahathir also repeated his accusations against currency
speculators, blaming them for bringing on the crisis that had cost
the Malaysian ringgit nearly 40 percent of its value in one year
and sent stock markets crashing.
	   Over the weekend, Mahathir found himself defending his
government and family against accusations of nepotism and cronyism.
Some youth leaders at his United Malays National Organization's
annual convention demanded a debate on government corruption.
	   These critics within the ruling party accused powerful
politicians of misusing an affirmative action program aimed at
helping Malays to benefit cronies by giving them lucrative
government contracts.
	   But Mahathir emerged more powerful from the convention, having
silenced his detractors.

Squash open shifts from Bombay due to threat to Pakistani sportsmen 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Organizers of the World Open Squash
Championship said Wednesday that they are moving the match to the
southern Indian city of Bangalore after members of a radical Hindu
Party in Bombay objected to Pakistani participation.
	   A spokesman for the Professional Squash Association said
promoters and sponsors agreed to the moved due to ``the
sensitivities expressed by Shiv Sena.''
	   The Shiv Sena is a right-wing party that shares power in the
western state of Maharashtra, of which Bombay is the capital. It
opposes Pakistani athletes and artists in Bombay because it says
neighboring Pakistan doesn't reciprocate and encourages the Muslim
insurrection in the northern state of Jammu-Kashmir.
	   The tournament will be held in Bangalore from Nov. 29 to Dec. 5.
	   Top politicians of the Shiv Sena said last month that Pakistani
performers will be allowed to perform in Bombay only when Islamabad
stops arming and training the militants.
	   Pakistan says it only gives moral support to the militants, who
are fighting for independence of Jammu-Kashmir, the Himalayan state
over which both nations have fought two wars.
	   Kashmir is the lone Muslim-majority state in India, where Hindus
form 82 percent of the nearly 1 billion population. Pakistan is an
Islamic nation.
	   In April, Shiv Sena activists stormed into an auditorium and
forced Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali to end his classical music
concert. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee later condemned the
incident. Pakistani musicians do not face similar problems in other
Indian cities.

Germans donate money to family of injured French policeman 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In sympathy and remorse, Germans set
up fund-raising accounts Wednesday for the family of a French
policeman left comatose after a weekend fight with German soccer
hooligans at the World Cup.
	   The policeman, 43-year-old Daniel Nivel, was hospitalized in
Lille, France, where doctors said Wednesday that his condition was
stable.
	   ``Our entire sympathy at this difficult time goes to his wife
and both his sons,'' said a statement from the Berlin police group
Gruener Stern, which opened a donations account with support from
the Berlin police union.
	   The statement listed a bank account number where people could
transfer money, a common method for paying bills in Germany.
	   The Bild tabloid, Germany's most-read newspaper, declared on its
front page Wednesday that it was giving 50,000 marks (dlrs 27,900)
to the family and asked readers for donations.
	   State police in Mecklenburg Lower Pommerania opened a donations
account Wednesday, as did the radio station Hit-Radio Antenna, in
Lower Saxony state, and ARD television's West Deutsche Runkfunk
radio subsidiary in Cologne.
	   The victims aid group Weisser Ring is collecting donations for
Nivel's family in an account in Mainz under the code phrase
``Hooligan Victims.''
	   Markus Warnecke, 27, of Hanover, and Steffen Karl Elschner, 26,
of Braunschweig, were arrested for the attack after Sunday's match
between Yugoslavia and Germany.

Government to set up bank to clean up bad debt crisis details from government; ADDS byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from Hashimoto, analyst and
By CHESTER DAWSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's government said Wednesday it is racing to
set up a ``bridge bank'' to provide loans to cash-strapped
companies left out in the cold by private banks struggling under
mountains of bad loans.
	   Details remain vague, but the new bank likely would fill a
breech left by bad loan-burdened private banks that ``might fall
into trouble,'' in the words of a government draft outline.
	   ``We will create a bridge bank that would have the ability to
screen borrowers to distinguish healthy borrowers from unhealthy
ones, and to extend new loans,'' Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
was quoted as saying by Kyodo News.
	   Japan has come under heavy pressure from the United States, its
Asian neighbors and investors in Japanese markets to deal with its
banking mess, a key cause of the slump that has paralyzed the
world's second-largest economy.
	   The government now recognizes the depth of the problem facing
the banking industry and realizes there is no time to lose in
dealing with it, other officials said Wednesday, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   An early draft outline compiled Tuesday of a government policy
package for handling the financial crisis calls for a rescue bank
proposal to be finalized ``as early as possible in July.''
	   ``Something has to be done about borrowers that are dependent on
troubled banks,'' said Brian Waterhouse, a financial analyst in the
Tokyo office of Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   At issue are some 65 trillion yen (dlrs 463 billion) in problem
loans extended by financial institutions. To prevent these from
completely souring, the bank will provide ``bridge'' loans to tide
over debtor companies dependent on troubled private banks.
	   But by extending loans to companies otherwise unable to secure
financing for their businesses, a bridge bank could put some
uncreditworthy companies on life-support _ possibly with taxpayer
funds.
	   ``There is a risk that essentially the patient doesn't make it
out of the operating room,'' said analyst Waterhouse.
	   How a rescue bank would be financed and what criteria it would
use to extend loans are issues being debated by a team of officials
assembled from Prime Minister Hashimoto's governing party and 10
government agencies and ministries.
	   Hashimoto said Wednesday that legislation approving
establishment of the bank will be submitted at a special session of
Parliament expected to start around July 30, Kyodo reported.
	   The bank is one part of a ``total plan'' being drafted by
government and governing party officials for revitalizing Japan's
financial industry. Other measures include steps making it easier
for banks to sell off real estate used as collateral for
non-performing loans.
	   The new rescue bank would join a crowded menagerie of similar
entities set up over the past few years to soak up bad loans from
healthy banks and assume the liabilities of failed financial
institutions. It may take over the roles of some or all of these in
addition to carrying out its primary task of extending new loans.
	   Putting all of the above into one institution would create
something akin to the Resolution Trust Corp. set up in the United
States to deal with the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.
	   The secretary-general of Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party,
Koichi Kato, has said a number of alternatives are under
consideration, including proposals to expand an existing bailout
body established to handle credit union failures.

Louise Woodward says she didn't try to copy Princess Diana 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Louise Woodward says that she wasn't trying to
copy Princess Diana when she submitted to an interview with the
British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Miss Woodward, 20, convicted of manslaughter in the death of
8-month-old Matthew Eappen in Massachusetts, returned to Britain
last week.
	   Two tabloid newspapers had suggested that Woodward had copied
the dark suit and the careful makeup which Diana brought to her
interview with Martin Bashir, the BBC man who also interviewed Miss
Woodward. The interview was broadcast on Monday.
	   ``I don't want to be a celebrity. I did not watch the Diana
interview and I happen to like that suit and that is why I wore it,
and I am not trying to emulate Princess Diana,'' Miss Woodward said
in an interview published Wednesday by the Liverpool Echo.
	   Responding to criticism that she had been too composed on
television, she said: ``Ask anyone who has sat through a weepy
movie with me, I am pretty affectionate, pretty emotional, but I
have had to adapt. My friends have told me I have not changed a
bit.''
	   She said she had found the publicity surrounding her case
tiresome and intrusive and hoped it would soon end.
	   ``The worst thing though has been being trapped in the house
with all the press outside,'' she said.
	   Speaking of her long-term plans she said she hoped to go to
university this fall, and eventually to marry and have children.
	   ``I have been around children since I have been back and I am
quite at ease with them. One day I shall get married and have
children of my own,'' she said.
	   She again asserted her belief that she was innocent of causing
the baby's death.
	   ``I would ask the public to please keep an open mind and to look
at all the evidence. The evidence proves my innocence. Please try
and believe me,'' she said.

Zeman opens talks on center-left government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The winner of last weekend's
deadlocked early elections, Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman, met
Wednesday with his bitter rival and runner-up, former Premier
Vaclav Klaus, as efforts continued to form a government.
	   President Vaclav Havel asked Zeman on Monday to try and form the
cabinet, a process likely to take several weeks.
	   Both Zeman and Klaus repeatedly have ruled out a ``grand
coalition'' of their center-left and center-right parties.
	   Zeman's Social Democrats gained 74 seats in the new 200-member
parliament, and Klaus' Civic Democratic Party 63.
	   On Wednesday, Klaus again ruled out supporting any government
led by Zeman.
	   ``Two possible candidates for such a government are also
possible candidates for government of a different type,'' Klaus
told Czech radio after the meeting.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a government
coalition, Havel will likely ask Klaus to attempt the same.
	   The deadlock leaves two smaller parties, the Christian Democrats
with 20 seats, and the Freedom Union with 19, in the position of
deciding whether the Czech Republic sticks with liberal rule, or
leans further left.

WTO: Nigeria needs major reform to regain international confidence 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: REMOVES reference to football in intro; CORRECTS spelling of
Nigeria in 13th graf
By PHILIP WALLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Major political and economic reforms are needed to
revive international confidence in Nigeria, according to a report
out Wednesday.
	   Continuing political uncertainty and weakening respect for the
law in the sprawling West African nation is discouraging foreign
investment and trade, according to the 132-page World Trade
Organization review.
	   The country's oil bu privatize state industries, thereby reducing the
economy's dependence on oil, it says.
	   ``Recent steps to increase transparency and accountability in
government, and thus combat allegations of fraud and corruption,
must be pursued,'' it adds.
	   The study says the stability and predictability of Nigeria's
institutions and its opaque constitution remain major concerns and
``increase the risk of doing business'' with the country.
	   Since he took power on June 8, Abubakar has sent mixed messages
to activists and opponents of his late predecessor Sani Abacha.
	   Nigeria's critics have praised Abubakar for releasing a string
of political prisoners who had opposed Abacha's harsh rule.
	   But he has angered Nigeria's political opposition by moving
quickly to quash pro-democracy protests and making only vague
pledges to follow through on Abacha's flawed political transition
program, due to culminate in an Oct. 1 transition to civilian rule.
	   Little in Nigeria functions these days, from the water supply to
the telephones, and crime is rampant.
	   Attempts to use the country's large oil revenue to expand the
economic base ``have been mostly unsuccessful'' and the economy
remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices, the study
adds.
	   It says Nigeria, a founding member of the WTO, should try to
reduce its high external debt and prevent arrears accumulating.
	   This would increase its ability to attract much needed foreign
investment outside the oil business.
	   The report acknowledges the military government's efforts to
liberalize Nigeria's foreign exchange and investment regimes and
establish a stable and predictable structure of import tariffs.
	   But it says concerns remain among WTO members about tariff
changes and quantitative import restrictions, saying these should
be eliminated.
	   ``A wide array of export incentive schemes has failed to offset
the anti-export bias resulting from the import regime, cumbersome
export procedures and failing infrastructure,'' says the review.

Egypt will recognize a Palestinian state next year 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt will recognize a unilaterally-declared
Palestinian state should Yasser Arafat defy Israeli warnings and
make good his pledge to do so next year, the Egyptian foreign
minister was quoted as saying Wednesday.
	   ``Under no circumstances should the Palestinians be deprived of
their legitimate right to declare their state,'' Amr Moussa said in
an interview with the government-run weekly Al-Mussawar.
	   The Palestinian leader has threatened to declare Palestinian
statehood in May 1999, at the end of the five-year interim period
of Palestinian autonomy, a move that Israeli leaders have said
would jeopardize the peace process.
	   ``We are in the forefront of those who support a Palestinian
state ... and President (Hosni) Mubarak himself will declare our
position at that time,'' he said.
	   Moussa said he expected Arafat to declare statehood, if only
because of his frustration with the deadlock in peace talks with
Israel.
	   ``President Arafat has reached the final limits after which
great harm will be done to both the Palestinian cause and himself
personally,'' Moussa said. ``Arafat is very much aware of this.''
	   Moussa's remarks were the strongest support yet from an Arab
state for a unilateral declaration by Arafat.
	   Moussa also accused Netanyahu's government of attempting to
impose a ``surrender on the Palestinians.''
	   Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979 but already cool relations have deteriorated further
over the stalemate in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ With warships circling, South Korean
navy frogmen began attaching air bags to a sunken North Korean
submarine Wednesday, hoping to raise the captured craft and look
inside for signs of life and clues to its mission.
	   The small submarine broke loose from a tow line and sank in 33
meters (110 feet) of water a mile (1.6 kilometers) off shore
Tuesday while being towed to this major east coast naval base by a
South Korean frigate.
	   Fearing the submarine's capture might derail his fragile efforts
to entice the North to open up its society, President Kim Dae-jung
ordered his hawkish Defense Ministry to refrain from any
retaliatory rhetoric, his aides said.
	   ``North Korea is revealing two or three faces in its dealings
with us,'' the president told officers at an air force base east of
Seoul Wednesday.
	   ``But our principles should not be shaken each time,'' Kim said,
reaffirming his policy of prying open the North through more
exchanges and economic cooperation.
	   The president visited the air base and an army command post in
an apparent effort to counter criticism from some domestic news
media that he was being too soft on North Korea.
	   ``We will not tolerate an armed provocation,'' Kim told the
airmen. ``But we have to wait and see if the submarine was
drifting, as the North says, or it was spying on us. Then we will
act.''
	   Lt. Col. Kim Chong-sook, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said the
navy salvage teams had planned to raise the submarine by Wednesday
evening but rapid currents were delaying the operation.
	   ``It will not be until Thursday afternoon that officials will
open the hatch and take a look inside,'' Kim said. ``But our
tentative conclusion is that there will be no crewmen alive inside.
They probably drowned or suffocated inside the submarine.''
	   Other Defense Ministry officials speculated that the crew
managed to escape before their vessel was seized Monday while
entangled in a mackerel fishing net just a half-mile (one
kilometer) south of the North Korean border.
	   North Korea said Tuesday one of its submarines was missing on a
training mission after experiencing mechanical problems.
	   Authorities described the craft seized Monday as a ``midget
submersible,'' which can carry up to six crewmen and is used
primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct coastal surveillance.
	   When the submarine was first spotted by South Korean fishermen,
three crewmen were struggling desperately to free it from the net.
	   Navy divers got no response when they pounded on the sub's hull
with a hammer. They also used sonar scans but detected no signs of
life inside.
	   The discovery of the sub on the coast 200 kilometers (125 miles)
northeast of Seoul renewed concerns that North Korea was trying to
infiltrate spies despite the South's efforts to help the
famine-stricken North with humanitarian aid.
	   The submarine was found just miles (kilometers) away from where
another, larger North Korean sub ran aground off the east coast two
years ago. The 1996 incursion triggered a 53-day manhunt that left
24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans dead and
relations between the two Koreas at their worst in years.
	   The South cut off aid and jacked up diplomatic pressure until
the North apologized.
	   This time, presidential aides have said the incident will not
derail their new policy of engagement toward the North.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

New problems force Russia to postpone satellite launch again quotes, edits thruout to conform.

Eds: UPDATES with launch postponed for at least a week, details,
By ANNA DOLGOV

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia postponed the launch of six satellites on
Wednesday for the second time, after new problems were discovered
with the cranky Zenit-2 booster rocket, officials said.
	   The launch from Russia's Baikonur cosmodrome had originally been
scheduled for Tuesday, but it was postponed until Wednesday because
of a failure in the rocket's orientation system. A similar problem
during a Zenit-2 launch last week sent six ``spy mailbox''
satellites into the wrong orbit.
	   The orientation was adjusted, but on Wednesday morning the
system broke down again, said Alexander Buchin, spokesman for
Russia's Strategic Missile Forces.
	   ``The malfunction is floating, which means that when the rocket
was checked before being placed in the starting position everything
was OK, but when it was taken to the site, inaccuracy in aiming was
found,'' spokesman for the Russian Space Agency, Sergei Gorbunov,
was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   An expert commission decided Wednesday that it would take at
least a week to fix the problem, Gorbunov said. The satellites
would have to be disconnected from the booster, which would be
taken back to an assembly and testing shop for repairs, he said.
	   Space experts have been cautious with the Zenit-2 booster since
it has been involved in more than a half dozen accidents and
failures since 1985. Last year, a Zenit-2 booster crashed less than
a minute after launch from Baikonur, which is located in
neighboring Kazakstan.
	   No new launch date has been set, Gorbunov said.
	   ``Of course, this is an unpleasant incident, but I think that by
postponing the launch we have avoided big problems, as the
satellites could have been put into the wrong orbit,'' he said.
	   The booster is to carry into orbit satellites from Russia,
Germany, Israel, Chile, Australia and Thailand.
	   The Russian Resurs-0 satellite will relay ecological and
meteorological information, while the others will take measurements
of the Earth's surface.
	   Russia has been pushing commercial satellite launches as a way
to help fund its space program, which is struggling after the loss
of Soviet-era subsidies. Russia launched 48 commercial satellites
last year.

OPEC ministers seek bigger cuts in production to boost oil price fresh quotes, oil prices higher, no time yet for official start of meeting. TRIMS. AP Business Writer

By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers worked Wednesday to cut
more barrels of oil from the glutted market, and prices crept
higher in early London futures dealings.
	   Some ministers say OPEC should cut production by at least 1
million barrels a day to help prices recover from their recent
12-year lows, and ministers were holding informal meetings
Wednesday to try to find a workable formula.
	   ``Anything less will not be enough,'' said the Libyan oil
minister, Abdalla Salem el-Badri.
	   Prices have risen about dlrs 1 per barrel this week in
anticipation of big cutbacks, but one prominent OPEC delegate told
reporters early Wednesday that the producers want an increase of at
least dlrs 4 per barrel.
	   Six of the 11 OPEC members have pledged to cut a total of
620,000 barrels daily from the market, and ministers are pushing
for still more cuts. The big Persian Gulf producers who have
promised cutbacks were hoping to hear Wednesd!he supply, but
they haven't publicly revealed any numbers.
	   ``We need a reduction,'' Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi
said. ``We need this to stabilize the market.''
	   OPEC was scheduled to formally open its summer meeting
Wednesday, but it was unclear when it would actually start. A
United Arab Emirates delegate said the ministers wanted first to
agree to various production cuts in informal sessions.
	   If OPEC manages to pull another 1 million barrels from the
market, that will be about twice what has been pledged thus far.
But OPEC members realize their oil-dependent economies are in deep
trouble if they can't find a way to get more money for their crude.
	   All the talk about big production cuts has pushed futures prices
higher. Brent crude oil to be delivered in August was up another 29
cents at dlrs 14.21 per barrel early this afternoon on London's
International Petroleum Exchange, adding to gains of 63 cents from
Tuesday's session.
	   Crude oil is the world's most vital commodity and the recent
cheap prices have been a bargain for consumers but a nightmare for
OPEC and other producers.
	   OPEC found itself in a mess this winter after boosting output
just as the Asian economic crisis started eroding the growth in
world oil demand.
	   The oil ministers held an emergency meeting in March, agreeing
to cut 1.245 million barrels of daily production. They delivered
most, but not all, of those cuts and prices plunged further.
	   After announcing new pledges to reduce output, the big producers
from the Gulf _ Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates _ all seem willing to slash output further than already
promised.
	   OPEC has been helped by non-OPEC members Mexico, Russia, Oman
and Egypt, who say they will withhold another 203,000 barrels from
the market.
	   But even as futures prices were rising, some analysts cautioned
that OPEC still needs to deliver more than words. The once-powerful
group has in recent years shown a marked inability to stick by its
production agreements.
	   ``It's a question of `How much and will they deliver?''' said
Leo Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Center for Global
Energy Studies.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Kosovo situation worsening, Rugova says; Urges NATO to end violence with Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian political leader
Ibrahim Rugova appealed Wednesday for NATO to use its military
might to end the worsening violence in the secessionist Serbian
province.
	   Rugova came to NATO headquarters as the alliance intensifies
military planning for possible intervention in Kosovo, including
air raids, but NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told him to
resume talks with the Serbian leadership so those plans won't have
to be put into action.
	   ``I urged for some kind of protection in Kosovo so that massive
massacres and massive ethnic cleansing is prevented,'' Rugova told
reporters after his meeting with Solana.
	   Rugova said Serb forces were still shelling villages in the
southern province whose population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed
this year in fighting between Serb forces and separatist fighters.
	   Rugova, who represents the more moderate branch of separatism in
Kosovo, reiterated his demand for Kosovo's independence, with
guarantees for the local, minority Serb population.
	   ``Kosovo has the right to become independent as it's part of a
country that has dissolved,'' he said.
	   But NATO officials said Solana told him the alliance continues
to oppose Kosovo's independence and would prefer the
reestablishment of the province's autonomy within Yugoslavia.
	   Solana insisted forcefully that Rugova should resume talks with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, without making independence
for Kosovo a pre-condition, said one official, who spoke on NATO's
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Milosevic must agree to withdraw from Kosovo all troops that are
normally stationed outside the province and allow refugees to
return to their homes, the official added.
	   NATO ambassadors Tuesday and Wednesday reviewed plans for air
strikes and other possible military action.
	   ``All options remain on the table,'' the official said. ``Every
ally hopes it won't be necessary to use force. On the other hand,
we cannot be certain that diplomacy will succeed.''
	   The planners are looking at three categories of possible action:
intensification of NATO maneuvers and advisory missions to Kosovo's
neighbors, Macedonia and Albania; deployment of NATO troops to
those nations to prevent the violence spreading; armed
intervention, including air strike or, as a last resort, ground
troops.
	   Rugova met later Wednesday with Robert Gelbard, the U.S
administration's Balkans negotiator. He was also due to meet with
the European Union's Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans Van den
Broek and Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke.
	   His talks here are part of a renewed diplomatic effort to end
the crisis, spearheaded by the U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke who
arrived Wednesday in Kosovo for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders
after warning Milosevic that time for a peaceful end to the
violence in the region was running out.

Izetbegovic: OSCE too soft on parties that neglect peace terms 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo BRU103
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Bosnia's Muslim president insisted
Wednesday that political parties that oppose full implementation of
the Dayton peace agreement should be barred from standing in
September's elections.
	   Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of Bosnia's joint presidency,
criticized international monitors from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe for being too lenient in
deciding who could run.
	   ``I don't think any party has been excluded,'' Izetbegovic told
the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee.
	   ``We need a stricter approach ... About half the parties should
be excluded from these elections, if they do not support the Dayton
agreement.''
	   The U.S. brokered peace-deal was signed in Dayton, Ohio, in 1995
to end the 3 1/2-year war among Bosnia's Muslims, Croats and Serbs.
	   Izetbegovic repeated his assertion that the Dayton agreement
should be revised if it is not fully implemented. He accused the
Bosnian Serbs of only selectively applying the peace terms.
	   Izetbegovic said the Dayton agreement could be a model for
ending the violence raging in nearby Kosovo.
	   He said the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo could be given
autonomy from Serbia in the way the Bosnian Serbs have their own
republic within Bosnia. As Dayton allows the Bosnian Serbs to have
special relations with Serbia, so the Kosovo Albanians could have
special relations with Albania, he added.
	   ``Kosovo is in our neighborhood, we are very interested in
seeing this resolved.''
	   Izetbegovic urged the European Union assembly members to back
Bosnia's bid to join international bodies including the Council of
Europe and the World Trade Organization. He said Bosnia also hoped
to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program of military
cooperation with eastern Europe.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The stock market's capitalization fell by
9.5 per cent in May to 1.2 billion Cyprus pounds (dlrs 2.28
billion) compared to April, according to a Cyprus Stock Exchange
monthly report issued Wednesday.
	   The volume of trade in the fledgling market, which trades in
about 50 securities, also fell in May by 23.9 per cent, recording a
daily average of 1.82 million pounds (dlrs 3.45 million).
	   Share prices soared by nearly 20 per cent in the first four
months of the year but have shed half of these gains since the
start of May.
	   Traders attribute the decline to the heightened political
uncertainty caused by the failure last month of U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke to persuade leaders of the island's Greek and Turkish
communities to resume talks on reuniting Cyprus.
	   Cyprus has been unofficially divided since Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in 1974.
	   The dispatch of warplanes to Cyprus last week by Turkey and
Greece, mentors of the island's two communities, raised the tension
on the island again, causing the bourse's index to drop by about 2
per cent on Thursday and Friday. It slightly recovered on Monday
but fell again Tuesday.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The European Union has agreed to grant
Lebanon dlrs 42 million to modernize its civil service, a leading
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The daily An-Nahar said Lebanese Minister of Administrative
Reform, Bishara Merhej, had been notified of the decision by EU
representative Manuel Gonzalez.
	   The grant is designed ``to rehabilitate the Lebanese
administration through various projects aimed at modernizing and
computerizing it,'' Gonzalez said in a letter to Merhej, according
to a statement issued by the minister's office.
	   The 15-nation EU is one of Lebanon's largest aid donors. In
1996, the EU announced a dlrs 650 million aid package to Lebanon to
help it rebuild from the devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   Lebanon has launched a multibillion dollar program to repair the
damage caused by the civil war. The program is mostly being
financed by foreign loans and grants.
 &UR; ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A Canadian company has agreed to lend a
Lebanese bank dlrs 10 million to finance the import of Canadian
goods and products, local newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The credit line agreement was signed in Ottawa by Joseph Torbey,
chairman and general manager of the Lebanese bank, Credit Libanais,
and a representative of the Export Development Corporation of
Canada, An-Nahar and other newspapers reported.
	   They did not say when the agreement was signed.
	   Lebanon's imports from Canada are mainly heavy-duty machinery,
raw materials and high-tech products.

Ex-Israeli agent wanted by Norway in botched 1973 Mossad killing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A quarter-century after Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency killed the wrong man in a botched
assassination, Norway has issued an arrest warrant for a retired
Israeli agent suspected in the killing.
	   On July 21, 1973, Moroccan waiter Ahmed Bouchikhi was shot and
killed as he returned from the movies with his pregnant Norwegian
wife in the town of Lillehammer.
	   A small team of Israeli hit men apparently mistook Bouchikhi for
Hassan Salameh, a PLO intelligence chief suspected of masterminding
the killing of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
Five men identified as Mossad agents served brief prison terms for
the shooting and were then pardoned.
	   Norway has long suspected that the mastermind of the killing was
a top Mossad agent named Mike Harari, who was never charged.
	   Public prosecutor Lasse Qvigstad on Friday said Norway was
seeking the arrest of Harari, now 71 and retired, through the
international police organization Interpol on charges of being an
accessory to murder.
	   ``We will ask that he be sought internationally as someone who
is suspected in the Lillehammer murder 25 years ago,'' Qvigstad
said. ``There is reason to suspect him and the statute of
limitation was about to run out.''
	   A 25-year statute of limitations on the crime expires in less
than one month. By charging Harari now, prosecutors extended the
time limit by another 25 years under Norwegian law.
	   In November 1997, Norway asked Israeli for permission to take a
formal deposition from Harari in an Israeli court. That request
came weeks after the investigation was reopened because of reports
that top Norwegian officials had been told of Harari's possible
involvement a month after the killing, but failed to act.
	   Since that request did not lead to a court inquiry, Qvigstad
said Norway has now issued an arrest warrant for Harari.
	   The Israeli government has agreed to pay compensation to
Bouchikhi's family, but stopped short of accepting responsibility
for the attack.

<TEXT>
	   NHOMA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's parliamentary
speaker is meeting Wednesday with leaders of the breakaway military
faction to discuss a cease-fire and the possible return of
government to this battered West African country.
	   The speaker, Malam Bacai Sanha, was meeting in Nhoma with
representatives of former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane,
who staged a failed coup June 7.
	   The talks were underway Wednesday morning in this town, about 30
kilometers (19 miles) north of the capital, Bissau, which was
battered by heavy shelling Wednesday.
	   Religious leaders were also reportedly planning to meet with
renegade soldiers in Nhoma.
	   Government troops, supported by forces from neighboring Senegal,
began an artillery bombardment at dawn against the breakaway
faction's positions around Bissau's airport and in a nearby
suburban military garrison, according to Portugal's ambassador to
Guinea-Bissau.
	   ``Apparently, the shelling was from the government side, then
the rebels responded,'' Ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva
told Portuguese radio RDP-Africa.
	   The bombardment was continuing four hours later as Senegalese
infantry units moved up to the front line, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   Heavily-armed renegades have been dug into the positions since
launching their revolt in the former Portuguese colony June 7.
	   Henriques da Silva said the religious leaders who are seeking to
mediate an end to the conflict also aimed to meet with a rebel
delegation at Nhoma.
	   They intended to skirt the city on foot, passing through swamp
areas, and then continue by vehicle to the meeting place, according
to Henriques da Silva.
	   The leaders of the local Roman Catholic, Muslim and Evangelical
communities tried to meet with the rebels in Bissau on Tuesday, but
said they were turned back by Senegalese troops with tanks.
	   Two previous attempts at mediation, by a Gambian government
minister and by local politicians, failed last week.
	   Some 1,300 Senegalese troops are supporting President Joao
Bernardo Vieira against an unknown number of rebel forces led by
former armed forces chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane.
	   The rebels have accused Vieira of corruption and abuse of power
and have called on him to step down so that fresh elections can be
held.
	   Most of Bissau's population of about 300,000 people have fled
the city and are short of food and medicine, humanitarian
organizations reported.
	   The United Nations refugee agency has warned that without
immediate assistance, Guinea-Bissau will face a massive
humanitarian crisis within days.
	   Some aid is making it to Guinea-Bissau, though.
	   A Portuguese aid team is arriving in Dakar on Wednesday and will
head Thursday for Gabu, where AMI _ a Portuguese acronym for
International Medical Assistance _ is centering its operations.
	   ``More refugees are arriving there each day. There are now an
estimated 6,000 to 7,000 people in need of aid,'' Leonor Nobre of
AMI said in Lisbon.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has
distributed basic foodstuffs to about 10,000 in and around Bissau,
is sending two more aid teams into the country shortly, where they
will concentrate on the cities of Gabu, Bafata, Nhacra and Mansoa.
	   The U.N. refugee agency officials believe as many as 250,000
people have fled Bissau for the the central towns of Canchungo,
Mansoa and Bafata.
	   The rebels also distributed thousands of bags of rice Tuesday to
refugees gathered in the towns of Comura and Pradis, about 15km
from Bissau, Lusa reported.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila has ordered the
release of three journalists arrested earlier in June and has
instructed the Justice Ministry to examine the cases of two more,
according to a Congolese newspaper editor.
	   Michel Museme Diawe, the director of state television, and
Achille Akele and Guy Kassango, who both work for the satiric
weekly Pot-Pourri, have been ordered freed, said Michel Ladi Luya,
editor of Le Palmares newspaper and head of a delegation of
journalists that recently met with Kabila.
	   Luya said Tuesday the cases of Thierry Kyalumba, the director of
Vision newspaper, and Albert Bosange, owner of Alarm, have been
turned over to the justice ministry for review.
	   They were arrested in February and sentenced to one year in
prison.
	   Kabila, who came to power last year after overthrowing longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, has locked up a number of Congolese
journalists over the past few months, accusing them of working with
foreign countries, undermining Congolese security or other
infractions.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Police said Wednesday they had arrested
two men in connection with the slaying of a well-known journalist
earlier this month. A third suspect was still on the run.
	   Simao Roberto, deputy political editor of the state-run daily
Jornal de Angola, was gunned down in broad daylight in downtown
Luanda June 5.
	   The two men in custody _ Jose Branco, 28, and Aderito Jenivava,
24, _ said they stopped Roberto's car with the intention of
stealing it, according to police.
	   Roberto resisted, and armed police officers who witnessed the
incident drew their guns. The third unidentified man allegedly shot
Roberto in the stomach during an exchange of fire with the
officers.
	   The three men, all reportedly unemployed, then fled.
	   Roberto left a wife and five children.
	   ------
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The international aid organization
Medecins du Monde has called on Congolese authorities to release a
volunteer who has been detained in the central African country for
the past eight weeks.
	   Fabrice Michalon, a Frenchman, was evaluating Medecins du
Monde's medical programs when he was arrested during a May 4
identity check at the international airport in Goma, in eastern
Congo. He was transferred the next day to Kinshasa and has been
held there ever since, according to a statement released Tuesday in
Paris by the aid organization.
	   The group said he was being held ``under acceptable
conditions.''
	   The group initially believed Michalon would be quickly released
once the misunderstanding was cleared up.
	   But they have been frustrated so far.
	   ``After two months of talks in vain, and with no guarantees
concerning the release of its volunteer, Medecins du Monde
denounces the arbitrary nature of this arrest, as no charges have
been filed against him,'' the group said, demanding Michalon's
release.
	   Congolese authorities could not be immediately reached for
comment.
	   ------
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Police officers were suspected of helping
in an armed robbery that netted 100 million kwacha (dlrs 55,000)
and seven were arrested, news reports said Wednesday.
	   Police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwende said the seven were caught
in the past week with about 20 million kwacha (dlrs 11,000) in
their possession.
	   Six men armed with assault rifles robbed a downtown Lusaka bank
last month.
	   Chimfwende said two robbers caught after the raid implicated the
police officers though it was not clear whether police took part in
the robbery or helped facilitate it.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A man drowned in a vat of beer after
trying to help himself to a drink, police said.
	   Raymond Tizai, 32, a worker at the Go-Beer Brewery in the
central town of Gweru, apparently slipped into the 14,000 liter
(3,000 gallon) fermentation tank while trying to fill a container.
	   Workers receive a free weekly ration of beer. Work mates said
Tizai forgot to collect his ration after a weekend shift and
returned alone at night to help himself.
	   No one saw him fall into the vat, where his body was found the
following morning.
	   ------
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) - The United Nations Development Program
has unveiled its new four-year project worth 120.2 million U.S.
dollars to assist Mozambique.
	   The program said Tuesday that the money will be used on projects
to reduce poverty, support good governance, manage natural
resources, conserve the environment and improve economic and
financial management.
	   Emmanuel Casterle, the UNDP representative in Maputo, said 21
percent of the 120 million dollars for the plan will come from its
funds and the rest from donors.
	   ------
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ A U.N. report on AIDS to be presented
next week at the 12th World AIDS Conference in Geneva indicates
about 20 percent of Namibian adults between the ages of 15 and 49
are infected with the HIV-virus.
	   The report says 150,000 people in Namibia are HIV positive. The
Health Ministry earlier said the country was among the top 10 AIDS
infected countries in the world.
	   Mary Guinn Delaney, the U.N. AIDS program director in Namibia,
said the epidemic would be the most important macro-economic
variable for the country and threatened to overwhelm Namibia's
health care system.
	   ------
	   EAST LONDON, South AFrica (AP) _ A 20-year-old student has died
of injuries suffered when he was attacked by a shark while body
surfing along South Africa's southeast Indian Ocean coast.
	   Hospital officials said Anton Devos died Tuesday of a blood
disorder directly related the the massive amount of blood he lost
after the attack on Monday.
	   The attack on Devos brought to six the number of people mauled
by sharks in the Eastern Cape region over the past five weeks.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunmen linked to rival factions of a
militant ethnic group rampaged through several neighborhoods in
this southern port city on Wednesday terrorizing residents and
forcing shop owners to close.
	   Three people were killed, including a policewoman.
	   Gunmen with automatic rifles shot and killed Farukh Sultana, the
former head of Pakistan's all-women police force, as she left her
home in the ethnically divided southern district of Karachi, said
police officials.
	   Hours later in Musa colony in central Karachi, gunmen broke into
the home of Jehangir Mirza and killed his wife, Noor Jehan, they
said.
	   The killing occurred while Mirza was at work. Within 30 minutes
of his return home from work, the gunmen returned and killed him,
police said.
	   No one has taken responsibility for any of the killings. Police
suspect rival militant groups targeted Mirza believing he was an
informer for one of their rivals.
	   Police officers in Karachi are linking all the killings to the
relentless ethnic violence that has wracked Karachi this month.
	   According to official figures the death toll since June 1 is
121, including six police officers.
	   Pakistan's Conservative President Rafiq Tarar has accused
neighboring India of masterminding the unrest in Karachi, news
reports said Wednesday. Pakistan and India routinely accuse each
other of fomenting violence on their territory.
	   Throughout several troubled neighborhoods police in armored
vehicles patrolled following a night of violence that left six
people dead and several people injured, including a small boy
caught in the crossfire, said police.
	   The combatants, rival members of the Mohajir Qami Movement, roam
the city's congested streets, often at night, attacking their
rivals with automatic rifles.
	   Late on Tuesday gunmen attacked an office of the Movement's
largest faction led by exiled leader Altaf Hussein, killing two
people and injuring two others. No one was arrested.
	   The killings have sparked retaliatory attacks and calls for a
city-wide strike by activists of the movement's Hussein faction.
	   No charges have been filed and it wasn't immediately clear
whether any of the people who were arrested had been involved in
the latest round of violence.
	   The movement, which represents Indian Muslims who settled in
Pakistan after 1947, split into two groups several years ago.
Calling themselves mohajirs, meaning refugees, they have accused
successive governments of treating them unfairly and giving job and
education preference to the country's established ethnic groups of
Pathans, Punjabis, Sindhis and Baluch.

Hindu right-winger brandishes plan to erect controversial temple

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A right-wing Hindu leader whose group
led the razing of a mosque _ setting off nationwide religious riots
_ on Wednesday acknowledged plans to erect a temple at the site.
	   ``There is nothing hidden here,'' Ashok Singhal,
secretary-general of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu
Council, told reporters Wednesday. ``We are building a temple that
will stand for 2,000 years.''
	   The issue has dogged the three-month-old government of Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party also has been linked to the destruction of the mosque
in Ayodhya in 1992.
	   BJP leaders have denied charges from opposition politicians that
they supports a clandestine effort to build a Hindu temple at the
site in Ayodhya, 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of New Delhi.
	   Both the BJP and Singhal's group are off-shoots of the Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh, which describes itself as devoted to protecting
India's Hindu heritage. Opposition politicians accuse the BJP of
being controlled by its rightist parent.
	   Singhal acknowledged that hundreds of artisans were chipping
away at stone sculptures and fittings, but said no attempt to
assemble the temple would be made before India's Supreme Court
rules on the fate of the plot at Ayodhya.
	   Still, Singhal indicated he would not accept any ruling that
does not fit his plans.
	   ``This issue is about a belief that has spanned thousands of
years. The court can't just brush it away,'' he said. ``This is a
question of India's identity.''
	   It was not clear when the court would rule.
	   Singhal's group says the mosque was built 400 years ago by Mogul
invaders using the rubble of a Hindu shrine they tore down. Many
Hindus believe the shrine stood on the birthplace of Ram, an
important Hindu deity.
	   Some Muslim leaders say no temple ever existed at the site.
	   Right-wing leaders among Hindus, who form 82 percent of India's
nearly 1 billion people, have often used the dispute to whip up
religious passions for political gains, as have some Muslim
leaders. About 12 percent of Indians are Muslim, making them the
country's largest minority.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived
Wednesday in Kosovo for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders after
warning Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that time for a
peaceful end to the violence in the region was running out.
	   ``We are at a critical moment in the crisis surrounding
Kosovo,'' Holbrooke said Tuesday in Belgrade after four hours of
talks with Milosevic.
	   The visit by Holbrooke, nominated to be the next U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, is seen as a last attempt to get Milosevic
to stop his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the secessionist
Yugoslav province.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between Serb-led army and police forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is gaining public support in predominantly
Albanian Kosovo.
	   In Kosovo on Wednesday, Holbrooke was meeting with negotiators
close to ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, while touring
regions west of the capital Pristina that have seen some of the
heaviest fighting.
	   During his talks with Holbrooke, Milosevic reaffirmed an earlier
promise to allow foreign diplomats to observe the situation in
Kosovo. Holbrooke refused to reveal anything else about the
meeting, saying it was confidential.
	   Holbrooke returns to Belgrade Thursday before traveling to
Greece.
	   He met Tuesday with leaders of neighboring Macedonia, and
Rugova, saying the latter meeting was ``very productive.''
	   In Brussels Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana met
Rugova and insisted Serbs and Albanians return to the negotiating
table without conditions. Solana also stressed the NATO allies
support a return to the autonomy in Kosovo, but not the
independence sought by both Rugova and Albanian militants.
	   In 1989, Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy and has since
ruled the province with virtual martial law.

Hundreds of thousands Securitate files destroyed

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, an
intelligence officer admitted that some 300,000 files of Romania's
feared communist secret police have been destroyed, media reported
Wednesday.
	   Mircea Gheordunescu, deputy director of the Romanian Information
Service, told Parliament Tuesday that 270,000 Securitate files were
burned between 1971 and 1979, Cotidianul daily reported.
	   A further 27,000 files were burnt by Securitate officers
immediately after the 1989 revolt, he said. The Romanian
Information Service succeeded the communist-era Securitate
following the revolution.
	   The files destroyed between 1971 and 1979 documented movements
of Communist Party Securitate collaborators and informers who died
in that period. Billions of Securitate files remain closed to the
public, almost nine years after Ceausescu was killed.
	   Romanians are still preoccupied with the Securitate. Over the
last two weeks, several prominent politicians including Health
Minister Francisc Baranyi were exposed as collaborators of the
former secret police controlled by late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   The statement by Gheordunescu marks the first time that a
government official has begun to confront this dark part of
Romania's past. Previous intelligence officers have tried to
confound and mystify matters in good Securitate fashion.
	   According to Romanian intelligence reports, there are still
100,000 Securitate informers living in Romania. An additional 125
million pages of files are still locked away in the vaults of the
Romanian Information Service.

South Korean captain given suspended prison term 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese court fined the captain of a South
Korean fishing trawler Wednesday for operating in Japanese waters
and injuring a Japanese official.
	   The Nagasaki District Court also sentenced Cho Chong-hwan to 30
months in prison, but suspended the sentence for three years,
meaning the 40-year-old captain will avoid jail if commits no
further violations in Japan.
	   Kiyoto Yatsushiro of the Maritime Safety agency, Japan's coast
guard, said the court fined Cho 1.5 million yen (dlrs 10,700).
	   Two other Korean crew members, convicted of joining in the
attack on the official, were sentenced to 18 months, suspended for
three years, on charges of obstructing coast guard authorities from
performing their duties, he said.
	   Yatsushiro said the officer was injured in the face when
Japanese patrol boats seized the Korean trawler Jan. 20 off
Nagasaki, on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu.
	   Kyodo News agency quoted presiding Judge Keizo Yamamto as saying
the current fisheries agreement between Japan and South Korea does
not restrict Japan's jurisdiction or control over its 12-mile
territorial waters.
	   The Fishing Agency said Japan adopted the ``straight baselines''
concept effective Jan. 1, 1997, to determine its territorial waters
under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. Drawing lines from
islands and the tips of capes has enlarged Japan's claimed
territorial waters.
	   South Korea does not recognize Japan's claims.
	   Kyodo said defense lawyers argued that Japan has no right to
police South Korean boats operating in the newly declared waters
because the Japan-Korea agreement takes priority over domestic laws
on territorial waters.
	   In Seoul, an official of South Korea's trade ministry expressed
regret that the court had ruled against the Korean fishermen.
	   ``We will continue to closely watch the legal procedures
involving the Manguho No. 3,'' said Choi Sung-ho, of the ministry's
Treaties Bureau. He noted that similar cases are coming up in
Japanese appelate courts.

Montgomerie puts U.S. hecklers behind him 
</HEADLINE>
By ALAN PAGE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GUYANCOURT, France (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie is accustomed to
being asked why he is so unlucky in the United States. Now, he has
to live with being unloved.
	   After finishing tied 18th in last week's U.S. Open at San
Francisco's Olympic Club, where he faced galleries so hostile they
justified the police protection he was given, the Scot flew into Le
Bourget airport by private plane Wednesday to prepare for the dlrs
800,000 French Open.
	   He was hoping to put his latest U.S. experience behind him in
the tournament which starts Thursday and ends Sunday.
	   ``I've always loved playing in the States. And I had four years
in college in Houston and loved every minute of it,'' Montgomerie
said Wednesday at the National Golf Club. ``But obviously last week
was not one of my happiest experiences.''
	   A runner-up at the Open last year and in 1994, Montgomerie is
determined to draw strength from being targeted by hecklers.
	   ``I am obviously a threat and they see that,'' Montgomerie said.
``And that is a compliment. I just wish it would come out a bit
better than it does. Even if it was blown a little bit out of
proportion.''
	   ``Generally speaking, the American public is very appreciative.
It's just the loud minority, as usual, which gets the headlines.
And when apparently I'm being blamed personally for the (U.S.) loss
of the Ryder Cup, it's difficult to do anything about it.''
	   He denied that the Olympic Club rowdies would change his
attitude toward playing in the United States.
	   ``I'll get over for the U.S. P.G.A. with the same attitude I've
always had. After all, not to play well and still finish in the
top-20 in the U.S. Open has to be a fair achievement. And I'll get
that title one day, I'm sure.''
	   More immediately, Montgomerie is facing four weeks of top-class
tournament play, following up the French Open _ where he is
receiving a dlrs 60,000 appearance fee _ with the Irish Open, and
the Loch Lomond International before culminating with the British
Open at Birkdale, England.
	   Victory over the 6,510-meter (7,112-yard), par-72, National
Albatros course would earn Montgomerie dlrs 133,000 and boost him
from sixth to second in the European money-list, behind England's
Lee Westwood who is resting.
	   Germany's Bernhard Langer, Argentina's Eduardo Romero and
defending champion Retief Goosen from South Africa also line up.

Indonesian dissident doubts new president's power to reform 
</HEADLINE>
By ANNE PANDOLFI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Despite the resignation of Indonesia's
autocratic President Suharto, the country is still volatile, one of
Indonesia's leading dissidents said Wednesday.
	   New president B.J. Habibie should move to calm the volatility by
quickly holding free and fair elections, said Pius Lustrilanang.
But, he said, ``We are very afraid that Habibie can't make genuine
reform. Everything can happen in the next few months.''
	   Lustrilanang, speaking at a forum of the Stockholm-based
Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, urged the United
States to help push the reform process by tying economic aid to
political changes.
	   ``The U. S. government can at least put several conditions for
full aid to Indonesia, such as improvement of democracy and human
rights. We hope that the government can push Habibie to conduct
real and fair elections with full international standards,''
	   He also expressed doubts about whether the International
Monetary Fund would grant aid to Indonesia in the near future
because of concerns about Habibie's capacity and intent to
implement reforms.
	   Lustrilanang, secretary-general of the pro-democracy group
ALDERA, was kidnapped Feb. 4 while waiting for a bus in the capital
city of Jakarta. Two months of torture and interrogation followed,
including electrical shocks, beating, kicking, and a constantly
blaring radio, he said.
	   He was released April 3, little more than a month before Suharto
stepped down in the wake of massive unrest. Despite being warned
not to speak about the torture, Lustrilanang spoke out and then
fled the country.
	   Lustrilanang said he plans to return to Indonesia in August.
	   ``I want to celebrate Indonesian Independence Day for the first
time in my life, without Suharto. I love my country and I have to
deal with its problems even if it's too risky for me,'' he said.

Arafat says he considers Cabinet as having resigned 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
indicated for the first time Wednesday that he has accepted the
resignation of most of his Cabinet _ submitted nearly a year ago
amid allegations of widespread corruption.
	   In a letter to the Palestinian legislative council, Arafat
referred to the group of ministers as ``a Cabinet that has
resigned,'' said legislator Marwan Barghouti.
	   In the letter, Arafat requested and was given another two weeks
to form a new Cabinet, Barghouti said.
	   The legislators initially had set Thursday as a deadline for
Arafat to complete the reshuffle. The council has threatened to
vote on a motion of no-confidence in the government unless Arafat
presented a new Cabinet quickly.
	   Last August, 16 of 18 Cabinet ministers had submitted their
resignations to Arafat following reports of corruption in
government ministries. Arafat never said whether he accepted the
resignation and the makeup of the Cabinet remained largely the
same.

EU clears Citicorp-Travelers Group merger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European regulators on Wednesday
cleared the planned merger of the financial services concern
Travelers Group with the U.S. banking company Citicorp without
demanding any changes.
	   The deal announced in April would be the biggest corporate
merger ever, valuing each company at about dlrs 73 billion.
	   The European Union Commission said in a statement that despite
its size, the deal ``does not create a dominant player on the
European market.''
	   Travelers activities in Europe focus on securities and
derivatives trading while Citicorp's activities ``are focused
mainly on commercial banking services,'' the Commission said.
	   ``Thus, in Europe the transaction will combine highly
complementary operations and result in only minor overlaps of
fragmented markets with numerous, large and well-established
multinational competitors,'' the agency said.
	   Under EU rules, the European Commission has broad powers to
order changes in corporate ventures of European and non-European
companies if it feels these will harm fair trade within the
15-nation EU.

POSCO cancels investment in China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Pohang Iron and Steel Co., South
Korea's largest steel maker, has canceled plans to build two plants
in China at a cost of dlrs 117 million, company officials said
Wednesday.
	   The company had planned to build a plant in Dairen in northeast
China to produce steel plates used in beverage cans and another in
Guangdong province in southeast China to make plates for use in
electronic transformers.
	   But the Korean steel maker said in a statement Wednesday that
sluggish sales at home and South Korea's severe financial crisis
made it difficult to raise new funds.
	   POSCO currently runs two joint-venture plants in China producing
200,000 tons a year of steel sheets used in cars and home
appliances. Three other plants are under construction, and will
produce 260,000 tons of similar products when completed by the end
of this year.
	   Last week, the Korean company said it will cut production this
year by 6.4 percent to some 25 million tons. Steel demand in South
Korea has fallen sharply as car makers and construction companies
faced sluggish sales.
	   POSCO is the world's second largest steel maker after Nippon
Steel of Japan, which produced 26.9 million tons last year.

Ex-Israeli agent wanted by Norway in botched 1973 Mossad murder prime minister.

Eds: CORRECTS time element in 5th graf; ADDS comment from Norwegian
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A quarter-century after Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency killed the wrong man in a botched
assassination, Norway has issued an arrest warrant for a retired
Israeli agent suspected in the murder.
	   On July 21, 1973, Moroccan waiter Ahmed Bouchikhi was shot and
killed as he returned from the movies with his pregnant Norwegian
wife in the town of Lillehammer.
	   A small team of Israeli hit men apparently mistook Bouchikhi for
Hassan Salameh, a PLO intelligence chief suspected of masterminding
the killing of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
Five men identified as Mossad agents served brief prison terms for
the shooting and were then pardoned.
	   However, Norway has long suspected that the mastermind of the
killing was a top Mossad agent named Mike Harari, who was never
charged.
	   Public prosecutor Lasse Qvigstad on Wednesday said Norway was
seeking the arrest of Harari, now 71 and retired, through the
international police organization Interpol on charges of being an
accessory to murder.
	   ``We will ask that he be sought internationally as someone who
is suspected in the Lillehammer murder 25 years ago,'' Qvigstad
said. ``There is reason to suspect him and the statute of
limitation was about to run out.''
	   A 25-year statute of limitations on the crime expires in less
than one month. By charging Harari now, prosecutors extended the
time limit by another 25 years under Norwegian law.
	   In November 1997, Norway asked Israeli for permission to take a
formal deposition from Harari in an Israeli court. That request
came weeks after the investigation was reopened because of reports
that top Norwegian officials had been told of Harari's possible
involvement a month after the killing, but failed to act.
	   Since Israel rejected that request, Qvigstad said Norway has now
issued an arrest warrant for Harari.
	   Norwegian news media predicted that Israel could react to the
charges as a political slap. Commentators said that could worsen
relations between the Jewish state and the small country that
brokered a 1993 Israel-PLO peace accord.
	   But Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik said the arrest order
was a purely legal matter decided by the prosecutor, which is
independent of the government.
	   ``We have nothing to do with these charges whatsoever,'' he said
when asked about the case at his regular half-year news conference.
	   About two years ago, the Israeli government agreed to pay
compensation to Bouchikhi's family, but stopped short of accepting
responsibility for the attack.

EU unveils dlrs 110 billion transport network for EU newcomers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission unveiled a dlrs
110 billion blueprint Wednesday to upgrade roads, railways, air and
seaports in 11 East European nations that have asked to join the
European Union.
	   EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said the bulk of the
costs of 100 billion European currency units must be borne by the
would-be EU members.
	   He estimated it would cost them 1.5 percent of their annual
gross domestic product between now and 2015 to bring the ambitious
scheme to reality.
	   The plan he unveiled is designed to build or upgrade 18,000
kilometers of roads, 20,290 kilometers of rail line, 38 airports,
13 sea ports and 14 river ports.
	   The projects span 10 nations _ Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania
and Bulgaria _ that expect to join the EU in the decade ahead.
	   In recent years, the EU has provided them with 1 billion
European currency units (dlrs 1.1 billion) in infrastructure aid.
	   Kinnock said between now and 2000, that will go to 500 million
ecus (dlrs 550 million) a year, but made clear ``the applicant
countries will have to shoulder the major share of the cost of
developing the network while coping with intense pressures on their
public finances.''
	   He said that was key to a successful integration of Eastern
Europe into the EU.
	   ``Borders cannot open properly and goods and people will not
move freely unless the roads, railways, airports and ports of ...
East Europe are functioning effectively,'' Kinnock said.

Holocaust survivors press claims against German banks

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Flanked by lawyers, a Holocaust
survivor visited the gleaming skyscraper offices of Germany's two
biggest financial institutions Wednesday to press claims that
Deutsche and Dresdner banks laundered assets of Nazi victims.
	   Michal Schonberger, 69, is one of 10,000 plaintiffs in a dlrs 18
billion lawsuit filed in New York early this month, claiming the
two banks knowingly accepted, laundered or sold their property _
cash, securities, art and family heirlooms.
	   His U.S. and German lawyers, Ed Fagan and Michael Witti
respectively, brought Schonberger to separate press conferences
outside the banks' offices in Frankfurt, Germany's financial
capital.
	   ``One of the reasons for showing these people publicly is to
show these banks that this is a sensitive matter. They have to see
the faces,'' said Fagan, who has also represented plaintiffs in
similar lawsuits against the German insurance company Alliance and
Swiss banks.
	   The German banks said Wednesday they were continuing
investigations begun last year into assets dating from World War
II, but declined to make any detailed comments on the issue.
	   Deutsche Bank ignored Schonberger and his lawyers. But at
Dresdner Bank, spokeswoman Gabriele Eick invited Schonberger in for
a brief talk with bank officials while the lawyers waited outside.
	   Schonberger, a New York resident, said the meeting was
``friendly'' but that he learned nothing new about assets his
family lost to the Nazis.
	   On his first trip to Germany since the Holocaust, Schonberger
described his family's deportation to Auschwitz and how a Nazi
soldier yanked gold teeth from his father's mouth before he was
taken away to his death.
	   In the lawsuit, looted assets include dental fillings and other
gold taken from Jews by the Nazis, resmelted and sold to the
private banks.
	   U.S. historian Jonathan Steinberg, who is reviewing Deutsche
Bank records, said earlier this month that the bank bought gold
from the Nazi government's Reichsbank, and that the purchases
probably included gold from Holocaust victims.
	   But Steinberg said there was no way Deutsche Bank could have
known the gold's origin.
	   Deutsche Bank announced in March it was donating 5.6 million
marks (dlrs 3.1 million) in proceeds from a 1995 gold sale to
Jewish foundations, because of suspicions the gold may have been
robbed from Jews.
	   Fagan says evidence of the banks' alleged wrongdoing comes from
archives in the United States, Germany and other countries, and
reports from commissions investigating lost wartime assets. He says
the banks have until July 4 to respond to the complaint before a
trial date is considered.

Bulgaria, Poland join protest over Belarus diplomatic compound 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Bulgaria and Poland recalled their
ambassadors to Belarus on Wednesday, joining seven other countries
in a protest against the government's attempt to evict diplomats
from the compound where they live.
	   The ambassadors from the United States, Britain, Germany,
France, Greece, Italy and Japan left Belarus earlier this week to
consult with their governments over the dispute.
	   Poland's Ambassador Mariusz Maszkiewicz was leaving Thursday,
and Bulgaria's ambassador Marko Ganchev was to follow on Friday.
	   President Alexander Lukashenko's government has been trying for
weeks to evict the ambassadors from their homes on the wooded
outskirts of Minsk. Officials say that the houses need urgent sewer
and plumbing repairs.
	   But the countries maintain that violates international law,
which designates ambassadors' home as the territory of their home
countries. The host country must ask permission to enter and cannot
demand that residents leave.

Rusedski pulls out of Wimbledon with ankle problems 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Greg Rusedski, fourth seeded this year
and a quarterfinalist last year, pulled out of Wimbledon Wednesday
when his badly sprained left ankle failed to respond to treatment,
chief referee Alan Mills said.
	   The Canadian-born Briton was scheduled Wednesday to complete his
match against Australian Mark Draper, a match that was cut short
Tuesday by rain.
	   Rusedski won the first set 6-4, dropped the second 6-2 as he
began to limp badly. Draper was up a break at 5-4 in the third when
play was called.
	   Rusedski injured the ankle almost two weeks ago in a bad fall
during the Queen's tournament, a traditional grass-court warmup for
Wimbledon.
	   The left-handed Rusedski and fellow Briton Tim Henman both
reached the quarterfinals last year and have been billed as
Britain's great hope to win its first men's singles title since
1936.
	   He practiced earlier Wednesday, then said there was no swelling
and he intended to play.

Eds: UPDATES with Yassin reportedly leaving Cairo, arrival delayed;
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin, a
thorn in the side to both Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israel, was set to return Wednesday to the Gaza Strip.
	   However, the sheik's departure from Cairo, where he had been
receiving medical treatment, was delayed by several hours, and he
was not expected to arrive at the border crossing until early
evening.
	   In Gaza City, well-wishers gathered at the home of the
62-year-old spiritual leader o f Hamas, who is quadriplegic and has
hearing and vision problems.
	   A freshly spray-painted graffiti on a nearby wall proclaimed:
``The Islamic nation is very proud of Ahmed Yassin who ... can lead
the nation to victory from his wheelchair.''
	   During a four-month fundraising tour of nearly a dozen Arab
capitals, Yassin has raised millions of dollars for the Islamic
militant group Hamas that vehemently opposes peace with Israel.
	   Yassin also made fiery statements _ widely reported in Israel _
praising suicide bombers and calling on Palestinians to carry on an
armed struggle against the Jewish state.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai left it open until
the last minute whether Israel would allow Yassin to return to the
Gaza Strip. Israel controls Gaza's external borders.
	   However, Israeli officials have said they considered Yassin more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his movements can be
monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Yassin left Gaza in late February, ostensibly on a short trip to
obtain medical treatment. Instead, he embarked on a tour of the
Arab world.
	   In recent months, Yassin has posed a growing challenge to
Arafat's authority. Public opinion polls suggest Palestinian
support for Hamas has crept upward in recent months as the peace
process _ supported by Arafat's Palestinian Authority _ has
remained at an impasse.
	   This marks Yassin's second triumphal homecoming to Gaza in nine
months. Israel was forced to release him from prison in September
to buy the freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents who were caught
trying to kill another Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
	   Yassin had served eight years of a life term for ordering the
killings of Israeli soldiers and Palestinians accused of
collaborating with the Israelis.
	   Arafat's camp blamed an internal Hamas feud for the death of
chief bombmaker Mohiyadine Sharif, who was found dead March 29 at
the scene of a massive car-bomb blast in the West Bank town of
Ramallah.
	   But Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz Rantisi blamed the Palestinian
Authority and several high-ranking Palestinian officials and
security chiefs for collaborating with Israel in Sharif's death.
	   Rantisi was arrested in April and charged with endangering
national security. Earlier this month, the Palestinian Supreme
Court released Rantisi for lack of evidence, but he remains jailed.
	   Palestinian security forces routinely ignore court orders and
keep detainees in custody until their release is personally
approved by Arafat.
	   Last week, Hamas spurned an offer to join Arafat's Cabinet.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police jumped a man and wrestled him
into submission on the roof of a house Wednesday after he
threatened to kill himself and his 3-year-old son.
	   The dramatic arrest of Pramual Khunmee, 28, a window worker who
police believe was under the influence of amphetamines, was
broadcast repeatedly on Thai television throughout the day.
	   Pramual was holding his son, Chirawut, with one arm and appeared
to be undergoing spasms when police who had been negotiating with
him for two hours leaped atop him.
	   One officer wrestled away the crying child and other handcuffed
Pramual and arrested him. No one appeared to be hurt. Police said
Pramual would be charged with trespassing, at a minimum.

	   The three _ a woman and two men _ had sought shelter during a
heavy downpour late Tuesday inside a covered bus stop on a mountain
road in Bontoc, Mountain province, when the side of the mountain
behind the shed collapsed on them.
	   They had been stranded by an earlier landslide that blocked the
road and were waiting for workers to clear it when the second
landslide hit, the Philippine Information Agency said.
	   The woman died on the way to a hospital, but the two others were
already dead when local residents dug them out from under the rocks
and mud, it said.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian political leader
Ibrahim Rugova appealed Wednesday for NATO to use its military
might to end the worsening violence in the secessionist Serbian
province.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told Rugova he would rather
avert the need to implement existing plans military intervention in
Kosovo, including air raids, and told the Albanian leader to resume
talks with the Serbian leadership.
	   ``I urged for some kind of protection in Kosovo so that massive
massacres and massive ethnic cleansing is prevented,'' Rugova told
reporters after his meeting with Solana.
	   Rugova said Serb forces were still shelling villages in the
southern province, where the population is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed
this year in fighting between Serb forces and separatist fighters.
	   Rugova, who represents the more moderate branch of separatism in
Kosovo, reiterated his demand for Kosovo's independence, with
guarantees for the local, minority Serb population.
	   ``Kosovo has the right to become independent as it's part of a
country that has dissolved,'' he said.
	   NATO officials said Solana told him the alliance continues to
oppose Kosovo's independence and would prefer the reestablishment
of the province's autonomy within Yugoslavia.
	   Solana insisted forcefully that Rugova should resume talks with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, without making independence
for Kosovo a pre-condition, said one official, who spoke on NATO's
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Milosevic must agree to withdraw from Kosovo all troops that are
normally stationed outside the province and allow refugees to
return to their homes, the official added.
	   NATO ambassadors Tuesday and Wednesday reviewed plans for air
strikes and other possible military action.
	   The planners are looking at three categories of possible action:
intensification of NATO maneuvers and advisory missions to Kosovo's
neighbors, Macedonia and Albania; deployment of NATO troops to
those nations to prevent the violence spreading; armed
intervention, including air strikes or, as a last resort, ground
troops.
	   Rugova met later Wednesday with Robert Gelbard, the U.S
administration's Balkans negotiator.

Iraq, Iran sign pact to resolve POW issue 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Iran have signed a deal that Iraq
says will resolve their longstanding dispute over prisoners of war.
	   The agreement was reached following a week of talks in Baghdad
between senior Iraqi officials and a visiting Iranian delegation
headed by Abdullah al-Najafi, head of Iran's POW commission, the
official Iraqi News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   But the agency gave no further details and al-Najafi, who left
Baghdad on Wednesday, declined to comment.
	   Al-Najafi arrived in Baghdad last week with a list of thousands
of Iranian POWs Tehran claims are still held by Iraq.
	   Iraq has long maintained that it has released all Iranian
prisoners and was reportedly angered by the new list.
	   In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three
POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees.
	   It was the largest repatriation of Iranian and Iraqi POWs since
1990, said the International Committee of the Red Cross, which
supervised the swap. The Red Cross says it knows of several
thousand Iraqis in Iran, but it is not aware of more Iranian POWs
in Iraq.
	   The Iran-Iraq war, in which more than more than 1 million people
were killed or wounded, ended in 1988.
	   The issue of POWs has long stood in the way of better ties.

Military blocks labor union protest in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of soldiers blocked workers
from staging an anti-government protest at the national Parliament
Wednesday.
	   A standoff with the military developed after about 200
demonstrators gathered at the office of the Indonesian Prosperity
Trade Union.
	   The army stopped a fleet of buses that had been chartered to
take them to the legislature, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) away.
	   Soldiers, armed with automatic weapons, tear gas and sticks,
also blocked a main road and prevented another 100 workers from
reaching the union's office. Unable to get to the office, some
protesters threatened to stage a street march.
	   ``We've blocked them because they want to march to the
Parliament,'' said south Jakarta military chief Lt. Col. Ibrahim
Saleh.
	   Protesters chanted and waved banners at the troops, but the
situation remained peaceful.
	   At one stage, a line of workers stood within five meters (16
feet) of a line of soldiers.
	   ``We want to go to the Parliament. But the army won't give us
permission. We are negotiating with them,'' said Agus Edi, a
protest organizer.
	   The protest had been called by the union's leader, Muchtar
Pakpahan, a former political prisoner released by new President
B.J. Habibie last month.
	   Earlier this week, organizers predicted that thousands of
workers would take part.
	   But only a fraction of the predicted number turned out Wednesday
after the army warned that it would ``cripple'' the demonstration.
	   Those who showed up wore blue headbands and carried dozens of
banners. ``People are hungry now,'' read one.
	   The protest broke up after about four hours. There were no
injuries or arrests.
	   Protests have become an almost daily occurrence in Jakarta in
recent weeks.
	   Habibie replaced longtime autocrat Suharto as president in May.
Since then, Habibie has promised sweeping political and economic
changes as the world's fourth most populous nation grapples with
its worst financial crisis in decades.
	   Unemployment and inflation are soaring and poverty rates are
predicted to rise dramatically.
	   Organizers of Wednesday's protest said they wanted Habibie, a
close associate of Suharto, to step down so that the reform process
could be accelerated.
	   Despite the blocking of the workers' protest, police and troops
allowed about 500 students to stage an hour-long demonstration at
Parliament.
	   The student protesters demanded the resignation of lawmakers
they accused of being corrupt.
	   At Belawan, a port town on the northern end of Sumatra Island,
about 1,400 kilometers (900 miles) northwest of Jakarta, a mob
burned a warehouse and six boats after an anti-government protest
turned violent Wednesday.
	   No injuries were reported.
	   Police said about 500 people had earlier marched on a local
government building, protesting against what they complained was a
lack of official action in the unsolved case of three children
allegedly kidnapped three years ago.

Uzbekistan urges Europe to help it stem drug traffic 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Uzbekistan's president said Wednesday
modern know-how and equipment were needed to help former Soviet
republics in Central Asia stem drug trafficking to western Europe.
	   Uzebek President Islam Karimov urged the European Union to help
former Soviet republics in central Asia stop the flow of narcotics
over their borders.
	   ``Help us close the way of drugs to Europe,'' Islam Karimov told
reporters at a news conference. ``We need modern know-how and
equipment.''
	   Karimov is on a three-day visit to Bulgaria, where he met his
Bulgarian counterpart, Petar Stoyanov and signed a treaty of
friendship and cooperation.
	   Bulgarian and Uzbek government officials signed a package of 6
accords in trade, investment, tourism, culture and transport meant
to boost ties between oil-rich Uzbekistan and Bulgaria.
	   Uzbekistan, along with its neighboring countries of Kirghizstan,
Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan gained indpendence when the
former Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
	   But according to Karimov, their borders only exist on paper and
customs and controls are very loose. He said that 50 to 60 percent
of all narcotics sold in Europe were smuggled from neighboring
Afghanistan over their borders and on to the West.
	   ``Drugs sold by the gram in Europe, pass through our borders by
the ton,'' Karimov said.
	   Afghanistan has been wracked by civil war and lack of a central
government for over a decade, which has allowed drug production to
thrive and even ``attain the nature of a planned economy,'' Karimov
said.

Syria extradites 16 Algerian Islamic activists to Algeria 
</HEADLINE>
By MARIAM SAMI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Syria has extradited at least 16 Algerian
Islamic activists to Algeria, apparently under a new anti-terrorism
pact between Arab countries, activists said Wednesday.
	   The 16 men, some of whom had lived in Syria since 1992, were
deported earlier this month, Sheik Omar Bakry Mohammed, leader of
the London-based al-Muhajiroun (the Emigrants) group, said.
	   The group, which is banned in Syria, does not have affiliation
to any country but says it represents the interests of Muslims in
the Arab world.
	   The deportees were members of Algeria's fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front whose loss to the military-backed government in the
1992 elections sparked the current bloodbath that has claimed at
least 75,000 lives.
	   A spokesman for Liberty for the Muslim World, an Islamic
watchdog also based in London, confirmed the figures, adding that
Syria had sent to Algeria a smaller batch earlier. The spokesman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, could got give other details.
	   The reports could not be immediately confirmed in either Algeria
or Syria.
	   But if true, the extradition would appear to be the result of
the pact signed by 22 Arab countries on April 22 to deny refuge,
training and financial or military support to groups that launch
attacks on other Arab nations.
	   Islamic groups say the governments are using the pact to deny
Muslims their religious right to campaign against corruption and to
install Islamic rule.
	   Speaking to The Associated Press in Cairo, Mohammed, a Syrian
who now has British citizenship, said that Saudi Arabia, Jordan and
Syria began extraditing Islamic activists to their respective
countries in April. He gave no details.
	   Yemen _ a haven for Islamic extremists from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi
Arabia, Algeria, and Syria _ is expected to send scores of them
back home soon, he said.
	   Mohammed said Saudi Arabia extradited to Egypt Saeed Sayyed
Salama, a top aide to Osama Bin Laden, the Afghanistan-based
financier of Islamic extremists worldwide.
	   Salama, who was brought to Egypt earlier this week, was a member
of the Islamic Jihad, which assassinated President Anwar Sadat in
1981. He left Egypt in the early 1990's after the government's
crackdown on the group's members. He is expected to stand trial
soon on charges of attempting to overthrow the government.
	   Mohammed said that Jordan also extradited three wanted Egyptian
militants.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey called Wednesday on Britain to stop
what it called the ``tension building'' military activities on
Cyprus by the Greek Cypriots and Greece.
	   Relinquishing its colonial rule over Cyprus in 1960, Britain
became a guarantor of the island's independence together with
Greece and Turkey.
	   ``It has been requested from the guarantor state Britain to
spend every possible effort to stop these activities,'' a Foreign
Ministry statement said.
	   Tension has been running high on the Mediterranean island since
the Greek Cypriot government announced plans last year to deploy
Russian anti-aircraft missiles. Greek and Turkish warplanes flew to
the the island last week in a show of force.
	   The statement said the opening of an air base by Greek Cypriots
for the use of Greek warplanes and the building of a naval base
have added to the tensions.
	   Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash accused Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides of warmongering, the English-language
Turkish Daily News reported Wednesday.
	   ``I appeal to Clerides again, if blood is shed on the island
because of these missiles, he will be solely responsible for this.
This is warmongering,'' Denktash said.

Report: Chinese aerospace executive spent two days in Hong Kong jail 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An aerospace executive who has been identified
as the source of Chinese campaign contributions to the U.S.
Democratic Party spent two days in a Hong Kong jail in 1996, the
Far Eastern Economic Review reports.
	   The weekly, in a statement previewing its latest edition, quoted
intelligence officials as saying Liu Chaoying tried to leave the
territory in 1996 on false Hong Kong travel documents. At that
time, Hong Kong still was under British rule.
	   It said records of the arrest appeared to have been erased from
Hong Kong police files, and were with British intelligence.
	   Liu, a Chinese citizen with right of abode in Hong Kong, handled
public relations for China Great Wall Co. and in 1994 joined China
Aerospace International Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong-listed company.
Both companies are subsidiaries of the state-run China Aerospace
Corp.
	   Liu Chaoying is the daughter of retired Gen. Liu Huaqing, who
was the highest-ranking member of the military and a representative
in the ruling Communist Party Politburo.
	   As vice president of China Aerospace International, Liu
befriended Democratic Party fund-raiser Johnny Chung.
	   Chung claims Liu gave him U.S. dlrs 300,000 from the Chinese
military in 1996, U.S. dlrs 100,000 of which ended up in Democratic
Party coffers.
	   Chung pleaded guilty in March to charges he made illegal
contributions. He awaits sentencing in July.
	   Chung has told prosecutors that Ms. Liu told him that the funds
came from Chinese intelligence and were for political
contributions. In the summer of 1996, Chung arranged to have Liu
photographed with Clinton at a Los Angeles fund-raiser.
	   Liu has repeatedly denied making the donation.

Minister: Coffee production down 50 percent in Kenya in past decade 
</HEADLINE>
By PATRICK MAJUTE
<TEXT>
	   RUIRU, Kenya (DOW JONES) _ Coffee production in Kenya has
declined by 50 percent in the past decade from a record 129,000
metric tons in the 1987-88 season to about 65,000 metric tons for
the 1996-97 season, Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi said
Wednesday.
	   Speaking at opening day ceremonies of the Kenya Coffee College
at the Coffee Research Foundation, the minister attributed the
decline to a lack of interest among farmers, crippling interest
rates on borrowing, poor management of cooperatives and bad
weather.
	   He said appropriate measures had to be taken quickly to reverse
the negative trend.
	   ``The trend does not only militate against the government's
policy of tripling coffee production by the year 2000, but also
deprives the country of the much-needed foreign exchange as well as
denying farmers increased farm incomes,'' Mudavadi said.
	   Along with tea and tourism receipts, coffee is one of Kenya's
three main sources of hard currency earnings.
	   Mudavadi commended foundation for its role in Kenya's coffee
industry.
	   ``Indeed, coffee research has been the driving force behind
coffee development in the country and will continue to do so as the
era of industrialization takes root in the country, coupled with
the current trend towards liberalization of the agricultural
sector,'' he said.
	   Frustrated by the 29 percent interest rates on bank loans, late
payments for coffee and growing chaos as the coffee sector moves
towards complete liberalization, Kenyan coffee farmers are moving
towards horticulture. Thin green beans and cut flowers are growth
sectors.
	   On Tuesday, one man was killed and another injured in a
five-hour battle that took place during an abortive annual general
meeting of the Kabare Coffee Cooperative Society in central Kenya,
the East African Standard said.
	   The fight began when attackers pretending to be coffee farmers
and police disrupted the proceedings, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A quarter-century after Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency killed the wrong man in a botched
assassination, Norway has issued an arrest warrant for a retired
Israeli agent suspected in the murder.
	   On July 21, 1973, Moroccan waiter Ahmed Bouchikhi was shot and
killed as he returned from the movies with his pregnant Norwegian
wife in the town of Lillehammer.
	   A small team of Israeli hit men apparently mistook Bouchikhi for
Hassan Salameh, a PLO intelligence chief suspected of masterminding
the killing of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
Five men identified as Mossad agents served brief prison terms for
murder and were then pardoned.
	   However, Norway has long suspected that the mastermind of the
killing was a top Mossad agent named Mike Harari, who was never
charged.
	   Public prosecutor Lasse Qvigstad on Wednesday said Norway was
seeking the arrest of Harari, now 71 and retired, through the
international police organization Interpol on charges of being an
accessory to murder.
	   ``We will ask that he be sought internationally as someone who
is suspected in the Lillehammer murder 25 years ago,'' Qvigstad
said. ``There is reason to suspect him and the statute of
limitation was about to run out.''
	   A 25-year statute of limitations on the crime expires in less
than one month. By charging Harari now, prosecutors extended the
time limit by another 25 years under Norwegian law.
	   In November 1997, Norway asked Israeli for permission to take a
formal deposition from Harari in an Israeli court. That request
came weeks after the investigation was reopened because of reports
that top Norwegian officials had been told of Harari's possible
involvement a month after the killing, but failed to act.
	   Israel rejected that request, and Norway issued an arrest
warrant.
	   Norwegian news media said the warranr could worsen relations
between the Jewish state and the small country that brokered a 1993
Israel-PLO peace accord.
	   Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik said the arrest order was a
purely legal matter decided by the prosecutor, which is independent
of the government.
	   ``We have nothing to do with these charges whatsoever,'' he said
when asked about the case at his regular half-year news conference.
	   About two years ago, the Israeli government agreed to pay
compensation to Bouchikhi's family, but stopped short of accepting
responsibility for the attack.

Eds: Updates with Ivanisevic, Caprati victories; Rusedski
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ A top men's title contender withdrew
with an injury Wednesday, while two struggling former favorites
began their Wimbledon comebacks in winning style.
	   Fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski, a quarterfinalist last year, pulled
out with an ankle injury before the resumption of his rain-delayed
match.
	   Rusedski, who damaged ligaments in his left ankle in a fall at
the Queen's Club tournament two weeks ago, was limping Monday as he
split the first two sets with Mark Draper and was down a break at
5-4 in the third.
	   The Canadian-born Briton practiced Wednesday morning and said he
was ready to play. But he changed his mind a few hours later.
	   ``I thought it would get better,'' he said. ``I thought when it
got warmed up it would get better. Unfortunatley, it didn't happen.
But there is always next year.''
	   Rusedski, who has the fastest serve in the game, had been rated
one of the top favorites for the title. His withdrawal leaves No.
12 Tim Henman as Britain's best hope for its first men's Wimbledon
champion since 1936.
	   Early winners Wednesday included two players with a lot to prove
_ men's No. 14 seed Goran Ivanisevic and women's wild card entry
Jennifer Capriati.
	   Capriati won her first Grand Slam match in five years,
overcoming nine foot-faults to defeat Australia's Nicole Pratt 6-4,
3-6, 6-4.
	   It was Capriati's first Wimbledon appearance since reaching the
quarterfinals in 1993. Since then, she's played in only five other
Grand Slam events and lost in the first round each time.
	   ``It's great to be back here,'' Capriati said. ``It brings back
a lot of good memories. I was really pumped up. I was really
excited to be out there.''
	   In 1991, Capriati became the youngest ever women's Wimbledon
semifinalist at 15 years, 95 days. But her career nosedived after
problems with drugs and injuries.
	   ``Right now I want it pretty bad,'' she said. ``I'm really
focused and determined to play well.''
	   Capriati, 22, said she has no regrets and feels in control of
her life.
	   ``Whatever I'm doing it's whatever I want to be doing,'' she
said. ``I just try to be happy off the court as well as on the
court, to keep a balance.''
	   Ivanisevic, a two-time Wimbledon finalist who had won only one
match in his last five Grand Slam tournaments, beat Grant Stafford
6-3, 6-3, 6-2 in just one hour, 19 minutes.
	   ``I can beat anybody when I play good here, and I can lose to
some serious bad guys,'' Ivanisevic said. ``You never know with me.
... Not too many people rate me as a favorite or expect me to do
good here. But I feel good. Anything is possible.''
	   Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, No. 3 Monica Seles and No. 4
Steffi Graf were among the women scheduled to play second-round
matches Wednesday.
	   In men's play, defending champion Pete Sampras was due to face
Sweden's Mikael Tillstrom and Andre Agassi was up against Germany's
Tommy Haas.
	   On Tuesday, Venus Williams came within five minutes of being
defaulted when she got lost on the All England Club grounds and
turned up late for her first-round match.
	   ``I could never figure out where Court 13 was,'' the 18-year-old
American said. ``I thought I was playing on Court 18, but I thought
that was Court 13, but no.''
	   Williams said she made it on time but WTA Tour officials
confirmed she was 10 minutes late. A no-show after 15 minutes
results in an automatic default.
	   Winning the match proved easier than finding the court as
Williams cruised to a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Canada's Jana Nejedly _
one of only 14 matches completed on a day disrupted by intermittent
showers.
	   Other women's seeds advancing Tuesday were No. 1 Martina Hingis,
No. 3 Jana Novotna, No. 14 Sandrine Testud and No. 16 Nathalie
Tauziat.
	   The only men's seed to complete a match Tuesday was No. 6
Patrick Rafter, who downed Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuberger, 6-1, 6-2,
4-6, 6-1.
	   Getting past the opening round was a relief for Williams, who
was upset in her first Wimbledon match last year by Magdalena
Grzybowska. Williams lost her only grass-court match this year at
the Wimbledon warmup event at Eastbourne.
	   ``It feels real nice,'' she said. ``It's comforting to know that
I'm doing better.''
	   But Williams isn't doing much different. She remained glued to
the baseline and refused to try the serve-and-volley tactics which
are so effective on grass.
	   ``I wasn't really trying too many things,'' she said. ``My plan
was more or less, make my shots and get off the court before it
rains.''

Naked people arrested near Houses of Parliament

	   LONDON (AP) _ Steven Bangel said he felt more liberated
Wednesday after a naked frolic opposite the House of Lords, but he
wound up in jail after he and three friends ignored orders from the
police to put their clothes on.
	   ``Barbarians, barbarians, this is atrocious!'' shouted Vincent
Bethell, who styled himself as the leader of the Campaign for the
Destruction of Society.
	   ``The people who should be arrested are the people with clothes
on. I'm offended by them. I do not wish to be oppressed,'' he said.
``This nation is dead and festering. It's obvious I'm a peaceful
person and I've done nothing wrong. Hopefully, the truth will come
out in court.''
	   Bethel had led his group in a brisk session of jumping and
dancing, piggyback riding and sunbathing on Abingdon Green.
	   ``I've often felt like stripping off and being naked. I feel
more liberated having done this,'' said Bangel, 18.
	   Police arrested the four men on suspicion of a breach of the
peace, and took them to Charing Cross police station.

UN agency worried about 30,000 ethnic Georgians 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A U.N. food agency expressed worry Wednesday about
the plight of more than 30,000 ethnic Georgians who have fled
fighting between Abkhaz separatists and Georgian militias.
	   The Rome-based World Food Program said it is providing flour and
vegetable oil for an emergency bread-making operation organized by
the Georgian government.
	   Last week Georgia's Edouard Shevardnadze said he and Abkhazian
leader Vladislav Ardzinba would discuss the return of refugees.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
civilians in a 13-month war, and violence has broken out
sporadically since then.
	   WFP said an outbreak of hostilities in an area of southern
Abkhazia last month triggered the new wave of refugees into
Georgia.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Greg Rusedski, fourth seeded this year
and a quarterfinalist last year, pulled out of Wimbledon Wednesday
when his badly sprained left ankle failed to respond to treatment.
	   The Canadian-born Briton _ famed for having tennis' fastest
serve _ was scheduled Wednesday to complete his match against
Australian qualifier Mark Draper, which was cut short Tuesday by
rain.
	   Rusedski won the first set 6-4, dropped the second 6-2 as he
began to limp badly. Draper was up a break at 5-4 in the third when
play was called.
	   Rusedski injured the ankle almost two weeks ago in a bad fall
during the Queen's tournament, a traditional grass-court warmup for
Wimbledon.
	   ``I thought it would get better,'' Rusedski said. ``I thought
when it got warmed up it would get better. Unfortunatley, it didn't
happen. But there is always next year.''
	   ``There was a very good chance for me this year,'' he added. ``I
thought I was playing some of my best tennis.''
	   ``My form was just coming right. But in life these things happen
and they make you stronger.''
	   ATP trainer Bill Norris said earlier Wednesday he expected
Rusedski to be able to play and finish the match, but Rusedski said
the ankle had stiffened up.
	   ``I didn't have the power and force in the foot, I just couldn't
get that,'' Rusedski said.
	   The left-handed Rusedski and fellow Briton Tim Henman both
reached the quarterfinals last year and have been billed as
Britain's great hope to win its first men's singles title since
1936.

Eds: LEADS with OPEC reaching a decision, source saying 1 million
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC reached an agreement today to cut
more barrels of oil from the glutted market, Saudi Arabia's oil
minister said.
	   Saudi minister Ali Naimi made the comments after the producers
held critical talks about boosting severely depressed prices.
	   The cuts will probably be in the range of 1 million to 1.2
million barrels a day _ just what some of the OPEC ministers had
been shooting for _ a Gulf source said on condition of anonymity.
	   Oil futures were modestly higher in London even though OPEC gave
out no immediate confirmation of how sharply it plans to slash
crude output. The new cutbacks will be effective July 1.
	   The Saudi minister, Ali Naimi, told reporters he was ``very
happy'' with the deal, which OPEC hopes will rescue prices that
recently plunged to 12-year lows. Naimi said details would be
announced later in the day.

Survey: Business leaders confident about Hong Kong 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Despite a looming economic recession, most
business leaders responding to a survey were still optimistic about
Hong Kong's future, the polling organization said Wednesday.
	   In a survey conducted by U.S.-based A.C. Nielsen, 91 percent of
the 928 respondents selected from Hong Kong's international
business community said their companies' performance will be
positive over the next three years.
	   The survey did not give the margin of error.
	   Among the respondents were members of Hong Kong's 23
international chambers of commerce.
	   More than 700 companies, or 80 percent of those asked, predicted
a ``very favorable'' business environment in Hong Kong in the next
three years. Of the respondents, 70 percent had their regional
headquarters in Hong Kong, and 88 percent intended to keep Hong
Kong as their base.
	   Hong Kong's economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter of the
year, and officials announced last week that unemployment was at a
15-year high of 4.2 percent. Economic contraction in the second
quarter, which is almost certain, would technically put Hong Kong
in recession.

Japan's Sanyo Securities to liquidate business 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with company confirmation
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sanyo Securities Co., an ailing medium-size
Japanese brokerage house, said Wednesday that it has abandoned
restructuring efforts and plans to halt business.
	   But the securities company said negotiations about a possible
buyout will continue with a foreign financial company that Sanyo
refused to name.
	   Sanyo applied for court protection from creditors last November
as it sought to rebuild its operations under a corporation
rehabilitation law.
	   ``From now on we'll focus on liquidation, although we've put all
efforts on reconstruction since November,'' said Akira Fujishima,
provisional trustee for the brokerage.
	   If no agreement is reached with the unnamed foreign financial
suitor by August, Sanyo will likely dissolve the business by the
end of that month, Fujishima said.
	   As of the end of Japan's fiscal year in March, Sanyo's
liabilities exceeded its assets by some 105.8 billion yen (dlrs 754
million), largely as a result of bad loans held by affiliated
companies, he said.
	   Sanyo expanded its operations aggressively in the late 1980s,
but was hit hard by the collapse of a bubble in Japanese stock and
real estate prices at the outset of this decade.
	   About 1,100 of its more than 2,000 workers have already left the
second-tier brokerage.

Judges rejects disqualification request in bridge collapse trial 
</HEADLINE>
By DANNY BEN-TAL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Judges in the trial over the fatal
collapse of a footbridge at Israel's Maccabiah Games rejected a
request Wednesday by a defense lawyer that the head of the
three-judge panel disqualify herself.
	   Meanwhile, an engineering expert told the Tel Aviv Magistrates
Court that the bridge engineer bore responsibility for allowing
building to proceed despite a faulty design.
	   The bridge buckled as about 100 Australian athletes crossed on
their way to the opening ceremony of the games last July 14. Four
Australian athletes died and dozens were injured after being
plunged into the polluted Yarkon River below.
	   Two contractors, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
director of the games and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee are on trial on charges of negligent homicide and
building without proper permits.
	   The disqualification request came from Abraham Landstein, who is
defending bridge engineer Micha Bar Illan. He asked Edna
Bekenshtein, head of the three-judge panel, to disqualify herself.
	   Landstein told the AP that he believed the judge was acting
under ``pressure from Australia and other places'' to finish the
trial quickly.
	   The other defense lawyers did not support the disqualification
request, which was rejected by the judges.
	   The court heard more testimony Wednesday from Yitzhak Sheinman,
a professor of engineering at Israel's Technion institute, who told
the court earlier this week that a ``chain of failures'' by
designers and builders led to the bridge collapse.
	   In Wednesday's testimony, Sheinman said construction had been
far too speedy, and that the design was slipshod.
	   ``This bridge was constructed in less than a week _ it is
impossible to build a bridge so fast,'' he said. ``The design was
like Lego (children's plastic building blocks), with parts welded
together.''
	   Bar Illan should have supervised the building of the bridge, he
said.
	   ``There was no engineer supervising the project. In this case,
in my opinion, the engineer who planned the bridge is
responsible,'' Sheinman said.
	   He showed the court slides of what he said were faulty elements,
including pipes that had split along weld lines.
	   The trial continues next week, and Sheinman will be
cross-examined by the defense.

Jane's: China to finance Myanmar aircraft purchase 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Myanmar plans to buy seven jet trainers that also
can be used as light attack aircraft in an estimated dlrs 20
million deal financed by China, Jane's Defense Weekly reported
Wednesday.
	   The military-ruled Asian nation, formerly known as Burma, will
be the first export customer for the twin-seat Karakorum-8 jet,
which has been co-developed by China and Pakistan, the respected
military magazine said.
	   Jane's said it was unclear whether the order for seven aircraft
included two jets delivered last October for trial, or would
supplement them to form a half-squadron of nine. The proposed
delivery schedule is not known, it said.
	   The magazine said it was also not yet known whether Myanmar will
have the aircraft fitted with an optional armaments package. That
would include a 23 mm gun pod under the center fuselage and
fittings for PL-7 air-to-air missiles, and 57 mm rockets or bombs
weighing up to 250 kilograms (550 pounds), it said.
	   Sources in the Myanmar capital Yangon, formerly Rangoon, were
quoted as saying the country's Air Force chief, Maj. Gen. Kyaw
Than, visited Beijing earlier this month to finalize the deal.
	   The K-8s are to replace six Super Galebs obtained several years
ago from Yugoslavia, Jane's said.
	   Known as the K-8, the aircraft is being built by China's
Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Company. Pakistan has a 25 percent
share in the program, the magazine said.
	   The first test flight of the K-8 was conducted in late 1990 and
12 aircraft had been delivered by the end of 1996, six each to
China and Pakistan, it said.
	   Prototype and pre-production versions of the K-8 are powered by
an Allied Signal turbofan engine. Beijing acquired 40 of these
engines before the United States cut off further sales because of
concerns over the transfer of technology, Jane's said.

	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Togolese President Gnassigbe Eyadema, who has
ruled this West African country for 31 years, on Wednesday was
declared the winner of Sunday's presidential elections.
	   But the announcement followed the resignation of the head of
Togo's national election commission, saying she had been
intimidated and harassed.
	   The re-election announcement sent thousands of young people
spilling into the streets of Lome, calling for Eyadema's
resignation.
	   ``We want Gilchrist Olympio,'' many demonstrators shouted,
calling out the name of the main opposition candidate.
	   The demonstrators were dispersed after about two hours by
security forces firing tear gas, but fled to a pro-Olympio
neighborhood where they were reportedly blocking streets with
burning tires.
	   Eyadema supporters also briefly drove through Lome celebrating
his victory.

Road accidents one of largest killers in the world says report 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Road accidents will soon kill more
people worldwide than respiratory infection, tuberculosis or AIDS,
the Red Cross said Wednesday.
	   Half a million people die in traffic accidents every year and 15
million are injured, according to the World Disaster Report issued
annually by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies.
	   The Red Cross predicted that that number would keep rising over
the next generation to overtake deaths caused by respiratory
infection, tuberculosis or AIDS, though it did not give current
figures for fatalities caused by those diseases. The World Health
Organization estimated that 2.3 million died of AIDS in 1997.
	   ``Traffic accident problems are very acute in India,'' said
federation president Astrid N. Heiberg who formally released the
report in the Indian capital New Delhi where, according to
newspaper reports, more than 3,000 people were killed in traffic
accidents last year.
	   In developing countries _ where road safety campaigns, driver
training and seat belt legislation are behind those in developed
countries _ road fatalities are higher. Accidents cost developing
countries dlrs 53 billion annually, the report said.
	   ``Traffic accidents already cost the (developing world) almost
as much as all the aid they receive,'' said Heiberg.
	   In Ethiopia, traffic fatalities are a hundred times higher than
in Japan and Australia. The gap reflects the difference in health
facilities and traffic conditions, the report said. Roads in
developing countries are cluttered with pedestrians, bicycles and
animals. Nepal, Bangladesh, China, Swaziland and India follow
Ethiopia as countries with the largest number of accidents.
	   While communities needed to raise awareness about safety, car
manufacturers and governments needed to balance the rights of
people to mobility and safety, the report said.
	   The report said that during the next generation most of the
world's population would be concentrated in urban areas _ but most
relief agencies were geared to rural areas and must prepare for
change.
	   The report also said that humanitarian funding by major donors
worldwide has fallen by 17 percent between 1992-96, posing a
challenge to international relief organizations.
	   Aid from the world's biggest relief providers, the United States
and Japan, fell by 25 percent. Italian aid fell by 40 percent and
Australia, Austria, Canada, France and Portugal also registered
double digit decreases.
	   The Red Cross attributed the slump to the failure of aid
agencies to set specific and achievable goals and to be accountable
to donors and beneficiaries.
	   ``The increasing tendency in donor countries is that people
should fend for themselves,'' Heiberg said. Officials of the Red
Cross suggested some of the funds for relief work should come from
the developing countries themselves.

	   Some ministers said previously that OPEC needed to cut at least
1 million barrels a day. The producers struck a deal in an informal
session involving delegations from all 11 OPEC countries.
	   But after it was over, oil ministers were tight-lipped about
what they had done.
	   ``It's going very well _ I have no other comments,'' Libyan oil
minister Abdalla Salem el-Badri told reporters as he emerged from
the talks held in a Vienna hotel. El-Badri had previously said
anything less than 1 million barrels a day in new production cuts
``will not be enough.''
	   OPEC has not yet formally begun its summer meeting but
apparently has come to a agreement on the main issue: withdrawing
supply from the market.
	   Prices have risen about dlrs 1 per barrel this week on
anticipation of big cutbacks, but one prominent OPEC delegate told
reporters early Wednesday that the producers want an increase of at
least dlrs 4 per barrel.
	   Futures prices moved even higher by midafternoon in London,
where Brent crude oil for delivery in August was up by 32 cents at
dlrs 14.24 per barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. That
added to gains of about dlrs 1 per barrel that have come this week
after OPEC ministers started promoting the idea of bigger
production cuts.
	   Going into today's session, six of the 11 OPEC members had
pledged to cut a total of 620,000 barrels daily from the market _
and they appear to have roughly doubled that promise. Non-OPEC
producers Mexico, Russia, Egypt and Oman had also promised to cut
another 203,000 barrels.
	   Crude oil is the world's most vital commodity and the recent
cheap prices have been a bargain for consumers but a nightmare for
OPEC and other producers.
	   OPEC found itself in a mess this winter when it boosted output
just as the Asian economic crisis led to falling demand.
	   The oil ministers held an emergency meeting in March, agreeing
to cut 1.245 million barrels of daily production. They delivered
most, but not all, of those cuts and prices plunged further,
leading to the latest effort to restrain production further.
	   But even as futures prices were rising, some analysts cautioned
that OPEC still needs to deliver more than words. The once-powerful
group has in recent years shown a marked inability to stick by its
production agreements.
	   ``It's a question of `How much and will they deliver?''' said
Leo Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Center for Global
Energy Studies.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Activity increases at northeastern Japan volcano, eruption possible 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A volcano in northeastern Japan is showing signs of
increasing underground activity and could erupt soon, the Japan
Meteorological Agency said Wednesday.
	   The agency issued the warning to local authorities after a sharp
increase in the number of volcanic tremors at Mount Iwate over the
last several days.
	   Seismic activity has continued to increase since earlier this
year. A total of 1,293 tremors have been registered so far in June,
compared to 424 in March, the agency said.
	   It said the number of average daily tremors registered on
seismographs over the past week was 84, more than twice as many as
the daily average last month, though most of them were too weak to
be felt.
	   The 2,039-meter (6,690-foot) Mount Iwate last erupted in 1939.
It is near Morioka, a city of 278,000 people 460 kilometers (290
miles) north of Tokyo.

Aeroflot gets its first new Boeing jet 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The latest addition to the Aeroflot fleet, a new
Boeing jet, landed in Moscow on Wednesday.
	   The jet is the first of 10 777-200 airplanes that the Russian
airline has bought in a dlrs 400 million contract with the American
airplane manufacturer, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The jet will fly to London and New York five times a week.
	   A Russian crew piloted the jet under the supervision of American
flight instructors in a 10-hour journey from the United States.
	   Aeroflot has frequently leased jets from Boeing to replace
planes in its aging fleet.
	   The Russian government wants to protect the Russian aviation
industry by requiring Russian airlines to buy homemade planes at
the same time as they purchase foreign ones, ITAR-Tass said, citing
Russian Economic Minister Yakov Urinson.

World Cup: Refs become focus of tournament controversies AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ At a World Cup full of scoring and spectacle, the
spotlight has fallen on the one place few want it to touch _ the
referees.
	   Since the start, when a hotly debated hand ball penalty helped
Italy tie Chile, through a series of borderline calls, a rash of
expulsions and even a tongue-lashing from soccer's world boss, the
referees have been unusually prevalent in the outcome of matches.
	   While soccer's world body said it was pleased with the overall
level of officiating, the referees' presence was never more in
focus than on Tuesday, when a pair of questionable whistles helped
send two teams to the second round and two others home.
	   In Nantes, Hungary's Laszlo Vagner nullified a goal by Francois
Omam Biyick that would have put Cameroon ahead of Chile 2-1,
calling teammate Patrick Mboma for pushing off a defender. Replays
showed contact but no clear foul.
	   The resulting 1-1 tie, coupled with Italy's 2-1 victory over
Austria, meant Chile advanced and Cameroon was out.
	   ``We can't really accept this unfair decision,'' defender
Salomon Olembe said. ``The referee will not be welcome in Cameroon
if he wanted to spend a holiday there.''
	   Then in Marseille, Norway beat Brazil 2-1 on a penalty shot by
Kjetil Rekdal with a minute left after referee Esse Baharmast of
the United States called a foul on Junior Baiano. Again, replays
indicated little contact.
	   ``I don't really know what happened there,'' Brazil coach Mario
Zagallo said. ``The referee is FIFA's problem, not Brazil's
problem.''
	   That victory moved Norway into Round 2 instead of Morocco, which
had just finished beating Scotland 3-0 when the pivotal foul was
called.
	   ``We trained for this for three years. To lose this way is more
than disappointing, it's, it's ... ,'' Rachid Azzouzi said, shaking
his head and looking at the ground.
	   Coach Claude Le Roy of Cameroon called on FIFA to do something
about what he said was ``incompetent'' officiating. FIFA said
Wednesday that the two cases were being treated in routine fashion
and that no discipline or other actions were planned.
	   Federation spokesman Keith Cooper said no team had officially
complained about the refereeing. He also said that any suggestions
that the referees' calls were intended to influence the
second-round makeup were ``absolutely pointless.''
	   ``Decisions were taken during the course of the match by the
referees in good faith, according to the situations as they
interpreted them in the game, totally regardless of what might be
happening elsewhere, of which they were absolutely, totally
unaware,'' Cooper said.
	   The spokesman said FIFA president Sepp Blatter had no plans to
speak with referee coordinator David Will about Tuesday's games and
refused to say how the calls might effect selection of officials
for the second round and later.
	   While soccer's 16th world championship has been marked by lots
of offense and the colorful, circus-like atmosphere that French
style brings to big events, FIFA has spent an inordinate amount of
time dealing with officiating questions, a stark change from four
years ago when the referees were given credit for letting the
players play.
	   Italy managed a 2-2 tie with Chile in its opener only because of
a penalty shot awarded when referee Lucian Bouchardeau of Niger
called a handball when a pass hit Ronald Fuentes' right arm as it
hung at his side.
	   When just four red cards were handed out in the first 20 games,
Blatter publicly criticized the refs for being too soft and
jeopardizing the crackdown on dangerous tackles from behind.
	   The message was heard clearly and quickly. The next day, five
red cards were flashed, including one that cost the home team its
star striker, Zinedine Zidane, until the quarterfinals _ if France
gets that far.
	   Going into Wednesday's games, there had been 16 red cards. Two
games have ended with a team two players down, including Cameroon
in the match against Chile.
	   Blatter was blasted by players and coaches who said he forced
the referees' hand, and Le Roy again criticized the FIFA president
after the later controversies.
	   ``If this is what football is all about, I hope Mr. Blatter was
watching,'' he said. ``Perhaps he should stick to administrative
tasks.''
	   Blatter was unavailable for comment, but Cooper said FIFA was
generally pleased with the refs' work.
	   ``The standard remains very, very high,'' he said. ``If there
were two errors in all those games, and I'm not saying they were
errors, that is a very, very low error rate.''

OPEC ministers will cut more oil production to boost price AP Business Writer

By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC reached an agreement Wednesday to
cut more barrels of oil from the glutted market, Saudi Arabia's oil
minister said.
	   Saudi minister Ali Naimi made the comments after the producers
held critical talks about boosting severely depressed prices.
	   The cuts will probably be 1 million to 1.2 million barrels a day
_ just what some of the OPEC ministers had been shooting for _ a
Gulf source said on condition of anonymity.
	   Oil futures were modestly higher in London even though OPEC gave
out no immediate confirmation of how sharply it plans to slash
crude output. The new cutbacks will be effective July 1.
	   The Saudi minister, Ali Naimi, told reporters he was ``very
happy'' with the deal, which OPEC hopes will rescue prices that
recently plunged to 12-year lows. Naimi said details would be
announced later in the day.
	   Some ministers said previously that OPEC needed to cut at least
1 million barrels a day. The producers struck a deal in an informal
session involving delegations from all 11 OPEC countries.

World Cup: injured Italian defender returns home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Italy's defender Alessandro Nesta, his World Cup
abruptly ended by torn knee ligaments, flew home on Wednesday
heartbroken at missing matches but confident about returning to
soccer fields before the end of the year.
	   ``It's difficult to accept the idea that the World Cup is over
for me,'' the 22-year-old player of Lazio of Rome said shortly
before boarding a Rome-bound plane at Charles De Gaulle airport.
	   ``Doctors told me I can recover by Christmas. For my part I'll
work hard to meet that date. I want to return to action as soon as
possible,'' Nesta said.
	   Italian doctors said that Nesta will need up to six months to
heal and rehabilitate.
	   The Italian defender tore his right knee ligaments in the fourth
minute of the Italy-Austria Group B match at St. Denis Tuesday.
Italy advanced to the second round on a 2-1 victory.
	   Nesta explained he tripped before colliding with an Austrian
defender.
	   ``I'm leaving a great team, which can do great things. I hope to
return to Paris on July 12 to support my teammates from the stands,
in the World Cup final,'' Nesta said.
	   The young defender, his right leg heavily bandaged and going on
crutches, said he hoped to undergo surgery in a Rome clinic as soon
as possible.
	   His injury may force Lazio to seek a substitute defender by the
start of the Italian Serie A in September.
	   Nesta, one of the best league players last season, had said
before injury he was anxious to team in the next campaign with
newly-signed Chilean striker Marcelo Salas.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Stella McCartney, daughter of former Beatle Paul
McCartney, has quit a government-appointed panel charged with
modernizing Britain's image _ dealing an apparent blow to the group
dubbed ``Cool Britannia.''
	   The Foreign Office, which in April named the 33-member Panel
2000, said Miss McCartney, designer for the Paris fashion house,
Chloe, said Wednesday that she had cited pressure of work in
stepping down.
	   Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett had expressed his
``sympathy and understanding,'' the Foreign Office said.
	   A spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused to say
if Fatchett was also disappointed at the loss of Miss McCartney,
26, from a panel which includes a batch of not-so-young bureaucrats
and businessmen.
	   Her appointment was announced shortly before her mother, Linda,
died from breast cancer in April.

Security Council hears evidence of Iraqi nerve gas weapons UN relations with Iraq, EDITS to conform. No pickup

Eds: UPDATES with Annan saying he hopes allegation does not damage
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq has rejected a U.S. Army laboratory's
finding that traces of a deadly VX nerve gas were on shards of
Iraqi missile warheads, and is demanding independent analysis of
the samples.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, was scheduled
to brief the Security Council on Wednesday on results of an
analysis by the U.S. Army laboratory at Aberdeen, Maryland.
	   Before the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who won
international acclaim in February for striking a deal with the
Iraqis to avert U.S.-led airstrikes, said Wednesday he hoped the
finding would not damage U.N. relations with Iraq.
	   ``We are dealing with the Iraqis on a large spectrum of issues
and I hope this particular development will not destroy the
improved relations that has allowed (the commission) to carry on
with his work,'' Annan said.
	   ``I expect and I plead with them to continue to work with UNSCOM
so they can see light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said, meaning
an end to sanctions.
	   Diplomatic sources said the lab reported finding traces of VX
and a stabilizer on Iraqi warheads, despite Iraq's claims that it
never succeeded in transforming the deadly nerve agent into a
weapon.
	   If true, the finding could undermine efforts by Russia, France
and China to close the seven-year inspection program and lift
crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Saddam Hussein's
forces invaded Kuwait. The invasion led to the 1991 Gulf War.
	   ``If this allegation is correct ... that will set back Iraq's
efforts to try to lift sanctions,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson
said Tuesday. ``It shows that they've been concealing, they've been
lying, and it calls into question their commitment to
disarmament.''
	   In a statement published Wednesday in Baghdad, Saddam and other
Iraqi leaders demanded sanctions be lifted immediately. If not,
they warned they would reconsider relations with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The statement did not mention the VX findings, although the
official Iraqi News Agency dismissed them as ``baseless and mere
fabrications.''
	   Iraq's U.N. mission said in a statement Tuesday that Baghdad
rejects the results, adding they ``cannot be accurate since VX was
not used in any kind of munitions in Iraq due to continuous
production failure.''
	   The Iraqis said the samples were too small to be conclusive and
``finding a trace of a stabilizer in one sample out of seven
analyzed is not evidence because, if VX was used, a stabilizer
would have been found in every sample.''
	   Iraq said the results must be verified by laboratories in a
neutral country or in several countries.
	   VX is a colorless, odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it
comes into contact with oxygen. A few drops can kill in minutes.
	   Despite the American report, the Security Council is deeply
divided over the Iraq issue. The United States and Britain insist
Iraq be compelled to provide full disclosure of all banned weapons
before sanctions are lifted.
	   Russia, China and France are equally resolved that the
inspections should wrap up as quickly as possible, a position also
held by Annan's chief advisers.
	   It remains unclear whether the new evidence would be enough to
persuade the Russians, French and Chinese to change their position.
	   Washington was hopeful it would.
	   ``I would be stunned if any country, in the light of these new
apparent deceptions on the part of the Iraqis, even suggested that
now is the time to be suspending or lifting the sanctions regime,''
State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
	   Even if the findings were verified, they would not prove
conclusively that Iraq still has banned weapons because the samples
were taken from warheads Baghdad says were destroyed after the Gulf
War.
	   But Iraq has maintained it never produced VX warheads or figured
out how to store the deadly nerve agent in bulk. Findings to the
contrary would call into question Iraq's previous declarations
about the state of its programs of mass-destruction weapons.
	   In Baghdad, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said that 1.7 tons
of VX had been produced, but that it was not of weapons grade. U.N.
officials suspect the Iraqis produced up to four tons and that if
some was placed in warheads more could be hidden in Iraq.

Ambassador says rockets aimed at hurting U.S.-Lebanon 
</HEADLINE>
By RODEINA KENAAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The American ambassador to Lebanon said
Wednesday explosions near his embassy's compound were aimed at
undermining warming U.S.-Lebanese ties and hurting the country's
postwar recovery.
	   The comments by Ambassador Richard Jones were the first by the
embassy since three rocket-propelled grenades attached to a crude
detonator exploded on Sunday, less than a kilometer (half-mile)
from the fortified compound in a suburb north of Beirut.
	   ``Regardless of the technical capabilities and the technical
execution of the incident, I think it was designed to undermine
Lebanon and complicate its relationship with us and cause
uncertainty in our minds,'' Jones said.
	   No one was hurt in the explosions, which, however, raised
questions about the Lebanese government's claims that it has
restored law and order since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war.
	   ``I think having that apparatus placed in that area was designed
to stir things up and undermine the security in the country,''
Jones said.
	   Lebanese government ministers have said the bombs were a message
from Israel in a bid to destabilize security.
	   But Jones refused to point a finger at any party.
	   ``If I don't know who is sending the message then how can I know
what the message is,'' Jones said.
	   The leftist As-Safir newspaper reported Wednesday that the
explosions were in retaliation for the recent arrest of 23 Lebanese
who allegedly worked for Israeli intelligence based in an occupied
border zone in southern Lebanon.
	   Interior Minister Michel Murr dismissed reports that the rockets
were aimed at the embassy.
	   In a decision that signaled a change in U.S. policy toward
Lebanon, the State Department in July lifted a decade-old ban on
the use of American passports for travel to Lebanon. The ban was
imposed at the height of attacks against Westerners during civil
war.
	   Last week, President Bill Clinton lifted some restrictions on
air travel to Lebanon that had been in effect since the 1985
hijacking of a TWA airliner to Beirut.
	   But the U.S. administration kept in place a ban on direct
flights involving U.S. carriers and flights between American
airports and Beirut. Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz expressed
unhappiness Wednesday with that decision.

Ukraine's Cabinet allocates more than dlrs 1 million to flooded areas 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The government has allocated 2.5 billion
hryvna (dlrs 1.25 million) to flood-stricken regions in western and
eastern Ukraine, a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Most of the money, 1.8 million hryvna (dlrs 600,000), was
allocated to regional authorities in the Lviv, Ternopil and
Ivano-Frankivsk regions in the west, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Last week's rainstorms flooded some 5,663 houses in 194
settlements in these regions, forcing the evacuation of about 3,000
people and damaging large agricultural areas.
	   Other funds were sent to combat the consequences of floods in
the Donetsk, Khmelnitsk, Cherkasy and Zhitomir regions.

Chinese censors rebuff plea to let Shanghai opera perform in New York 
</HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Chinese officials on Wednesday rebuffed a
plea by a U.S. music festival to lift a travel ban on a Shanghai
opera company, demanding extensive changes in a ``superstitious and
pornographic'' opera that could force the cancellation of a planned
New York City performance.
	   The dispute, just a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton is
to visit during a high-profile trip to China, threatened to create
a public relations disaster for a city that prides itself on its
cosmopolitan air and developing cultural life.
	   The Shanghai Cultural Bureau seized the sets of the Shanghai
Kunqu Opera Company earlier this month and barred its singers from
traveling. They are scheduled to perform the ``Peony Pavilion,'' a
400-year-old love story, at the Lincoln Center Festival '98 in a
20-hour production over six evenings beginning July 7.
	   ``We want to guarantee that art taken abroad is healthy in its
ideology,'' the director of the Cultural Bureau, Ma Bomin, told
reporters. She repeated official criticism that the production by
Chinese-born American director Chen Shizheng included ``feudal,
superstitious and pornographic'' elements.
	   Ma did not give details of the revisions Chen was expected to
make, but suggested they could be so extensive that the New York
performance would have to be postponed.
	   Such a delay would be impossible because of the festival
schedule, said its director, Nigel Redden, who is in Shanghai
trying to have the ban overturned. He said that unless the sets are
shipped by Thursday, the opera may not take place.
	   ``We wouldn't cancel. It would have been canceled by the
Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Cultural Affairs,'' said Redden. He
said he had no more meetings scheduled with Chinese officials, but
hoped they could reach a compromise.
	   The ``Peony Pavilion,'' with 21 people singing 150 roles and
elaborate sets that include a pond with live ducks and fish, also
is scheduled to be performed at festivals in Hong Kong and Sydney,
Australia.
	   The Cultural Bureau says its goal is to protect the high
standards of Kunqu opera, a distinctive style unique to Shanghai.
	   One bureau official, Li Shoucheng, complained that Chen's
production features vulgar language and a ``feudalistic'' funeral
that he said was not part of the original opera.
	   ``What he added is the garbage of ancient Chinese culture,'' Li
said.
	   Such strident ideological criticism sounds strikingly
old-fashioned at a time when Chinese leaders are trying promote an
image of tolerance and a diverse cultural life to match the
country's economic achievements.
	   It isn't clear whether the dispute is purely artistic or fueled
by other issues _ or even whether the Shanghai officials have the
support of President Jiang Zemin, who would risk hurting the
amicable atmosphere that he so clearly wants for the Clinton visit.
	   Chen, a student of Chinese opera since age 7, said he was
uncomfortable that the issue had come up just before the U.S.
presidential visit.
	   ``I was hoping everything would be solved quietly and this could
go to New York. This is great for a new U.S.-Chinese beginning. I
don't understand why this is happening now,'' he said.
	   Due to its immense length, the 55-act ``Peony Pavilion'' had
never been performed in its entirety before a dress rehearsal
earlier this month in Shanghai, Chen said.
	   ``I refuse to believe this will not go to America,'' he said.

Lawyer sues Deutsche Bahn for negligence in fatal train crash 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ A lawyer has sued Deutsche Bahn for
manslaughter in the high-speed train crash that killed 100 people,
claiming the German rail company knew the wheels on the train model
were unsafe.
	   ``I use this train, and I could have been one of the victim,''
Bernd Rosenkranz said Wednesday, one day after filing the suit in
Celle, a northern town 20 kilometers (13 miles) from where the
train crashed June 3.
	   While the crash is still under investigation, the state-owned
rail company has said a broken wheel rim likely caused the
InterCity Express train to derail and smash into the pillar of a
concrete overpass.
	   Rosenkranz argues that the wheel rims on the first generation
InterCity Express trains _ the type that crashed _ were made of
several parts and therefore less safe than second-generation
wheels, made of a single component.

Cold soldiers, wiggle your toes: Deputy Prime Minister demonstrates

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian military cadets were
reminded Wednesday to wiggle their toes to stave off the effects of
extreme cold while standing on parade.
	   The advice came from former army officer and Deputy Prime
Minister Tim Fischer the day after one cadet and three band members
collapsed during a passing out parade in near-freezing temperatures
at the Royal Military College Duntroon.
	   Fischer said cadets were entitled to faint in the cold, but
demonstrated to journalists outside the nation's Parliament his
endurance technique for standing in freezing temperatures _ toe
wiggling.
	   ``People are entitled to collapse in the hypothermia conditions
pertaining here at Canberra,'' Fischer said.
	   ``I was less impressed though, when in beautiful weather
conditions at the Australian War Memorial (at a ceremony in
spring), after a rehearsal the day before, some three people
fainted from the Honor Guard.
	   ``I was a bit disappointed by that in superb weather
conditions.''

Italian judge orders exhumation of banker hung under bridge 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian judge has ordered the exhumation of the
body of a Vatican-connected financier to help determine if he was
murdered or committed suicide by hanging from a London bridge in
1982.
	   News reports Wednesday said prosecutors hope a new forensic
medical examination of the body will shed light on whether Roberto
Calvi was alive or dead when left hanging from Blackfriars Bridge.
	   Calvi was found dead after Italy's biggest postwar banking
scandal. A London coroner's jury could not decide if the man known
as ``God's banker'' had killed himself or had been murdered
elsewhere and then left hanging from the bridge.
	   Last fall, a Roman businessman, Flavio Carboni, turned himself
into Italian authorities after being charged with conspiracy to
commit homicide in connection with the case.
	   Rome prosecutors sought the exhumation order after lawyers for
Carboni presented a medical report indicating from a preliminary
exam of the body that Calvi hung himself, the news reports said.
	   Calvi's Banco Ambrosiano collapsed after the bank failed to
collect dlrs 1.4 billion in loans made to 10 dummy companies in
Latin America controlled by the Vatican bank.
	   No date was announced for the exhumation, but it was unlikely to
happen before the end of summer, reports indicated.

Car bomb wounds 2 in border town on eve of Northern Ireland vote 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb wounded two people
Wednesday in the predominantly Catholic border town of
Newtownhamilton, on the eve of elections for a new compromise
Northern Ireland government.
	   The blast outside Newtownhamilton's main barracks housing
British soldiers and police also caused substantial damage to homes
and shops along the main street of the village 40 miles (65 kms)
southwest of Belfast.
	   Police said they received several telephoned warnings, including
one purporting to come from the outlawed Irish National Liberation
Army, an anti-British rival of the IRA that has refused to
subscribe to the larger group's July 1997 truce.
	   Newtownhamilton lies in the South Armagh borderland, a
traditional hotbed of support for the Irish Republican Army.
	   Police said the bomb exploded as they were evacuating the area
and as an army bomb-disposal unit was arriving. They said the
injuries suffered by the two wounded people weren't
life-threatening, but offered no other details.
	   The blast followed an unclaimed bomb attack Tuesday on a road
outside the South Armagh village of Forkhill. The blast, apparently
intended for a passing army foot patrol, injured nobody.

Poland admits lack of professionalism in preparation for EU entry 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland lacked professionalism and proper
communication in its dealings with the European Union, leading EU
officers to cut financial aid, a government commission admitted
Wednesday.
	   The commission was investigating what Poland did wrong in its
applications for funding from the EU's Phare program, designed to
help eastern European countries prepare for EU membership.
	   Last month, the EU cut aid to Poland by about 20 percent, down
to dlrs 195.8 million.
	   Zbigniew Derdziuk, head the commission, said Poland failed to
pay attention to new Phare regulations for projects eligible for
aid.
	   He also blamed Polish ministries for proposing projects
inappropriate for EU aid, for weak coordination among government
agencies and for insufficient communication with the EU.
	   ``Poland needs to raise the level of professionalism in
preparing projects,'' Derdziuk said.
	   Poland, which began EU membership negotiations March 31, has
lost more than a million dollars per capita because of the cuts in
EU aid.
	   ``We lost much more: our good reputation,'' commented Polityka,
a respected weekly newsmagazine.

Cambodian newspaper editors protest campaign rules 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Cambodia-Election
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Editors of seven Cambodian newspapers
declared Wednesday they would risk their own safety and ignore an
official media guideline for the upcoming election, saying it
violated their ``constitutional freedom of the press.''
	   Their letter, received in Bangkok by fax, asked for the support
of all international organizations ``to help us keep our freedom
and our ability to inform readers according to our ability as
journalists.''
	   It was circulated the day before the official campaign period
was to begin for the July 26 election. It protests a guideline set
by the National Election Commission banning all commercial media
groups from publishing any material that could be construed to be
of service to any political entities.
	   The letter said the guideline also ``violates the basic freedom
of expression and the public's right to know, which is especially
unacceptable before an election when people should have the right
to hear any kind of information.''
	   ``Therefore we the undersigned will disregard this provision and
go on publishing as we have been, without changing at all, even if
we have to risk our own safety,'' it said.
	   Several journalists have been murdered in Cambodia since the
last election in 1993. In addition, scores of government opponents
have been killed since coup last July in which Hun Sen deposed his
co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party is the apparent front-runner
for the upcoming election, and Ranariddh and his FUNCINPEC party
are the main challengers.
	   Ranariddh and other opposition figures have complained that they
are not being allowed equal access to the media.
	   In a statement issued Wednesday listing ways in which he
considered the election process unfair, Ranariddh wrote that ``the
Cambodian People's Party uses, on a daily basic, all the electronic
media under its control to campaign. FUNCINPEC contests the CPP
control of the media and requests, without delay, equitable access
to it.''
	   Independent groups such as the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch
agree that opposition groups lack equal access to broadcast media.
Radio and television stations sympathetic to Ranariddh were taken
over by Hun Sen and his party after last year's coup.

	   MIDDELFART, Denmark (AP) _ Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Wednesday he remained optimistic that a peaceful
solution would be found to end the ethnic violence in Yugoslavia's
secessionist Kosovo region.
	   ``There are no signs that (Serbia's president Slobodan)
Milosevic will move away from his promises,'' Primakov said. ``The
present situation (indicates) that there is a political solution in
sight,'' he said told a news conference.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Tuesday warned Milosevic that
time for a peaceful end to the crackdown against ethnic Albanias in
Kosovo region was running out.
	   Asked whether Russia would support military action against Serb
forces, Primakov said ``we would rather avoid that situation.''
	   Moscow _ traditionally a Serb ally _ would ``avoid (putting)
deadlines'' on Milosevic, the Russian foreign minister said, adding
it would be ``unjust and unacceptable'' not to try to settle the
issue with political talks.
	   ``I understand that Milosevic is ready to talk with all
political forces,'' Primakov said.
	   Primakov, in Denmark for a meeting of the foreign ministers of
baltic Sea states, said he had spoke by telephone with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Allbright on Tuesday about the
Balkans.
	   ``We agreed that we should coordinate our actions,'' Primakov
said, through a translator, but declined to give details.

22 die in Somali floods

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 22 people, most of them
children, died Wednesday in flooding caused by heavy rains in
Mogadishu and other towns in southeastern Somalia. Eleven others
were injured, volunteer rescue workers said.
	   A continuous downpour that began at 2 a.m. (2300 gmt) flooded
nearly all the roads in the capital, Mogadishu. Houses and other
buildings were swept away by the rushing waters.
	   Several of the victims died when their houses collapsed on them,
the volunteers said. Especially hard hit were refugees from
fighting in other parts of the country who live in flimsy
dwellings.
	   Thousands were forced to flee their homes and seek refuge with
friends and relatives in other parts of the city.
	   Abdulaziz Mohamed Omar, a volunteer in Huriwa neighborhood, said
he and his group of 30 volunteers rescued more than 80 children
from 60 houses in the area.
	   All minibus and taxi traffic has come to a standstill, and most
shops and markets are closed due to impassable roads.
	   Floods also hit Afgoie, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of
Mogadishu and the port of Merca, 100 kilometers (65 miles) south of
the capital. The road to Merce was reported to be under water.
	   Faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who control north Mogadishu,
called on residents to unite to assist in rescue efforts, saying it
was the only way to prevent catastrophe.
	   Somalia has been without a central government since 1991 when
faction leaders joined forces to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre,
then turned on each other.
	   Last November, flooding caused by unseasonal heavy rains was
responsible for the deaths of at least 1,500 people and forced more
than 200,000 from their homes, according to relief agencies.
	   United Nations agencies dealing with the catastrophe said more
than 1 million people were affected by lost crops, livestock and
homes.

Glider's wing clips horse's ear in bizarre accident

<TEXT>
	   OMMEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A glider pilot has been booted out of
his aviation club for flying his plane so low it sliced the ear off
a grazing horse, police said Wednesday.
	   The bizarre incident happened June 1 during a flight competition
in this eastern Dutch town, where the pilot flew too low over a
field and a wing of his plane clipped the horse's right ear.
	   Although the one-eared animal is recovering for now, the
prognosis doesn't look good, said police spokesman Ed Kraszewski.
Ear wax is oozing out of the injured ear, which may cause
infections and lead to brain damage, he said.
	   The 30-year-old pilot, who was not identified, may have to pay
compensation if the horse dies.
	   The daily De Telegraaf ran a photo of the maimed beast on its
front page Wednesday, calling it ``the unhappy horse that must go
though life with just one ear.''

Aboriginal bureaucracy should be abolished, One Nation says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Aborigines were urged Wednesday to
enroll to vote in Australia's upcoming federal election, as a
spokesman for the right-wing One Nation party restated its policy
of dismantling the largest Aboriginal administrative body.
	   Aboriginal leader Bruce ``Tracker'' Tilmouth said every
Aboriginal vote would be needed at the election, which he said will
be the most important for Aborigines in decades.
	   Tilmouth called for all indigenous Australians to enroll to
vote.
	   ``Otherwise your vote may not be counted,'' he said. ``The next
federal election will be critical for Aboriginal people.
	   ``With parties like One Nation campaigning against services that
are vital to Aboriginal people ... every vote is important. Make
sure your vote counts.''
	   One Nation, led by federal legislator Pauline Hanson, won about
23 percent of the vote in a June 13 Queensland state election, and
has been scoring in the low- to mid-teens in recent opinion polls
of national support.
	   Hanson has been criticized as racist for calling for an end to
Asian immigration and advocating protectionist economic policies.
	   Conservative Prime Minister John Howard must call an election
before May 1999, and has indicated he may call a poll any time
after this month.
	   One Nation spokesman David Oldfield said Wednesday the party
sought to dismantle the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Commission, a body funded by the federal government that
administers key programs for Aborigines under an administration
elected by Aborigines.
	   Oldfield said One Nation wanted funds for Aborigines to be
distributed through the same bureaucracy as other government
funding.
	   ``We're not saying we want to remove Aboriginal funding. What
we're saying is we want to remove the Aboriginality of that
funding, that everyone should be treated equally and through the
same departments,'' Oldfield told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   He said ``it could very well be the case'' that Aborigines ended
up getting more funding under One Nation policy than they do
currently.
	   Australia's some 300,000 Aborigines are the society's most
disadvantaged minority, which a life expectancy 20 years shorter
than the white population, far higher rates of preventable diseases
and severe housing and health services shortages.
	   Oldfield said the commission resulted in money being ``chewed
up'' and misappropriated, and that not only Aborigines living on
their traditional lands, but farmers also should be given
consideration when it came to allocation of government funds for
living in rural areas.

in 7th graf; other results in 18th-19th grafs
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ A top men's title contender withdrew
with an injury Wednesday, while two struggling former favorites
began their Wimbledon comebacks in winning style.
	   Fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski, a quarterfinalist last year, pulled
out with an ankle injury before the resumption of his rain-delayed
match.
	   Rusedski, who damaged ligaments in his left ankle in a fall at
the Queen's Club tournament two weeks ago, was limping Tuesday as
he split the first two sets with Mark Draper and was down a break
at 5-4 in the third.
	   The Canadian-born Briton practiced Wednesday morning and said he
was ready to play. But he changed his mind a few hours later.
	   ``I thought it would get better,'' he said. ``I thought when it
got warmed up it would get better. Unfortunatley, it didn't happen.
... I thought that this year was really my year, but it just wasn't
to be.''
	   Rusedski, who has the fastest serve in the game, had been rated
one of the top favorites for the title. His withdrawal leaves No.
12 Tim Henman as Britain's best hope for its first men's Wimbledon
champion since 1936.
	   Steffi Graf, seeking her eighth Wimbledon title, won the first
eight games as she powered into the third round with a 6-0, 6-4
victory over Slovakia's Henrieta Nagyova.
	   Other winners Wednesday included two players with a lot to prove
_ men's No. 14 seed Goran Ivanisevic and women's wild card entry
Jennifer Capriati.
	   Capriati won her first Grand Slam match in five years,
overcoming nine foot-faults to defeat Australia's Nicole Pratt 6-4,
3-6, 6-4.
	   It was Capriati's first Wimbledon appearance since reaching the
quarterfinals in 1993. Since then, she's played in only five other
Grand Slam events and lost in the first round each time.
	   ``It's great to be back here,'' Capriati said. ``It brings back
a lot of good memories. I was really pumped up. I was really
excited to be out there.''
	   In 1991, Capriati became the youngest ever women's Wimbledon
semifinalist at 15 years, 95 days. But her career nosedived after
problems with drugs and injuries.
	   ``Right now I want it pretty bad,'' she said. ``I'm really
focused and determined to play well.''
	   Capriati, 22, said she has no regrets and feels in control of
her life.
	   ``Whatever I'm doing it's whatever I want to be doing,'' she
said. ``I just try to be happy off the court as well as on the
court, to keep a balance.''
	   Ivanisevic, a two-time Wimbledon finalist who had won only one
match in his last five Grand Slam tournaments, beat Grant Stafford
6-3, 6-3, 6-2 in just one hour, 19 minutes.
	   ``I can beat anybody when I play good here, and I can lose to
some serious bad guys,'' Ivanisevic said. ``You never know with me.
... Not too many people rate me as a favorite or expect me to do
good here. But I feel good. Anything is possible.''
	   French Open champion Carlos Moya, the No. 5 seed from Spain,
needed five sets to get past India's Mahesh Bhupathi, 6-4, 4-6,
6-4, 2-6, 6-3.
	   Switzerland's Patty Schnyder, the women's No. 13 seed, won in
three sets over Helena Sukova, a 33-year-old Czech who came out of
retirement to play in her 17th straight Wimbledon.
	   Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport and No. 3 Monica Seles were
among other women scheduled to play second-round matches Wednesday.
	   In men's play, defending champion Pete Sampras was due to face
Sweden's Mikael Tillstrom and Andre Agassi was up against Germany's
Tommy Haas.
	   On Tuesday, Venus Williams came within five minutes of being
defaulted when she got lost on the All England Club grounds and
turned up late for her first-round match.
	   ``I could never figure out where Court 13 was,'' the 18-year-old
American said. ``I thought I was playing on Court 18, but I thought
that was Court 13, but no.''
	   Williams said she made it on time but WTA Tour officials
confirmed she was 10 minutes late. A no-show after 15 minutes
results in an automatic default.
	   Winning the match proved easier than finding the court as
Williams cruised to a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Canada's Jana Nejedly _
one of only 14 matches completed on a day disrupted by intermittent
showers.
	   Other women's seeds advancing Tuesday were No. 1 Martina Hingis,
No. 3 Jana Novotna, No. 14 Sandrine Testud and No. 16 Nathalie
Tauziat.
	   The only men's seed to complete a match Tuesday was No. 6
Patrick Rafter, who downed Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuberger, 6-1, 6-2,
4-6, 6-1.

Government criticized for exporting arms to 35 nations Office 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in grafs 5 and 7 with new comments from the Foreign
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An independent research group accused the
government Wednesday of selling arms to countries that might use
them for repression or aggression, in apparent violation of its
``ethical'' foreign policy guidelines.
	   According to a report by Saferworld, the government approved
2,181 licenses for British companies to export arms to 35 nations
of ``concern'' in the past year, including India, Pakistan,
Indonesia, China, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia. Only 24 applications
were refused, it said.
	   While some exports are legitimate, the foreign affairs think
tank said some appear to be at odds with government guidelines
adopted after the Labor Party swept to power in May 1997.
	   As part of Labor's new ethical foreign policy, which made human
rights a central plank, the government announced stricter criteria
last July aimed at halting arms sales to regimes that might used
weapons ``for internal repression or international aggression.''
Sales were not banned to any specific country.
	   The government, which is expected to publish its first annual
report of arms exports next month, stressed that each application
was dealt with on its own merits _ ``irrespective of destination''
_ and that no arms embargoes had been violated.
	   Cases were reviewed if there was a ``clearly identifiable risk
of repression or aggression,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said,
speaking with customary anonymity.
	   ``Since the new criteria were adopted, a number of licenses have
been refused which would have been approved under the previous
guidelines,'' the Foreign Office said in a later statement.

Party chief: Vietnam truly respects religious freedom 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam ``truly respects religious
freedom,'' but religious activities must follow the country's laws
and policies, Communist Party General Secretary Le Kha Phieu says.
	   Phieu's comments came at a two-day conference that ended Tuesday
to review the party's work on religion over the past six years. A
report presented at the meeting said there have been positive
changes but that many tasks remain.
	   Religion in Vietnam is strictly controlled by the government,
sparking repeated friction between some Catholic and Buddhist
church leaders and the authorities.
	   The U.S. Congress has included Vietnam on a list of 36 countries
that practice religious suppression. Vietnam responded by calling
that a distortion and suggested Congress should reconsider an ``old
and meaningless story.''
	   Human rights groups say church leaders have been jailed in the
past because of their religious practices. Officials say they do
not hold any religious prisoners, just people who have broken the
law.
	   ``Religious activities must abide by the laws,'' Phieu told the
conference. ``The party and state do not interfere into purely
religious activities of religions.
	   ``However, the religious organizations and activities must be
suitable to our laws, our policy of great unity. In that spirit, we
request religious organizations to report and register and get
state approval.''
	   The majority of Vietnam's 76 million people are Buddhist. About
8 million are Catholic, the second-largest Catholic community in
Southeast Asia after the Philippines.
	   The Vietnamese government has an uneasy relationship with the
Vatican. It insists that the Vatican should have no direct
influence on Vietnam's Catholic Church and that the church's
appointments must be approved by the government.
	   The Buddhist church, meanwhile, falls directly under the
government's supervision.
	   ``Religious belief is a legitimate need of some of our people,''
Phieu said. ``Our party and state clearly acknowledge that reality.
The party has educated its members to overcome any prejudice
against religions.
	   ``We also have to guide religious people to heighten vigilance
against hostile forces' abuse of our people's religious belief to
oppose and do harm to national interests.''

First petrochemical plant faces trouble after two months 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's first petrochemical plant, a
joint venture with Japan's Mitsui Corp., may have to shut down if
no drastic action is taken, a company executive said Wednesday.
	   Mitsui Vina is losing more than dlrs 120 for every ton of
polyvinyl chloride it produces because of a dramatic price slump
blamed on the Asian financial crisis, said Nguyen Cong Hoa, chief
representative of the company's office in Hanoi.
	   The company, which opened just two months ago, spends dlrs
583.35 to produce a ton of PVC that sells for only dlrs 460, down
from dlrs 750 to dlrs 780 per ton last year, he said.
	   Mitsui Vina is a joint venture with two local companies, Vietnam
Chemical Corp. and Vietnam Plastic Corp. It was capitalized at dlrs
90 million, of which the foreign partner took a 70 percent stake
and the local companies 30 percent.
	   Hoa said the company, in the Go Dau industrial park in the
southern province of Dong Nai, could lose dlrs 6 million in the
second half of this year and up to dlrs 14 million in 1999 if it
continues production under the current circumstances.
	   He said board members will meet in late July to consider the
situation.
	   The plant can produce 80,000 tons of PVC per year but has turned
out only 1,500 tons in the first two months.
	   Hoa said the joint venture has proposed to the government to
reconsider the PVC import tariff of 3 percent to protect the
fledgling industry.
	   Mitsui Vina is the first petrochemical plant in Vietnam, which
last year produced more than 10 million tons of crude oil _ all of
it exported because the country has no refinery. Ground breaking
for the first refinery was held several months ago.
	   Vietnam imported nearly 100,000 tons of PVC last year.

German parliament approves national DNA database on sex offenders 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Parliament's lower house approved
legislation Wednesday to set up a national database of DNA from sex
offenders and other criminals.
	   The success of using genetic fingerprints to solve sex crimes
was highlighted earlier this year when a DNA evidence led Germany
police to a suspect in the rape and murder of 11-year-old Christian
Nytsch.
	   A convicted rapist confessed after DNA taken from his saliva
matched genetic evidence found at the crime scene at Struecklingen,
near the Dutch border.
	   The murder _ and its resolution _ intensified a push by Interior
Minister Manfred Kanther to start a national database. If the DNA
bank had existed, Kanther said, the confessed killer would have
been on record, making it easier to catch him and discouraging him
from striking again.
	   The DNA samples are to be taken from people convicted and
suspected of crimes ranging from rape to burglary to murder.
	   The samples can then be compared to biological evidence found at
crime scenes, such as saliva, semen, blood, or tissue. Police in
Germany's 16 states could cross-reference data, a tactic already
used in Austria, Britain, the Netherlands and the United States.
	   Genetic information from suspects who are later cleared of
charges are to be removed from the data bank.
	   The legislation passed Wednesday by a wide margin, with support
from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition and the main
opposition party, the Social Democrats.
	   Only the left-leaning Greens party and the former communists,
the Party of Democratic Socialism, opposed the measure. Greens
member Rezzo Schlauch said the legislation ``fumbles with the
screws of repression'' without doing much to combat crime.

Precede PRISTINA Holbrooke meets with KLA fighters in Kosovo accuse Serbs of trying to deceive Holbrooke with withdrawals; changes dateline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke meeting with KLA, color, Albanians

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. troubleshooter Richard Holbrooke
ventured into besieged Kosovo on Wednesday and met for the first
time with ethnic Albanian fighters _ tacit recognition of the
Kosovo Liberation Army's growing strength.
	   Holbrooke, who helped broker peace in Bosnia, grimly compared
the worsening situation in the secessionist province of Serbia to
that in Bosnia before the Dayton accord. He reiterated his call for
Serb forces to withdraw.
	   ``The situation is explosive,'' he told reporters after holding
private talks with two local KLA leaders in Junik, a western town
under daily shelling by Serb security forces near the border with
Albania.
	   In a scene sure to anger Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
Holbrooke shook hands with the Albanian fighters and posed for
photographs with them.
	   ``These people are beleaguered and they don't have supplies,''
he said. ``The Serb security forces are all over the place.''
	   He also toured the town of Decane, where he cited the blackened
houses and houses with their roofs blown off as evidence condemning
the Serbs' action against pro-independence ethnic Albanians.
	   This is ``the kind of action we saw earlier in this part of the
world,'' he said, in a clear reference to Bosnia. ``The Serbs
should get out of here, and the original inhabitants should come
back and rebuild their houses with government help.''
	   Holbrooke was accompanied by a truckload of armed Serb security
forces and three ethnic Albanian political officials who advocate
independence through peaceful means. He held talks throughout the
trip with the Albanians, calling the tour a ``traveling
negotiation.''
	   It came a day after he warned Milosevic that time for a peaceful
end to the violence in the region was running out.
	   ``We are at a critical moment in the crisis surrounding
Kosovo,'' Holbrooke said Tuesday in Belgrade after four hours of
talks with Milosevic. He is scheduled to return to Belgrade on
Thursday, where the Russian news agency ITAR-Tass said he will meet
with Russia's deputy foreign minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky.
	   The visit by Holbrooke, nominated to be the next U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, is seen as a last attempt to get Milosevic
to stop his crackdown on ethnic Albanians.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between Serb-led army and police forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is gaining in public support in
predominantly Albanian Kosovo.
	   Due to fighting and KLA roadblocks along the province's main
Pristina-Pec road, Holbrooke and the U.S. delegation were forced to
detour through surrounding villages.
	   A shootout between Serb forces and KLA fighters erupted around a
convoy of reporters that followed Holbrooke on his tour, and
graphic evidence of heavy fighting was plentiful throughout the
trip. While he was speaking with the KLA men, at least 10 distant
explosions could be heard, along with sporadic gunfire.
	   Viewing the burned-out houses and other damage in Decane,
Holbrooke said: ``This was not a firefight. It is the security
forces coming in and destroying houses and driving people out.''
	   The head of the local ethnic Albanian human rights board in
Decane said Serbs had withdrawn much of their ``army, police and
paramilitary'' forces from the area ahead of Holbrooke's visit.
	   ``The regime is naively trying to deceive the international
community and create a false picture about the situation in this
area,'' Musa Berisha claimed.
	   During his talks with Holbrooke, Milosevic reaffirmed an earlier
promise to allow foreign diplomats to observe the situation in
Kosovo. Holbrooke refused to reveal anything else about the
meeting, saying it was confidential. He also said little about his
talk with the KLA.
	   In Brussels Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana met
Rugova and insisted Serbs and Albanians return to the negotiating
table without conditions. Solana also stressed the NATO allies
support a return to the autonomy in Kosovo, but not the
independence sought by both Rugova and Albanian militants.
	   In 1989, Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy and has since
ruled the province with virtual martial law.

Syria extradites 16 Algerian Islamic activists to Algeria 
</HEADLINE>
By MARIAM SAMI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Syria has extradited at least 16 Algerian
Islamic activists to Algeria, Islamic activists said Wednesday,
apparently under a new anti-terrorism pact between Arab countries
that the activists say has become a tool to clamp down on them.
	   The 16 men, some of whom had lived in Syria since 1992, were
deported earlier this month, Sheik Omar Bakry Mohammed, leader of
the London-based al-Muhajiroun (the Emigrants) group, said.
	   The group, which is banned in Syria, says it represents the
interests of Muslims in the Arab world.
	   The deportees were members of Algeria's fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front, whose loss to the military-backed government in
the 1992 elections sparked the current bloodbath that has claimed
at least 75,000 lives.
	   A spokesman for Liberty for the Muslim World, an Islamic
watchdog also based in London, confirmed the figures, adding that
Syria had already sent some activists to Algeria. The spokesman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, could got give other details.
	   The reports could not be immediately confirmed in either Algeria
or Syria.
	   The extradition would appear to be the result of the pact signed
by 22 Arab countries on April 22 to deny refuge, training and
financial or military support to groups that launch attacks on
other Arab nations.
	   Islamic groups say the governments are using the pact to deny
Muslims their religious right to campaign against corruption and to
install Islamic rule.
	   Speaking to The Associated Press in Cairo, Mohammed, a Syrian
who now has British citizenship, said that Saudi Arabia, Jordan and
Syria began extraditing Islamic activists to their respective
countries in April. He gave no details.
	   Saeed Sayyed Salama, a top aide to Osama Bin Laden, the
Afghanistan-based financier of Islamic extremists worldwide, was
brought to Egypt earlier this week.
	   Mohammed said Salama, a member of the Islamic Jihad, which
assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981, was extradited by Saudi
Arabia. He is expected to stand trial soon on charges of attempting
to overthrow the government.
	   Mohammed said that Jordan also extradited three wanted Egyptian
militants.
	   Yemen _ a haven for Islamic extremists from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi
Arabia, Algeria, and Syria _ is also expected to send scores of
them back home soon, Mohammed said.

World Cup: South Africa, Saudi Arabia tied 1-1 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ An questionable penalty gave Saudi
Arabia an injury-time goal to tie South Africa 1-1 at halftime
Wednesday, putting the South Africans' hopes of making the World
Cup second round in serious jeopardy.
	   Chilean referee Mario Sanchez Yanten awarded the spot kick when
he whistled defender Pierre Issa for a foul on Youssef al-Thyniyan.
Replays showed al-Thyniyan fell to the turf despite the slightest
touch from Issa's outstretched arm.
	   Shaun Bartlett scored in the 18th minute for the Bafana Bafana,
who need to win and make up a four-goal deficit to Denmark in goal
differential in order to advance. Denmark was tied 1-1 with France
at halftime in the other Group C finale, being played at the same
time.
	   South Africa, which had scored only once in its first two games,
took the lead when Bartlett got position on defender Fuad Amin and
chased down Issa's through ball before beating goalkeeper Mohammed
al-Deayea with a left-footed drive.
	   Saudi Arabia, which failed to score in its first two games,
nearly equalized twice through the efforts of Sami al-Jaber, who
stretched goalkeeper Hans Vonk into a fingertip save in the 27th
minute and drove deep into the penalty box a minute later before
tumbling in a three-way collision with a defender and Vonk.
	   Suspensions and injuries left South Africa with only five
non-goalkeeper reserves. Starting midfielder Brendan Augustine and
reserve Naughty Mokoena were sent home for violating a curfew, and
midfielder Alfred Phiri is serving a three-game ban for his red
card against Denmark. Striker Phil Masinga of Bari is out with a
bad ankle.
	   Saudi Arabia played its first game since the dismissal of coach
Carlos Alberto Parreira, who was fired after the team lost its
first two matches and was eliminated from second-round contention.
One of Parreira's assistants, Mohamed al-Kharashi, coached the team
Wednesday.

Accused jewelry embezzler denies charges 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A jewelry merchant suspected of engineering a
fraudulent scheme that cost Russia dlrs 180 million in stolen gold
and gems denied complicity in the crime on Wednesday, a news agency
reported.
	   ``Neither I nor any senior official had anything to do with this
crime,'' the Interfax news agency said, citing Andrei Kozlyonok,
co-founder of the U.S.-based Golden ADA company.
	   Kozlyonok is accused of embezzling more than dlrs 183 million in
gold, diamonds and silver from Russia. He is accused of making a
fake jewelry production contract with the Russian State Committee
on Metals and Gems on behalf of Golden ADA.
	   Kozlyonok, 38, was extradited last week from Greece, where he
had been in custody since his arrest in January. He had fought
extradition by claiming his life would be in danger in Russia, but
Greek courts rejected the appeals.

OPEC ministers to cut 1.4 million barrels of daily oil output throughout with details, prices head lower. No pickup. AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS with sources providing details of production cuts, new
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC agreed Wednesday to a new round of
oil production cuts, promising to take 1.4 million barrels a day
off the glutted market in an attempt to boost severely depressed
prices, sources said.
	   Ministers of the 11 OPEC nations held critical talks on the
supply problem that recently pushed prices of crude to 12-year lows
and stirred some concerns about a possible repeat of the disasters
that struck the global oil industry in 1986.
	   OPEC had no immediate confirmation of the exact pledges by each
member to cut output, but figures given privately by OPEC delegates
put the total at around 1.4 million barrels _ on top of an earlier
round of cutbacks that failed to help the market this spring.
	   Traders appeared unsure about whether OPEC was doing enough.
Prices rose modestly on news that OPEC had reached an agreement but
soon reversed course.
	   Brent crude oil to be delivered in August was down 35 cents at
dlrs 13.57 per barrel by late afternoon on London's International
Petroleum Exchange, giving up gains of more than 30 cents that had
pushed Brent above dlrs 14 per barrel earlier in the day.
	   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali Naimi, first announced that a
deal had been done, saying he was ``very happy'' although he would
not provide any immediate details.
	   OPEC delegates said the production cuts would be led by the
Saudis, who are chopping 425,000 barrels a day from their
production beginning on July 1. Venezuela has promised to cut
325,000 barrels a day, followed by Iran's pledge to restrain output
by 190,000 barrels daily.
	   Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria each pledged to cut
production by 100,000 barrels daily, with smaller cuts coming in
from smaller OPEC members, delegates said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Analysts have cautioned that OPEC needs to show that it can
deliver more than just promises. Even though the producers found
themselves in serious economic trouble by flooding the market this
winter and spring, they have had persistent problems sticking to
any production agreements in recent years.
	   The new deal was reached in an informal but hugely important
closed-door session involving the delegations from all 11 OPEC
members.
	   Immediately after it was over, oil ministers were tight-lipped
about what they had done.
	   ``It's going very well _ I have no other comments,'' Libyan oil
minister Abdalla Salem el-Badri told reporters as he emerged from
the talks held in a fancy Vienna hotel. El-Badri had previously
said that anything less than 1 million barrels a day in new
production cuts ``will not be enough.''
	   OPEC has not yet formally begun its summer meeting but
apparently has come to a agreement on the main issue: withdrawing
supply from the market.
	   Going into Wednesday's session, six of the 11 OPEC members had
pledged to cut a total of 620,000 barrels daily from the market _
and OPEC appears to have more than doubled that promise. Non-OPEC
producers Mexico, Russia, Egypt and Oman had also pledged to cut
another 203,000 barrels.
	   Crude oil is the world's most vital commodity and the recent
cheap prices have been a bargain for consumers but a nightmare for
OPEC and other producers.
	   OPEC found itself in a mess this winter after boosting output
just as the Asian economic crisis started eroding the growth in
world oil demand.
	   The oil ministers held an emergency meeting in March, agreeing
to cut 1.245 million barrels of daily production. They delivered
most, but not all, of those cuts and prices plunged further,
leading to the latest effort to restrain production further.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

World Cup: France and Denmark tied 1-1 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) - France and Denmark were drawing 1-1 at
halftime Wednesday after both teams had scored from contested
penalties.
	   France struck first in the 12th minute, with a penalty by Youri
Djorkaeff.
	   David Trezeguet, storming through on goal after good work by
Vincent Candela, was tripped by centerback Jes Hogh.
	   Denmark protested the penalty, claiming that Hogh had taken the
ball first, but referee Pierluigi Collina had no hesitation in
pointing to the spot.
	   Peter Schmeichel got a touch to Djorkaeff's penalty, struck low
to his right, but couldn't keep the ball out.
	   Against the run of play, Denmark equalized in the 42nd minute,
when Martin Jorgensen, first to react to a quick free kick, was
shoved by Candela.
	   Michael Laudrup calmly slotted the ball to the left of Fabien
Barthez to level the scores.
	   France, with six points from two games, began the match knowing
that a draw would be enough to secure first place in the Group C.
	   Denmark, with four points, needed a point to make sure of second
place, while a win would give it top position.
	   Coach Aime Jacquet rested Laurent Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu and
Didier Deschamps, three players who picked up yellow cards in
France's first two matches, as well as Lilian Thuram and Thierry
Henry. He was also without the suspended Zinedine Zidane and the
injured Christophe Dugarry.
	   Frank Leboeuf, Christian Karembeu, Candela and Patrick Vieira
all came in for their World Cup debuts.
	   Denmark coach Bo Johansson was without midfielder Morten
Wieghorst and forward Miklos Molnar, both sent off in Denmark's
last match against South Africa.
	   In Zidane's absense, Djorkaeff took on the role of chief
playmaker and within the first four minutes the Inter Milan star
played a fine defense-splitting backheel to create an opening for
Vieira, whose 15-yard shot was well saved by Peter Schmeichel.
	   Djorkaeff created another chance in the 41st minute, with a
lofted cross to Trezeguet, whose volley went just wide.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Christian Karembeu, Marcel Desailly,
Frank Leboeuf, Vincent Candela; Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires,
Emmanuel Petit; Youri Djorkaeff, David Trezeguet, Bernard Diomede.
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel; Jacob Laursen, Marc Rieper, Jes
Hogh, Jan Heintze; Martin Jorgensen, Thomas Helveg, Allan Nielsen,
Michael Schjonberg; Michael Laudrup, Brian Laudrup.
	   Referee _ Pierluigi Collina, Italy.

Italian judge orders exhumation of banker hung under bridge

said, SUBS 5th graf to clarify.
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian judge has ordered the exhumation of the
body of a Vatican-connected financier to help determine if he was
murdered or committed suicide by hanging from a London bridge in
1982.
	   News reports Wednesday said prosecutors hope a new forensic
medical examination of the body will shed light on whether Roberto
Calvi was alive or dead when left hanging from Blackfriars Bridge.
	   Calvi was found dead after Italy's biggest postwar banking
scandal. A London coroner's jury could not decide if the man known
as ``God's banker'' had killed himself or had been murdered
elsewhere and then left hanging from the bridge.
	   Last fall, a Roman businessman, Flavio Carboni, turned himself
into Italian authorities after being charged with conspiracy to
commit homicide in connection with the case.
	   Rome prosecutors sought the exhumation order after lawyers for
Carboni presented a medical report based on a preliminary
examination of the body. That report indicated Calvi hanged
himself, news reports said.
	   The experts asked to come up with a new report will also examine
the rope found wrapped around the banker, Corriere della Sera said
Wednesday.
	   Calvi's Banco Ambrosiano collapsed after the bank failed to
collect dlrs 1.4 billion in loans made to 10 dummy companies in
Latin America controlled by the Vatican bank.
	   No date was announced for the exhumation, but it was unlikely to
happen before the end of summer, reports indicated.

Ambassador says rockets aimed at hurting U.S.-Lebanon 
</HEADLINE>
By RODEINA KENAAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon said
Wednesday that he believed explosions near his embassy's compound
were aimed at undermining warming U.S.-Lebanese ties and hurting
the country's postwar recovery.
	   The comments by Richard Jones were the first by the embassy
since three rocket-propelled grenades attached to a crude detonator
exploded on Sunday, less than a kilometer (half-mile) from the
fortified compound in a suburb north of Beirut.
	   ``Regardless of the technical capabilities and the technical
execution of the incident, I think it was designed to undermine
Lebanon and complicate its relationship with us and cause
uncertainty in our minds,'' Jones said. He would not speculate as
to who may have been responsible.
	   The government has dismissed reports that the rockets were aimed
at the embassy. Some government ministers, without citing proof,
have said the bombs were a message from Israel in a bid to
destabilize security. Lebanon routinely accuses Israel of seeking
to destabilize its postwar recovery.
	   The leftist As-Safir newspaper reported Wednesday that the
explosions were in retaliation for the recent arrest of 23 Lebanese
who allegedly worked for Israeli intelligence based in an occupied
border zone in southern Lebanon. It cited unnamed ``security
sources.''
	   No one was hurt in the explosions, which raised questions about
the Lebanese government's claims that it has restored law and order
since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war.
	   In a decision that signaled a change in U.S. policy toward
Lebanon, the State Department in July lifted a decade-old ban on
the use of American passports for travel to Lebanon. The ban was
imposed at the height of attacks against Westerners during the
civil war.
	   Last week, President Bill Clinton lifted some restrictions on
air travel to Lebanon that had been in effect since the 1985
hijacking of a TWA airliner to Beirut.

Budapest mayor to fight hay fever with sheep 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The best cure for hay-fever doesn't
come in a bottle; it's woolly and walks on four legs, according to
the mayor of Budapest.
	   To reduce amount of pollen that causes runny noses and itchy
eyes for thousands of Budapest residents, Mayor Gabor Demszky will
hire sheep to graze fields of ragweed on the outskirts of the
capital, his office said Wednesday.
	   Negotiations are underway with sheep breeders to bring their
flocks to the weed-infested areas, said Zsuzsa Kiss, a spokeswoman
for the mayor.
	   The plan could benefit both those who suffer from the ragweed
allergy and sheep breeders, desperate for sheep-runs, Kiss said.
	   More than 20 percent of the country's population suffers from
hay fever, and a quarter of those are allergic to ragweed, an
allergist at the National Physiological and Physiotherapeutic
institute told the AP by telephone.
	   An explosion in the spread of ragweed in recent years is widely
seen as the result of the nuclear catastrophe in Chernobyl, Ukraine
in 1986.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The European Union is working with the

	   Moratinos, a Spanish diplomat, will also meet with Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri Thursday.
	   Arab states have called for a bigger EU role in the peace talks,
which have been backed largely by the United States since 1991.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine plans to send military observers to
Moldova's breakaway region of Trans-Dniester, President Leonid
Kuchma said Wednesday.
	   Ukraine and Russia have been trying to broker an end to the
conflict over Trans-Dniester, a mostly Russian-speaking region in
eastern Moldova that sought independence out of fear that Moldova
would unite with Romania.
	   Kuchma met Wednesday with Trans-Dniester leader Igor Smirnov and
discussed energy, trade, agricultural, education and communication
ties, said the president's foreign policy aide, Volodymyr Ogryzko.
	   Ukraine agreed to send up to 10 military observers to
Trans-Dniester, just across its western border, Ogryzko said in
comments cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   A 1992 war killed 700 people in Trans-Dniester before Russian
forces intervened, but efforts to reach a settlement have failed.
Russia still has troops in the region.

Canadian Indians ask power companies to honor 21-yr old pledge 
</HEADLINE>
By KEVIN POWERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Northern States Power Co. plans to send a
team to Manitoba as it reviews its role in the development of
hydroelectric power in Canada, following a protest by Canadian
Indians.
	   Leaders of the Cross Lake Band of Cree called on NSP and other
Minnesota utilities Tuesday to stop purchasing hydroelectric power
from Manitoba Hydro until the Canadian utility implements an
agreement it signed with the tribe 21 years ago.
	   The tribe says NSP is an accomplice to Manitoba Hydro, which it
accuses of diverting rivers, flooding forests, destroying hunting
grounds, and depriving tribes of their culture. The utility built
five large dams and hydroelectric plants on the Nelson River north
of Lake Winnipeg between 1975 and 1992.
	   The agreement was supposed to compensate the tribe for its
losses. But Nelson Miller, a tribal council member, has said the
agreement has not been implemented equitably. Miller said the tribe
wanted to publicize its concerns in the United States.
	   NSP annually purchases about 10 percent of its electricity from
Manitoba Hydro, according to Audrey Zibelman, NSP director of
energy and marketing. NSP has a 500-megawatt power purchase
contract with Manitoba Hydro that expires in 2005.
	   NSP also receives up to 200-megawatts from Manitoba Hydro in the
summer, and sends up to 200-megawatts to the Canadian utility in
the winter.
	   ``At this stage, we have heard their claims for the first time
this week,'' Zibelman said. ``We are trying to understand the
substantive nature of claims and ongoing processes in Manitoba.''
	   Manitoba Hydro president Bob Brennan said Tuesday that even if
Cross Lake natives are successful in turning Minnesota against
Manitoba Hydro, they would only be hurting themselves.

Security Council hears evidence of Iraqi nerve gas weapons Council; comments from US and British ambassadors; CORRECTS quotes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Butler beginning his briefing to the Security
in 3rd graf; edits to conform; TIGHTENS
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq has rejected a U.S. Army laboratory's
finding that traces of a deadly VX nerve gas were on shards of
Iraqi missile warheads, and is demanding independent analysis of
the samples.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, briefed the
Security Council behind closed doors Wednesday on results of an
analysis by the U.S. Army laboratory at Aberdeen, Maryland.
	   Diplomatic sources said the lab reported finding traces of VX
and a stabilizer on Iraqi warheads, despite Iraq's claims that it
never succeeded in transforming the deadly nerve agent into a
weapon.
	   If the findings are true, they could undermine efforts by
Russia, France and China to close the seven-year inspection program
and lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Saddam
Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait. The invasion led to the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   Before the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who won
international acclaim in February for striking a deal with the
Iraqis to avert U.S.-led airstrikes, said Wednesday he hoped the
finding would not damage U.N. relations with Iraq.
	   ``We are dealing with the Iraqis on a large spectrum of issues
and I hope this particular development will not destroy the
improved relations that has allowed UNSCOM to carry on with its
work,'' Annan said, using the acronym for the U.N. Special
Commission which performs arms inspections.
	   ``I expect and I plead with them to continue to work with UNSCOM
so they can see light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said, meaning
an end to sanctions.
	   But the British and American ambassadors _ Iraq's toughest
critics on the council _ said the findings underscore the need for
Baghdad to disclose all information on illegal weapons programs if
it expects an end to sanctions.
	   ``I think Iraq is conducting its diversion and deception
campaign and it's not working,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson
told reporters as he arrived for the meeting. ``Facts are facts.
Iraq has been deceiving the international community with
weaponization of nerve gas.''
	   British Ambassador John Weston said ``the truth is not relative
and the truth is not what you can get away with.''
	   ``And we need to have satisfaction on this issue as on the other
uncompleted bits of work before this whole question (of sanctions
relief) can be any further in the Security Council,'' Weston said.
	   In a statement published Wednesday in Baghdad, Saddam and other
Iraqi leaders demanded sanctions be lifted immediately. If not,
they warned they would reconsider relations with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The statement did not mention the VX findings, although the
official Iraqi News Agency dismissed them as ``baseless and mere
fabrications.''
	   Iraq's U.N. mission said in a statement Tuesday that Baghdad
rejects the results, adding they ``cannot be accurate since VX was
not used in any kind of munitions in Iraq due to continuous
production failure.''
	   The Iraqis said the samples were too small to be conclusive and
``finding a trace of a stabilizer in one sample out of seven
analyzed is not evidence because, if VX was used, a stabilizer
would have been found in every sample.''
	   Iraq said the results must be verified by laboratories in a
neutral country or in several countries.
	   VX is a colorless, odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it
comes into contact with oxygen. A few drops can kill in minutes.
	   Despite the American report, the Security Council is deeply
divided over the Iraq issue. The United States and Britain insist
Iraq be compelled to provide full disclosure of all banned weapons
before sanctions are lifted.
	   Russia, China and France are equally resolved that the
inspections should wrap up as quickly as possible, a position also
held by Annan's chief advisers.
	   It remains unclear whether the new evidence would be enough to
persuade the Russians, French and Chinese to change their position.
	   Washington was hopeful it would.
	   ``I would be stunned if any country, in the light of these new
apparent deceptions on the part of the Iraqis, even suggested that
now is the time to be suspending or lifting the sanctions regime,''
State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
	   Even if the findings were verified, they would not prove
conclusively that Iraq still has banned weapons because the samples
were taken from warheads Baghdad says were destroyed after the Gulf
War.
	   But Iraq has maintained it never produced VX warheads or figured
out how to store the deadly nerve agent in bulk. Findings to the
contrary would call into question Iraq's previous declarations
about the state of its programs of mass-destruction weapons.
	   In Baghdad, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said that 1.7 tons
of VX had been produced, but that it was not of weapons grade. U.N.
officials suspect the Iraqis produced up to four tons and that if
some was placed in warheads more could be hidden in Iraq.

OSCE welcomes Croatia's new plan for refugees' return 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which last month strongly criticized Croatia
for its poor treatment of Serbs, said Wednesday the government had
made a ``genuine effort'' with its new plan that ultimately
envisages the unconditional return of tens of thousands of Serbs.
	   The 54-nation OSCE and the U.N. refugee agency welcomed the
document, which the government says is aimed at lifting the current
obstacles to the return of Serbs. Some 180,000 fled in 1995, when
government troops recaptured lands seized by rebel Serbs in 1991.
	   Only 35,000 have returned. Many others complained of
bureaucratic hurdles.
	   Croatia has been under fierce international pressure for months,
and even threatened with economic sanctions, for failing to accept
that the Serbs must return. Without that, Western government say,
Croatia cannot join the West European institutions to which it
aspires.
	   Parliament is expected to adopt the new plan later this month.
	   ``We believe the government has made genuine effort to address
the concerns that the international community has raised,'' OSCE
spokesman Mark Thompson said. He noted however that it should be
swiftly implemented.
	   On Tuesday, in another bid to dampen international criticism,
parliament refused even to discuss the demand from a far-right
party that the issue of Serb return be put to a referendum.
	   Signaling the at least verbal change of heart, even a well-known
hard-liner from President Franjo Tudjman's ruling party, Ivan
Malas, said the constitution guarantees each citizen to leave the
country and return.
	   ``Depriving Serb citizens of that right would be racist,'' Milas
said.

Workers to begin unearthing remains for body-and-prisoner swap 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Setting in motion the biggest body-and-prisoner
exchange in two years between Israel and Lebanon, Israel made
preparations Wednesday to unearth the bodies of Shiite Muslim
guerrillas.
	   Workers with earthmoving equipment were ordered to begin digging
up remains of guerrillas from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia
from a cemetery in northern Israel, an Israeli official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Reports have said Israel would free up to 60 prisoners and hand
over up to 60 bodies of slain guerrillas, and would receive in
return the remains of an Israeli soldier who died in a raid last
September in south Lebanon.
	   Israel's army radio said the actual exchange could begin as
early as Wednesday evening. Members of a special rabbinical
military unit went to the scene of the exhumations, it said.
	   In talks brokered by the International Committee of the Red
Cross, Israel sought the return of the remains of 21-year-old Sgt.
1st Class Itamar Ilya.
	   After he and 11 other commandos were killed in the failed raid,
guerrillas from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and Amal militias
displayed body parts of slain Israelis.
	   Large-scale swaps have taken place previously, with the last one
two years ago.
	   In July 1996, Israel freed 45 Hezbollah prisoners and returned
the bodies of 123 guerrillas in exchange for the remains of two
Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon 10 years ago.
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israel and its allied
militia out of a buffer zone Israel set up in 1985 in southern
Lebanon. Israel has said it wants to withdraw, but only if the
security of its northern border can be guaranteed by Lebanon.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Wednesday formally accepted the resignation of most of his Cabinet
_ submitted nearly a year ago amid allegations of widespread
corruption.
	   The acceptance was a key demand of Palestinian legislators who
threatened to hold a no-confidence motion against Arafat if he
didn't move swiftly to form a new government.
	   Legislators agreed to give Arafat two weeks to reshuffle his
cabinet, Palestinian Minister of Local Government, Saeb Erekat told
The Associated Press.
	   ``Having accepted the resignation of the previous government,''
Arafat wrote to the Palestinian Legislative Council, ``I hereby
inform you that consultations have not yet been completed and I
will introduce my new government when I finish the consultations
within the next two weeks in accordance with the rules of
parliament.''
	   Last August, 16 of 18 Cabinet ministers submitted their
resignations to Arafat following reports of corruption in
government ministries. Arafat never said whether he accepted the
resignation and the makeup of the Cabinet remained largely the
same.
	   ``We'll remain in office until a new Cabinet is appointed in the
next two weeks,'' Erekat said. The Cabinet is expected to meet
Thursday, in what may be their last meeting before the reshuffle.

game ahead of the Yomiuri Giants, who moved into second place with
a 7-3 victory over the Hiroshima Toyo Carp at Hiroshima.
	   Balvino Galvez, formerly with the Texas Rangers, limited the
Carp to nine scattered hits for his fifth victory against six
defeats.
	   Hideki Matsui of the Giants hit a two-run home run in the first
inning. He has 15 homers and leads the league.
	   The Carp suffered their seventh straight defeat.
	   At Nagoya Dome, Akihiro Yano singled home a run in the second
inning and Yutaka Wada hit a one-run single in the third as the
Hanshin Tigers blanked the Chunichi Dragons 2-0.
	   In the Pacific League, Jerry Brooks smashed a three-run home run
and Yukio Tanaka hit a two-run homer as the front-running Nippon
Ham Fighters beat the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 9-3 at Tokyo Dome.
	   Tanaka has 18 homers and leads the league. Brooks, formerly with
the Florida Marlins, has 15.
	   The Fighters are 2 1/2 games ahead of the Kintetsu Buffaloes,
who lost 7-2 to the Orix BlueWave at Osaka Dome.
	   The BlueWave's Yasuo Fujii singled home the tie-breaking run
following singles by Ichiro Suzuki and former Oakland Athletics
player Troy Neel in the three-run eighth inning.
	   At Toyama, Domingo Martinez hit a three-run home run in the
five-run sixth innning and singled home the winning run in the
bottom of the 11th as the Seibu Lions beat the Chiba Lotte Marines
6-5.
	   Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A Rochester team, has 14
homers.

Bitter soccer fans target white expatriates in Cameroon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ Throngs of angry supporters of
Cameroon's soccer team Wednesday attacked vehicles and businesses
owned by white expatriates in retaliation against what they
described as a racist anti-African plot by World Cup officials.
	   No injuries were reported.
	   The attacks accompanied Cameroonian government condemnation of
officiating in the World Cup after Cameroon was ousted from the
World Cup on Tuesday in a controversial 1-1 draw with Chile.
	   Cameroon's coach Claude Leroy and his players insisted they were
robbed by Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner's refusal to allow a
second-half goal by Francois Omam Biyick that gave Cameroon the
lead.
	   A victory would have propelled the Indomitable Lions into the
second round.
	   Several cars, including one with diplomatic license plates, were
damaged and a number of people threatened as crowds of university
students shouting anti-white slogan in the streets of Yaounde,
Cameroon's capital.
	   Security forces in riot gear patrolled the city after a group of
white shoppers in a popular downtown supermarket was surrounded by
a mob of young men who threatened to attack whites. Some shoppers
were trapped inside for more than an hour until police dispersed
the group with armored cars and water cannons.
	   In another part of the city, a bakery owned by a French national
was surrounded by a group of men who threatened to attack the owner
and other white customers inside. Police dispersed the crowd.
	   Cameroonian government officials blamed the sport's ruling body,
FIFA, for allowing what they called poor-quality refereeing and
said the country had lodged an official protest.
	   ``What we saw is not a World Cup competition. It has been a
festival of scandal,'' Cameroon's Youth and Sports Minister Joseph
Owona was quoted as saying by the African Nation newspaper. ``It
was not the round ball that eliminated us.''
	   Some fans accused the football fraternity of hatching a plot
against African teams.
	   ``It has now been confirmed that no matter the performance of
Africans, whites are determined to eliminate us. We should stop
competing in the competition,'' said one fan who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   After an earlier 3-0 loss to Italy, frustrated supporters
accused Australian referee Edward Lennie of racial bias after he
ejected two Cameroonian players from the game for red-card
violations.
	   Cameroon surprised observers with a quarterfinals appearance in
the 1990 World Cup when the team was led by the now-retired star
Roger Milla. This year's edition of the team showed similar bursts
of speed and talent but had difficulties scoring.

Romania has several players injured for Tunisia game 
</HEADLINE>
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) _ Two tough games cost the winning Romanians
a heavy toll in injuries, and the players are tired and need a good
rest, team officials said Wednesday.
	   Ovidiu Stanga, a diligent, attacking midfielder who plays for
PSV Eindhoven, was sent to The Netherlands after he tore ligaments
in his left knee in the game against England, which Romania won
2-1. The injury could sideline the 25-year-old Romanian for as long
as three months, the officials said.
	   ``Stanga is more gravely injured and he was sent back to his
Dutch club for medical treatment,'' Costica Stefanescu, Romanian
Football Federation secretary, said Wednesday.
	   Also out for Romania's game against Tunisia on Friday in Group G
is midfielder Iulian Filipescu, suspended after getting two yellow
cards.
	   Other players on the doctor's list are Gabriel Popescu of
Salamanca, who has a nose injury, Valencia's striker Adrian Ilie,
who suffered a head injury, and sweeper Gheorghe Popescu, with a
bruised leg.
	   ``We hope that all of them will be fit to play against
Tunisia,'' said Stefanescu.
	   The Romanians did not make a secret of their plans to top the
group standings.
	   ``We'll do whatever we can to get the first spot in our group,''
said Stefanescu. ``But several players have health problems and
others are tired after two difficult games. Our doctor has been
very busy these days.''
	   Team officials said coach Anghel Iordanescu will try several
second-string players, with less international experience. That
should pose no problems for Romania _ at least for its game against
bottom-of-the-standings Tunisia.
	   After beating England and Colombia, Romania tops the group
standings with six points, and has already qualified for the
knockout second stage.
	   The Romanians will meet Argentina or Croatia in the round of 16
on June 30, depending on which place the teams get in their groups.
Argentina and Croatia play in Group H, along with Japan and
Jamaica.
	   ``We prefer to play Croatia, it's closer to our playing style.
Argentina has a much better team than four years ago,'' Gabi
Balint, Romania's second coach, told reporters.
	   In the '94 World Cup in the United States, Romania beat
Argentina 3-2 in the round of 16. It was eliminated by Sweden on a
penalty shootout in the quarterfinals.

World Cup: Gambler places record bet on England 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A gambler has placed a record 200,000 pound (dlrs
334,000) bet on England to beat Colombia in the vital World Cup
clash Friday.
	   A spokesman for bookmaker William Hill, who took the bet from a
foreign-based businessman Wednesday, said it could be the largest
bet ever placed with a British bookmaker on any event.
	   The gambler ignored England's 2-1 loss to Romania on Monday and
placed the bet when William Hill offered the odds of 4-5 on England
winning and advancing into the second round.
	   William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said the World Cup was on
target to produce a record betting turnover of 100 million, which
would make it the biggest betting event of all time.
	   Bookmaker Ladbrokes reported a surge Tuesday after increasing
the odds of England gaining World Cup victory to 33-1 following the
team's defeat by Romania.
	   But within 15 minutes of betting opening Ladbrokes was forced to
cut the odds to 20-1 and has now trimmed the odds further to 16-1.
	   Brazil is still favorite to win the World Cup at odds of 11-4.

Security Council hears evidence of Iraqi nerve gas weapons Council; comments from US and British ambassadors; CORRECTS quotes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Butler beginning his briefing to the Security
in 3rd graf; edits to conform; TIGHTENS
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq has rejected a U.S. Army laboratory's
finding that traces of a deadly VX nerve gas were on shards of
Iraqi missile warheads, and is demanding independent analysis of
the samples.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, briefed the
Security Council behind closed doors Wednesday on results of an
analysis by the U.S. Army laboratory at Aberdeen, Maryland.
	   Diplomatic sources said the lab reported finding traces of VX
and a stabilizer on Iraqi warheads, despite Iraq's claims that it
never succeeded in transforming the deadly nerve agent into a
weapon.
	   If the findings are true, they could undermine efforts by
Russia, France and China to close the seven-year inspection program
and lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Saddam
Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait. The invasion led to the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   Before the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who won
international acclaim in February for striking a deal with the
Iraqis to avert U.S.-led airstrikes, said Wednesday he hoped the
finding would not damage U.N. relations with Iraq.
	   ``We are dealing with the Iraqis on a large spectrum of issues
and I hope this particular development will not destroy the
improved relations that has allowed UNSCOM to carry on with its
work,'' Annan said, using the acronym for the U.N. Special
Commission which performs arms inspections.
	   ``I expect and I plead with them to continue to work with UNSCOM
so they can see light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said, meaning
an end to sanctions.
	   But the British and American ambassadors _ Iraq's toughest
critics on the council _ said the findings underscore the need for
Baghdad to disclose all information on illegal weapons programs if
it expects an end to sanctions.
	   ``I think Iraq is conducting its diversion and deception
campaign and it's not working,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson
told reporters as he arrived for the meeting. ``Facts are facts.
Iraq has been deceiving the international community with
weaponization of nerve gas.''
	   British Ambassador John Weston said ``the truth is not relative
and the truth is not what you can get away with.''
	   ``And we need to have satisfaction on this issue as on the other
uncompleted bits of work before this whole question (of sanctions
relief) can be any further in the Security Council,'' Weston said.
	   In a statement published Wednesday in Baghdad, Saddam and other
Iraqi leaders demanded sanctions be lifted immediately. If not,
they warned they would reconsider relations with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The statement did not mention the VX findings, although the
official Iraqi News Agency dismissed them as ``baseless and mere
fabrications.''
	   Iraq's U.N. mission said in a statement Tuesday that Baghdad
rejects the results, adding they ``cannot be accurate since VX was
not used in any kind of munitions in Iraq due to continuous
production failure.''
	   The Iraqis said the samples were too small to be conclusive and
``finding a trace of a stabilizer in one sample out of seven
analyzed is not evidence because, if VX was used, a stabilizer
would have been found in every sample.''
	   Iraq said the results must be verified by laboratories in a
neutral country or in several countries.
	   VX is a colorless, odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it
comes into contact with oxygen. A few drops can kill in minutes.
	   Despite the American report, the Security Council is deeply
divided over the Iraq issue. The United States and Britain insist
Iraq be compelled to provide full disclosure of all banned weapons
before sanctions are lifted.
	   Russia, China and France are equally resolved that the
inspections should wrap up as quickly as possible, a position also
held by Annan's chief advisers.
	   It remains unclear whether the new evidence would be enough to
persuade the Russians, French and Chinese to change their position.
	   Washington was hopeful it would.
	   ``I would be stunned if any country, in the light of these new
apparent deceptions on the part of the Iraqis, even suggested that
now is the time to be suspending or lifting the sanctions regime,''
State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
	   Even if the findings were verified, they would not prove
conclusively that Iraq still has banned weapons because the samples
were taken from warheads Baghdad says were destroyed after the Gulf
War.
	   But Iraq has maintained it never produced VX warheads or figured
out how to store the deadly nerve agent in bulk. Findings to the
contrary would call into question Iraq's previous declarations
about the state of its programs of mass-destruction weapons.
	   In Baghdad, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said that 1.7 tons
of VX had been produced, but that it was not of weapons grade. U.N.
officials suspect the Iraqis produced up to four tons and that if
some was placed in warheads more could be hidden in Iraq.

Flash floods kill at least 22 people in Mogadishu 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Flash floods due to heavy rains
overnight killed at least 22 people and destroyed more than 100
homes in Mogadishu, a faction leader said Wednesday.
	   Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who controls the northern part of the city,
urged the residents to help one another and appealed for food,
medicine and shelter material from international aid agencies. Most
of the victims died when their homes were flooded or collapsed, Ali
Mahdi said.
	   Foreign aid agencies no longer operate in Mogadishu because of
insecurity.
	   Abdulaziz Mohamed Omar, who was in a group of 30 youths helping
people escape the floods, said the team had rescued more than 80
children from 60 homes which were either damaged or threatened by
the floods.
	   Hundreds of people fled their homes to higher grounds and were
either being cared for by relatives or sympathizers.
	   The floods also halted all vehicular traffic in and out of the
seaside town.
	   It was impossible to ascertain the amount of rainfall because
Somalia has had no functioning government or public services like
meteorology since the 1991 ouster of the late dictator Mohamed Siad
Barre.
	   The country disintegrated into fiefdoms protected by militias
after the rebels turned against each other when Siad Barre's rule
collapsed.

AT-and-T agrees to buy TCI for dlrs 32 billion approval within 9 months, other details. AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES stock prices; ADDS Armstrong saying he expects
By DAVID E. KALISH
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ AT-and-T Corp. is buying cable television giant
Tele-Communications Inc. for dlrs 32 billion in a bold step that
would give the long-distance company access to millions of homes to
offer local telephone service and high-speed Internet access.
	   The all-stock transaction would allow AT-and-T to reach TCI's
more than 13 million cable customers across the United States and
make good on AT-and-T chairman Michael Armstrong's promise to beef
up the company's weak spots and branch out into new
telecommunications businesses.
	   Getting access to TCI's cable customers would be a major step
toward that goal. Eventually, it could give AT-and-T the ability to
offer local phone service through TCI's existing cable hook-ups to
customers' homes.
	   ``Wednesday we're beginning to answer a big part of the question
about how we will provide local service to U.S. consumers,''
Armstrong said in announcing the deal Wednesday.
	   The agreement would combine the nation's biggest
telecommunications company and one of the biggest cable companies.
It would be the third-richest ever in the telecommunications
industry after SBC Communications Inc.'s planned dlrs 60.1 billion
purchase of rival Baby Bell Ameritech Corp. and WorldCom Inc.'s
planned dlrs 37 billion purchase of MCI Communications Inc.
	   AT-and-T is paying just under dlrs 51 a share to buy all of
TCI's outstanding shares. That represents a 31 percent premium over
TCI's closing price of dlrs 38.69 on Tuesday on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. AT-and-T's stock was down dlrs 4.87 1/2 at dlrs 60.50 per
share on the New York Stock Exchange this morning. TCI rose dlrs
2.69 to dlrs 41.37 1/2.
	   In addition to paying dlrs 32 billion in stock, AT-and-T would
assume TCI's huge debt of dlrs 16 billion.
	   Under the deal, which must be approved by stockholders and
government regulators, TCI's programming arm, Liberty Media Group,
would continue to be operated independently and run by TCI chief
executive John C. Malone.
	   Despite a 1996 federal law intended to open up local phone
markets to new competition, AT-and-T and other long-distance
companies largely have sat on the sidelines. AT-and-T has scrapped
a series of strategies for breaking into local phone service and
has said the regional phone monopolies were charging too much for
leasing local lines for it to make a profit.
	   A TCI deal is ``exactly what AT-and-T has needed to burst into
the local market,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent
telecommunications consultant based in Atlanta. ``AT-and-T would
have the ability to offer a bundle they were never able to offer
before.''
	   AT-and-T made a move toward entering the local phone services
market in January by buying Teleport Communications Group for dlrs
11.3 billion. Teleport, which is partly owned by a group of cable
companies, provides local phone services to business.
	   TCI had previously been eyed by a big telephone company when
Bell Atlantic proposed buying it in 1993 for dlrs 26 billion. At
the time the deal was ballyhooed as marking the convergence of
telecommunications and entertainment, but the deal fell apart and
cable and telephones appeared headed their separate ways.
	   AT-and-T is gambling that TCI's upgrades of its network to
handle digital services will enable it to provide more
sophisticated services to households, including Internet access.
TCI has spent dlrs 500 million this year alone so far to update its
equipment to handle two-way transmissions by 2000. With AT-and-T's
deep pockets, TCI hopes to finish the upgrade up to 20 percent
faster, Malone said.
	   AT-and-T itself has a rocky history with regulators; government
criticism led it to abandon merger talks last year with SBC
Communications Inc., a Baby Bell.
	   But Armstrong said the new deal will create competition in local
markets instead of reducing it. He expects regulators to approve
its TCI purchase within 9 months. ``We don't anticipate this will
be a rough road,'' Armstrong said in a teleconference with analysts
this morning.
	   Under the agreement, AT-and-T would own TCI's cable businesses
while maintaining an alliance with Liberty Media Group, which
includes stakes in some of America's most popular cable networks,
including Discovery, Black Entertainment Television and Fox/Liberty
Networks.

Zeman opens talks on center-left government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The winner of last weekend's early
elections, Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman, opened talks
Wednesday to tru and build a center-left government coalition.
	   President Vaclav Havel asked Zeman on Monday to try and form the
cabinet, a process likely to take several weeks.
	   Zeman won the elections, held two years early in a vain attempt
to overcome political deadlock. But he has only 74 seats in the
200-seat legislature, and lacks obvious center-left allies that
could give him a majority.
	   On Wednesday, Zeman met with ex-premier Vaclav Klaus, whose
center-right Civic Democratic party finished second with 63 seats.
	   Klaus, who based his campaign on staunch opposition to the
Social Democrats, again ruled out supporting any government led by
Zeman.
	   Both leaders are competing for the support of two small
center-right parties, the Christian Democrats chaired by Josef Lux
and the Freedom Union led by Jan Ruml.
	   ``Two possible candidates for (Zeman's) government are also
possible candidates for government of a different type,'' Klaus
told Czech radio after seeing the Social Democrat.
	   Later Wednesday, Zeman met with Miroslav Grebenicek whose
old-guard Communist party holds 24 seats.
	   The Communists are the third strongest, but avoided by all four
remaining parties as coalition partners due to their record and
lack of will to reform. Their tacit support could theoretically
play into Zeman's hands.
	   Grebenicek said he could support a coalition of Social Democrats
and Christian Democrats, a two-party minority cabinet already
rejected by Lux.
	   ``The Communist party could be tolerant in certain cases,''
Grebenicek told CTK news agency after meeting with Zeman.
	   Zeman is scheduled to meet Lux and Ruml for crucial talks on
Thursday, when he will also inform Havel of progress made.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a government
coalition, Havel will likely ask Klaus to attempt the same.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Greg Rusedski, fourth seeded this year
and a quarterfinalist last year, pulled out of Wimbledon Wednesday
when his badly sprained left ankle failed to respond to treatment.
	   The Canadian-born Briton _ famed for having tennis' fastest
serve _ was scheduled Wednesday to complete his match against
Australian qualifier Mark Draper, which was cut short Tuesday by
rain.
	   Rusedski won the first set 6-4, dropped the second 6-2 as he
began to limp badly. Draper was up a break at 5-4 in the third when
play was called.
	   Rusedski injured the ankle almost two weeks ago in a bad fall
during the Queen's tournament, a traditional grass-court warmup for
Wimbledon.
	   ``I thought it would get better,'' Rusedski said. ``I thought
when it got warmed up it would get better. Unfortunatley, it didn't
happen. But there is always next year.''
	   ``There was a very good chance for me this year,'' he added. ``I
thought I was playing some of my best tennis.''
	   ``My form was just coming right. But in life these things happen
and they make you stronger.''
	   ``I didn't have the power and force in the foot, I just couldn't
get that.''
	   Tony Pickard, angered by Rusedski's decision to attempt a match
on the ankle, resigned Wednesday as his coach.
	   ``I'm not worried about it,'' Rusedski said, obviously upset.
``The player always makes it. The coach can help, but it's the
player at the end of the day.''
	   ``I guess that just shows the person's (Pickard's) true
colors.''
	   The left-handed Rusedski and fellow Briton Tim Henman both
reached the quarterfinals last year and have been billed as
Britain's great hope to win its first men's singles title since
1936.

Police warn of champion pickpockets 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ They take the same international flights, stay in
the same hotels, even attend the same soccer matches as their
victims.
	   More than a dozen pickpockets, mostly from South America, have
been arrested by French police for robbing foreign tourists since
the World Cup began June 10, according to Paris police spokeswoman
Elise Sainson.
	   Police describe the light-fingered thieves as experienced,
clever, and cautious.
	   ``They're clever, don't take chances and do a lot of damage.
They keep the cash, and sell off everything else _ credit cards,
passports,'' one officer told the daily Le Parisien.
	   Police say most of the pickpockets are from Chile, though an
Ecuadorean couple, aged 60 and 57, was caught lifting a fat wallet
from a German tourist at the Charles de Gaulle airport.
	   ``The couple is known as international pickpockets,'' Sainson
said. ``They can be found wherever there are big sporting events or
where there are huge crowds.''
	   She said the couple made their travel arrangements through the
same tour operators as their victims, and that the special police
unit hunting pickpockets, known as TIRE, was expecting them.
	   One Frenchman was caught operating on the fashionable Rue de
Rivoli, which is lined with souvenir shops.
	   Loudspeakers in subway stations and buses warn passengers, in
French and English, of the presence of pickpockets and tell them to
hang on to their belongings.
	   Police also have beefed up patrols in the subway, especially on
the lines fans take to get to stadiums for matches.
	   Several pickpockets _ including two Albanian youths, Romanians
and several more Ecuadoreans _ were caught working the crowd of
fans coming out of the metro at the Stade de France.
	   Police are warning tourists to be particularly cautious at
airports and train stations. The World Cup ends July 12.

	   MIDDELFART, Denmark (AP) _ Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Wednesday he remained optimistic that a peaceful
solution would be found to end the ethnic violence in Yugoslavia's
secessionist Kosovo region.
	   ``There are no signs that (Serbia's president Slobodan)
Milosevic will move away from his promises,'' Primakov said. ``The
present situation (indicates) that there is a political solution in
sight,'' he said told a news conference.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Tuesday warned Milosevic that
time for a peaceful end to the crackdown against ethnic Albanias in
Kosovo region was running out.
	   Asked whether Russia would support military action against Serb
forces, Primakov said ``we would rather avoid that situation.''
	   Moscow _ traditionally a Serb ally _ would ``avoid (putting)
deadlines'' on Milosevic, the Russian foreign minister said, adding
it would be ``unjust and unacceptable'' not to try to settle the
issue with political talks.
	   ``I understand that Milosevic is ready to talk with all
political forces,'' Primakov said.
	   Primakov, in Denmark for a meeting of the foreign ministers of
baltic Sea states, said he had spoke by telephone with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Allbright on Tuesday about the
Balkans.
	   ``We agreed that we should coordinate our actions,'' Primakov
said, through a translator, but declined to give details.

Bitter soccer fans target white expatriates in Cameroon

<TEXT>
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ Throngs of angry supporters of
Cameroon's soccer team Wednesday attacked vehicles and businesses
owned by white expatriates in retaliation against what they
described as a racist anti-African plot by World Cup officials.
	   No injuries were reported.
	   The attacks accompanied Cameroonian government condemnation of
officiating in the World Cup after Cameroon was ousted from the
World Cup on Tuesday in a controversial 1-1 draw with Chile.
	   Cameroon's coach Claude Leroy and his players insisted they were
cheated by Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner's refusal to allow a
second-half goal by Francois Omam Biyick that gave Cameroon the
lead.
	   A victory would have propelled the Indomitable Lions into the
second round.
	   Several cars, including one with diplomatic license plates, were
damaged and a number of people threatened as crowds of university
students shouted anti-white slogans in the streets of Yaounde,
Cameroon's capital.
	   Security forces in riot gear patrolled the city after a group of
white shoppers in a popular downtown supermarket was surrounded by
a mob of young men who threatened to attack whites. Some shoppers
were trapped inside for more than an hour until police dispersed
the group with armored cars and water cannons.
	   In another part of the city, a bakery owned by a French national
was surrounded by a group of men who threatened to attack the owner
and other white customers inside. Police dispersed that crowd as
well.
	   Cameroonian government officials blamed the sport's ruling body,
FIFA, for allowing what they called poor-quality refereeing and
said the country had lodged an official protest.
	   ``What we saw is not a World Cup competition. It has been a
festival of scandal,'' Cameroon's Youth and Sports Minister Joseph
Owona was quoted as saying by the African Nation newspaper. ``It
was not the round ball that eliminated us.''
	   Some fans accused the football fraternity of hatching a plot
against African teams.
	   After an earlier 3-0 loss to Italy, frustrated supporters
accused Australian referee Edward Lennie of racial bias after he
ejected two Cameroonian players from the game for red-card
violations.
	   Cameroon surprised observers with a quarterfinals appearance in
the 1990 World Cup when the team was led by the now-retired star
Roger Milla. This year's edition of the team showed similar bursts
of speed and talent but had difficulties scoring.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Wednesday formally accepted the resignation of most of his Cabinet,
submitted nearly a year ago amid allegations of widespread
corruption.
	   The acceptance was a key demand of Palestinian legislators who
threatened to hold a no-confidence motion against Arafat if he
didn't move swiftly to form a new government.
	   Legislators agreed to give Arafat two weeks to reshuffle his
cabinet, Palestinian Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat said.
	   ``Having accepted the resignation of the previous government,''
Arafat wrote to the Palestinian Legislative Council, ``I hereby
inform you that consultations have not yet been completed and I
will introduce my new government when I finish the consultations
within the next two weeks in accordance with the rules of
parliament.''
	   Last August, 16 of 18 Cabinet ministers submitted their
resignations to Arafat following reports of corruption in
government ministries. Arafat never said whether he accepted the
resignations.
	   ``We'll remain in office until a new Cabinet is appointed in the
next two weeks,'' Erekat said. The Cabinet is expected to meet
Thursday, in what may be their last meeting before the reshuffle.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.7
shook Tokyo and areas to the north and east Wednesday night, but
there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.
	   The quake, at 11:52 p.m. (1452 GMT), was centered about 70
kilometers (44 miles) underground in Ibaraki prefecture (state),
about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of Tokyo, the Meteorological
Agency said.
	   An earthquake of 5 is considered very strong, but effects of
Wednesday's quake were muffled by its distance underground.

By GEORGE BOEHMER

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The Interior Ministry toughened border
checks Wednesday for soccer hooligans traveling to the World Cup in
France, fearful that German thugs might repeat their weekend
violence at the upcoming Germany-Iran game.
	   An additional 1,000 police will posted along the southwestern
border to target hooligans traveling to Thursday's match in
Montpelier, France.
	   Germany is seeking ways to curb soccer hooliganism after about
180 thugs clashed with French police during and after the game
Sunday between Germany and Yugoslavia. An officer, Daniel Nivel,
was beaten comatose. Two Germans _ Markus Warnecke, 27, of Hanover,
and Steffen Karl Elschner, 26, of Braunschweig _ were arrested in
the attack.
	   Shocked and shamed by the violence, Germans nationwide launched
fundraising campaigns Wednesday for the injured officer's family.
	   ``Our entire sympathy at this difficult time goes to his wife
and both his sons,'' said a statement from the Berlin police group
Gruener Stern, which opened a donations account with support from
the Berlin police union.
	   The statement listed a bank account number where people could
transfer money, a common method for paying bills in Germany.
	   The Bild tabloid, Germany's most-read newspaper, declared on its
front page that it was giving 50,000 marks (dlrs 27,900) to the
family and asked readers for donations.
	   State police in Mecklenburg Lower Pommerania opened a donations
account, as did the radio station Hit-Radio Antenna, in Lower
Saxony state, and ARD television's West Deutsche Runkfunk radio
subsidiary in Cologne.
	   The victims aid group Weisser Ring is collecting donations for
Nivel's family in an account in Mainz under the code phrase
``Hooligan Victims.''
	   Interior Minister Manfred Kanther ordered the increased border
checks despite his comments earlier Wednesday that stopping
hooligans at the border is a near-impossible task.
	   Soccer thugs move in small groups to avoid detection and cannot
be easily distinguished from other travelers _ particularly in the
busy summer vacation months.
	   ``This is like looking for a needle in a haystack,'' Kanther
said in the lower house of parliament during a regular meeting on
internal security.
	   More effective might be a push by local authorities to identify
soccer hooligans planning violence and prevent them from traveling
abroad, Kanther said.
	   The German Sports Federation has proposed setting up a data bank
on soccer hooligans, an idea supported by Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel.

FINA doping panel to meet July 24 on Smith's case 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The competitive future of triple Olympic swimming
champion Michelle Smith could be decided by the International
Swimming Federation's (FINA) doping panel on July 24.
	   FINA secretary Gunnar Werner confirmed the hearing date
Wednesday. The panel will examine allegations that the Irish
swimmer manipulated a urine sample _ an offense punishable by a
life ban.
	   A FINA spokesman said the doping panel would proceed with or
without the presence of Smith.
	   FINA submitted Smith's case to its doping panel for
investigation on May 25 after analysis of her backup sample showed
the same signs of alleged tampering as her first specimen.
	   Smith underwent an out-of-competiton test in Kilkenny County,
Ireland, on January 10.
	   FINA said her urine sample showed ``unequivocal signs of
adulteration'' and ``physical manipulation.''
	   The samples allegedly contained a lethal concentration of
alcohol.
	   The scheduling of the doping panel hearing was in doubt when
Smith's lawyer Peter Lennon announced May 26 that he would apply to
the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for an injunction.
	   Lennon contended that FINA did not report finding any banned
drug in either sample and, therefore, the charges should be
dropped.
	   Lennon was not available for comment Wednesday.
	   Smith, who won three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,
has repeatedly denied accusations that she used
performance-enhancing drugs.

WTO: Nigeria needs major reform to regain international confidence throughout to tidy 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes from US, European Union; RECASTS
By PHILIP WALLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Major political and economic reforms are needed to
revive international confidence in Nigeria, according to a report
out Wednesday.
	   Continuing political uncertainty and weakening respect for the
law in the sprawling West African nation is discouraging foreign
trade and investment, according to the 132-page World Trade
Organization review.
	   The country's oil business, representing more than 95 percent of
Nigeria's export trade and three quarters of government revenue, is
dynamic compared to other parts of the economy.
	   But even this is hindered by ``inappropriate policies'' causing
oil refinery rundowns and serious shortages of petroleum products
in the home market, the report says.
	   Nigeria's new government, led by General Abdulsalam Abubakar,
should reduce import restrictions and its external debt, and
implement its proposed privatization of state industries, thereby
reducing the economy's oil dependence, it says.
	   European Union officials told a meeting in Geneva they believed
the country's disappointing economic performance resulted from
widespread corruption and fraud, mismanagement, overregulation and
lack of accountability.
	   ``The fortunes created by the oil sector remain concentrated in
the hands of the very few, while the large majority of the
population suffers,'' a statement said.
	   U.S. trade officials told the meeting the Nigerian trade regime
must be substantially reformed to attract more domestic and foreign
investment.
	   They said the United States would only help when Nigeria had
demonstrated commitment to reform.
	   Nigerian trade officials told the meeting trade and investment
regimes were being reformed.
	   Since Abubakar took power on June 8, he has sent mixed messages
to activists and opponents of his late predecessor Sani Abacha.
	   Nigeria's critics have praised Abubakar for releasing a string
of political prisoners who opposed Abacha's harsh rule.
	   But he angered Nigeria's political opposition by moving quickly
to quash pro-democracy protests and making only vague pledges to
advance Abacha's flawed political reform program, due to culminate
in an Oct. 1 transition to civilian rule.
	   Attempts to use the country's large oil revenue to expand the
economic base ``have been mostly unsuccessful,'' the report said.
The economy remains highly vulnerable to oil price fluctuations.
	   The report acknowledges the military government's efforts to
liberalize Nigeria's foreign exchange and investment regimes and
establish a stable and predictable structure of import tariffs.
	   But it said: ``A wide array of export incentive schemes has
failed to offset the anti-export bias resulting from the import
regime, cumbersome export procedures and failing infrastructure.''

Half of Russia's banks in mafia hands, sociologist says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Criminal gangs control half of Russia's
banks and back about 20 percent of lawmakers in the Russian State
Duma, a Moscow sociologist said Wednesday.
	   Yakov Gilinsky estimated that there are some 3,000 criminal
gangs in Russia, with 15,000 active members.
	   The director of the Deviantological Center of the Russian
Academy of Sciences' Sociological Institute, he spoke at a forum
organized by the Hungarian National Criminological Institute.
	   Corruption permeates all levels of society, he said.
	   Among the major reasons he mentioned that many young people are
without jobs, and that because of corruption and high tax payments
it is virtually impossible to conduct business honestly.
	   Hungarian political scientist Laszlo Lengyel, another speaker at
the forum, warned of the threat to Europe from capital with shady
sources.
	   ``Within today's global financial situation we can't be sure
what the source of the money is that they might use to buy up the
shares of big Hungarian private companies,'' he said.
	   However, Lengyel pointed out that Hungary is a ``small fish''
for the Russian mafia, adding that ``if Gazprom could spend 4 to 5
billion dollars to support (President Boris) Yeltsin's campaign, we
are not a major target.''

New law to allow sending WWII back to Iron Curtain countries 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The final barrier to establishing
modern extradition treaties with former Iron Curtain countries will
be removed by legislation introduced Wednesday in Australia's
Parliament, Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said.
	   The War Crimes Amendment Bill 1998 repeals a section of the War
Crimes Act 1945 to allow suspected World War II criminals to be
extradited from Australia to former Iron Curtain countries.
	   Vanstone said that since the Iron Curtain no longer existed,
countries such as Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were now accepted
as members of the Council of Europe and Australia was prepared to
enter into extradition arrangements.
	   ``Although the usual practice would have been to extradite
persons accused of such crimes to the country where the crimes
occurred, at the time it was considered politically unacceptable to
extradite persons to countries behind the so-called Iron Curtain,''
Vanstone said.
	   The new legislation would remove the barrier that has prevented
Australia from cooperating with the international community in the
trial of suspected war criminals, she said.
	   The War Crimes Act only applied to war criminals from European
1939 to 1945 theaters of war, with any alleged war criminals from
later conflicts dealt with under the Extradition Act.

Bottlenose dolphins in Scotland thought to be killing their young 
</HEADLINE>
By JENNY E. HELLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The sociable, frisky dolphin may not be as gentle
as its image. Researchers said Wednesday that a group of dolphins
in northeast Scotland is killing its own young in what scientists
call the first discovery of infanticide among dolphins, porpoises
or whales.
	   In a study lasting more than six years, researchers from
Aberdeen University and the Scottish Agricultural College
discovered evidence of physical attacks on five of eight young
dolphins found dead on a beach. All were less than a year old.
	   The carcasses, from a group of 130 bottlenose dolphins living at
Moray Firth, had fractured ribs and spines, ruptured organs and
large teeth marks on their skin, said Bob Reid, who works at the
Scottish Agricultural College investigating the calves' deaths.
	   The wounds were similar to those fatally inflicted on porpoises
by the group of dolphins, detailed in a report published earlier
this decade by the same researchers.
	   Reid said that by comparing the carcasses of the porpoises and
young dolphins and measuring the size of the teeth marks,
scientists concluded the dolphins were killed by members of their
own species.
	   ``Most people don't like to think about it happening,'' Reid
said. ``But it's normal behavior for lots of wild animals.''
	   Paul Thompson, a member of the research team from Aberdeen
University, said the calves' own parents probably were not the
culprits.
	   By comparing dolphins with other animals with similar behavioral
patterns, such as lions, it seems likely that males from the group
attack groups of females and kill their babies so the females can
begin mating again, he said.
	   Thompson noted that human behavior in the region may increase
the frequency of killings by disturbing the dolphins' social order.
	   In what could be further evidence for dolphin infanticide,
researchers from Aberdeen carrying out routine boat surveys in 1994
observed an adult dolphin ``acting agressively'' toward the carcass
of a young dolphin, Thompson said.
	   After learning of the Scotland study, researchers at the
Virginia Marine Science Museum in the United States found similar
evidence of adult dolphins killing their young. They discovered
carcasses of calves washed up on beaches with the same types of
injuries and witnessed adult dolphins violently throwing their
young in the air.
	   The dolphin group in Scotland _ one of two bottlenose dolphin
communities in the United Kingdom _ kills 20 percent of its progeny
each year, researchers said. No cases of infanticide have been
discovered in the second group, which is in Wales.
	   The researchers' work will appear in the July edition of the
Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, a British scientific
journal. Excerpts were published in the current BBC Wildlife
magazine.

Australian Senate passes motion supporting Gusmao's release 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The upper house of Australia's
Parliament passed a motion Wednesday calling for the immediate and
unconditional release of jailed East Timorese independence leader
Xanana Gusmao.
	   The Senate vote on thg ention followed a personal appeal for
help by Gusmao to Australian Prime Minister John Howard in a letter
smuggled out of the prison in which he is being held.
	   ``All of us, representing Indonesians fighting for democracy and
East Timorese fighting for freedom, appeal to the government of
Howard to firmly urge (Indonesia's) President Habibie to
immediately release all political prisoners,'' Gusmao wrote in the
letter, which was read to the Senate.
	   ``We appeal to the Australian government to change its position
on East Timor and to become a champion of self-determination for
East Timor.''
	   The Green party's Bob Brown, who read the letter, urged the
Senate to pass a motion demanding that Indonesia not only free
Gusmao, but also allow a free and fair referendum on the issue of
independence for East Timor.
	   The Labor opposition's Peter Cook amended that motion to seek
Gusmao's immediate release, but instead of pressing for a
referendum on the former Portuguese colony's independence, it urged
that a substantive dialogue be established on East Timor's future
involving all concerned parties and the United Nations.
	   Cook said his motion would add weight to the meeting between
Habibie and East Timorese Nobel laureate Bishop Carlos Belo.
	   Cook's motion was supported by government, opposition and Green
Senators.

Zeman opens talks on center-left government 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Zeman meeting Communists
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The winner of last weekend's
deadlocked early elections, Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman, met
Wednesday with his bitter rival and runner-up, former Premier
Vaclav Klaus, as efforts continued to form a government.
	   President Vaclav Havel asked Zeman on Monday to try and form the
cabinet, a process likely to take several weeks.
	   Both Zeman and Klaus repeatedly have ruled out a ``grand
coalition'' of their center-left and center-right parties.
	   Zeman's Social Democrats gained 74 seats in the new 200-member
parliament, and Klaus' Civic Democratic Party 63.
	   On Wednesday, Klaus again ruled out supporting any government
led by Zeman.
	   ``Two possible candidates for such a government are also
possible candidates for government of a different type,'' Klaus
told Czech radio after the meeting.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a government
coalition, Havel will likely ask Klaus to attempt the same.
	   The deadlock leaves two smaller parties, the Christian Democrats
with 20 seats, and the Freedom Union with 19, in the position of
deciding whether the Czech Republic sticks with liberal rule, or
leans further left.
	   Later Wednesday, Zeman met with Miroslav Grebenicek whose
old-guard Communist party holds 24 seats. The Communists are the
third strongest party, but avoided by all four remaining parties as
coalition partners due to their record and lack of will to reform.
	   Grebenicek said he may consider lending a Social
Democrats-Christian Democrats tacit support in parliament.

Rusedski pulls out of Wimbledon with ankle problems AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Greg Rusedski, fourth seeded this year
and a quarterfinalist last year, pulled out of Wimbledon Wednesday
when his badly sprained left ankle failed to respond to treatment.
	   The Canadian-born Briton _ famed for having tennis' fastest
serve _ was scheduled Wednesday to complete his match against
Australian qualifier Mark Draper, which was cut short Tuesday by
rain.
	   Rusedski won the first set 6-4, dropped the second 6-2 as he
began to limp badly. Draper was up a break at 5-4 in the third when
play was called.
	   Rusedski injured the ankle almost two weeks ago in a bad fall
during the Queen's tournament, a traditional grass-court warmup for
Wimbledon.
	   ``I thought it would get better,'' Rusedski said. ``I thought
when it got warmed up it would get better. Unfortunatley, it didn't
happen. But there is always next year.''
	   ``There was a very good chance for me this year,'' he added. ``I
thought I was playing some of my best tennis.''
	   ``My form was just coming right. But in life these things happen
and they make you stronger.''
	   ``I didn't have the power and force in the foot, I just couldn't
get that.''
	   Tony Pickard, angered by Rusedski's decision to attempt a match
on the ankle, resigned Wednesday as his coach.
	   ``I'm not worried about it,'' Rusedski said, obviously upset.
``The player always makes it. The coach can help, but it's the
player at the end of the day.''
	   ``I guess that just shows the person's (Pickard's) true
colors.''
	   Pickard _ who coached Stefan Edberg to his Wimbledon titles _
said he dropped Rusedski over his decision to play.
	   ``I didn't think he should play,'' Pickard said. ``The other
thing that broke the camel's back is that for two days (last week)
I couldn't find him.''
	   Rusedski _ who has a reputation for being stubborn _ disappeared
from view last week, a move he said he made to get out of the
public eye while he tried to rehabilitate himself.
	   The left-handed Rusedski and fellow Briton Tim Henman both
reached the quarterfinals last year and have been billed as
Britain's great hope to win its first men's singles title since
1936.

Hamas leader returning after successful fundraising drive Palestinian Authority officials among those waiting to welcome him

Eds: UPDATES with Yassin arriving at Egyptian side of border,
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Waving green flags and singing Islamic
songs, supporters of Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin waited
Wednesday to welcome him back to the Gaza Strip.
	   The sheik, spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group,
arrived from Cairo to the Rafah border crossing point on Wednesday
evening. On the Gaza side of the crossing, a delegation of Hamas
officials and several dozen supporters spent the afternoon
preparing to greet him.
	   In Gaza City, well-wishers gathered at the home of the
62-year-old Hamas founder, who is quadriplegic and has hearing and
vision problems.
	   A freshly spray-painted graffiti on a nearby wall proclaimed:
``The Islamic nation is very proud of Ahmed Yassin who ... can lead
the nation to victory from his wheelchair.''
	   During a four-month fundraising tour of nearly a dozen Arab
capitals, Yassin had raised millions of dollars for the Islamic
militant group Hamas that vehemently opposes peace with Israel.
	   Yassin also made fiery statements _ widely reported in Israel _
praising suicide bombers and calling on Palestinians to carry on an
armed struggle against the Jewish state.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai left it open until
the last minute whether Israel would allow Yassin to return to the
Gaza Strip. Israel controls Gaza's external borders.
	   However, Israeli officials have said they considered Yassin more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his movements can be
monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The frail white-bearded Yassin left Cairo by car in the early
afternoon for the Rafah border crossing, Israel radio reported.
	   Yassin, who is the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, left
Gaza in late February, ostensibly on a short trip to obtain medical
treatment. Instead, he embarked on a tour of the Arab world.
	   In recent months, Yassin has posed a growing challenge to
Arafat's authority. Public opinion polls suggest Palestinian
support for Hamas has crept upward in recent months as the peace
process _ supported by Arafat's Palestinian Authority _ has
remained at an impasse.
	   This marks Yassin's second triumphal homecoming to Gaza in nine
months. Israel was forced to release him from prison in September
to buy the freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents who were caught
trying to kill another Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
	   Yassin had served eight years of a life term for ordering the
killings of Israeli soldiers and Palestinians accused of
collaborating with the Israelis.
	   It remained to be seen whether Yassin's return would worsen the
rift between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. Several
high-ranking Palestinian officials were part of the welcoming
party.
	   Tensions between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority took a sour
turn when Arafat's camp blamed an internal Hamas feud for the death
of chief Hamas bombmaker Mohiyadine Sharif, who was found dead
March 29 at the scene of a massive car-bomb blast in the West Bank
town of Ramallah.
	   But Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz Rantisi blamed the Palestinian
Authority and several high-ranking Palestinian officials and
security chiefs for collaborating with Israel in Sharif's death.
	   Rantisi was arrested in April and charged with endangering
national security. Earlier this month, the Palestinian Supreme
Court Rantisi released for lack of evidence, but he remains jailed.
	   Palestinian security forces routinely ignore court orders and
keep detainees in custody until their release is personally
approved by Arafat.
	   Last week, Hamas spurned an offer to join Arafat's Cabinet.

Young Democrats and Smallholders sign coalition pact 
</HEADLINE>
By EVA KEKES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's Young Democrats, winners of
last month's elections, signed a coalition pact Wednesday with the
agrarian-based Independent Smallholders Party, paving the way for
four years of center-right government.
	   Under the agreement, the Smallholders get four cabinet seats,
including the key defense and agriculture portfolios, environmental
protection and a post for overseeing European Union funds. The
party also gets the right to name the next president, when Arpad
Goencz' term in that largely ceremonial post expires in 2000.
	   The Smallholders' populist leader Jozsef Torgyan is set to be
agriculture minister. His profile has risen sharply in Hungary
since May elections left him the kingmaker in forming a coalition
with either the Young Democrats, who won 148 seats in the 386-seat
parliament, or the Socialists of Gyula Horn, who finished second.
	   With the Smallholders' 48 seats, and 17 seats with their smaller
partner, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the Young Democrats and
their prime minister-designate Viktor Orban have a comfortable
213-seat majority.
	   ``This step is of historical importance to enable Hungary to
move on on the path of European integration,'' Torgyan told The
Associated Press in an interview just before the signing.
	   ``We are planning long-term cooperation, not just for one
governmental term,'' he added.
	   In the past four years of Socialist government, Hungary gained
its coveted invitation to join NATO and got into the primary group
of post-communist nations to open talks on joining the EU in 2002.
	   Torgyan said the government's most important task is to boost
the economy and attract investors who will produce goods and create
jobs, rather than just acquiring shares of Hungary's market.
	   In the election campaign, Torgyan's party strongly opposed
foreign ownership of arable land, highway tolls, the crawling-peg
devaluation of the Hungarian forint and demanded large tax cuts.
	   This approach was widely seen as fiscally irresponsible. Now,
with power in reach, Torgyan says these issues are subject to
coalition negotiations.
	   Regarding foreign land ownership _ a touchy topic in other EU
candidate countries such as Slovenia _ Torgyan said allowing
foreigners to buy arable land freely right now ``would be equal to
looting the country.
	   ``First, the economy has to get stronger _ and then I also
wouldn't mind to buy a vineyard in Bordeaux,'' he joked.
	   Torgyan declined to comment on widespread speculation that he
will seek the presidency in 2000.

Russian, Ukrainian officials discuss gas debts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine sought a long-term contract with
Russia's gas monopoly Wednesday to prevent Gazprom from re-routing
natural gas supplies and depriving Ukraine of badly needed revenue.
	   Ukrainian leaders and top Gazprom executives also discussed
Ukraine's debt to the company.
	   Gazprom ships natural gas to Europe through Ukraine, but Ukraine
is concerned the company is considering other routes. Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said at a news conference he would
like a long contract with Gazprom, perhaps for 10 years.
	   The two sides also discussed Ukraine's unpaid bill to Gazprom,
which has recently been squeezed by Russian tax authorities who are
trying to increase budget revenues.
	   Russia estimates the bill is more than dlrs 1 billion, but
Pustovoitenko's deputy, Anatoly Holubchenko, said it is dlrs 690
million, of which dlrs 300 million is owed by private companies.
	   One of those companies has promised to pay its dlrs 70 million
bill by July and another has agreed to repay dlrs 17 million within
three to four months in gas equipment supplies, he said.
	   ``Ukraine has a full possibility to fully pay for the consumed
Russian gas by the end of the year,'' Holubchenko said, according
to the Interfax news agency.

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   High pressure just northwest of Puerto Rico has dominated area
weather, limiting the intensity and extent of precipitation.
However, the combination of sea breeze convergence, daytime heating
and local terrain features will allow scattered showers and a few
thunderstorms to develop over southwest Puerto Rico this afternoon.
	   An upper trough currently located over Puerto Rico will be
gradually pushed to the northwest and into a more favorable area
for shower and thunderstorm development by Friday.
	   Coastal sea heights and winds will remain above normal until
tonight. This will generate locally choppy seas, so mariners should
exercise caution, particularly in offshore waters.
	   San Juan and the northern sections of Puerto Rico:
	   Today... Partly sunny with widely scattered showers. High around
90. Wind northeast at 10 to 15 mph. Chance of rain is 20 percent.

Precede PRISTINA Holbrooke meets with KLA fighters in Kosovo Albanians accusing Serbs of trying to deceive Holbrooke with withdrawals. No pickup. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Holbrooke meeting with KLA and
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. troubleshooter Richard Holbrooke
ventured into troubled Kosovo Wednesday and met for the first time
with ethnic Albanian fighters _ tacit recognition of the Kosovo
Liberation Army's growing strength.
	   Holbrooke, who helped broker peace in Bosnia, grimly compared
the worsening situation in the secessionist province of Serbia to
that in Bosnia before the Dayton accord. He reiterated his call for
Serb forces to withdraw.
	   ``The situation is explosive,'' he said after holding private
talks with two local KLA leaders in Junik, a western town under
daily shelling by Serb security forces near the border with
Albania.
	   In a scene sure to anger Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
Holbrooke shook hands with the Albanian fighters and posed for
photographs with them.
	   ``These people are beleaguered and they don't have supplies,''
he said. ``The Serb security forces are all over the place.''
	   He also toured the town of Decane, where he cited the blackened
houses and houses with their roofs blown off as evidence condemning
the Serbs' action against pro-independence ethnic Albanians.
	   This is ``the kind of action we saw earlier in this part of the
world,'' he said, in a clear reference to Bosnia. ``The Serbs
should get out of here, and the original inhabitants should come
back and rebuild their houses with government help.''
	   Holbrooke was escorted by a truckload of armed Serb security
forces and three ethnic Albanian political officials who advocate
independence through peaceful means. He held talks throughout the
trip with the Albanians, calling the tour a ``traveling
negotiation.''
	   It came a day after he warned the Yugoslav president that time
for a peaceful end to the violence in the region was running out.
	   ``We are at a critical moment in the crisis surrounding
Kosovo,'' Holbrooke said Tuesday in Belgrade after four hours of
talks with Milosevic. He is scheduled to return to Belgrade on
Thursday, where the Russian news agency ITAR-Tass said he will meet
with Russia's deputy foreign minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky.
	   The visit by Holbrooke, nominated to be the next U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, is seen as a last attempt to get Milosevic
to stop his crackdown on ethnic Albanians.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between Serb-led army and police forces and the KLA,
which is gaining in public support in predominantly Albanian
Kosovo.
	   Due to fighting and rebel roadblocks along the province's main
Pristina-Pec road, Holbrooke and the U.S. delegation were forced to
detour through surrounding villages.
	   A shootout between Serb forces and KLA fighters erupted around a
convoy of reporters that followed Holbrooke on his tour, and proof
of heavy fighting was plentiful throughout the trip. While he was
speaking with the rebels, at least 10 distant explosions could be
heard, along with sporadic gunfire.
	   Viewing the burned-out houses and other damage in Decane,
Holbrooke said: ``This was not a firefight. It is the security
forces coming in and destroying houses and driving people out.''
	   The head of the local ethnic Albanian human rights board in
Decane said Serbs had withdrawn much of their forces from the area
before Holbrooke's visit.
	   ``The regime is naively trying to deceive the international
community and create a false picture about the situation in this
area,'' Musa Berisha claimed.
	   During his talks with Holbrooke, Milosevic reaffirmed an earlier
promise to allow foreign diplomats to observe the situation in
Kosovo. Holbrooke refused to reveal anything else about the
meeting. He also said little about his talk with the KLA.
	   In Brussels, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana met with
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and insisted Serbs and
Albanians return to the negotiating table without conditions.
Solana also stressed the NATO allies support a return to the
autonomy in Kosovo, but not the independence sought by both Rugova
and Albanian militants.
	   In 1989, Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy and has since
ruled the province with virtual martial law.

Security Council hears evidence of Iraqi nerve gas weapons Council; comments from US and British ambassadors; CORRECTS quote With US-Iraq-Nerve Gas, Iraq-UN 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Butler beginning his briefing to the Security
in 6th graf; edits to conform; TIGHTENS
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector briefed
the Security Council Wednesday on a U.S. Army laboratory's finding
that traces of a deadly VX nerve gas were on shards of Iraqi
missile warheads _ a finding Iraq has rejected.
	   Richard Butler met with council members behind closed doors on
results of an analysis by the U.S. Army laboratory at Aberdeen,
Maryland.
	   Diplomatic sources said the lab reported finding traces of VX
and a stabilizer on Iraqi warheads, despite Iraq's claims that it
never succeeded in transforming the deadly nerve agent into a
weapon.
	   If the findings are true, they could undermine efforts by
Russia, France and China to close the seven-year inspection program
and lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Saddam
Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait. The invasion led to the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   Before the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who won
international acclaim in February for striking a deal with the
Iraqis to avert U.S.-led airstrikes, said Wednesday that he hoped
the finding would not damage U.N. relations with Iraq.
	   ``We are dealing with the Iraqis on a large spectrum of issues
and I hope this particular development will not destroy the
improved relations that has allowed UNSCOM to carry on with its
work,'' Annan said, using the acronym for the U.N. Special
Commission that performs arms inspections.
	   But the British and American ambassadors _ Iraq's toughest
critics on the council _ said the findings underscore the need for
Baghdad to disclose all information on illegal weapons programs if
it expects an end to sanctions.
	   ``I think Iraq is conducting its diversion and deception
campaign and it's not working,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson
said as he arrived for the meeting. ``Facts are facts. Iraq has
been deceiving the international community with weaponization of
nerve gas.''
	   British Ambassador John Weston said ``the truth is not relative
and the truth is not what you can get away with.''
	   In a statement published Wednesday in Baghdad, Saddam and other
Iraqi leaders demanded sanctions be lifted immediately. If not,
they warned they would reconsider relations with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The statement did not mention the VX findings, although the
official Iraqi News Agency dismissed them as ``baseless and mere
fabrications.''
	   Iraq's U.N. mission said Tuesday in a statement that Baghdad
rejects the results, adding they ``cannot be accurate since VX was
not used in any kind of munitions in Iraq due to continuous
production failure.''
	   The Iraqis said the samples were too small to be conclusive and
``finding a trace of a stabilizer in one sample out of seven
analyzed is not evidence because, if VX was used, a stabilizer
would have been found in every sample.''
	   Iraq said the results must be verified by laboratories in a
neutral country or in several countries.
	   VX is a colorless, odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it
comes into contact with oxygen. A few drops can kill in minutes.
	   Despite the U.S. report, the Security Council is deeply divided
over the Iraq issue. The United States and Britain insist Iraq be
compelled to provide full disclosure of all banned weapons before
sanctions are lifted.
	   Russia, China and France are equally resolved that the
inspections should wrap up as quickly as possible, a position also
held by Annan's chief advisers.
	   It remains unclear whether the new evidence would be enough to
persuade the Russians, French and Chinese to change their position.
	   Even if the findings were verified, they would not prove
conclusively that Iraq still has banned weapons because the samples
were taken from warheads Baghdad says were destroyed after the Gulf
War.
	   But Iraq has maintained it never produced VX warheads or figured
out how to store the deadly nerve agent in bulk. Findings to the
contrary would call into question Iraq's previous declarations
about the state of its programs of mass-destruction weapons.
	   In Baghdad, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said that 1.7 tons
of VX had been produced, but that it was not of weapons grade. U.N.
officials suspect the Iraqis produced up to four tons and that if
some was placed in warheads more could be hidden in Iraq.

Cuprus says pact with Turks on missing persons is defunct 
</HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ An agreement between Cyprus' estranged
Greek and Turkish communities to locate people missing in communal
strife years ago is ``dead and buried,'' a senior Greek Cypriot
official said Wednesday.
	   Humanitarian Affairs Commissioner Takis Christopoulos said
Turkish Cypriots demands have led to the demise of the July 31,
1997 agreement between President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
	   The agreement was hailed at the time of its signing as a
breakthrough in one of the thorniest aspects of the Cyprus
problems. It was supposed to lay the ground for determining the
fate of 1,619 Greek Cypriots and 803 Turkish Cypriots missing in
communal clashes in the early 1960s and during Turkey's 1974
invasion and occupation of the northern third of the island.
	   The invasion, ostensibly to protect Turkish Cypriots, followed a
failed coup by Greek Cypriots who wanted the island united with
Greece.
	   ``The July agreement is dead and buried. I am afraid there is
not much hope of it being revived,'' Christopoulos told reporters.
	   The statement is likely to contribute to the tension on the
island and widen the gap between the two sides, which have been
separated by a U.N. buffer zone since the Turkish invasion.
	   Christopoulos said his government, the only internationally
recognized administration on the island, rejected Turkish Cypriot
demands that Greeks and Greek Cypriots killed during the failed
coup be struck off the list of the missing.
	   A spokesman for the United Nations in Cyprus, which has been
overseeing the implementation of the agreement, said the Turkish
Cypriot demand was not in line with the July 1997 agreement.
	   The U.N. is trying to salvage the agreement and get the two
sides to meet again, the spokesman said.
	   The long-running Cyprus problem has defied repeated attempts to
solve it by the United Nations and Western nations.
	   Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, says he will not return to
the negotiating table unless his self-styled state, declared in
1983 and recognized only by Turkey, is recognized and Cyprus
withdraws from membership talks with the European Union.

Spanish oil company Repsol in talks on expanding Iraqi presence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish oil and energy company Repsol said
Wednesday it hoped to enter oil exploration and production in Iraq
later this year if sanctions are lifted.
	   Repsol's apparent confidence in the future of Iraqi oil came on
the last day of a three-day visit to Spain by the country's top
diplomat.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz arrived in Madrid on
Sunday, lobbying for support in his mission to persuade the United
Nations Security Council to lift economic sanctions imposed after
the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq says it has complied with all U.N. resolutions and is
backed by Russia, but both the U.S. and Great Britain remain strong
opponents to lifting the sanctions.
	   Banned from exporting oil except under a U.N. oil-for-food deal,
Iraq's exports are limited to about 1.5 million barrels a day
despite having the second largest reserves after Saudi Arabia.
	   A Repsol spokeswoman said the company is already involved in the
U.N.'s oil-for-food shipments.
	   Oil companies from France, Italy, Russia and China are also
reportedly busy planning projects to develop Iraq's oil fields that
they could only pursue if sanctions were lifted.

<TEXT>
	   NHOMA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Heavy shelling battered
Guinea-Bissau's capital Wednesday and rockets screeched above
nearby towns while a delegation led by the parliamentary speaker
was fired on by renegade soldiers he was trying to meet.
	   The delegation, led by speaker Malam Bacai Sanha, had come to
Nhoma, 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of the capital, Bissau, to
discuss a cease-fire and the possible return of government to this
West African country. But they had to turn back after the rebel
soldiers opened fire on them. There were no injuries.
	   But religious leaders pressed ahead in their efforts to meet
with former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane, who has a base
in Nhoma.
	   ``I'm hopeful Ansumane Mane will talk. He is my friend and i
hope he will respond to my words,'' Father Setinio Artur Franzetti,
the Bishop of Bissau, said in an interview in Nhoma. ``What we want
is to push for a consensus to at least stop fighting and start a
dialogue.''
	   Three large rockets flew above Nhoma on Wednesday morning, one
screaming past a small village on the outskirts of town, and
artillery fire pounded the area. There were no immediate reports of
injuries.
	   In Bissau, meanwhile, government troops, supported by forces
from neighboring Senegal, began an artillery bombardment at dawn
against the breakaway faction's positions around Bissau's airport
and in a nearby suburban military garrison, according to Portugal's
ambassador to Guinea-Bissau.
	   ``Apparently, the shelling was from the government side, then
the rebels responded,'' Ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva
told Portuguese radio RDP-Africa.
	   The bombardment was continuing four hours later as Senegalese
infantry units moved up to the front line, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   While the situation in Bissau is not completely clear, an aid
worker based there said Wednesday that the city is largely
surrounded by rebel forces and that most Guinea-Bissau soldiers
have changed side.
	   The aid worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
fight has largely come down to President Joao Bernardo Vieira, a
few Guinea-Bissau soldiers and 1,300 Senegalese troops against the
renegades.
	   That account could not be immediately confirmed.
	   Heavily-armed renegades have been dug into the positions since
launching their revolt in the former Portuguese colony on June 7.
	   The leaders of the local Roman Catholic, Muslim and Evangelical
communities tried to meet with the rebels in Bissau on Tuesday, but
said they were turned back by Senegalese troops with tanks.
	   Two previous attempts at mediation, by a Gambian government
minister and by local politicians, failed last week.
	   The rebels have accused Vieira of corruption and abuse of power
and have called on him to step down so that fresh elections can be
held.
	   ``Vieira was our brother, now he's the brother of the
Senegalese,'' Issoboro Gomes, a rebel radio announcer said on the
air Wednesday. ``He pushed us to do this because of poverty and
corruption,'' he said.
	   Most of Bissau's population of about 300,000 people have fled
the city and are short of food and medicine, humanitarian
organizations reported.
	   The United Nations refugee agency has warned that without
immediate assistance, Guinea-Bissau will face a massive
humanitarian crisis within days.
	   A Portuguese aid team is arriving in Dakar on Wednesday and will
head Thursday for Gabu, where AMI _ a Portuguese acronym for
International Medical Assistance _ is centering its operations.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has
distributed basic foodstuffs to about 10,000 in and around Bissau,
is sending two more aid teams into the country shortly, where they
will concentrate on the cities of Gabu, Bafata, Nhacra and Mansoa.
	   The U.N. refugee agency officials believe as many as 250,000
people have fled Bissau for the the central towns of Canchungo,
Mansoa and Bafata.

PRECEDE Beirut Shelling in south Lebanon as EU envoy visit region shelling, fresh quotes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Moratinos in southern Lebanon,
<TEXT>
	   TIBNINE, Lebanon (AP) _ A European envoy got a taste of the
conflict in southern Lebanon Wednesday when Israeli forces shelled
suspected guerrilla infiltration trails near a U.N. peacekeepers'
base he was visiting.
	   The European Union's special envoy to the Middle East, Miguel
Moratinos, was in no danger when about a dozen 155mm shells fired
by Israeli artillery crashed in the Wadi Sluki and Majdal Silim
front line areas.
	   Moratinos was in Tibnine, where Irish peacekeepers have their
battalion headquarters, when most of the shells hit an area about 2
kilometers (1.3 miles) to the southeast.
	   The thud of shells could be heard as Moratinos was being briefed
by Irish officers of the nine-country United Nations Interim Force
in Lebanon.
	   Irish officers told Moratinos that the shelling came from the
Israeli army. Moratinos, a Spaniard, appeared unruffled by the
explosions and did not comment.
	   Tibnine is about two kilometers (1.3 miles) from Israeli army
outposts on the edge of an occupied zone in the south. The area is
about 16 kilometers (10 miles) north of the Israeli border.
	   U.N. peacekeepers have often been caught in the fighting between
Israeli forces and guerrillas. A total of 220 soldiers have died in
attacks and accidents since the force was deployed here in 1978.
	   Moratinos said his visit to the volatile region was a
fact-finding mission and ``to support the role of UNIFIL and thank
them.''
	   Moratinos also met with UNIFIL's commander, Fijian Maj. Gen.
Jioje Konrote, at the headquarters of the 4,500-strong force in the
border town of Naqoura in the south.
	   He said a 20-year-old U.N. Security Council resolution demanding
an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon should be
implemented.
	   ``It should be fulfilled with no amendment as written by the
Security Council,'' he said.
	   Israel has offered to implement the resolution but only if
security arrangements guarantee that northern Israel would not be
targeted from Lebanon.
	   Earlier Wednesday in Beirut, Moratinos held talks with Lebanese
Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz and said the EU is working with the
United States to revive Israel's peace talks with Syria and
Lebanon.
	   Moratinos arrived Tuesday on the third leg of a Middle East tour
aimed at breaking the deadlock in Arab-Israeli negotiations. He has
visited Syria and Israel and will travel to Egypt.

Spanish oil company Repsol in talks on expanding Iraqi presence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish oil and energy company Repsol said
Wednesday it hoped to enter oil exploration and production in Iraq
later this year if sanctions are lifted.
	   Repsol's apparent confidence in the future of Iraqi oil came on
the last day of a three-day visit to Spain by the country's top
diplomat.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz arrived in Madrid on Sunday,
lobbying for support in his mission to persuade the United Nations
Security Council to lift economic sanctions imposed after the 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq says it has complied with all U.N. resolutions and is
backed by Russia, but both the U.S. and Great Britain remain strong
opponents to lifting the sanctions.
	   Banned from exporting oil except under a U.N. oil-for-food deal,
Iraq's exports are limited to about 1.5 million barrels a day
despite having the second largest reserves after Saudi Arabia.
	   A Repsol spokeswoman said the company is already involved in the
U.N.'s oil-for-food shipments.
	   Oil companies from France, Italy, Russia and China are also
reportedly busy planning projects to develop Iraq's oil fields that
they could only pursue if sanctions were lifted.

Eds: AMs, UPDATES with police fearing German-English clash, other
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Authorities on Wednesday were fearing a new and
ugly turn in World Cup violence: German toughs competing against
English fans for the reputation as Europe's worst hooligans.
	   Violence has shaken and tainted the five-week soccer
championship since it began June 10, with clashes outside stadiums
leaving more than 100 injured, a policeman in a coma and an English
fan in critical condition.
	   French authorities backed by police from the countries in the
Cup have cracked down on the unrest, arresting more than 250 people
and deporting a number of English and German rowdies. But with just
half the World Cup matches played, police fear more violence.
	   The next expected hotspots are the Germany-Iran match in the
southern city of Montpellier on Thursday, and more importantly,
England versus Colombia in the northern city of Lens on Friday.
	   German toughs, like the ones that beat the policeman into a coma
in Lens over the weekend, appear ready to strike there again.
	   This time, German extremists would be there Friday ``to combat
the English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe,''' Le Monde cited a French intelligence memo to the
Interior Ministry as saying.
	   The French Interior Ministry had no immediate comment on the
newspaper report, but a ministry source privately confirmed the
hundreds of police to be deployed for the match were alerted about
the possibility of German-English clashes.
	   German police have also privately said they were taking the
development seriously. The French sports daily L'Equipe this week
quoted an unidentified German rowdy speaking of competing with
English counterparts.
	   As a result, German authorities said Wednesday that they had
stepped up checks of France-bound motorists by boosting their
border police force from about 200 to more than 1,000 ahead of the
matches Thursday and Friday.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
on Wednesday announced alcohol restrictions for Friday's match.
Officials banned alcohol sale or possession on the streets from 6
p.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As in other matches,
thousands of fans were coming without tickets _ at least 10,000
English on Friday _ raising concerns of more drunken unrest.
	   Most of the dozen German police working in France as
hooligan-spotters were being deployed in Lens, German police said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The police are among 180 officers from the 32 nations in the
World Cup, with the largest contingent of 25 from England helping
to watch or detain so-called ``category C'' soccer fans with a
track record of violence, Le Monde said.
	   Authorities were also concerned about more violence by French
North African youths who first became involved in clashes with
English fans in Marseille two weeks ago.
	   Similar violence erupted Monday after the England-Romania match
in Toulouse, where police arrested a dozen of the youths who
carried baseball bats.
	   An English fan was attacked, and remained in intensive care on
Wednesday.
	   The status of Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge, West
Midlands, was ``more reassuring'' Wednesday, a hospital statement
said.
	   French officials were taking legal action against Germans
arrested in the weekend melees in Lens. They convicted and
sentenced three to a year in prison for attacking police.
	   They placed two Germans under formal investigation _ one step
short of being charged _ for the attempted murder of a policeman
who remained in a coma Wednesday.

Israel warns United Nations over upgrading PLO status 
</HEADLINE>
By DANNA HARMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel appealed to the United Nations on
Wednesday not to upgrade the PLO's observer status in the world
body, saying such a step would violate the Mideast peace accords.
	   The PLO's request to be granted near-state status, although
without voting rights, is to be discussed later this week by the
U.N. General Assembly.
	   On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and urged him to delay the request
for a change in status, Palestinian sources said.
	   The Clinton administration apparently is concerned that a
dispute between Israel and the Palestinians over the issue could
further disrupt U.S. efforts to mediate agreement on an Israeli
troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's Foreign
Ministry have been campaigning against the change of status.
	   Such a change would be ``a negative step which will leave scars
on us and not bring any benefit to the Palestinian side,'' said
Yitzhak Lior, deputy director-general of the Foreign Ministry.
	   The PLO was granted observer status in the General Assembly in
1974, enabling it to maintain an office in New York but without the
same privileges as missions of U.N. member states.
	   In December 1997, the Arab states submitted a resolution asking
that the PLO receive ``the same rights and privileges of
participation as those conferred upon member states, with the
exception of voting and candidature for office on U.N.
committees.''
	   The resolution was withdrawn when members of the European Union
used a parliamentary maneuver to derail a vote.
	   Now, with no sign of progress on Middle East peace, the Arab
states decided to bring the resolution _ albeit a watered-down
version _ back before the 185-member General Assembly .
	   The proposed new designation would give the Palestinian mission
``full rights of participation,'' but make no mention of the PLO
having the same rights as other member states. The EU has indicated
it will support the resolution this time.
	   The upgrading of status, if it passes, would make little
difference in the daily work of the Palestinian mission. But it
would affirm international support for the Palestinians in the
protracted peace process, and give encouragement to Arafat, who has
said he plans to declare a state by next year, when the five-year
interim period of Palestinian Authority officially ends. A final
Israel-Palestinian peace agreement was supposed to have been
reached by then, but negotiations have yet to begin.
	   A change in the PLO's status now ``would have both political and
symbolic implications,'' said Aaron Yaacov of the Israeli Foreign
Ministry's U.N. section.
	   At the EU summit in Cardiff, Wales earlier this month, European
foreign ministers angered the Israeli government by adopting a
resolution calling on Israel ``to recognize the right of the
Palestinians to exercise self-determination, without excluding the
option of a state.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A referendum on a West Bank troop withdrawal
would be preceded by weeks of campaigning, including TV and radio
spots and canvassing, the justice minister said Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu favors such a nationwide
opinion poll, believing it would silence far-right opponents who
have threatened to topple him over a troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu was expected to make a final decision in time for the
weekly Cabinet meeting Sunday, said an Israeli official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   A referendum would delay an Israeli troop pullback by at least
two more months and has been denounced by the Palestinians and
Israeli opposition leaders as a waste of time.
	   U.S. officials have not yet commented on the referendum idea.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged
Netanyahu to deliver a decision soon on a U.S. plan for an Israeli
troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   On Tuesday evening, Albright spoke by phone to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who had asked her in a letter to step up
pressure on Israel and make the U.S. plan public.
	   Albright told Arafat that she was continuing her efforts to win
Israeli agreement to the U.S. plan, which was first presented in
January and has been accepted by the Palestinians.
	   Yoel Singer, a former Foreign Ministry legal adviser and the
author of the peace agreements with the Palestinians, suggested
Wednesday that a referendum was superfluous because Israel is
legally bound to carry out to troop withdrawal.
	   ``If the result (of a referendum) is non-approval, Israel cannot
argue that it is released from the obligation to carry out this
redeployment because it did not receive approval for it in a
referendum,'' Singer told Israel radio.
	   ``It will be a violation of the Oslo agreement,'' he said.
	   Despite such warnings, government officials were busy preparing
for a possible referendum, with Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi
taking the lead. On Wednesday, Hanegbi convened legal advisers to
discuss rules of campaigning.
	   The weeks before a referendum would resemble an election
campaign, though on a smaller scale, Hanegbi said, with one week
set aside for radio and TV spots. Rules would have to be set on
limiting donations from abroad so as not to tip the balance in
favor of one of the camps, the minister said. The government could
not be involved in funding the campaigns.
	   ``The referendum is intended to give both sides the feeling that
they had a chance to present their stand,'' Hanegbi said.
	   Recent opinion polls have suggested that a majority of Israelis
favor the U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback.
	   However, Netanyahu is expected to require a special majority _ a
60 percent hurdle is being proposed _ for approval of a withdrawal,
and it is by no means certain he will get it.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Netanyahu
needed overwhelming approval to silence far-right coalition
partners who have threatened to topple him over a troop withdrawal.
	   ``He wants a strong majority to indicate that the whole public
supports the redeployment,'' Bar-Illan said. ``It would be a way to
eliminate the threat to the government from those who oppose it.''
	   Opposition leaders said they would try to block a referendum by
voting against preparatory legislation.

Precede: LILLE Next feared clashes: competing German and English toughs details. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs, UPDATES with police fearing German-English clash, other
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Authorities on Wednesday were fearing a new and
ugly turn in World Cup violence: German toughs competing against
English fans for the reputation as Europe's worst hooligans.
	   Violence has shaken and tainted the five-week soccer
championship since it began June 10, with clashes outside stadiums
leaving more than 100 injured, a policeman in a coma and an English
fan in critical condition.
	   French authorities backed by police from the countries in the
Cup have cracked down on the unrest, arresting more than 250 people
and deporting a number of English and German rowdies. But with just
half the World Cup matches played, police fear more violence.
	   The next expected hotspots are the Germany-Iran match in the
southern city of Montpellier on Thursday, and more importantly,
England versus Colombia in the northern city of Lens on Friday.
	   German toughs, like the ones that beat the policeman into a coma
in Lens over the weekend, appear ready to strike there again.
	   This time, German extremists would be there Friday ``to combat
the English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe,''' Le Monde cited a French intelligence memo to the
Interior Ministry as saying.
	   The French Interior Ministry had no immediate comment on the
newspaper report, but a ministry source privately confirmed the
hundreds of police to be deployed for the match were alerted about
the possibility of German-English clashes.
	   German police have also privately said they were taking the
development seriously. The French sports daily L'Equipe this week
quoted an unidentified German rowdy speaking of competing with
English counterparts.
	   As a result, German authorities said Wednesday that they had
stepped up checks of France-bound motorists by boosting their
border police force from about 200 to more than 1,000 ahead of the
matches Thursday and Friday.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
on Wednesday announced alcohol restrictions for Friday's match.
Officials banned alcohol sale or possession on the streets from 6
p.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As in other matches,
thousands of fans were coming without tickets _ at least 10,000
English on Friday _ raising concerns of more drunken unrest.
	   Most of the dozen German police working in France as
hooligan-spotters were being deployed in Lens, German police said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The police are among 180 officers from the 32 nations in the
World Cup, with the largest contingent of 25 from England helping
to watch or detain so-called ``category C'' soccer fans with a
track record of violence, Le Monde said.
	   Authorities were also concerned about more violence by French
North African youths who first became involved in clashes with
English fans in Marseille two weeks ago.
	   Similar violence erupted Monday after the England-Romania match
in Toulouse, where police arrested a dozen of the youths who
carried baseball bats.
	   An English fan was attacked, and remained in intensive care on
Wednesday.
	   The status of Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge, West
Midlands, was ``more reassuring'' Wednesday, a hospital statement
said.
	   French officials were taking legal action against Germans
arrested in the weekend melees in Lens. They convicted and
sentenced three to a year in prison for attacking police.
	   They placed two Germans under formal investigation _ one step
short of being charged _ for the attempted murder of a policeman
who remained in a coma Wednesday.

Workers to begin unearthing remains for body-and-prisoner swap Thursday; NEW to some points 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Israel radio saying soldier's body to be returned
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Setting in motion the biggest body-and-prisoner
exchange in two years between Israel and Lebanon, Israel on
Wednesday began unearthing the bodies of Shiite Muslim guerrillas
for repatriation.
	   Under the swap, brokered by the International Committee of the
Red Cross, Israel will reportedly free up to 60 prisoners and hand
over the bodies of up to 60 slain guerrillas.
	   In return, it was to receive the body of an Israeli soldier who
died in a raid last September in south Lebanon. Israel radio said
the remains of the soldier, 21-year-old Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya,
would be returned on Thursday.
	   Workers with earthmoving equipment were ordered to begin digging
up remains of guerrillas from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia
from a cemetery in northern Israel, an Israeli official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Israel's army radio said members of a special rabbinical
military unit went to the scene of the exhumations.
	   After the raid in which Ilya and 11 other Israelis were killed,
his body was the only one not recovered, according to Israel. In
the raid's aftermath, the guerrilla groups displayed body parts and
captured equipment.
	   Large-scale swaps have taken place previously, with the last one
two years ago.
	   In July 1996, Israel freed 45 Hezbollah prisoners and returned
the bodies of 123 guerrillas in exchange for the remains of two
Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon 10 years ago.
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israel and its allied
militia out of a buffer zone Israel set up in 1985 in southern
Lebanon. Israel has said it wants to withdraw, but only if the
security of its northern border can be guaranteed by Lebanon.

EU ambassadors to visit East Timor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is to send a mission
to East Timor this week to reflect its ``increased concern with the
situation ... and its commitment to support all those working for a
peaceful solution,'' the EU said Wednesday.
	   The delegation will led by the Robin Christopher, the British
ambassador to Indonesia. It will also include the Dutch and
Austrian ambassadors and the the European Commission's Jakarta
representative.
	   They are scheduled to leave for East Timor Saturday and stay in
the disputed territory until Tuesday.
	   In a statement, the 15-nation bloc reiterated its support for
talks between Indonesia and EU-member Portugal which it hoped will
``result in a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable
solution ... which fully respects the rights of the people of East
Timor.''
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 as Portugal prepared to
grant independence to the territory. Portugal is lobbying to secure
self-determination for East Timor, which the United Nations refuses
to recognize as part of Indonesia.
	   Since the resignation of the authoritarian President Suharto on
May 21, the Indonesian government has shown a new openness towards
resolving the East Timor question, although it continues to reject
demands for a referendum on independence.

World Cup: France maintains winning streak with 2-1 victory over Denmark BY RAF CASERT 
</HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) - A fine 55th-minute goal by Emmanuel Petit
steered France to a 2-1 win over Denmark on Wednesday, putting the
home nation into the second round as Group C winners.
	   France won a game that it dominated for long periods after a
scramble in the penalty area. The ball was cleared to Petit, who
hit a powerful left-footed drive from 18 yards past Peter
Schmeichel.
	   By beating Denmark, France becomes the first team to win its
three opening games. South Africa's failure to beat Saudi Arabia in
the other Group C match means that Denmark joins the host nation in
the last 16 despite its defeat.
	   Djorkaeff put France ahead with a 12th minute penalty, given
after David Trezeguet, storming through on goal after good work by
Vincent Candela, was tripped by centerback Jes Hogh.
	   Denmark protested the penalty, claiming that Hogh had taken the
ball first, but referee Pierluigi Collina had no hesitation in
pointing to the spot.
	   Schmeichel got a touch to Djorkaeff's penalty, struck low to his
right, but couldn't keep the ball out.
	   Against the run of play, Denmark equalized in the 42nd minute,
when Martin Jorgensen, first to react to a quick free kick, was
wrestled to the ground by Candela.
	   Michael Laudrup calmly slotted the ball to the left of Fabien
Barthez to level the scores at 1-1.
	   France, with six points from two games, began the match knowing
that a draw would be enough to secure first place in the Group C.
	   Denmark, with four points, needed a point to make sure of second
place, while a win would have given it top position.
	   Coach Aime Jacquet rested Laurent Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu and
Didier Deschamps, three players who picked up yellow cards in
France's first two matches, as well as Lilian Thuram and Thierry
Henry. He was also without the suspended Zinedine Zidane and the
injured Christophe Dugarry.
	   Frank Leboeuf, Christian Karembeu, Candela and Patrick Vieira
all came in for their World Cup debuts.
	   Denmark coach Bo Johansson was without midfielder Morten
Wieghorst and forward Miklos Molnar, both sent off in Denmark's
last match against South Africa.
	   In Zidane's absense, Djorkaeff took on the role of chief
playmaker and within the first four minutes the Inter Milan star
played a fine defense-splitting backheel to create an opening for
Vieira, whose 15-yard shot was well saved by Peter Schmeichel.
	   In the last minute, a 25-yard free kick from Danish substitute
Stig Tofting was just kept over the line by Barthez.
	   But though it needed a point to be absolutely certain of
qualification, Denmark was happy to soak up pressure for most of
the second half, offering little support to striker Brian Laudrup.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Christian Karembeu, Marcel Desailly,
Frank Leboeuf, Vincent Candela; Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires
(Thierry Henry, 72nd), Emmanuel Petit (Alain Boghossian, 65th);
Youri Djorkaeff, David Trezeguet (Stephane Guivarc'h, 86th),
Bernard Diomede.
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel; Jacob Laursen (Soren Colding, 46th),
Marc Rieper, Jes Hogh, Jan Heintze; Martin Jorgensen (Ebbe Sand,
55th), Thomas Helveg, Allan Nielsen, Michael Schjonberg; Michael
Laudrup, Brian Laudrup (Stig Tofting, 75th).
	   Referee _ Pierluigi Collina, Italy.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, an
intelligence officer admitted that some 300,000 files of Romania's
feared communist secret police have been destroyed, media reported
Wednesday.
	   Mircea Gheordunescu, deputy director of the Romanian Information
Service, told Parliament Tuesday that 270,000 Securitate files were
burned between 1971 and 1979, Cotidianul daily reported.
	   A further 27,000 files were burnt by Securitate officers
immediately after the 1989 revolt, he said. The Romanian
Information Service succeeded the communist-era Securitate
following the revolution.
	   The files destroyed between 1971 and 1979 documented movements
of Communist Party Securitate collaborators and informers who died
in that period. Millions of Securitate files remain closed to the
public, almost nine years after Ceausescu was killed.
	   Romanians are still preoccupied with the Securitate. Over the
last two weeks, several prominent politicians including Health
Minister Francisc Baranyi were exposed as collaborators of the
former secret police controlled by late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   The statement by Gheordunescu marks the first time that a
government official has begun to confront this dark part of
Romania's past. Previous intelligence officers have tried to
confound and mystify matters in good Securitate fashion.
	   The ruling Peasant Party, whose leaders often were tortured and
even killed by the Securitate, said it now wants members to declare
if they collaborated with the secret police.
	   At least one Peasant Party leader opposed the move, saying
parliament should instead pass a law allowing access to files.
	   On Monday, Liberal Party senators handed written declarations in
sealed envelopes to party leader Mircea Ionescu Quintus.
	   By Thursday, Prime Minister Radu Vasile will have statements
from his ministers saying whether they worked for the Securitate.
	   According to Romanian intelligence reports, there are still
100,000 Securitate informers living in Romania. An additional 125
million pages of files are still locked away in the vaults of the
Romanian Information Service.

Pakistan Prime Minister agrees to meeting with Indian counterpart

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said he
will meet his Indian counterpart next month in the first
face-to-face talks since the two uneasy neighbors conducted
underground nuclear tests, the foreign ministry said Wednesday.
	   Sharif sent a letter on Tuesday to Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee agreeing to talks ``to discuss all issues of
concern, particularly issues of peace and security in the
nuclearized South Asia and the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, which is
the sole root cause of the problem and tensions in the region,'' a
foreign ministry statement said.
	   The talks are to be held during a three-day meeting of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation which is to begin in the
Sri Lankan capital of Colombo on July 29.
	   The group comprises India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Nepal and the Maldives.
	   In his letter to Vajpayee Sharif said a ``breakthrough between
Pakistan and India on issues of vital concern to peace and security
would open a new chapter of cooperation and development in South
Asia.''
	   Last month's nuclear tests by both countries sparked fears of a
nuclear arms race and a possible confrontation between two uneasy
neighbors, who have already fought three wars in the last 51 years.
	   Two of those battles were fought over Kashmir_ divided between
the two countries after the British left the subcontinent in 1947 _
in 1948 and 1965. The third war was over Bangladesh, or what was
then East Pakistan.
	   Sharif is seeking intervention by the United Nations and
industrialized world leaders to press India to allow a plebiscite
in Kashmir over whether a united Kashmir should join India or
Pakistan, in keeping with a U.N. resolution that dates back to
1948.
	   India has flatly rejected international intervention and a
Kashmir-wide plebiscite.
	   India's Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani on Wednesday called
for increased trade and economic ties with Pakistan as a possible
route to lasting peace in the region.
	   ``If Pakistan adopts this approach, the two countries would
together have opened a big door for the progress and prosperity of
the Indian subcontinent as a whole,'' Advani told supporters in
Srinigar, the capital of Indian-held Kashmir.
	   Also on Wednesday, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was
in Pakistan on a day-long peace mission to try to ease tensions
between her larger South Asian neighbors.
	   Hasina met Sharif, who ``briefed (her) on ``the grave security
threat faced by Pakistan as a result of India's nuclear test,''
said a foreign ministry statement.
	   Sharif termed his discussions with Hasina as ``meaningful''.
	   ``Everybody knows that we were left with no choice, but to
conduct nuclear tests to safeguard our national interests,'' the
state-run Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Sharif as saying.

IMF deputy head: Negotiations on bailout will be tough

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund will approve the
release of a delayed dlrs 670 million loan installment this week,
but a much larger potential bailout package will be ``negotiated
very hard,'' a top IMF official said Wednesday.
	   ``We reached an agreement with the government of Russia on
measures which have to be met to issue this tranche,'' Stanley
Fischer, the fund's first deputy managing director, told The
Associated Press.
	   Premier Sergei Kiriyenko formally submitted his austerity plan
to the IMF on Wednesday. The plan is intended to meet key IMF
conditions for further loans, including cuts in government
spending, better tax collection and tighter control over customs
and tax authorities.
	   In addition to mapping the government's economic strategy, the
plan was seen as a signal to international investors that Russia
was serious about tackling its chronic economic problems.
	   Fischer said IMF analysts will need several weeks to study the
plan, which was presented to the Cabinet and parliament on Tuesday.
	   ``We have read the headlines. We've read the speeches. We got
descriptions of the measures,'' Fischer said at the end of a
two-day visit to Moscow. ``Precisely what they will amount to in
terms of the budget, we will have to discuss.''
	   Fischer said he expected the IMF board in Washington could
approve the release of the dlrs 670 loan installment by Thursday.
But any further loans would be ``negotiated very hard'' over
several weeks, he said.
	   Fischer said that Russia's chronic tax collection problem was
the biggest obstacle to the new dlrs 10 to dlrs 15 billion loan
Russia is seeking to replenish the Central Bank's reserves, bring
down interest rates and foster an economic recovery.
	   But he noted with satisfaction that Russia seemed at last ready
to tackle the tough problems plaguing the economy.
	   The IMF has said that the government has not put enough pressure
on the biggest debtors, big oil companies, to pay taxes.
	   Russia's economy began slipping at the beginning of this year
after posting its first growth of the post-Soviet period last year.
The slippage quickly became a slide, with the Asian financial
crisis and the plunge in world oil prices putting intense pressure
on Russia's emerging financial markets.
	   Fears that the ruble will be devalued have spurred an exodus
from Russian markets. Last month, the Central Bank had to raise
interest rates as high as 120 percent to defend the ruble. Rates
are now at 60 percent, but the stock market is still the world's
worst performing in 1998, having fallen 55 percent from the
beginning of the year.
	   The Central Bank was forced to issue a statement Wednesday
saying it categorically opposed a devaluation, after a prominent
Russian economist called a press conference to say a fall of 50
percent was nearly certain.
	   Russian financial markets perked up a bit Wednesday. Russia's
main stock index rose 2.2 percent by the end of the day, though
traders said that was mostly due to higher world oil prices. The
ruble was steady.

World Cup: U.S. battles for consolation win against Yugoslavia 
</HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Yugoslavia wants to beat the United States
Thursday and score high. The Americans, faced with player dissent,
only want to salvage their pride after an early exit from the World
Cup.
	   Having lost both its matches at the World Cup, 0-2 against
Germany and 1-2 against Iran, the United States already is out of
the competition.
	   For American players, the match against Yugoslavia Thursday
ranks in significance somewhere between a spring training game and
a late-season match involving a team that's going nowhere.
	   Following Sunday's 2-1 loss to Iran, which eliminated them from
contention, golf and shopping have replaced practice as the top
priority. And some older players are unhappy with their likely
outgoing coach Steve Sampson.
	   ``It seems everyone he gives a start but me,'' said forward
Preki Radosavljevic, a former Yugoslav who became a U.S. citizen in
1996.
	   Radosavljevic, 35, who entered the Iran match late in the second
half, said he wanted to start against Yugoslavia but Sampson is
likely to keep him on the bench.
	   ``I wanted to start especially against Yugoslavia, my former
country,'' said Radosavljevic, who scored the historic goal in
February that gave the Americans their first-ever victory over
Brazil.
	   The apparent rift within the U.S. team is good news for the
Yugoslavs who hope to score high and place first on goal-difference
in Group F, ahead of their main rival Germany which plays Iran in a
parallel match.
	   Both Germany and Yugoslavia, with four points each so far, will
seek to be first in the group in order to avoid the Netherlands in
the next round. The mighty Dutch are the likely winners of the
Group E.
	   So far, Germany has scored one more goal than Yugoslavia. Iran
has three points, and a victory against Germany would allow it to
clinch one of the first two places in the group and continue on
into the elimination rounds.
	   ``I think we can score more goals against the United States than
Germany can against Iran,'' midfielder Slavisa Jokanovic said
Tuesday. ``A simple victory may not be enough for first place.''
	   U.S. coach Sampson was thinking about starting a mixture of
veterans and young players against Yugoslavia, one of Europe's top
teams.
	   ``We want to finish this tournament with a good game against
Yugoslavia,'' said U.S. forward Roy Wegerle. ``We want to do our
team justice. We want to show we are a better team than against
Iran and Germany,'' Wegerle said.
	   The Yugoslavs, with a history of stumbles on big occasions, were
cautious.
	   ``We shouldn't underestimate the Americans,'' said Yugoslav
coach Slobodan Santrac. ``Especially because they have nothing to
lose in the game against us.''
	   ``It is always tough to play teams which are without motives,''
striker Perica Ognjenovic said.
	   The injuries of several key Yugoslav players have hampered
preparations ahead of the match against the United States. Central
defender Miroslav Djukic, left back Zoran Mirkovic and striker
Darko Kovacevic will not play on Thursday.
	   Former Aston Villa striker Savo Milosevic is likely to start up
front against the Americans instead of Kovacevic who has suffered a
hamstring injury in a 2-2 tie with Germany last Sunday.

World Cup: France maintains winning streak with 2-1 victory over Denmark RAF CASERT 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Gives officials times of goals, adds Djorkaeff's first nameBY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) - A fine 57th-minute goal by Emmanuel Petit
steered France to a 2-1 win over Denmark on Wednesday, putting the
home nation into the second round as Group C winners.
	   France won a game that it dominated for long periods after a
scramble in the penalty area. The ball was cleared to Petit, who
hit a powerful left-footed drive from 18 yards past Peter
Schmeichel.
	   By beating Denmark, France becomes the first team to win its
three opening games. South Africa's failure to beat Saudi Arabia in
the other Group C match means that Denmark joins the host nation in
the last 16 despite its defeat.
	   Youri Djorkaeff put France ahead with a 12th minute penalty,
given after David Trezeguet, storming through on goal after good
work by Vincent Candela, was tripped by centerback Jes Hogh.
	   Denmark protested the penalty, claiming that Hogh had taken the
ball first, but referee Pierluigi Collina had no hesitation in
pointing to the spot.
	   Schmeichel got a touch to Djorkaeff's penalty, struck low to his
right, but couldn't keep the ball out.
	   Against the run of play, Denmark equalized in the 42nd minute,
when Martin Jorgensen, first to react to a quick free kick, was
wrestled to the ground by Candela.
	   Michael Laudrup calmly slotted the ball to the left of Fabien
Barthez to level the scores at 1-1.
	   France, with six points from two games, began the match knowing
that a draw would be enough to secure first place in the Group C.
	   Denmark, with four points, needed a point to make sure of second
place, while a win would have given it top position.
	   Coach Aime Jacquet rested Laurent Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu and
Didier Deschamps, three players who picked up yellow cards in
France's first two matches, as well as Lilian Thuram and Thierry
Henry. He was also without the suspended Zinedine Zidane and the
injured Christophe Dugarry.
	   Frank Leboeuf, Christian Karembeu, Candela and Patrick Vieira
all came in for their World Cup debuts.
	   Denmark coach Bo Johansson was without midfielder Morten
Wieghorst and forward Miklos Molnar, both sent off in Denmark's
last match against South Africa.
	   In Zidane's absense, Djorkaeff took on the role of chief
playmaker and within the first four minutes the Inter Milan star
played a fine defense-splitting backheel to create an opening for
Vieira, whose 15-yard shot was well saved by Peter Schmeichel.
	   In the last minute, a 25-yard free kick from Danish substitute
Stig Tofting was just kept over the line by Barthez.
	   But though it needed a point to be absolutely certain of
qualification, Denmark was happy to soak up pressure for most of
the second half, offering little support to striker Brian Laudrup.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Christian Karembeu, Marcel Desailly,
Frank Leboeuf, Vincent Candela; Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires
(Thierry Henry, 72nd), Emmanuel Petit (Alain Boghossian, 65th);
Youri Djorkaeff, David Trezeguet (Stephane Guivarc'h, 86th),
Bernard Diomede.
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel; Jacob Laursen (Soren Colding, 46th),
Marc Rieper, Jes Hogh, Jan Heintze; Martin Jorgensen (Ebbe Sand,
55th), Thomas Helveg, Allan Nielsen, Michael Schjonberg; Michael
Laudrup, Brian Laudrup (Stig Tofting, 75th).
	   Referee _ Pierluigi Collina, Italy.

Car bomb on eve of Northern Ireland's most important election With NIreland-Election Facts 
</HEADLINE>

BC-NIreland-Car Bomb
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Anti-British militants
detonated a car bomb in a border village Wednesday, wounding a
15-year-old boy on the eve of the election of Northern Ireland's
new compromise government.
	   The afternoon blast outside the main police-army barracks in
Newtownhamilton, about 40 miles (65 kms) southwest of Belfast,
followed several phoned warnings to police and Belfast media
outlets purporting to come from the outlawed Irish National
Liberation Army.
	   The small anti-British gang, which rejects the larger Irish
Republican Army's July 1997 truce, has rarely detonated car bombs
in its own campaign to undermine Northern Ireland and its
pro-British Protestant majority.
	   The blast, which left the teen-ager hospitalized in stable
condition with a shrapnel wound to the chest, was the first of its
kind since IRA dissidents struck two mainly Protestant towns with
car bombs in February.
	   It underscored continuing militant opposition to the April peace
accord and to Thursday's vote, the most important in the 77-year
history of this British-ruled territory.
	   The election will determine how many seats each party holds in a
108-member legislative Assembly, the bedrock of the peace
agreement.
	   If the Assembly takes root, Northern Ireland's divided
politicians will largely govern their own affairs for the first
time since the British government imposed ``direct rule'' from
London in 1972.
	   Results from the 18 six-seat constituencies will start coming in
Friday, but may not be completed until Saturday.
	   Assembly members are supposed to appoint a multi-party
administration of Protestants and Catholics. This 12-member
Executive will cooperate formally with the neighboring Irish
Republic, a step that Catholics hope will promote gradual
unification.
	   Crucially, decisions in the Assembly will require majority
support from both its British Protestant and Irish Catholic blocs.
	   That ``double majority'' requirement, while ensuring that
neither side can impose sectarian policies on the other, also makes
the Assembly vulnerable to obstruction by Protestant politicians
opposed to implementing the agreement.
	   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble will be the favorite
to head the administration, if his Protestant party maintains its
traditional No. 1 position in Northern Ireland.
	   The Protestant electorate is badly divided among a half-dozen
parties, two of whom vociferously oppose the agreement and are
hoping to win enough seats to veto progress. A half-dozen of
Trimble's own Ulster Unionist candidates say they support the
so-called ``wreckers.''
	   John Hume, leader of the north's traditional top Catholic
vote-getter, the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, has an
outside chance to end up on top for the first time in history.
Credited as a primary architect of the successful negotiations,
Hume predicted voters would back the SDLP ``in record numbers.''
	   Most Protestant politicians' greatest complaint is the prospect
of having to cooperate with the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, Hume's
militant rival for Catholic votes. Sinn Fein's support has been
growing steadily and the party already is staking a claim to two
seats in the new administration.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, in his election eve appeal, called
on voters to back Sinn Fein in preference to Hume's SDLP, which has
long opposed IRA violence.
	   According to the peace plan, the Assembly would gradually take
control of six departments, ranging from education to economic
development, now under direct British government control.
	   In 1972, the government abolished Northern Ireland's original
parliament, which the Ulster Unionists had run as a one-party
monolith since 1921. An attempt to share power between moderate
Protestant and Catholic politicians collapsed in 1974 under the
combined weight of a Protestant general strike and IRA violence.

Rusedski withdraws; Graf, Ivanisevic, Capriati advance
Eds: recasts, upates with other results
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ For Jennifer Capriati, playing at
Wimbledon for the first time in five years was special. Winning was
even better.
	   Capriati won her first Grand Slam match in five years Wednesday,
overcoming nine foot faults to defeat Australia's Nicole Pratt 6-4,
3-6, 6-4.
	   It was Capriati's first Wimbledon appearance since reaching the
quarterfinals in 1993. Since then, she's played in only five other
Grand Slam events and lost in the first round each time.
	   ``It's great to be back here,'' Capriati said. ``It brings back
a lot of good memories. I was really pumped up. I was really
excited to be out there.''
	   In 1991, at age 15, Capriati became the youngest ever women's
Wimbledon semifinalist. But her career nosedived after problems
with drugs _ including an arrest for marijuana possession in 1994 _
and injuries.
	   Capriati became a symbol of what can go wrong when a teen-ager
is surrounded by so much hype and pressure.
	   But the 22-year-old said she has no regrets and feels in control
of her life.
	   ``Whatever I'm doing it's what I want to be doing,'' she said.
``I just try to be happy off the court as well as on the court,
just keep a balance.''
	   After a succession of aborted comebacks, Capriati's goal is to
return to the top of the game. In April she was ranked 267. Now
she's up to 151.
	   ``Right now I want it pretty bad,'' she said. ``I'm really
focused and determined to play well. ... I have to believe in
myself. I believe that I can go all the way.''
	   Meawhile, the tournament lost a top men's contender when Greg
Rusedski withdrew with an ankle injury.
	   Rusedski, the fourth seed and a quarterfinalist last year,
pulled out before the resumption of his rain-delayed match with
Mark Draper.
	   Rusedski damaged ligaments in his left ankle in a fall at the
Queen's Club tournament two weeks ago. He was limping Tuesday as he
split the first two sets with Draper and was down a break at 5-4 in
the third.
	   The Canadian-born Briton, with the fastest serve in tennis,
practiced in the morning and said he was ready to play. But he
changed his mind a few hours later.
	   ``I thought it would get better,'' he said. ``I thought when it
got warmed up it would get better. Unfortunatley, it didn't happen.
... I thought that this year was really my year, but it just wasn't
to be.''
	   Rusedski's withdrawal left No. 12 Tim Henman as Britain's best
hope for its first men's Wimbledon champion since 1936. Henman
advanced with a 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 win over David Nainkin.
	   Top-seeded Pete Sampras, bidding for his fifth title in six
years, moved into the third round with a 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5)
victory over Sweden's Mikhael Tillstrom.
	   Steffi Graf, seeking her eighth Wimbledon title, won the first
eight games as she powered into the third round with a 6-0, 6-4
victory over Slovakia's Henrieta Nagyova.
	   The fourth-seeded German, playing her first Grand Slam
tournament since undergoing reconstructive knee surgery a year ago,
cried with emotion after her first-round match Monday.
	   But there were no tears Wednesday.
	   ``It was good to get the first match over, the emotions going,''
she said. ``I feel I've calmed down a little bit since then.''
	   Goran Ivanisevic, a two-time Wimbledon finalist who had won only
one match in his last five Grand Slam tournaments, beat Grant
Stafford 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``I can beat anybody when I play good here, and I can lose to
some serious bad guys,'' Ivanisevic said. ``You never know with me.
... Not too many people rate me as a favorite or expect me to do
good here. But I feel good. Anything is possible.''
	   French Open champion Carlos Moya, the No. 5 seed from Spain,
needed five sets to get past India's Mahesh Bhupathi, 6-4, 4-6,
6-4, 2-6, 6-3.
	   No. 15 Karol Kucera became the fourth men's seed eliminated so
far when he was beaten 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, 6-4 by Vladimir Voltchkov.
	   Fifth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario beat Catalina Cristea, 5-7,
6-2, 6-0, while No. 9 Amanda Coetzer was ousted by Naoko Sawamatsu,
3-6, 6-3, 6-2.

London Monarchs suspend operations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ London Monarchs has been scrapped from the NFL
European League's 1999 competition and will be replaced by a new
franchise in Berlin.
	   The NFL Europe League board of directors suspended operations of
the struggling team Wednesday because of declining support and poor
on-field performances.
	   League president Oliver Luck said the Monarchs recorded the
League's lowest average attendance rate and the team had difficulty
attracting sponsors or securing a suitable playing venue.
	   ``This decision is a last resort but one that could no longer be
avoided,'' he said.
	   The Monarchs' poor playing season culminated with the
resignation of Lionel Taylor, who stood down as coach with a 3-7
record in 1998.
	   Taylor, the Denver Broncos' career receiving leader, joined the
Monarchs as offensive coordinator in 1995 and became head coach in
1996.

Bulgaria asks about ethnic composition of Yugoslav army in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria asked Yugoslavia Wednesday to
detail whether soldiers from ethnic minorities are being sent to
fight militant Albanian separatists in the secessionist southern
province of Kosovo.
	   The step followed reports in Bulgarian media that many of the
soldiers in Kosovo are from Yugoslavia's Hungarian and Bulgarian
minorities.
	   ``The members of the Bulgarian minority are Yugoslav citizens
and we can't tell Yugoslavia where to send them to serve,'' foreign
ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov told the Associated Press.
``However we can't acccept that the Bulgarians should be sent to
the hottest points.''
	   ``If a disbalance in drafting youths for Kosovo emerges, we
shall not pass over such an issue,'' he added in a statement,
without giving further details.
	   The Bulgarian minority lives mostly in the far east of
Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. Vlaikov put its size at
50,000.
	   Hungary is not known to have made a similar inquiry. There are
an estimated 400,000 ethnic Hungarians in Yugoslavia, mostly in the
northern Serbian province of Vojvodina, which like Kosovo was
stripped of broad autonomy in 1989.

Next feared clashes: competing German and English toughs 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs; SUBS final grafs to UPDATE with Chirac comment; TRIMS
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Authorities on Wednesday were fearing a new and
ugly turn in World Cup violence: German toughs battling English
fans for the reputation as Europe's worst hooligans.
	   Violence has shaken and tainted the five-week soccer
championship since it began June 10, with clashes outside stadiums
leaving more than 100 injured, a policeman in a coma and an English
fan in critical condition.
	   French authorities backed by police from the countries in the
Cup have cracked down on the unrest, arresting more than 250 people
and deporting a number of English and German rowdies. But with just
half the World Cup matches played, police fear more violence.
	   The next expected hotspots are the Germany-Iran match in the
southern city of Montpellier on Thursday, and more importantly,
England versus Colombia in the northern city of Lens on Friday.
	   German toughs, like the ones that beat the policeman into a coma
in Lens over the weekend, appear ready to strike there again.
	   This time, German extremists would be there Friday ``to combat
the English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe,''' Le Monde quoted a French intelligence memo to the
Interior Ministry as saying.
	   The ministry had no immediate comment on the newspaper report,
but a ministry source privately confirmed the hundreds of police to
be deployed for the match were alerted about the possibility of
German-English clashes.
	   German police have also privately said they were taking the
development seriously.
	   German authorities said Wednesday that they had stepped up
checks of France-bound motorists by boosting their border police
force from about 200 to more than 1,000 ahead of the matches
Thursday and Friday.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
on Wednesday announced alcohol restrictions for Friday's match.
Officials banned alcohol sale or possession on the streets from 6
p.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As in other matches,
thousands of fans were coming without tickets _ at least 10,000
English on Friday _ raising concerns of more drunken unrest.
	   Most of the dozen German police working in France as
hooligan-spotters were being deployed in Lens, German police said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The police are among 180 officers from the 32 nations in the
World Cup, with the largest contingent of 25 from England helping
to watch or detain so-called ``category C'' soccer fans with a
track record of violence, Le Monde said.
	   Authorities were also concerned about more violence by French
North African youths who first became involved in clashes with
English fans in Marseille two weeks ago.
	   Similar violence erupted Monday after the England-Romania match
in Toulouse, where police arrested a dozen of the youths who
carried baseball bats.
	   An English fan was attacked, and remained in intensive care on
Wednesday. The status of Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge,
West Midlands, was ``more reassuring'' Wednesday, a hospital
statement said.
	   President Jacques Chirac sought to put in perspective the unrest
by a few hundred toughs at an event drawing 1 million largely
sportsmanlike foreigners.
	   ``Even if there were dramatic incidents ... the incidents were
relatively limited compared to what was feared,'' he told French
television after Wednesday evening's France-Denmark match in Lyon.
	   ``I hope the justice system will work with the greatest
firmness,'' he added.
	   A court on Tuesday night convicted and sentenced three Germans
to a year in prison for attacking police in Lens on Sunday. They
placed two Germans under formal investigation _ one step short of
being charged _ for the attempted murder of a policeman who
remained in a coma Wednesday.

Brandenburg state steps up fight against neo-Nazis, xenophobia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Brandenburg state governor Manfred
Stolpe said Wednesday he is stepping up a program to fight racist
and anti-foreigner attitudes that are ``poisoning society.''
	   About 1.3 million marks (dlrs 726,000) are to be spent on the
project called ``Tolerant Brandenburg'' this year, and 2.5 million
marks (dlrs 1.4 million) are earmarked for next year, Stolpe said.
	   The 34-point program includes extra training for teachers to
help them curb student prejudice against foreigners. The program
also calls for setting up international school exchanges and
community youth programs.
	   Brandenburg started its program last year to fight neo-Nazi and
anti-foreigner attacks that increased in the former communist
eastern German states since reunification in 1990.
	   But a state-sponsored poll by the Forsa Institute, released
Tuesday, found that 57 percent of 1,000 people surveyed were
unaware of the Brandenburg program. Fifty-seven percent also said
they feel foreigners abuse the German social system; and 48 percent
blamed foreigners for Germany's record-high unemployment.
	   In addition, the May survey found that 41 percent said they
understood neo-Nazis and 7 percent said they would vote for a
radical rightist party of state elections were held today.
	   A poll of that size usually carries margin of error of plus or
minus 4 percent.

Cuprus says pact with Turks on missing persons is defunct 
</HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A widely praised agreement between
Cyprus' estranged Greek and Turkish communities to locate people
missing in communal strife years ago has collapsed over a numbers
dispute, a senior Greek Cypriot official said Wednesday.
	   Humanitarian Affairs Commissioner Takis Christopoulos declared
the July 31, 1997 agreement between President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash _ seen as a breakthrough at
the time _ ``dead and buried.''
	   ``I am afraid there is not much hope of it being revived,''
Christopoulos told reporters.
	   The agreement was supposed to lay the ground for determining the
fate of 1,619 Greek Cypriots and 803 Turkish Cypriots missing in
communal clashes in the early 1960s and during Turkey's 1974
invasion and occupation of the northern third of the island.
	   The invasion, ostensibly to protect Turkish Cypriots, followed a
failed coup by Greek Cypriots who wanted the island united with
Greece.
	   Christopoulos said his government, the only internationally
recognized administration on the island, rejected Turkish Cypriot
demands that Greeks and Greek Cypriots killed during the failed
coup be struck off the list of the missing.
	   The Turks maintained that was an internal dispute, and not a
Turkish problem.
	   A spokesman for the United Nations in Cyprus, which has been
overseeing the implementation of the agreement, said the Turkish
Cypriot demand was not in line with the July 1997 agreement. The
U.N. is trying to salvage the agreement and get the two sides to
meet again, said the spokesman, who spoke with customary anonymity.
	   The breakdown is likely to contribute to the tension on the
island, where the two sides have been separated by a U.N. buffer
zone since the Turkish invasion.
	   The long-running Cyprus problem has defied repeated attempts to
solve it by the United Nations and Western nations.
	   Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, says he will not return to
the negotiating table unless his self-styled state, declared in
1983 and recognized only by Turkey, is recognized and Cyprus
withdraws from membership talks with the European Union.

Angolan rebels eye deadline extension for compliance with peace pact 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The international commission overseeing
Angola's peace process on Wednesday recommended that the former
rebel movement UNITA be granted five extra days to implement its
part of its 1994 peace pact with the government.
	   The recommendation to extend the deadline to June 30 was to be
studied by the United Nations Security Council later in the day.
	   Earlier this month the Security Council said new economic
sanctions would be imposed on UNITA on June 25 unless the former
rebels met the outstanding stipulations of the peace accord that is
already running far behind schedule.
	   The main requirement is that UNITA hands over control to the
government of its remaining central highland strongholds.
	   The U.N. spokesman in Luanda said the resumption of direct talks
between the government and UNITA, after weeks of tense silence, had
given the peace process ``new impetus.''
	   ``They're talking to each other. That's positive,'' Moktar Gueye
said. The spokesman added that he expected the Security Council to
approve the commission's recommendation for the deadline to be
extended to next Tuesday.
	   The commission includes representatives of the Angolan
government, UNITA, the United Nations, the United States, Russia
and Portugal.
	   Gueye said there was ``no straightjacket'' on how much time the
former foes would be given to resolve their differences, as long as
they were talking to each other. However, he noted that the
patience of the international community was running thin.
	   In an effort to force the former rebels to comply with the
latest deadline, the Security Council earlier this month threatened
to freeze UNITA's foreign bank accounts and ban its diamond sales.
	   Air and travel sanctions were already slapped on UNITA in
October, in addition to an oil and weapons embargo in effect since
1993.
	   UNITA has complained of police brutality and harassment of its
supporters in areas returned to government control.
	   Also, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi has refused to leave his
stronghold at Andulo, about 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of
Luanda, saying he fears for his safety.
	   The government has promised to give formal approval on Saturday
for a 400-strong contingent of armed bodyguards for Savimbi.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war for nearly two
decades against the government following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.

BBC program to show man dying as part of documentary series 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A man's death from stomach cancer will be shown in
a television documentary airing Thursday in Britain, as part of a
series that has taken a frank look at the mysteries of life.
	   Herbert Mowes, who died April 9, 1997, permitted television
cameras to record his last breaths as part of a seven-part BBC
series called ``The Human Body,'' presented by Lord Winston, one of
Britain's leading authorities on fertility.
	   ``I know that I'll never see this film in my lifetime, but I
like to think that everybody will see how a human being can manage
an illness like mine,'' Mowes, 63, says in the program. ``Everybody
can see that there is a way to make the best of the end of your
life.''
	   The program has excited a certain amount of excitement in the
tabloids, as evidenced by the Daily Mail headline ``BBC to Break
Death on TV Taboo.'' Robert Robinson of the Evening Standard wrote:
``A man's deathbed, his last hour, is his alone, and to intrude
upon it is to rob his grave before he is in it.''
	   But the controversy, such as it is, is routine by the standards
of the tabloids, who characterize any clash of opinions as a
``furious row.''
	   Writing in The Times, Winston said he found the modicum of
sensational reporting ``depressing, indeed outrageous.''
	   ``Television, possibly more than any medium through its fiction
and even its news coverage, has largely inured us to carnage, to
violent death and other horrors,'' Winston wrote. ``Yet when it is
planned, constructively and sensitively, to show the reality of the
journey that all of us take, the paradoxical reaction is one of
anxiety.''
	   Mowes and his wife, Hannelore, moved from Frankfurt to Galway on
the west cost of Ireland 20 years ago.
	   Mowes learned that he had stomach cancer at the end of 1995, and
he agreed to participate in the documentary project the following
autumn.
	   Hannelore Mowes said the project seemed to help her husband,
whose tumor had grown to about 40 pounds (18 kg) by the time he
died. In an interview with The Sunday Times, she said the crew
members were good company and soon became friends.
	   On the morning of his death, two members of the television crew
gave Mowes his last bath. But the crew withdrew at the very end of
his life, leaving the cameras running while Mrs. Mowes cradled him
in her arm, talking softly to him in German.
	   ``I couldn't cry,'' she said. ``I was happy for him. I thought,
'Yes, Herbie, you have peace.' ''
	   Later, the two crew members who gave Mowes his last bath lowered
him into his coffin.
	   Winston said he was particularly moved by one scene in the
documentary, in which a neighbor brings his 10-year-old daughter to
visit Mowes.
	   ``She thrusts into (his) hand a tiny bunch of wild flowers which
she has picked in the fields outside,'' Winston said, ``and she and
her father sing him a little Irish folksong ...
	   ``For those who have yet to see this program, it may seem
shocking, even mawkish, that a small girl could be allowed to
witness the death of a neighbor, in what might be thought to be a
distressing scene. But the thing which stands out is this girl's
very lack of distress.
	   ``It is, indeed, a lesson to all of us. In hiding death as we do
in our civilized society, we make it a taboo.''
	   The Rev. Steve Chalke, an Anglican priest who works in
television, wrote in the Mail on Sunday newspaper that he objected
to Winston's narration, saying it reduced human beings to machines
designed only to reproduce.
	   But Chalke had no objection to the death scene.
	   ``If the series ... helps us to talk more openly and honestly
about our hopes and fears concerning death, it will have done us a
great service,'' he wrote.

Hundreds of thousands Securitate files destroyed 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in fourth graf with files remain closed; penultimate
graf with moves by politicians to declare collaboration
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, an
intelligence officer admitted that some 300,000 files of Romania's
feared communist secret police have been destroyed, media reported
Wednesday.
	   Mircea Gheordunescu, deputy director of the Romanian Information
Service, told Parliament Tuesday that 270,000 Securitate files were
burned between 1971 and 1979, Cotidianul daily reported.
	   A further 27,000 files were burnt by Securitate officers
immediately after the 1989 revolt, he said. The Romanian
Information Service succeeded the communist-era Securitate
following the revolution.
	   The files destroyed between 1971 and 1979 were of Communist
Party Securitate collaborators and informers who died in that
period. Millions of Securitate files remain closed to the public,
almost nine years after Ceausescu was killed.
	   Romanians are still preoccupied with the Securitate. Over the
last two weeks, several prominent politicians including Health
Minister Francisc Baranyi were exposed as collaborators of the
former secret police controlled by late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   The ruling Peasant Party, whose leaders often were tortured and
killed by the Securitate, said it now wants members to declare if
they collaborated with the secret police. Prime Minister Radu
Vasile said he will have by Thursday statements from his ministers
saying whether they worked for the Securitate.
	   According to Romanian intelligence reports, there are still
100,000 Securitate informers living in Romania. An additional 125
million pages of files are still locked away in the vaults of the
Romanian Information Service.

Annan stands ready to help Cambodia in upcoming elections 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed his
readiness Wednesday to assist Cambodia in its upcoming election and
called on donor countries to help Cambodian officials close the
funding gap for the balloting.
	   The offer was contained in a statement released in the wake of
communiques last week by the Freinds of Cambodia and three
representatives of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or
ASEAN.
	   In a statement Saturday in Phnom Penh, the Friends of Cambodia _
a group of Western and Asian countries seeking an end to the
country's unrest _ said that the elections will not be perfect, but
urged all parties to take part for the sake of democracy.
	   ``The secretary-general wishes also to reiterate his call to the
Cambodian government to do its utmost to create an environment
conducive to the holding of free, fair and credible elections,''
the U.N. statement said.
	   ``The secretary-general stands ready to cooperate with the
Cambodian authorities and other political actors to move the
electoral process forward,'' it added. ``The secretary-general is
giving his personal attention to the developments in Cambodia and
will be making a further review in early July of developments
regarding the elections and of the United Nations' role in
coordinating international observers.''
	   Official campaigning for the July 26 election opens Thursday.
The opposition says the process is rigged in favor of strongman Hun
Sen and little is being done about it.
	   But the deposed co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
said Saturday that he will not join a boycott of the elections,
despite concerns they will not be free or fair.
	   Instead, Ranariddh argued that Hun Sen _ who ousted him in a
bloody coup a year ago _ should be pressured to ensure the vote
will be as credible as possible.
	   Last year's coup shattered a tense dual premiership formed after
U.N.-brokered elections in 1993. Hun Sen agreed to hold the
election in an effort to win back international legitimacy and
foreign aid, and allowed Ranariddh to return to participate after
pressure from foreign aid donors.
	   In the statement, the United Nations noted that Cambodia's
National Election Committee faces a shortfall of about dlrs 3
million to finance the election.
	   The United Nations said Annan is making ``an urgent appeal to
donor countries to close this funding gap as soon as possible,
since elections are only a month away.''

Bulgaria, Poland join protest over Belarus diplomatic compound home; ADDS byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Polish ambassador blocked from entering
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The Polish ambassador was recalled to his
capital on Wednesday to protest Belarus' attempts to evict him and
21 other diplomats, but before he could even pack his bags he was
locked out of his house.
	   President Alexander Lukashenko's government has been trying for
weeks to oust the ambassadors from their homes on the wooded
outskirts of Minsk. Officials say that the houses need urgent sewer
and plumbing repairs, and Lukashenko says the compound belongs to
him.
	   But the countries maintain that violates international law,
which designates ambassadors' home as the territory of their home
countries. The host country must ask permission to enter and cannot
demand that residents leave.
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy and Japan left Belarus earlier this week to consult
with their governments over the dispute. On Wednesday, Bulgaria
also instructed its ambassador, Marko Ganchev, to leave.
	   Polish Ambassador Mariusz Maszkiewicz had planned to conduct a
flag-lowering ceremony on Wednesday at the diplomatic compound,
Polish radio and the Interfax news agency reported. He was also
planning to pick up his belongings.
	   Guards refused to allow Maszkiewicz into the residence, saying
that urgently needed repairs had already begun. He is scheduled to
leave Belarus on Thursday.

Swiss withdraw trains for wheel checks after German crash 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The national Swiss railway operator has
withdrawn two trains from service for detailed wheel checks, a
director of the company told Swiss radio Wednesday.
	   The withdrawn trains, used on the country's Geneva-La Plaine
route, have rubber-buffered tires similar to those used on the
ill-fated German high-speed ICE train which crashed on June 3 in
northern Germany, killing 100 people.
	   They were among five trains on which the Swiss have already
conducted ultrasound tests following the German accident, Swiss
Federal Railways' rolling stock director Adrian Schneeberger told
Zurich local radio Radio Z.
	   While three of the five were found to be free of faults,
problems were discovered on the two others, said Schneeberger.
	   The company has decided to send the pair back to their German
manufacturer for more exhaustive tests, he said.
	   The five trains tested are the only rolling stock owned by Swiss
Federal Railways with wheels similar to those on the crashed German
train.
	   A cracked wheel tire on the first generation ICE was blamed for
the June 3 accident in Eschede, 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of
Hanover.

England Monarchs suspend operations 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with background, fixes to England Monarchs
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The NFL Europe league shut down its England
franchise Wednesday and replaced it with a team in Berlin.
	   The NFL Europe League board of directors suspended operations of
the struggling England Monarchs because of declining support and
poor on-field performances.
	   League president Oliver Luck said the Monarchs recorded the
league's lowest average attendance (5,944) and the team had
difficulty attracting sponsors or securing a suitable playing
venue.
	   ``This decision is a last resort but one that could no longer be
avoided,'' he said.
	   The Monarchs' poor playing season culminated with the
resignation of Lionel Taylor, who resigned as coach with a 3-7
record in 1998.
	   Taylor, the Denver Broncos' career receiving leader, joined the
Monarchs as offensive coordinator in 1995 and became head coach in
1996.
	   The Berlin franchise, which was not immediately named, will
begin play in the 1999 season and joins two other German teams _
the Frankfurt Galaxy and Rhein Fire of Duesseldorf.
	   The league's three other teams are the Scottish Claymores,
Barcelona Dragons and Amsterdam Admirals.
	   The London franchise was the flagship team of the former World
League of American Football. Known then as the London Monarchs, the
club drew up to 40,000 fans at Wembley Stadium during its run to
the league championship in 1991.
	   The league, originally comprising 10 teams in Europe and North
America, folded after the 1992 season and returned in 1995 with a
new six-team all-European format.
	   But the London franchise never drew the crowds it did during the
first season and, this year, the team played games in Birmingham
and Bristol as well as the capital.

Heavy fighting north of capital 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Opposition soldiers suffered heavy
casualties on Wednesday during a ferocious day-long battle with the
Taliban religious army, according to Taliban spokesmen.
	   A spokesman for the anti-Taliban alliance, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, confirmed there was heavy fighting around
Tagab, some 60 kilometers (18 miles) northeast of Kabul, but he did
not have any casualty figures.
	   Tagab is the only route open for residents of the capital to
travel north to opposition-controlled territory. Dozens of people
-- many of them civilians -- died during heavy fighting in the area
last month.
	   The Taliban, which rules roughly 85 percent of Afghanistan, is
locked in ferocious battles with its opposition on at least three
separate battlefields, all north of the capital.
	   The opposition alliance mostly represents the country's minority
ethnic and religious groups.
	   Taliban authorities said fighting has escalated in Afghanistan
in recent days following a visit to northern Afghanistan by Iranian
government officials. It accuses Iran of arming and financing its
enemies, who represent the country's minority Shiite Muslims. Most
Iranians also are Shiite Muslims.
	   Taliban soldiers, who espouse a strict form of Islamic law,
largely belong to the country's majority Sunni sect of Islam, like
most Pakistanis.

World Cup: Saudi penalties sink South Africa in World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS, ADDS more detail, quote
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Shaun Bartlett scored twice for South
Africa, but penalty strikes by Sami al-Jaber and captain Youssef
al-Thyniyan gave Saudi Arabia a 2-2 draw Wednesday and ended the
Africans' hopes of advancing in their first World Cup.
	   South Africa dominated the match it had to win, putting
consistent pressure on the Saudi defense. But the two penalties
awarded the Saudis by Chilean referee Mario Sanchez proved the
equalizing factor.
	   Bartlett's second goal, an second-half injury time penalty,
caused the colorful South African contingent at Stade Lescure to
erupt in dancing and singing as the match ended.
	   Neither nation made the second round, as Saudi Arabia finished
Pool C play with one point on the draw and two losses _ to France
and Denmark _ while South Africa had two points on its draws with
Denmark and the Saudis after losing to France in the opener.
	   The Saudis already were eliminated from contention entering the
match and played under new coach Mohammed al-Kharashi, a longtime
assistant, after Brazilian Carlos Albert Parreira was fired
following the 4-0 loss to France.
	   South Africa needed to win and make up a four-goal deficit to
Denmark in goal differential in order to advance. France defeated
the Danes 2-1 in the other Group C finale, and both those teams
advanced.
	   ``It was a nice show by our players, but we have to continue to
work harder to improve our play. I was expecting a better result,''
said South African coach Philippe Troussier.
	   Both penalties against South Africa involved defender Pierre
Issa and were questionable. On the first, near the end of the first
half, al-Thyniyan fell in the penalty area after Issa brushed him.
	   Al-Jaber took the penalty, beating South African goalkeeper Hans
Vonk high to the left side.
	   The second call came in the 73rd minute after Issa wrestled with
substitute Ibrahim al-Shahrani for the ball, eventually pulling him
down. Sanchez immediately pointed to the spot, and al-Thyniyan beat
Vonk low, again to the left.
	   Bartlett scored the second World Cup goal in South African
history in the 18th minute, taking a long clearing pass from Issa
while shielding off defender Fuad Amin and fooling al-Deayea by
shooting for the near corner.
	   South Africa pushed for an equalizer near the end, with captain
Lucas Radebe testing al-Deayea on a free kick. Then substitute
Jerry Sikhosana was pulled down in the penalty area in injury time
and Bartlett blasted a high kick past al-Deayea to tie the game.
	   Suspensions and injuries left South Africa with only five
non-goalkeeper reserves. Starting midfielder Brendan Augustine and
reserve Naughty Mokoena were sent home for violating a curfew, and
midfielder Alfred Phiri was serving a three-game ban for his red
card against Denmark. Striker Phil Masinga of Bari is out with a
bad ankle.
	   The match ended a tough World Cup for Olympique Marseilles
defender Issa. He scored an own goal in the opening loss to France
and also had another French goal deflect off him, then was called
for both penalties against Saudi Arabia.

OPEC ministers haggle over production cuts over sume numbers; fresh oil price. New throughout. AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS with Venezuelan source saying ministers still haggling
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers haggled late Wednesday
over how much oil to remove from the glutted market, after some
expressed reservations about a deal to cut 1.4 million barrels a
day, sources said.
	   The 11 OPEC nations held critical talks on the supply problem
that recently pushed prices of crude to 12-year lows and stirred
some concerns about a possible repeat of the disasters that struck
the global oil industry in 1986.
	   After an informal afternoon session, Saudi Arabia's oil
minister, Ali Naimi, said the group had reached a deal, and various
OPEC sources said the production cuts would come to 1.4 million
barrels a day.
	   OPEC was soon back behind closed doors, however, discussing how
much crude oil Iran would actually take off the market, according
to a Venezuelan OPEC source who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
	   ``There is no agreement yet, but we are looking at the
numbers,'' the Venezuelan said.
	   Some of the OPEC ministers were apparently hoping to find out
whether Iran will actually cut the 190,000 barrels a day that was
part of the 1.4 million-barrel deal.
	   Outside analysts have said Iran angered others in OPEC during an
earlier round of output cuts in the spring, by arguing that its
first round of cuts would come from an unfilled production quota,
meaning no cut at all.
	   Traders appeared unsure about whether OPEC was doing enough.
Prices rose modestly on news that OPEC had reached an agreement but
then fell as some of the details started flashing on trading
screens.
	   Brent crude oil to be delivered in August was down 9 cents at
dlrs 13.83 per barrel by late afternoon on London's International
Petroleum Exchange, giving up gains of more than 30 cents that had
pushed Brent above dlrs 14 per barrel earlier in the day.
	   After ministers met privately in the early afternoon, Saudi
Arabia's oil minister, Ali Naimi, first announced that a deal had
been done, saying he was ``very happy'' although he would not
provide any immediate details.
	   OPEC delegates said 1.4 million barrels in production cuts would
be led by the Saudis, who are chopping 425,000 barrels a day from
their production beginning on July 1. Venezuela has promised to cut
325,000 barrels a day, followed by Iran's pledge to restrain output
by 190,000 barrels daily.
	   Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria each pledged to cut
production by 100,000 barrels daily, with smaller cuts coming in
from smaller OPEC members, delegates said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Analysts have cautioned that OPEC needs to show it can deliver
more than just promises. Even though the producers found themselves
in serious economic trouble by flooding the market this winter and
spring, they have had persistent problems sticking to any
production agreements in recent years.
	   OPEC has not yet formally begun its summer meeting, but was
hoping first to resolve its major issue _ the production cuts.
	   Going into Wednesday's informal session, six of the 11 OPEC
members had pledged to slash 620,000 barrels daily from the market
_ and OPEC appears to have more than doubled that promise. Non-OPEC
producers Mexico, Russia, Egypt and Oman had pledged to cut 203,000
barrels.
	   Crude oil is the world's most vital commodity and the recent
cheap prices have been a bargain for consumers but a nightmare for
OPEC and other producers.
	   OPEC found itself in a mess this winter after boosting output
just as the Asian economic crisis started eroding the growth in
world oil demand.
	   The oil ministers held an emergency meeting in March, agreeing
to cut 1.245 million barrels of daily production. They delivered
most, but not all, of those cuts and prices plunged further,
leading to the latest effort to restrain production further.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Human rights organization urges Caribbean to condemn Guyana violence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ The Caribbean Human Rights Network
denounced violent anti-government protests in Guyana and is urging
members of the Caribbean Community trade group to do the same.
	   In a written statement released Tuesday, the group said it was
``deeply saddened for the people of Guyana on the resumption of
violent street demonstrations in Georgetown.''
	   Guyanese of African descent are demanding that President Janet
Jagan's party step down, claiming it used fraud to win the Dec. 15
elections. Jagan's party is backed by the East Indian ethnic
majority.
	   During a week of protests, demonstrators have thrown stones and
firebombs at police. Police have countered with tear gas grenades,
and dozens of people have been arrested.
	   The Human Rights Network said it backed a Caribbean Community
audit that said the elections were fair.
	   ``The network is calling on the governments of the Caribbean
Community to unequivocally condemn these demonstrations,'' the
group said.

Judges obedient to former communist authorities should not be fired 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A special tribunal said on Wednesday that
a law allowing the dismissal of judges who from 1944-89 issued
verdicts expected by the communist authorities violates Poland's
constitution.
	   The Constitutional Tribunal, which checks whether all new laws
are in accord with the supreme charter, made the comments after
reviewing a law approved by the rightist-dominated parliament in
December.
	   The law said that judges who violated the principle of
independence because they ruled according to the expectations of
communist authorities in trials against the opposition, can be
fired by the year 2000. The law is unconstitutional because the
National Court Board did not issue an opinion on it, the tribunal
said.
	   It would have concerned about 20 judges, according to the
Chairman of the Supreme Court, Adam Strzembosz.
	   The law is a part of Poland's efforts to deal with the evils of
the former communist era, as it builds a democratic society.
	   But the tribunal agreed with another provision of the law, which
said that judges and prosecutors who under communist era were
Soviet or Polish secret service or military intelligence agents,
should be stripped of retirement bonuses - such as earlier
retirement rights or extra sums for serving under the communists
	   The tribunal's ruling is not subject to appeal.
	   Ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski, who asked the
tribunal to screen the law, must still sign that part of the law
approved by the tribunal.

Swedish missionaries released after six months captivity in Russia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Two young Swedish missionaries taken
hostage in southern Russia in January were released and taken to an
unspecified country, the Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday.
	   Daniel and Paulina Brodin were kidnapped Jan. 8 in Makhachkala,
the center of Russia's Dagestan region. The 22-year-old Brolins,
who are married, were on missionary work as members of Sweden's
Pentecostal Church.
	   Some two months after the kidnapping, a Russian television
network aired a videotape of the couple, who said they were being
held in a mountain village in Chechnya, which borders Dagestan.
	   Church official Lars-Olof Andersson, who took part in efforts to
win the couple's release, said at a news conference that the
Brolins were in good health, considering what they had gone
through.
	   Swedish national police chief Lars Nylen declined to give
details of the release.
	   The kidnappers had made no public demands, but Sweden's
ambassador to Russia Sven Hirdman said in March that ``we know they
were taken for purely commercial reasons.''
	   Hirdman told reporters in Moscow that no ransom was paid.

Israel warns United Nations over upgrading PLO status 
</HEADLINE>
By DANNA HARMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel appealed to the United Nations on
Wednesday not to upgrade the PLO's observer status in the world
body, saying such a step would violate the Mideast peace accords.
	   The PLO's request to be granted near-state status, although
without voting rights, is to be discussed later this week by the
U.N. General Assembly.
	   A change in the PLO's status now ``would have both political and
symbolic implications,'' said Aaron Yaacov of the Israeli Foreign
Ministry's U.N. section.
	   On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and urged him to delay the request
for a change in status, Palestinian sources said.
	   The Clinton administration apparently is concerned that a
dispute between Israel and the Palestinians over the issue could
further disrupt U.S. efforts to mediate agreement on an Israeli
troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's Foreign
Ministry have been campaigning against the change of status.
	   The PLO was granted observer status in the General Assembly in
1974, enabling it to maintain an office in New York but without the
same privileges as missions of U.N. member states.
	   In December 1997, the Arab states submitted a resolution asking
that the PLO receive ``the same rights and privileges of
participation as those conferred upon member states, with the
exception of voting and candidature for office on U.N.
committees.''
	   The resolution was withdrawn when members of the European Union
used a parliamentary maneuver to derail a vote.
	   Now, with no sign of progress on Middle East peace, the Arab
states decided to bring the resolution _ albeit a watered-down
version _ back before the 185-member General Assembly .
	   The proposed new designation would give the Palestinian mission
``full rights of participation,'' but make no mention of the PLO
having the same rights as other member states. The EU has indicated
it will support the resolution this time.
	   The upgrading of status, if it passes, would make little
difference in the daily work of the Palestinian mission.
	   But it would affirm international support for the Palestinians
in the protracted peace process, and give encouragement to Arafat,
who has said he plans to declare a state by next year, when the
five-year interim period of Palestinian Authority officially ends.
	   A final Israel-Palestinian peace agreement was supposed to have
been reached by then, but negotiations have yet to begin.

Psychics testify at Gucci trial in Milan 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Psychics who worked for Maurizio Gucci and
his ex-wife testified Wednesday at the trial for the murder of the
former fashion heir.
	   One of the psychics, Antonietta Cuomo, told the court that she
used her ``sensitive powers'' and ``ability to see things'' in
advising Gucci on business decisions during the last two years of
his life.
	   Gucci's former wife, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, is accused of
arranging his murder out of jealousy and desire for his money. Her
psychic and longtime friend, Giuseppina Auriemma, is a
co-defendant, charged with helping her set up the slaying.
	   Three others also are on trial for the shooting of Gucci, which
took place March 27, 1995, outside his office building in downtown
Milan.
	   ``When (Gucci) felt the need to speak with me, I would go to his
office and he would ask me what I thought of his business
projects,'' Cuomo testified, saying she had an appointment to see
Gucci the morning he was killed.
	   She said she never asked him for money for her services, but
that Gucci gave her a ``gift'' of 10 million lire (dlrs 5,700) that
was intended to cover a three-year period.
	   ``He would tell me he was thinking of doing this project or
making that investment and I would tell him if I thought something
would be successful or not,'' she said.
	   At one point, Cuomo said, Gucci asked her to visit his St.
Moritz chalet, which he believed had been put under an evil spell
by Auriemma.
	   ``He told me he couldn't stand to go in that house, that he had
an intense sense of rejection,'' Cuomo said. ``He couldn't sleep
there ... (and) he asked me to help.''
	   Cuomo said she went to the house and found ``that there was
something that wasn't right.''
	   ``What did you do?'' asked prosecutor Carlo Nocerino.
	   ``I lit all the candles,'' Cuomo said with a shrug.
	   Also taking the stand was Maddalena Anselmi, who says she was a
friend and spiritual adviser to both Reggiani Martinelli and Gucci.
	   She said she lived with Reggiani Martinelli for nearly three
years in the late 1980s, following the couple's separation in 1984.
	   Reggiani Martinelli ``complained constantly that the monthly
check from Maurizio wasn't sufficient to meet her needs,'' Anselmi
said. At one point, Gucci was sending 60 million lire (dlrs 34,000)
a month.

Dutch approve uranium sale to Taiwanese nuclear plants 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ In a move likely to irk China, the
Dutch government has approved the sale of uranium to Taiwan for use
in two nuclear power plants, a Dutch official said Wednesday.
	   Economics Ministry spokesman Luuc van Zijp said the sale
concerns light, enriched uranium which will not be used for
weapons. But the deal was almost sure to upset Beijing, which has
frowned at similar uranium exports to Taiwan by other countries.
	   Calls to the Chinese Embassy in The Hague went unanswered
Wednesday.
	   Van Zijp declined to disclose details of the sale to the Taiwan
Power Company, saying only that the uranium will be delivered by
the Dutch-British-German consortium Urenco, which is based in the
eastern Dutch city of Almelo.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Frank de Bruin stressed the uranium
will be used for ``peaceful purposes.'' The Dutch government is
forbidden to sell weapons to Taiwan, which is considered a renegade
province by Beijing.
	   The Netherlands has long followed a ``one China'' policy which
recognizes Beijing and shuns political ties with Taipei. But on the
economic front, the pragmatic Dutch conduct lucrative trade with
both.
	   ``We respect the one-China policy, but we cannot ignore the fact
that we also have economic ties with Taiwan,'' said De Bruin.
	   Back in the early 1980s, sales of Dutch submarines to Taiwan
torpedoed Dutch-Sino relations. Since then, the Dutch have had to
tread carefully in this field.

World Cup: Saudi penalties sink South Africa in World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS more quotes; optional upcoming
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Shaun Bartlett scored twice for South
Africa, but penalty strikes by Sami al-Jaber and captain Youssef
al-Thyniyan gave Saudi Arabia a 2-2 draw Wednesday and ended the
Africans' hopes of advancing in their first World Cup.
	   South Africa dominated the match it had to win, putting
consistent pressure on the Saudi defense. But the two penalties
awarded the Saudis by Chilean referee Mario Sanchez proved the
equalizing factor.
	   Bartlett's second goal, an second-half injury time penalty,
caused the colorful South African contingent at Stade Lescure to
erupt in dancing and singing as the match ended.
	   Neither nation made the second round, as Saudi Arabia finished
Pool C play with one point on the draw and two losses _ to France
and Denmark _ while South Africa had two points on its draws with
Denmark and the Saudis after losing to France in the opener.
	   The Saudis already were eliminated from contention entering the
match and played under new coach Mohammed al-Kharashi, a longtime
assistant, after Brazilian Carlos Albert Parreira was fired
following the 4-0 loss to France.
	   ``I'm very happy. Even though we're out of the tournament, we
proved we could do something at the end,'' al-Kharashi said. ``I
wish we had played like this before. We would have qualified'' for
the second round.
	   South Africa needed to win and make up a four-goal deficit to
Denmark in goal differential in order to advance. France defeated
the Danes 2-1 in the other Group C finale, and both those teams
advanced.
	   ``It was a nice show by our players, but we have to continue to
work harder to improve our play. I was expecting a better result,''
said South African coach Philippe Troussier.
	   Troussier said South Africa's inexperience showed during the
tournament, and that his players lacked the will to win.
	   ``I really never felt that there was that collective commitment
on the part of everyone,'' said Troussier, who sent home two
players last week for staying out all night and had disputes with
others.
	   Both penalties against South Africa involved defender Pierre
Issa and were questionable. On the first, near the end of the first
half, al-Thyniyan fell in the penalty area after Issa brushed him.
	   Al-Jaber took the penalty, beating South African goalkeeper Hans
Vonk high to the left side.
	   The second call came in the 73rd minute after Issa wrestled with
substitute Ibrahim al-Shahrani for the ball, eventually pulling him
down. Sanchez immediately pointed to the spot, and al-Thyniyan beat

	   Bartlett scored the second World Cup goal in South African
history in the 18th minute, taking a long clearing pass from Issa
while shielding off defender Fuad Amin and fooling al-Deayea by
shooting for the near corner.
	   South Africa pushed for an equalizer near the end, with captain
Lucas Radebe testing al-Deayea on a free kick. Then substitute
Jerry Sikhosana was pulled down in the penalty area in injury time
and Bartlett blasted a high kick past al-Deayea to tie the game.
	   Suspensions and injuries left South Africa with only five
non-goalkeeper reserves. Starting midfielder Brendan Augustine and
reserve Naughty Mokoena were sent home for violating a curfew, and
midfielder Alfred Phiri was serving a three-game ban for his red
card against Denmark. Striker Phil Masinga of Bari is out with a
bad ankle.
	   The match ended a tough World Cup for Olympique Marseilles
defender Issa. He scored an own goal in the opening loss to France
and also had another French goal deflect off him, then was called
for both penalties against Saudi Arabia.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, an
intelligence officer admitted that some 300,000 files of Romania's
feared communist secret police have been destroyed, media reported
Wednesday.
	   Mircea Gheordunescu, deputy director of the Romanian Information
Service, told Parliament Tuesday that 270,000 Securitate files were
burned between 1971 and 1979, Cotidianul daily reported.
	   A further 27,000 files were burnt by Securitate officers
immediately after the 1989 revolt, he said. The Romanian
Information Service succeeded the communist-era Securitate
following the revolution.
	   Most of the files destroyed between 1971 and 1979 were burned on
orders from the Communist party, which did not want to reveal links
between its members and the Securitate service, media reported.
	   Other files destroyed were those of informers who died in that
eight-year period.
	   Millions of Securitate files remain closed to the public, almost
nine years after Ceausescu was killed.
	   Romanians are still preoccupied with the Securitate. Over the
last two weeks, several prominent politicians including Health
Minister Francisc Baranyi were exposed as collaborators of the
former secret police controlled by late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   The statement by Gheordunescu marks the first time that a
government official has begun to confront this dark part of
Romania's past. Previous intelligence officers have tried to
confound and mystify matters in good Securitate fashion.
	   The ruling Peasant Party, whose leaders often were tortured and
even killed by the Securitate, said it now wants members to declare
if they collaborated with the secret police.
	   At least one Peasant Party leader opposed the move, saying
parliament should instead pass a law allowing access to files.
	   On Monday, Liberal Party senators handed written declarations in
sealed envelopes to party leader Mircea Ionescu Quintus.
	   By Thursday, Prime Minister Radu Vasile will have statements
from his ministers saying whether they worked for the Securitate.
	   According to Romanian intelligence reports, there are still
100,000 Securitate informers living in Romania. An additional 125
million pages of files are still locked away in the vaults of the
Romanian Information Service.

Security Council hears evidence of Iraqi nerve gas weapons and Switzerland to confirm US analysis; French ambassador says if true, findings are serious 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Butler to ask labs in France
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector will ask
laboratories in France and Switzerland to confirm findings of U.S.
Army scientists that traces of a deadly VX nerve gas were on shards
of Iraqi missile warheads, diplomats said Wednesday.
	   One of the diplomats, French Ambassador Alain Dejammet, said
that if the European laboratories uphold the findings ``it would be
a matter to be discussed very seriously.''
	   That is significant because France _ along with Russia and China
_ has been among Iraq's leading sympathizers on the 15-member
council.
	   Chief inspector Richard Butler met with council members behind
closed doors on results of an analysis by the U.S. Army laboratory
at Aberdeen, Maryland.
	   Diplomatic sources said the lab reported finding traces of VX
and a stabilizer on Iraqi warheads, despite Iraq's claims that it
never succeeded in transforming the deadly nerve agent into a
weapon.
	   If the findings are true, they could undermine efforts by
Russia, France and China to close the seven-year inspection program
and lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Saddam
Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait. The invasion led to the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   Leaving the meeting before its conclusion, Dejammet said Butler
told the council that he would ask Swiss and French labs for an
independent assessment of the findings, as Iraq had demanded.
	   The Iraqis, in a statement Tuesday, denied placing VX in
warheads and questioned the scientific basis for the Army report.
Iraq said further tests should be conducted in a neutral country _
such as Switzerland _ or in France or Russia.
	   Before the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who won
international acclaim in February for striking a deal with the
Iraqis to avert U.S.-led airstrikes, said Wednesday he hoped the
finding would not damage U.N. relations with Iraq.
	   ``We are dealing with the Iraqis on a large spectrum of issues
and I hope this particular development will not destroy the
improved relations that has allowed UNSCOM to carry on with its
work,'' Annan said, using the acronym for the U.N. Special
Commission that performs arms inspections.
	   But the British and American ambassadors _ Iraq's toughest
critics on the council _ said the findings underscore the need for
Baghdad to disclose all information on illegal weapons programs if
it expects an end to sanctions.
	   ``I think Iraq is conducting its diversion and deception
campaign and it's not working,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson
said as he arrived for the meeting. ``Facts are facts. Iraq has
been deceiving the international community with weaponization of
nerve gas.''
	   In a statement published Wednesday in Baghdad, Saddam and other
Iraqi leaders demanded sanctions be lifted immediately. If not,
they warned they would reconsider relations with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The statement did not mention the VX findings, although the
official Iraqi News Agency dismissed them as ``baseless and mere
fabrications.''
	   In its statement Tuesday, Iraq's U.N. mission said that Baghdad
rejects the results, adding they ``cannot be accurate since VX was
not used in any kind of munitions in Iraq due to continuous
production failure.''
	   The Iraqis said the samples were too small to be conclusive and
``finding a trace of a stabilizer in one sample out of seven
analyzed is not evidence because, if VX was used, a stabilizer
would have been found in every sample.''
	   VX is a colorless, odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it
comes into contact with oxygen. A few drops can kill in minutes.
	   Despite the U.S. report, the Security Council is deeply divided
over the Iraq issue. The United States and Britain insist Iraq be
compelled to provide full disclosure of all banned weapons before
sanctions are lifted.
	   Russia, China and France are equally resolved that the
inspections should wrap up as quickly as possible, a position also
held by Annan's chief advisers.
	   Even if the findings were verified, they would not prove
conclusively that Iraq still has banned weapons because the samples
were taken from warheads Baghdad says were destroyed after the Gulf
War.
	   But Iraq has maintained it never produced VX warheads or figured
out how to store the deadly nerve agent in bulk. Findings to the
contrary would call into question Iraq's previous declarations
about the state of its programs of mass-destruction weapons.
	   In Baghdad, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said that 1.7 tons
(1.87 US tons) of VX had been produced, but that it was not of
weapons grade. U.N. officials suspect the Iraqis produced up to
four tons and that if some was placed in warheads more could be
hidden in Iraq.

Germany tightens border controls to stop soccer hooligans

Eds: UPDATES in grafs 4-5 more details on arrested thugs
By GEORGE BOEHMER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The Interior Ministry toughened border
checks Wednesday for soccer hooligans traveling to the World Cup in
France, fearful that German thugs might repeat their weekend
violence at the upcoming Germany-Iran game.
	   An additional 1,000 police will posted along the southwestern
border to target hooligans traveling to Thursday's match in
Montpelier, France.
	   Germany is seeking ways to curb soccer hooliganism after about
180 thugs clashed with French police during and after the game
Sunday between Germany and Yugoslavia. An officer, Daniel Nivel,
was beaten comatose. Two Germans _ Markus Warnecke, 27, of Hanover,
and Steffen Karl Elschner, 26, of Braunschweig _ were arrested in
the attack.
	   Warnecke, who once played soccer for the local FSV Sarstedt team
was kicked off in 1993 for rightist tendencies against foreigners,
said a club spokesman in Hanover who asked not to be identified by
name.
	   Elschner, formerly of Leipzig, has been registered as a violent
thug since 1996 and is banned from the soccer stadium in
Braunschweig where he resides, the Lower Saxony state Interior
Ministry said.

Police fire tear gas to disperse rowdy holiday crowd in Quebec 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   QUEBEC (AP) _ Police fired tear gas at rowdy young people
Wednesday after being pelted with rocks and bottles, the second
year in a row force was needed to disperse unruly crowds on
Quebec's provincial holiday.
	   Police said 35 people were arrested, many for minor incidents,
during a concert and other celebrations to mark Quebec's Fete
Nationale, which has been marred over the years by riots and other
violent incidents.
	   Several shop windows were broken late Tuesday and early
Wednesday, but the trouble-making was less serious than last year,
when Quebec City's downtown businesses suffered millions of dollars
of damage.

Man convicted of deadly London bombing that ended last IRA truce With Northern Ireland, NIreland-Election Facts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A jury convicted a Northern Ireland man Wednesday
of helping carry out a deadly London bombing that ended an Irish
Republican Army truce.
	   James McArdle, 29, was found guilty of conspiring to commit the
Feb. 9, 1996 blast in the Docklands district of east London,
killing two newspaper vendors and wounding scores of people.
	   Judge John Kay instructed the jury to rule later this week on
whether McArdle should be convicted of two counts of murder.
	   The truck-bomb attack _ which formally ended the IRA truce of
Aug. 31, 1994_ followed vague phoned warnings that left police
trying to evacuate a wide area, including office buildings, a train
station and public housing.
	   The outlawed IRA is 11 months into observing a new truce,
although dissidents have publicly vowed to continue to wage a
violent campaign against Northern Ireland and its British links.
	   McArdle was arrested at his home in Crossmaglen, Northern
Ireland, in April 1997 in a major operation involving soldiers and
police.
	   McArdle admitted transporting the truck used in the Docklands
attack twice from Northern Ireland to Britain, a fact captured on
video-security cameras. But he insisted he was simply delivering
the truck to someone he had been told was using it to ship used
cars.
	   Crossmaglen is the main town in the South Armagh borderland, a
region called ``bandit country'' because of its reputation for IRA
and criminal activity. Dissidents detonated a car bomb in
Crossmaglen's neighboring village of Newtownhamilton on Wednesday,
wounding a teen-age boy and damaging a British army fortification.

Clinton receives rare praise from Fidel Castro 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton is winning praise
from an unusual source _ Cuban President Fidel Castro.
	   The Cuban leader said Tuesday the ``balance is positive'' on
Clinton's performance in office despite Clinton's support for the
Helms-Burton law, which imposes sanctions on companies that invest
in Cuba.
	   ``I think Clinton has learned something, he's intelligent and he
defends U.S. interests and those of the multinationals, but from a
perspective different from that of the extreme right in the United
States,'' Castro told reporters, in remarks reported by Cuba's
official Prensa Latina news agency.
	   Castro said Clinton, whom he described as a peaceful, moral man,
approved Helms-Burton because he was ``looking for votes, above all
among those of Cuban origin.''
	   Castro also criticized the attention paid allegations against
Clinton.
	   ``One is repelled by so much hypocrisy. History remembers Latin
American presidents ... who were well-respected despite questions
which come up about their private lives,'' Castro said.

France wins Group C; Denmark also through to second round 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with new quotes from Chirac, Jacquet, Johansson.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ Smiles and cheers all around. France beat
Denmark 2-1 Wednesday, giving the host nation victory in Group C
and an easier passage into the next World Cup rounds, while the
Scandinavians also advanced.
	   Despite the loss, Denmark went through as second qualifier as
Saudi Arabia held South Africa 2-2 in the other group match.
	   ``We're doing well and we're going to get better,'' said French
coach Aime Jacquet after France clinched its third win in a row,
this time with a slew of players more used to being substitutes.
	   ``We lost, but we can move on,'' said a relieved Danish coach Bo
Johansson.
	   The crowd at the 44,000 capacity Stade de Gerland sang the
Marseillaise and France's first fan, President Jacques Chirac, was
all smiles. ``I'll be there again (for France) at the final,'' he
said.
	   Playmaker Youri Djorkaeff converted a penalty in the 12th minute
after a smooth move from defender Vincent Candela found David
Trezeguet, who was floored by Jes Hogh. Peter Schmeichel, earning a
Danish record 103rd cap, got a hand on the penalty but could not
push it out.
	   Against the run of play, Denmark equalized in the 42nd minute
when two French defensive flaws also earned it a spot kick.
	   Patrick Vieira unnecessarily leaned into an opponent just
outside the area and then Brian Laudrup caught the French asleep.
The veteran sent Martin Jorgensen into the penalty area and Candela
cut his legs away in desperation.
	   Michael Laudrup, in his 102nd international, scored his 37th
goal for Denmark. At 34, he will retire after the World Cup.
	   Emmanuel Petit put things right again for France in the 57th
minute, shooting through a maze of legs to beat Schmeichel for the
decisive goal, spoiling the record day for the goalkeeper.
	   ``France was the better team,'' conceded Johansson.
	   In the last second, French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez had to make
a good save from a freekick by Stig Tofting, earning several kisses
on his bald head from his defenders.
	   ``Even with the substitutions, the confidence was still there
and they kept us on the right road,'' said Jacquet.
	   By the end of the game, Danish fans were cheering ``Saudi,
Saudi,'' knowing the Arab nation had done more than expected by
containing South Africa.
	   France won Group C with a maximum nine points out of three
games. Denmark has four points, South Africa two, and Saudi Arabia
finished last with one point.
	   A Danish loss combined with a big South African win could have
seen the Africans through. A Danish win over France would have
given the Scandinavians first place.
	   Denmark will play Nigeria in Saint-Denis on Sunday and Brazil
looms for the winner of that match in the quarterfinal. France will
face either Spain, Bulgaria or Paraguay in Lens, which is
considered a far easier task.
	   ``We played three good matches, so we deserve to be where we are
now,'' said Jacquet.
	   Only four of France's World Cup starting lineup began
Wednesday's game.
	   Anybody with ideas both would play for a mutually advantageous
goalless draw were quickly proved wrong.
	   France, without a slew of regular starters to avoid suspensions
in the second round, piled on the pressure from the start and had
to wait only a dozen minutes to be rewarded with the penalty goal.
	   With star playmaker Zinedine Zidane serving the first game of a
two-match suspension for kicking an opponent, it was the start
Jacquet had dreamed of. Hometown hero Djorkaeff took over Zidane's
playmaking role with poise and efficiency for most of the match.
	   France had well over a dozen chances, continuing its attractive
brand of soccer that has delighted the home crowds during the first
two weeks of the World Cup.
	   Denmark did find some holes in the reworked French defense, with
Brian Laudrup using his speed on the right to outpace Candela and
testing Barthez with two shots, the last of which needed a
brilliant reaction save from 10 meters.
	   In the second half, France continued to pressure, and Djorkaeff
almost volleyed home a deep pass from Petit, but again Schmeichel
was up to the task.
	   Petit put some distance between the teams in the 57th minute.
	   Even though the game never got nasty, Italian referee Pierluigi
Collina did show four yellow cards in the second half, to Vieira
and Bernard Diomede for France and Soren Colding and Tofting for
Denmark.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Christian Karembeu, Marcel Desailly,
Frank Leboeuf, Vincent Candela; Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires
(Thierry Henry, 72nd), Emmanuel Petit (Alain Boghossian, 65th);
Youri Djorkaeff, David Trezeguet (Stephane Guivarc'h, 86th),
Bernard Diomede.
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel; Jacob Laursen (Soren Colding, 46th),
Marc Rieper, Jes Hogh, Jan Heintze; Martin Jorgensen (Ebbe Sand,
55th), Thomas Helveg, Allan Nielsen, Michael Schjonberg; Michael
Laudrup, Brian Laudrup (Stig Tofting, 75th).
	   Referee _ Pierluigi Collina, Italy.

Precede SALERNO Police chief fired after Italian mobsters escape through courtroom tunnel byline

By FRANCES D'EMILIO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ ``Ciao ciao e grazie'' -- bye-bye and thanks said
the note left by two escaping mobsters in a tunnel leading from a
courtroom steel-barred holding cage to freedom.
	   The bold escape Monday of defendants Giuseppe Autorino and
Ferdinando Cesarano during the trial in the southern city of
Salerno was the latest embarrassment to the Italian justice system,
and opposition politicians on Wednesday demanded that the justice
and interior ministers resign.
	   ``Swiss cheese courtroom, the police chief pays,'' Rome daily Il
Messaggero headlined its account about the first head to roll for
the escape.
	   The defendants, already serving life terms for a 1983 murder and
other crimes, were on trial for Mafia association.
	   Just last month, Premier Romano Prodi's coalition survived a
no-confidence vote against the ministers who were then under fire
for the escapes of a wheelchair-using Mafia boss and a financier
free while pending appeal.
	   According to news accounts of the latest escape, accomplices had
earlier cut a hole into the floor of the cage. The hole, which had
been covered, connected to the tunnel, which led to a farm field
right next to the courtroom, which itself had been fashioned out of
a gymnasium.
	   While other defendants in the cage blocked the view of dozens of
police guards, lawyers, spectators, prosecutors and judges, the
mobsters escaped.
	   Police said they saw Autorino and Cesarano emerge on the field
and flee in a waiting car.
	   Found inside the tunnel were guns and grenades, as well as lots
of candle stubs and empty cigarette packs, indicating digging had
gone on for some time.
	   Months ago, Italy changed its law so that mobsters kept in
top-security prisons could testify by videocamera, thus avoiding
potentially dangerous transfers to courtrooms. But that wasn't done
in this case. Despite a request by prosecutors for video equipment
in the courtroom, nothing had been installed.
	   The escape evoked memories of another one of Italy's courtroom
scandals.
	   During the years of Italian terrorism that bloodied the country
in the 1970s and early '80s, two terrorism defendants made love in
a courtroom cage while defendants surrounded them.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Two young Swedish missionaries taken
hostage in southern Russia in January were released and taken to an
unspecified country, the Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday.
	   Daniel and Paulina Brodin were kidnapped Jan. 8 in Makhachkala,
the center of Russia's Dagestan region. The 22-year-old Brolins,
who are married, were on missionary work as members of Sweden's
Pentecostal Church.
	   Some two months after the kidnapping, a Russian television
network aired a videotape of the couple, who said they were being
held in a mountain village in Chechnya, which borders Dagestan.
	   Church official Lars-Olof Andersson, who took part in efforts to
win the couple's release, said at a news conference that the
Brolins were in good health, considering what they had gone
through.
	   Swedish national police chief Lars Nylen declined to give
details of the release. Chechen officials, including Ali Asayev,
the Chechen presidency's representative in Azerbaijan, also took
part.
	   The kidnappers had made no public demands, but Sweden's
ambassador to Russia Sven Hirdman said in March that ``we know they
were taken for purely commercial reasons.''
	   Neither the church now the Swedish government paid any ransom,
according to Andersson and Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Annika
Soeder.

<TEXT>
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Waving green flags and singing Islamic
songs, supporters of Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin waited
Wednesday to welcome him back to the Gaza Strip.
	   The sheik, spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group,
arrived from Cairo at the Rafah border crossing point on Wednesday
evening. On the Gaza side of the crossing, a delegation of Hamas
officials and several dozen supporters spent the afternoon
preparing to greet him.
	   In Gaza City, well-wishers gathered at the home of the
62-year-old Hamas founder, who is quadriplegic and has hearing and
vision problems.
	   A freshly spray-painted graffiti on a nearby wall proclaimed:
``The Islamic nation is very proud of Ahmed Yassin who ... can lead
the nation to victory from his wheelchair.''
	   During a four-month fundraising tour of nearly a dozen Arab
capitals, Yassin had raised millions of dollars for the Islamic
militant group Hamas that vehemently opposes peace with Israel.
	   Yassin also made fiery statements _ widely reported in Israel _
praising suicide bombers and calling on Palestinians to carry on an
armed struggle against the Jewish state.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai left it open until
the last minute whether Israel would allow Yassin to return to the
Gaza Strip. Israel controls Gaza's external borders.
	   However, Israeli officials have said they consider Yassin more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his movements can be
monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Yassin, who is the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, left
Gaza in late February, ostensibly on a short trip to obtain medical
treatment. Instead, he embarked on a tour of the Arab world.
	   In recent months, Yassin has posed a growing challenge to
Arafat's authority. Public opinion polls suggest Palestinian
support for Hamas has crept upward in recent months as the peace
process _ supported by Arafat's Palestinian Authority _ has
remained at an impasse.
	   This marks Yassin's second triumphal homecoming to Gaza in nine
months. Israel was forced to release him from prison in September
to buy the freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents who were caught
trying to kill another Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
	   Yassin had served eight years of a life term for ordering the
killings of Israeli soldiers and Palestinians accused of
collaborating with the Israelis.
	   Tensions between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority took a sour
turn when Arafat's camp blamed an internal Hamas feud for the death
of chief Hamas bombmaker Mohiyadine Sharif, who was found dead
March 29 at the scene of a massive car-bomb blast in the West Bank
town of Ramallah.
	   But Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz Rantisi blamed the Palestinian
Authority and several high-ranking Palestinian officials and
security chiefs for collaborating with Israel in Sharif's death.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ As the players strode onto the field for the
Italy-Austria World Cup match, Italy came to a standstill. Even a
heated debate in the Chamber of Deputies was put on hold until
after the game.
	   Deputies passionately exchanged insults Tuesday morning over a
bill on NATO's eastward expansion. Then as things appeared to reach
a climax and the vote neared, the speaker of the Chamber, Luciano
Violante, declared the session suspended.
	   Violante said the recess, which coincided perfectly with game
time, was necessary to allow politicians to consult with each
other.
	   According to news reports, 90 percent of TV owners had their
screens turned on to catch Italy's 2-1 victory, despite the match's
falling during afternoon work hours.
	   Italy's streets, piazzas and restaurants, which were all but
deserted during the match, exploded into chaos within instants of
the referee's final whistle.
	   Traffic cops swarmed the streets to try to keep cars, driving
around wildly honking their horns, from provoking accidents. Mobs
of fans rushed onto the streets screaming ``Let's go Italy.''

Strike halts production of French euro 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PESSAC, France (AP) _ French production of Europe's single
currency, the euro, ground to a halt Wednesday after mint workers
went on strike to protest calls for longer hours.
	   Staff at the mint in this southwestern town voted unanimously
for the walkout, said Michel Mano, spokesman for the CGT-Monnaie
union. He said they also were protesting the mint's refusal to
create more posts to help meet production targets.
	   A delegation of workers met with mint officials Wednesday to
discuss the standoff, but there were no signs of a breakthrough.
	   France's first euro was stamped out in Pessac on May 11. It is
the only mint nationwide to be producing the coins.
	   On Jan. 1, nearly 300 million Europeans will begin using the
euro for non-cash transactions in the 11 European Union nations
that have agreed to use the currency. Bills and coins won't go into
circulation until 2002.
	   Each coin is to have a map of Europe on one side and a national
face on the other side. France's has the national motto ``Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity,'' with the initials RF, for Republique
Francaise.

Angolan rebels eye deadline extension for compliance with peace pact 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The international commission overseeing
Angola's peace process on Wednesday recommended that the former
rebel movement UNITA be granted five extra days to implement its
part of the 1994 peace pact with the government.
	   The recommendation to extend the deadline to June 30 was to be
studied by the United Nations Security Council later in the day.
	   Earlier this month the Security Council said new economic
sanctions would be imposed on UNITA on June 25 unless the former
rebels met the outstanding stipulations of the peace accord that is
already running far behind schedule.
	   The main requirement is that UNITA hands over control to the
government of its remaining central highland strongholds.
	   The U.N. spokesman in Luanda said the resumption of direct talks
between the government and UNITA, after weeks of tense silence, had
given the peace process ``new impetus.''
	   ``They're talking to each other. That's positive,'' Moktar Gueye
said. The spokesman added that he expected the Security Council to
approve the commission's recommendation for the deadline to be
extended to next Tuesday.
	   The commission includes representatives of the Angolan
government, UNITA, the United Nations, the United States, Russia
and Portugal.
	   Gueye said there was ``no straightjacket'' on how much time the
former foes would be given to resolve their differences, as long as
they were talking to each other. However, he noted that the
patience of the international community was running thin.
	   In an effort to force the former rebels to comply with the
latest deadline, the Security Council earlier this month threatened
to freeze UNITA's foreign bank accounts and ban its diamond sales.
	   Air and travel sanctions were already slapped on UNITA in
October, in addition to an oil and weapons embargo in effect since
1993.
	   UNITA has complained of police brutality and harassment of its
supporters in areas returned to government control.
	   Also, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi has refused to leave his
stronghold at Andulo, about 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of
Luanda, saying he fears for his safety.
	   The government has promised to give formal approval on Saturday
for a 400-strong contingent of armed bodyguards for Savimbi.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war for nearly two
decades against the government following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.

Further agreements in German retail workers' wage talks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Following earlier agreements in
Bavaria and Bremen this week, negotiators reached a settlement in
wage talks for retail workers in two more districts Wednesday.
	   Agreement was reached in southern Baden-Wuerttemberg state and
Hamburg after employers, who had been offering on 1.2 percent
increase, upped that to 2.1 percent effective July 1, the HBV and
DAG unions representing the workers said.
	   The HBV had been demanding pay raises of 4.8 percent and DAG 4.5
percent for the some 200,000 retail workers in the two districts.
	   Further wage talks in the retail sector are still scheduled in
Saarland, Hesse, North-Rhine Westphalia, Rhineland Palatinate and
Lower Saxony, where workers have staged sporadic warning strikes
over the past few weeks to push for more pay.

World Cup: Saudi penalties sink South Africa

	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Shaun Bartlett lived one World Cup dream
and saw another shattered.
	   The South African striker fulfilled a childhood fantasy by
scoring twice against Saudi Arabia, but two penalty kicks by the
Saudis left the game a 2-2 draw that ended the Bafana Bafana's
hopes of reaching the second round in their first World Cup.
	   Like all the South African players, Bartlett grew up during the
28 years his country was banned from international soccer because
of apartheid. Before the tournament, Bartlett said he used to
imagine himself scoring a World Cup goal.
	   ``When I scored the first goal, I just saw myself playing the
second round,'' Bartlett said of his 18th-minute left-footed shot
that caught Saudi goalkeeper Mohammed al-Deayea anticipating a
cross. ``I was really excited.
	   ``But in the end, the excitement is all gone.''
	   Neither team made the second round, as South Africa needed to
win and make up a four-goal deficit to Denmark in goal differential
in order to stay in the tournament. France defeated the Danes 2-1
in the other Group C finale, and both those teams advanced.
	   ``It was a nice show by our players, but we have to continue to
work harder to improve our play. I was expecting a better result,''
South Africa coach Philippe Troussier said.
	   Troussier said South Africa's inexperience showed during the
tournament, and that his players lacked the will to win.
	   ``I really never felt that there was that collective commitment
on the part of everyone,'' said Troussier, who sent home two
players last week for staying out all night and openly clashed with
others.
	   The Saudis already were eliminated from contention entering the
match and played under new coach Mohammed al-Kharashi, a longtime
assistant, after Brazilian Carlos Albert Parreira was fired
following the 4-0 loss to France.
	   ``I'm very happy. Even though we're out of the tournament, we
proved we could do something at the end,'' al-Kharashi said. ``I
wish we had played like this before. We would have qualified'' for
the second round.
	   Sami al-Jaber netted Saudi Arabia's first penalty in first-half
injury time and captain Youssef al-Thyniyan scored the second in
the 74th minute. Bartlett's second goal, also a penalty, came in
second-half injury time.
	   Both penalties against South Africa involved defender Pierre
Issa and were questionable. On the first, near the end of the first
half, al-Thyniyan fell in the penalty area after Issa brushed him
with an outstretched arm.
	   Al-Jaber took the penalty, beating South African goalkeeper Hans
Vonk high to the left side.
	   The second call came in the 73rd minute after Issa wrestled with
substitute Ibrahim al-Shahrani for the ball, eventually pulling him
down. Sanchez immediately pointed to the spot, and al-Thyniyan beat
Vonk low, again to the left.
	   Bartlett called the two penalties against Issa disappointing,
but he refused to criticize the calls.
	   ``The performance of the Saudis was surprising for us,'' he
said. ``They had the best counterattack of any team I've seen so
far.''
	   South Africa dominated the match it had to win, putting
consistent pressure on the Saudi defense. Bartlett scored the
second World Cup goal in South African history in the 18th minute,
taking a long clearing pass from Issa while shielding off defender
Fuad Amin and fooling al-Deayea by shooting for the near corner.
	   South Africa pushed for an equalizer near the end, with captain
Lucas Radebe testing al-Deayea on a free kick. Then substitute
Jerry Sikhosana was pulled down in the penalty area in injury time,
and Bartlett blasted a high kick past al-Deayea to tie the game.
	   The match ended a tough World Cup for Olympique Marseilles
defender Issa. He scored an own goal in the opening loss to France
and also had another French goal deflect off him, then was called
for both penalties against Saudi Arabia.

Swedish missionaries released after six months captivity in Russia 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quote from Asayev
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Two young Swedish missionaries taken
hostage in southern Russia in January were released and taken to an
unspecified country, the Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday.
	   Daniel and Paulina Brodin were kidnapped Jan. 8 in Makhachkala,
the center of Russia's Dagestan region. The 22-year-old Brolins,
who are married, were on missionary work as members of Sweden's
Pentecostal Church.
	   Some two months after the kidnapping, a Russian television
network aired a videotape of the couple, who said they were being
held in a mountain village in Chechnya, which borders Dagestan.
	   Church official Lars-Olof Andersson, who took part in efforts to
win the couple's release, said at a news conference that the
Brolins were in good health, considering what they had gone
through.
	   Swedish national police chief Lars Nylen declined to give
details of the release. Chechen officials, including Ali Asayev,
the Chechen presidency's representative in Azerbaijan, also took
part.
	   Asayev told the news conference that the operation was ``risky
... but we succeeded without shooting, by diplomatic means.''
	   The kidnappers had made no public demands, but Sweden's
ambassador to Russia Sven Hirdman said in March that ``we know they
were taken for purely commercial reasons.''
	   Neither the church now the Swedish government paid any ransom,
according to Andersson and Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Annika
Soeder.

France wins Group C; Denmark also through to second round 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: OPTIONAL
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ The president happily listened as the crowds
sang the Marseillaise in unison. In another corner, the Danish
contingent was bouncing back and forth in joy. Everyone was a
winner Wednesday in France's 2-1 defeat of Denmark.
	   Wednesday's Group C results gave the host nation top place and
an easier passage into the next World Cup rounds, while the
Scandinavians also advanced to meet Nigeria on Sunday.
	   Despite the loss, Denmark went through as second qualifier as
Saudi Arabia held South Africa 2-2 in the other group match.
	   ``We're doing well and we're going to get better,'' said French
coach Aime Jacquet after France clinched its third win in a row,
this time with a slew of players more used to being substitute.
	   ``We lost, but we can move on,'' said a relieved Danish coach Bo
Johansson.
	   The crowd at the 44,000-capacity Stade de Gerland sang the
Marseillaise and France's first fan, President Jacques Chirac, was
all smiles. ``I'll be there again (for France) at the final,'' he
said.
	   Playmaker Youri Djorkaeff converted a penalty in the 12th minute
after a smooth move from defender Vincent Candela found David
Trezeguet, who was floored by Jes Hogh. Peter Schmeichel, earning a
Danish record 103rd cap, got a hand on the penalty but could not
push it out.
	   Against the run of play, Denmark equalized in the 42nd minute
when two French defensive flaws also earned it a spot kick.
	   Patrick Vieira unnecessarily leaned into an opponent just
outside the area and then Brian Laudrup caught the French asleep.
The veteran sent Martin Jorgensen into the penalty area and Candela
cut his legs away in desperation.
	   Michael Laudrup, in his 102nd international, scored his 37th
goal for Denmark. At 34, he will retire after the World Cup.
	   Emmanuel Petit put things right again for France in the 57th
minute, shooting through a maze of legs to beat Schmeichel for the
decisive goal, spoiling the record day for the goalkeeper.
	   ``France was the better team,'' conceded Johansson. ``It was
good that the loss wasn't bigger.''
	   In the last second, French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez had to make
a good save from a freekick by Stig Tofting, earning several kisses
on his bald head from his defenders.
	   ``Even with the substitutions, the confidence was still there
and they kept us on the right road,'' said Jacquet.
	   By the end of the game, Danish fans were cheering ``Saudi,
Saudi,'' knowing the Arab nation had done more than expected by
containing South Africa.
	   France won Group C with a maximum nine points out of three
games. Denmark has four points, South Africa two, and Saudi Arabia
finished last with one point.
	   A Danish loss combined with a big South African win could have
seen the Africans through. A Danish win over France would have
given the Scandinavians first place.
	   Denmark will play Nigeria in Saint-Denis on Sunday and Brazil
looms for the winner of that match in the quarterfinal. France will
face either Spain, Bulgaria or Paraguay in Lens, which is
considered a far easier task.
	   ``We played three good matches, so we deserve to be where we are
now,'' said Jacquet.
	   Only four of France's World Cup starting lineup began
Wednesday's game.
	   Anybody with ideas both would play for a mutually advantageous
goalless draw were quickly proved wrong.
	   France, without a slew of regular starters to avoid suspensions
in the second round, piled on the pressure from the start and had
to wait only a dozen minutes to be rewarded with the penalty goal.
	   With star playmaker Zinedine Zidane serving the first game of a
two-match suspension for kicking an opponent, it was the start
Jacquet had dreamed of. Hometown hero Djorkaeff took over Zidane's
playmaking role with poise and efficiency for most of the match.
	   France had well over a dozen chances, continuing its attractive
brand of soccer that has delighted the home crowds during the first
two weeks of the World Cup.
	   Denmark did find some holes in the reworked French defense, with
Brian Laudrup using his speed on the right to outpace Candela and
testing Barthez with two shots, the last of which needed a
brilliant reaction save from 10 meters.
	   In the second half, France continued to pressure, and Djorkaeff
almost volleyed home a deep pass from Petit, but again Schmeichel
was up to the task.
	   Petit put some distance between the teams in the 57th minute.
	   Even though the game never got nasty, Italian referee Pierluigi
Collina did show four yellow cards in the second half, to Vieira
and Bernard Diomede for France and Soren Colding and Tofting for
Denmark.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Christian Karembeu, Marcel Desailly,
Frank Leboeuf, Vincent Candela; Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires
(Thierry Henry, 72nd), Emmanuel Petit (Alain Boghossian, 65th);
Youri Djorkaeff, David Trezeguet (Stephane Guivarc'h, 86th),
Bernard Diomede.
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel; Jacob Laursen (Soren Colding, 46th),
Marc Rieper, Jes Hogh, Jan Heintze; Martin Jorgensen (Ebbe Sand,
55th), Thomas Helveg, Allan Nielsen, Michael Schjonberg; Michael
Laudrup, Brian Laudrup (Stig Tofting, 75th).
	   Referee _ Pierluigi Collina, Italy.

Pustovoitenko forecasts no `financial catastrophes' in Ukraine

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko warned
Wednesday that Ukraine's financial situation was becoming critical
but expressed hope that the country could avert economic
catastrophe by careful decision-making.
	   Pustovoitenko said the budget was being drained by the huge
funds needed to service Ukraine's foreign debt and to redeem
domestic bonds. The budget is also hundreds of millions of hryvna
(dollars) short in planned privatization and tax revenues, he said.
	   ``Today we are at a critical mark,'' Pustovoitenko told a news
conference. ``As never before, we need political stability ... and
have to avoid careless decisions.''
	   Ukraine's attempts at market reforms have long been stalled, in
part by obstruction from the largely hard-line parliament. The new
legislature, elected in late March and dominated by the leftist and
centrist opposition, has been paralyzed since May by infighting and
repeated failures to elect a speaker.
	   Pustovoitenko accused parliament of trying to win political
capital this month by appeasing Ukraine's striking miners with 600
million hryvna (dlrs 300 million) allocated to support the
struggling coal industry.
	   State coffers simply don't have the money, Pustovoitenko said.
	   Despite his grim observations, Pustovoitenko said his Cabinet
``considers that there would be no financial catastrophes'' in
Ukraine at least until the end of 1998.
	   He said the Cabinet was devising various steps to fight the
current economic crisis, trying to control spending, attract
foreign and domestic investments, speed up privatization and widen
taxation so as to crack down on tax evaders, part of Ukraine's
omnipresent shadow economy.
	   Turning to Ukraine's privatization program, Pustovoitenko again
called for a careful approach. He said that ``objects practically
are not privatized, and if they are, they are privatized for
nothing'' and end up in the hands of shadow dealers seeking to
resell them.
	   ``We shall not stop the privatization process,'' Pustovoitenko
said. ``But we would like to see budget revenues and real owners.''
	   He said that if parliament could not end its paralysis by
electing a speaker, he would encourage President Leonid Kuchma to
push through economic reforms by decree.

World Cup: Croatian defender injured, team holds rare secret practice defender now sidelined, coach says Boban certain against Argentina. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Bilic restored to lineup but another
By TONY CZUCZKA

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatia's buildup for its game against
Argentina intensified Wednesday with the team's first secret
practice at the World Cup, but the Croats lost one of their most
experienced defenders due to injury.
	   Coach Miroslav Blazevic said it was the first time in more than
four years of directing the team that he barred the media from a
training session _ because he wanted to practice moves for Friday's
game at Bordeaux.
	   But Igor Stimac of England's Derby County, arguably Croatia's
toughest defender, dropped out with blisters on both heels from
Saturday's 1-0 victory over Japan.
	   Silvio Maric, who normally plays midfield at Croatia Zagreb,
will replace Stimac against Argentina, Blazevic said.
	   Earlier, the coach said right back Slaven Bilic would be
sidelined with a nagging groin strain, but after the practice he
said the Everton defender was fit to play.
	   Two-time world champion Argentina and World Cup newcomer Croatia
have both qualified for the second round after beating Japan and
Jamaica. Friday's game will decide the Group H winner, thus
determining the two teams' next opponent.
	   ``We will play better than against Jamaica and Japan,''
goalkeeper Drazen Ladic said. ``We want to finish first in the
group.''
	   Croatian playmaker Zvonimir Boban will return to the lineup
after sitting out Saturday's hard-won victory over Japan with a
pulled leg muscle, Blazevic said.
	   Wednesday's practice, in which Blazevic apparently wanted to
rehearse set pieces, was the last before the Croatians head west to
Bordeaux in their chartered plane Thursday for the duel with
Argentina.

Norwegian prime minister says his coalition has changed politics 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ After surviving seven months with a minority
coalition government many believed was doomed from the start,
Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik on Wednesday said he
has changed Norwegian politics for good.
	   Bondevik formed a government of three moderate parties in
October, challenging the traditional Norwegian political division
of the social-democratic left against the Conservative-led right.
	   ``The center has established itself as the third weight in the
political system, and there has been a clear break in the old
two-bloc way of thinking,'' Bondevik, a Christian Democrat, said at
news conference marking the end of the spring parliamentary
session.
	   The government has just 42 seats in the 165-member parliament,
and has managed to stay in power by alternating support from the
right and the left. Last week, it survived a vote of confidence
when two right wing parties backed it.
	   For most of the postwar period, Norway's largest party, social
democratic Labor with 65 seats, has led the country and built up
its cradle-to-grace welfare states. When other parties have formed
governments, they were usually led by the Conservatives.
	   But after a disappointing national election, Labor Party leader
Thorbjoern Jagland and his government stepped down in October. That
opened for the three-party center coalition of the Christian
Democrats, the Center Party and the Liberals to make a bid for
power without including the Conservatives.
	   With strong political differences and little support in
parliament, it was widely believed that the coalition would be
short-lived.
	   ``A year ago, we heard that all the talk of a possible centrist
government was wishful thinking. If it was established, it would
only last a few weeks,'' Bondevik recalled.
	   ``But now the government is formed, and has survived the first
parliamentary period and won support for a number of major
proposals,'' he said. ``That, of course, irritates our political
opponents and the commentators that believed a centrist government
was stillborn.''
	   Bondevik acknowledged giving in to the parliamentary majority in
a number of cases, but claimed he never went beyond the coalition's
joint platform.
	   And he said success in drawing support from both sides could
open the way for centrist rule until next parliamentary elections
in 2001.
	   ``The best illustration of our independence from the traditional
blocs is that the Labor Party accuses the government of going too
far to the right, while the Conservatives criticize us for going
too far to the left,'' said Bondevik.

Last-minute haggle delays OPEC deal on production cuts AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS to show meeting delayed by at least one day
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers ended up haggling late
Wednesday over how much oil to remove from the glutted market,
after some expressed reservations about the credibility of a deal
to cut 1.4 million barrels a day, sources said.
	   The last-minute dispute forced OPEC to delay the start of its
formal summer meeting at least until Thursday, an OPEC spokesman
said.
	   The 11 OPEC nations held informal but critical talks on the
supply problem that recently pushed prices of crude to 12-year lows
and stirred some concerns about a possible repeat of the disasters
that struck the global oil industry in 1986.
	   After a session Wednesday afternoon, Saudi Arabia's oil
minister, Ali Naimi, said the group had reached a deal, and various
OPEC sources said the production cuts would come to 1.4 million
barrels a day.
	   OPEC was soon back behind closed doors, however, discussing
concerns about how much crude oil Iran would actually take off the
market, according to a Venezuelan OPEC source who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``There is no agreement yet, but we are looking at the
numbers,'' the Venezuelan said.
	   Some of the OPEC ministers were apparently hoping to find out
whether Iran will actually cut the 190,000 barrels a day that was
part of the 1.4 million-barrel deal.
	   Outside analysts have said Iran angered others in OPEC during an
earlier round of output cuts in the spring, by arguing that its
first round of cuts would come from an unfilled production quota,
meaning no cut at all.
	   Traders appeared unsure about whether OPEC was doing enough.
Prices rose modestly on news that OPEC had reached an agreement but
soon reversed into negative territory as some of the details
started flashing on trading screens.
	   Brent crude oil to be delivered in August was down 9 cents at
dlrs 13.83 per barrel by late afternoon on London's International
Petroleum Exchange, giving up gains of more than 30 cents that had
pushed Brent above dlrs 14 per barrel earlier in the day.
	   After the ministers met privately in the early afternoon, Saudi
Arabia's oil minister, Ali Naimi, first announced that a deal had
been done, saying he was ``very happy'' although he would not
provide any immediate details.
	   OPEC delegates said 1.4 million barrels in production cuts would
be led by the Saudis, who are chopping 425,000 barrels a day from
their production beginning on July 1. Venezuela has promised to cut
325,000 barrels a day, followed by Iran's pledge to restrain output
by 190,000 barrels daily.
	   Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria each pledged to cut
production by 100,000 barrels daily, with smaller cuts coming in
from smaller OPEC members, delegates said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Analysts have cautioned that OPEC needs to show that it can
deliver more than just promises. Even though the producers found
themselves in serious economic trouble by flooding the market this
winter and spring, they have had persistent problems sticking to
any production agreements in recent years.

Security Council hears evidence of Iraqi nerve gas weapons further tests in France, Switzerland 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
Eds: UPDATES with Butler saying findings ``unambiguous;'' CONFIRMS
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector told the
Security Council on Wednesday that findings by a U.S. Army
laboratory showed `there is no doubt'' that Iraq placed deadly VX
nerve gas in missile warheads.
	   Richard Butler said he would sending the missile shards to
laboratories in France and Switzerland for further analysis, as
Iraq has demanded. But he said the tests were conducted by one of
the world's premier chemical weapons laboratories.
	   ``I explained to the council that that is very serious because
Iraq has always insisted it never weaponized VX,'' Butler said.
``These findings show they did ... put it in weapons' warheads.''
	   Although Butler agreed to further testing, he was confident the
findings would be the same.
	   ``I made clear there is no doubt'' that ``VX was present in some
of those weapons warheads,'' he said. ``These degredation products
could be from no other substance. These are unique products. They
were of VX, they were found in a munition, namely a missile
warhead. That's weaponization.''

American Jan-Michael Gambill win in five sets _ in three days AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ It took Jan-Michael Gambill three days
_ and 11 match points _ to get a result at Wimbledon.
	   At least he got a good one.
	   Billed as one of the rising stars of American tennis, Gambill
won his first-round match Wednesday over Sjeng Schalken of the
Netherlands.
	   Playing his first Wimbledon, Gambill was up 2-1 when darkness
ended play Monday. Rain ended it Tuesday at two sets each with
Schalken up 1-0 in the fifth.
	   On Wednesday _ under sunny skies _ he prevailed 7-6 (7-6), 6-4,
6-7 (7-5), 4-6, 8-6.
	   ``This is my first five-set match in the first place,'' said the
Spokane, Washington, native. ``And I've never had a match that's
lasted three days.''
	   Reporters kidded the young American about his hometown in rural
eastern Washington where there's plenty of grass _ but no
grass-court tennis.
	   ``We have a lot of grass at our house, we could easily make
one,'' he said. ``We have plenty of space _ but the winters would
kill it.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ONE MORE TIME: &LR;  She came back for one last Wimbledon, but for
Helena Sukova it was a year too far.
	   The 33-year-old Czech, ranked No. 4 in the world in 1985 but now
languishing at 102, retired from singles competition at January's
Australian Open. But she couldn't resist one more outing at the All
England Club.
	   It was going all right as she led No. 13 seed Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland by a set and 3-1, but it went all wrong when rain
halted play on Tuesday evening. When play resumed Wednesday,
Schnyder rallied to win 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.
	   ``It's very disappointing,'' said Sukova, her voice little more
than a whisper. ``I was hoping for more than this, much more.''
	   Sukova has competed at Wimbledon every year since 1982, equaling
the 17 appearances of Chris Evert and Virginia Wade but still five
short of Martina Navratilova's 22. Her outstanding memory?
	   ``That I never passed the quarters,'' she responded.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WOODIES: &LR;  The Australian doubles duo of Mark Woodforde and Todd
Woodbridge can break a Wimbledon record that's been around for 97
years.
	   If they win their sixth straight this year they will surpass the
five straight won by Britain's Laurie and Reggie Doherty between
1897 and 1901
	   Curiously, the Woodies are only seeded No. 2 behind Jacco
Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands.
	   The Doherty brothers won eight overall. The Woodies will have to
play a few more years to surpass that.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   STEFFI COMEBACK: &LR;  Seven-time Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf has
made comebacks before, but this one _ trying to come back from a
year off with knee surgery and injuries _ is much different.
	   ``I had breaks (before) but they were usually for a couple of
weeks,'' Graf said. ``That is a big difference. (I) haven't played
many tournaments and really haven't been getting in the rhythm of
playing matches.
	   ``That is definitely the hardest task.''
	   Graf was guarded _ she almost seemed frightened _ when she
talked about her chance of winning here again. ``Right now I'm
looking to the second match, that's all.''
	   But she smiled when the talk turned to rehabilitation.
	   ``We have been making fun about it,'' she said. ``Sometimes it's
nice to get certain treatments, but not every day.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO COLOR: &LR;  Goran Ivanisevic, seeded No. 14, on Wednesday
lamented the lack of colorful characters in the men's game.
	   ``Bad boy, good boy, I enjoy who I am,'' he said. ``I don't
think you have any more personalities in tennis. It's finished, and
I enjoy who I am and where I am.''
	   Ivanisevic, breaking a recent slump, defeated Grant Stafford
Wednesday in the first round 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``I have to prove to somebody that I can be good again,''
Ivanisevic said. ``In the top five, where I belong.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: &LR;  Six-time Wimbledon champion Billie Jean King
thinks the women's game has never been better. But Steffi Graf
disagrees.
	   ``I think that there is more depth in it,'' she admitted. ``But
I do not think it really is that much stronger. I do not really
feel that, no.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   COURIER OUT: &LR;  Former world No. 1 Jim Courier fell in the first
round for the third straight year. Thomas Johansson of Sweden beat
the American 6-4, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.

UNITED NATIONS: That's weaponization.'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   The allegation was among the most serious raised against Iraq by
the U.N. Special Commission, which has conducted weapons
inspections in Iraq since 1991.
	   U.N. inspectors must verify whether Iraq has destroyed all
long-range missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
before the council will lift economic sanctions imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   Iraq has admitted having maintained VX supplies but claims it
was never able to develop the technology to place the deadly nerve
agents in a weapons system.
	   If the findings are true, they could undermine efforts by
Russia, France and China to close the seven-year inspection program
and lift the sanctions.
	   French Ambassador Alain Dejammet, one of the strongest critics
of the inspection program within the 15-member council, said that
if the European laboratories uphold the findings ``it would be a
matter to be discussed very seriously.''

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel began unearthing the bodies of
some 40 Shiite Muslim guerrillas Wednesday it plans to swap for the
remains of a single Israeli soldier in the largest prisoner
exchange with Lebanon in two years.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said the swap was scheduled to take place
Thursday at 8:00pm (17:00gmt). A plane carrying the body of Sgt.
1st Class Itamar Ilya was to arrive in Israel from Beirut, Lebanon
and then return to Lebanon with the bodies of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas.
	   A second stage of the swap, brokered by the International
Committee of the Red Cross, was to take place Friday, Channel 2
reported. Israel would hand over an addition 16 Lebanese prisoners
held in Israeli jails and 50 more would be freed from a prison in
south Lebanon.
	   At a military cemetery in northern Israel, workers and soldiers
lifted wooden coffins out of the ground which hold the remains of
the guerrillas killed during fighting with Israel.
	   Israel's army radio said members of a special rabbinical
military unit went to the scene of the exhumations.
	   The 21-year-old Israeli soldier died in a raid last September in
south Lebanon along with 11 other Israelis. Ilya's body was the
only one not recovered after the raid, according to Israel. In the
raid's aftermath, guerrilla groups in lebanon displayed body parts
and captured equipment.
	   Large-scale swaps have taken place previously, with the last one
two years ago.
	   In July 1996, Israel freed 45 Hezbollah prisoners and returned
the bodies of 123 guerrillas in exchange for the remains of two
Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon 10 years ago.
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israel and its allied
militia out of a buffer zone Israel set up in 1985 in southern
Lebanon to prevent cross-border raids. Israel has said it wants to
withdraw, but only if the security of its northern border can be
guaranteed by Lebanon.

France wins Group C; Denmark also through to second round 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: OPTIONAL, changes ``Danish'' to ``Denmark'' in 5th paragraph
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ The president happily listened as the crowds
sang the Marseillaise in unison. In another corner, the Danish
contingent was bouncing back and forth in joy. Everyone was a
winner Wednesday in France's 2-1 defeat of Denmark.
	   Wednesday's Group C results gave the host nation top place and
an easier passage into the next World Cup rounds, while the
Scandinavians also advanced to meet Nigeria on Sunday.
	   Despite the loss, Denmark went through as second qualifier as
Saudi Arabia held South Africa 2-2 in the other group match.
	   ``We're doing well and we're going to get better,'' said French
coach Aime Jacquet after France clinched its third win in a row,
this time with a slew of players more used to being substitute.
	   ``We lost, but we can move on,'' said relieved Denmark coach Bo
Johansson.
	   The crowd at the 44,000-capacity Stade de Gerland sang the
Marseillaise and France's first fan, President Jacques Chirac, was
all smiles. ``I'll be there again (for France) at the final,'' he
said.
	   Playmaker Youri Djorkaeff converted a penalty in the 12th minute
after a smooth move from defender Vincent Candela found David
Trezeguet, who was floored by Jes Hogh. Peter Schmeichel, earning a
Danish record 103rd cap, got a hand on the penalty but could not
push it out.
	   Against the run of play, Denmark equalized in the 42nd minute
when two French defensive flaws also earned it a spot kick.
	   Patrick Vieira unnecessarily leaned into an opponent just
outside the area and then Brian Laudrup caught the French asleep.
The veteran sent Martin Jorgensen into the penalty area and Candela
cut his legs away in desperation.
	   Michael Laudrup, in his 102nd international, scored his 37th
goal for Denmark. At 34, he will retire after the World Cup.
	   Emmanuel Petit put things right again for France in the 57th
minute, shooting through a maze of legs to beat Schmeichel for the
decisive goal, spoiling the record day for the goalkeeper.
	   ``France was the better team,'' conceded Johansson. ``It was
good that the loss wasn't bigger.''
	   In the last second, French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez had to make
a good save from a freekick by Stig Tofting, earning several kisses
on his bald head from his defenders.
	   ``Even with the substitutions, the confidence was still there
and they kept us on the right road,'' said Jacquet.
	   By the end of the game, Danish fans were cheering ``Saudi,
Saudi,'' knowing the Arab nation had done more than expected by
containing South Africa.
	   France won Group C with a maximum nine points out of three
games. Denmark has four points, South Africa two, and Saudi Arabia
finished last with one point.
	   A Danish loss combined with a big South African win could have
seen the Africans through. A Danish win over France would have
given the Scandinavians first place.
	   Denmark will play Nigeria in Saint-Denis on Sunday and Brazil
looms for the winner of that match in the quarterfinal. France will
face either Spain, Bulgaria or Paraguay in Lens, which is
considered a far easier task.
	   ``We played three good matches, so we deserve to be where we are
now,'' said Jacquet.
	   Only four of France's World Cup starting lineup began
Wednesday's game.
	   Anybody with ideas both would play for a mutually advantageous
goalless draw were quickly proved wrong.
	   France, without a slew of regular starters to avoid suspensions
in the second round, piled on the pressure from the start and had
to wait only a dozen minutes to be rewarded with the penalty goal.
	   With star playmaker Zinedine Zidane serving the first game of a
two-match suspension for kicking an opponent, it was the start
Jacquet had dreamed of. Hometown hero Djorkaeff took over Zidane's
playmaking role with poise and efficiency for most of the match.
	   France had well over a dozen chances, continuing its attractive
brand of soccer that has delighted the home crowds during the first
two weeks of the World Cup.
	   Denmark did find some holes in the reworked French defense, with
Brian Laudrup using his speed on the right to outpace Candela and
testing Barthez with two shots, the last of which needed a
brilliant reaction save from 10 meters.
	   In the second half, France continued to pressure, and Djorkaeff
almost volleyed home a deep pass from Petit, but again Schmeichel
was up to the task.
	   Petit put some distance between the teams in the 57th minute.
	   Even though the game never got nasty, Italian referee Pierluigi
Collina did show four yellow cards in the second half, to Vieira
and Bernard Diomede for France and Soren Colding and Tofting for
Denmark.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Christian Karembeu, Marcel Desailly,
Frank Leboeuf, Vincent Candela; Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires
(Thierry Henry, 72nd), Emmanuel Petit (Alain Boghossian, 65th);
Youri Djorkaeff, David Trezeguet (Stephane Guivarc'h, 86th),
Bernard Diomede.
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel; Jacob Laursen (Soren Colding, 46th),
Marc Rieper, Jes Hogh, Jan Heintze; Martin Jorgensen (Ebbe Sand,
55th), Thomas Helveg, Allan Nielsen, Michael Schjonberg; Michael
Laudrup, Brian Laudrup (Stig Tofting, 75th).
	   Referee _ Pierluigi Collina, Italy.

Facts about Guinea-Bissau 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Guinea-Bissau
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Key facts about Guinea-Bissau, the West African nation torn by a
military rebellion:
	   ___
	   LAND: A country on Africa's western tip, bordered by Senegal and
Republic of Guinea. It is 13,948 square miles (36,125 square
kilometers), about the size of Israel. Most of the country is
low-lying swamps, rain forests and mangrove-covered wetlands, with
about 25 islands off the coast.
	   PEOPLE: About 1 million made up of the Fulani, Balante, Mandyako
and Mandingo groups. Portuguese and Crioulo, a melange of
Portuguese, French and African tongues, are the most widely spoken
languages.
	   HISTORY: A former Portuguese slave-trading colony, Guinea-Bissau
fought an independence war lasting more than a decade, resulting in
Portugal's withdrawal in October 1974.
	   POLITICS: Since the colonial powers pulled up stakes, the ruling
African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde
has struggled to find stability, eventually abandoning its Marxist
ideology. President Joao Bernardo Vieira headed a 1980 coup that
deposed Luis Cabral, president since 1974.
	   BEHIND THE FIGHTING: Former Brig. Ansumane Mane led an uprising
on June 7, after being removed as army chief of staff for alleged
involvement in an arms smuggling scheme. Mane claims he was being
scapegoated after Guinea-Bissau was accused of aiding a separatist
guerrilla movement in neighboring Senegal. Senegalese and Republic
of Guinea forces have sided with Guinea-Bissau's government in the
fight. The most serious fighting has occurred in the capital, where
an unknown number of civilians and combatants have been killed.

Questionable penalties help knock out another underdog developments, changes byline; WILL be UPDATED with late games. 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: NEW throughout with Wednesday's early games, other
By SLOBODAN LEKIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Once again, questionable calls by a referee helped
knock out a World Cup outsider from the second round of the
tournament.
	   Saudi Arabia and South Africa drew 2-2 Wednesday, after Chilean
referee Mario Sanchez awarded the Saudis two penalties in
situations that appeared dubious at best.
	   Underdogs from Africa, the Middle East and Asia frequently
complain that established soccer powers have the inside track in
when it comes to refereeing, and poor officiating has been a
contentious issue since the start of the current tournament. But in
the last two days it appears to have unduly influenced which teams
will play in the knockout rounds.
	   Still, an official of world soccer's governing body said that
the federation remained pleased with the overall level of
refereeing in the tournament.
	   ``The standard remains very, very high,'' FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper said Wednesday, when the other matches were Nigeria-Paraguay
and Spain-Bulgaria in Group D.
	   Wednesday's tie, after the Shaun Bartlett had established an
early lead for the Africans, killed their chances of challenging
Denmark for the second-place slot in Group C.
	   ``It was a nice show by our players, but ... I was expecting a
better result,'' said South African coach Philippe Troussier.
	   In the group's other match, France beat the Danes 2-1 to emerge
from the initial round with three straight wins and Denmark got
through as Group C runner up.
	   At Bordeaux, with the Bafana Bafana leading 1-0, Sanchez awarded
a spot kick to Saudi Arabia, ruling that defender Pierre Issa had
fouled Youssef al-Thyniyan inside the box. Replays from three
different angles showed no contact between the two players before
al-Thyniyan theatrically crashed to the ground.
	   In the second half, a shoving match between Issa and Ibrahim
al-Shahrani _ initiated outside the South African box by the Saudi
forward _ was sanctioned as a penalty as the two men struggled
across the line.
	   The game ended on a third penalty, this time for South Africa in
injury time and Bartlett scored his second of the game.
	   In Cameroon, angry soccer fans attacked white-owned businesses
to protest what they said was a racist plot by FIFA to prevent
African teams from advancing.
	   The riots came a day after the national team was eliminated when
the Hungarian referee disallowed a second-half goal that would have
given Cameroon the lead in its match with Chile. A victory would
have propelled the West Africans into the next round.
	   Cameroon government officials blamed FIFA for the officiating
and said the country had lodged an official protest.
	   ``What we saw is not a World Cup competition. It has been a
festival of scandal,'' Cameroon's Youth and Sports Minister Joseph
Owona was quoted as saying by the African Nation newspaper. ``It
was not the round ball that eliminated us.''
	   Also Tuesday, Morocco was prevented from advancing despite a 3-0
win over Scotland, after the American referee of the parallel match
between Brazil and Norway gave the Norwegians a last-minute penalty
in a situation where replays indicated little contact.
	   In the France-Denmark match, the Danes appeared happier with
their defeat than the French did with their victory.
	   ``We're doing well and we're going to get better,'' said French
coach Aime Jacquet.
	   ``We lost, but we can move on,'' said a relieved Danish coach Bo
Johansson as players laughed and cheered after clinching a berth as
the Group's second qualifier.
	   French playmaker Youri Djorkaeff scored from a penalty early in
the game, after defender Jes Hogh brought down David Trezeguet in
the area.
	   Michael Laudrup equalized late in the first half from a spot
kick after Martin Jorgensen was tripped by Vincent Candela. But
Emmanuel Petit scored the decisive goal for France in the 57th
minute, sending a rasping shot through a maze of legs and into the
net.
	   Meanwhile, French authorities fighting World Cup violence placed
two Germans under formal investigation Wednesday, a step shy of
charging them with beating a police officer into a coma in northern
France.
	   The move stems from a clash after Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia
match in Lens. Three other hooligans were given one-year jail
terms. The policeman remained hospitalized in Lille, where doctors
said his condition was stable.
	   In Toulouse, an English fan stabbed in the stomach and lungs by
a local attacker was improving Wednesday after being reported in
``very serious condition'' a day earlier.

World Cup: Refs become focus of tournament controversies AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS details from protests in Yaounde, 8th and 9th grafs
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ At a World Cup full of scoring and spectacle, the
spotlight has fallen on the one place few want it _ the referees.
	   Since the start, when a hotly debated handball penalty helped
Italy tie Chile, through a series of borderline calls, a rash of
expulsions and even a tongue-lashing from soccer's world boss, the
referees have been unusually prevalent in the outcome of matches
and as the target of irate fans.
	   One African government minister said Wednesday that poor
officiating was part of a racist World Cup plot and called the
tournament a ``festival of scandal.'' Fans there attacked vehicles
and businesses owned by white expatriates.
	   While soccer's world body said it was pleased with the overall
level of officiating, the referees' high visibility was never more
evident than on Tuesday, when a pair of questionable whistles
helped send two teams to the second round and two others home.
	   In Nantes, Hungary's Laszlo Vagner nullified a goal by Francois
Omam Biyick that would have put Cameroon ahead of Chile 2-1,
calling teammate Patrick Mboma for pushing off a defender. Replays
showed contact but no clear foul.
	   The resulting 1-1 tie, coupled with Italy's 2-1 victory over
Austria, meant Chile advanced and Cameroon was out.
	   ``We can't really accept this unfair decision,'' defender
Salomon Olembe said. ``The referee will not be welcome in Cameroon
if he wanted to spend a holiday there.''
	   The Cameroon capital of Yaounde was the scene Wednesday of
attacks by black fans on white-owned businesses in retaliation for
what they saw as anti-African soccer bias.
	   ``What we saw is not a World Cup competition. It has been a
festival of scandal,'' Youth and Sports Minister Joseph Owona was
quoted as saying by the African Nation newspaper. ``It was not the
round ball that eliminated us.''
	   Later Tuesday, in Marseille, Norway beat Brazil 2-1 on a penalty
shot by Kjetil Rekdal with a minute left after referee Esse
Baharmast of the United States called a foul on Junior Baiano.
Again, replays indicated little contact.
	   ``I don't really know what happened there,'' Brazil coach Mario
Zagallo said. ``The referee is FIFA's problem, not Brazil's
problem.''
	   That victory moved Norway into Round 2 instead of Morocco, which
had just finished beating Scotland 3-0 when the pivotal foul was
called.
	   ``We trained for this for three years. To lose this way is more
than disappointing, it's, it's ... ,'' Rachid Azzouzi said, shaking
his head and looking at the ground.
	   Coach Claude Le Roy of Cameroon called on FIFA to do something
about what he said was ``incompetent'' officiating. The questions
continued Wednesday when penalty kicks provided five of the seven
goals in France's 2-1 victory over Denmark and a 2-2 tie between
Saudi Arabia and South Africa.
	   FIFA said that the cases were being treated in routine fashion
and that no discipline or other actions were planned.
	   Federation spokesman Keith Cooper said no team had officially
complained about the refereeing. He also said that any suggestions
that the referees' calls were intended to influence the
second-round makeup were ``absolutely pointless.''
	   ``Decisions were taken during the course of the match by the
referees in good faith, according to the situations as they
interpreted them in the game, totally regardless of what might be
happening elsewhere, of which they were absolutely, totally
unaware,'' Cooper said.
	   The spokesman said FIFA president Sepp Blatter had no plans to
speak with referee coordinator David Will about Tuesday's games and
refused to say how the calls might effect selection of officials
for the second round and later.
	   While soccer's 16th world championship has been marked by lots
of offense and the colorful, circus-like atmosphere that French
style brings to big events, FIFA has spent an inordinate amount of
time dealing with officiating questions, a stark change from four
years ago when the referees were given credit for letting the
players play.
	   Italy managed a 2-2 tie with Chile in its opener only because of
a penalty shot awarded when referee Lucian Bouchardeau of Niger
called a handball when a pass hit Ronald Fuentes' right arm as it
hung at his side.
	   When just four red cards were handed out in the first 20 games,
Blatter publicly criticized the refs for being too soft and
jeopardizing the crackdown on dangerous tackles from behind.
	   The message was heard clearly and quickly. The next day, five
red cards were flashed, including one that cost the home team it's
star striker, Zihedine Zidane, until the quarterfinals _ if France
gets that far.
	   Going into Wednesday's games, there had been 16 red cards. Two
games have ended with a team two players down, including Cameroon
in the match against Chile.
	   Blatter was blasted by players and coaches who said he forced
the referees' hand, and Le Roy again criticized the FIFA president
after the later controversies.
	   ``If this is what football is all about, I hope Mr. Blatter was
watching,'' he said. ``Perhaps he should stick to administrative
tasks.''
	   Blatter was unavailable for comment, but Cooper said FIFA was
generally pleased with the refs' work.
	   ``The standard remains very, very high,'' he said. ``If there
were two errors in all those games, and I'm not saying they were
errors, that is a very, very low error rate.''

World Cup: Norway's coach hopes to postpone farewell speech again AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ Norwegian coach Egil ``Drillo''
Olsen hopes to postpone his farewell speech at least one more time.
	   After beating Brazil 2-1 and extending its unbeaten streak to
three games against the world champions, Norway faces Italy next in
Marseille on Saturday as the tournament enters the knockout phase.
	   Trailing 1-0 late in the game they had to win to advance, Olsen
started thinking about a farewell speech late Tuesday night.
	   The coach will retire after the World Cup and has been linked to
the vacant manager's job at Glasgow Celtic.
	   As it turned out, Olsen didn't have to worry about that speech.
	   Striker Tore Andre Flo equalized for Norway with seven minutes
left in the game at Marseille's Stade Velodrome.
	   Midfielder Kjetil Rekdal, who scored Norway's only goal in the
'94 Cup, got the clincher on a penalty with one minute left after
Flo was brought down inside the area by defender Junior Baiano.
	   After Wednesday's light training session at Stade Carcassone in
Aix-en-Provence north of Marseille, Olsen said the penalty, called
by American referee Esse Baharmast, was ``crystal clear''.
	   ``There's no doubt about it,'' Olsen said. ``I had a perfect
view. Junior Baiano grabbed Tore Andre's jersey, but let it go when
the ball came. We're thankful that the referee saw the holding and
whistled.''
	   Flo agreed.
	   ``He pulled my jersey,'' the tall striker said. ``I'm certain
that it was a correct call. I saw the video reply but it doesn't
show what really happened. It only shows when he lets the jersey
go.''
	   Olsen has not seen Italy in action during the tournament, but
plans to spend much of Thursday analyzing the team on video.
	   Four years ago, Norway lost 1-0 to Italy in the first round.
Norway, which has four players remaining from that team, didn't
make the second round. Italy went on to reach the final, losing to
Brazil.
	   In their only previous meeting in the World Cup, Norway lost to
Italy 2-1 in 1938 at Marseille's Stade Velodrome, the site of
Norway's first appearance ever in the second round.
	   Norway, ranked fourth in the world by FIFA going into the
tournament, is unbeaten is its last 17 matches but struggled to two
draws against Morocco (2-2) and Scotland (1-1) in the first two
Group A matches.
	   Brazil, winner of the World Cup four times, topped Group A and
will play Chile next in Paris.

Top judge: No pressure from any side on presidential decision 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of Russia's Constitutional Court said
Wednesday that nobody was attempting to sway the court in its
decision on the legality of a third term for President Boris
Yeltsin, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russia's constitution sets a two-term limit for the president.
However, Yeltsin's aides have hinted that the 67-year old leader
may run again, arguing that his first term began during Soviet
times and should not count toward the two-term limit.
	   Yeltsin has said repeatedly that he won't run. But on Friday, he
seemed to soften his rejection of a third term by saying simply
that the constitution wouldn't allow it.
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, has asked the
Constitutional Court for a ruling, and a decision is expected later
this year.
	   ``There has never been a single telephone call to the
Constitutional Court from either the president or the government''
or the two chambers of parliament, Interfax quoted court chairman
Marat Baglai as saying.
	   He said that the court always made its decisions on the basis of
``objectivity and neutrality,'' Interfax reported.

Precede JERUSALEM Workers to begin unearthing remains for body-and-prisoner swap

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel began Wednesday to unearth the
bodies of some 40 Shiite Muslim guerrillas it plans to swap along
with 66 live prisoners for the remains of a single Israeli soldier
in the largest such exchange with Lebanon in two years.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said the swap was scheduled to take place
Thursday at 8:00pm (17:00gmt). A plane carrying the body of Sgt.
1st Class Itamar Ilya was to arrive in Israel from Beirut, Lebanon
and then return to Lebanon with the bodies of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas.
	   A second stage of the swap, brokered by the International
Committee of the Red Cross, was to take place Friday, Channel 2
reported. Israel would hand over 16 Lebanese prisoners held in
Israeli jails and 50 more would be freed from a prison in south
Lebanon.
	   At a military cemetery in northern Israel, workers and soldiers
lifted wooden coffins out of the ground. Israel's army radio said
members of a special rabbinical military unit were also at the
scene.
	   The 21-year-old Israeli soldier died in a raid last September in
south Lebanon, along with 11 other Israelis. Ilya's body was the
only one not recovered after the raid, according to Israel. In the
raid's aftermath, guerrilla groups in Lebanon displayed his body
parts and captured equipment.
	   Large-scale swaps have taken place previously, with the last one
two years ago.
	   In July 1996, Israel freed 45 Hezbollah prisoners and returned
the bodies of 123 guerrillas in exchange for the remains of two
Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon 10 years ago.
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israel and its allied
militia out of a buffer zone Israel set up in 1985 in southern
Lebanon to prevent cross-border raids. Israel has said it wants to
withdraw, but only if the security of its northern border can be
guaranteed by Lebanon.

UNITED NATIONS: very seriously.'' 
</HEADLINE>

	   The report reinforced the U.S. and British position that Iraq
still has not released enough information on its weapons program to
warrant the lifting of sanctions.
	   ``I think Iraq is conducting its diversion and deception
campaign and it's not working,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson
said as he arrived for the meeting. ``Facts are facts. Iraq has
been deceiving the international community with weaponization of
nerve gas.''
	   The Iraqis, in a statement Tuesday, denied placing VX in
warheads and questioned the scientific basis for the report by the
U.S. Army laboratory in Aberdeen, Maryland.
	   VX is a colorless, odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it
comes into contact with oxygen. A few drops can kill in minutes.
	   Iraq said further tests should be conducted in a neutral country
_ such as Switzerland _ or in France or Russia. Butler noted that
the Aberdeen lab is certified for chemical weapons testing by the
international Chemical Weapons Convention.
	   Unless Iraq provides more information on its VX program, the
report could trigger another crisis similar to the one over access
by U.N. inspectors to presidential palaces.
	   That crisis was defused by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who won
international acclaim in February for striking a deal with the
Iraqis to open the Iraqi sites and avert U.S.-led airstrikes.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
Annan's senior aides have been pressuring Butler to ease up on the
Iraqis so the inspection program can be brought to an end.
	   Mindful of the impact on his February agreement, Annan said
before the council meeting that he hoped the finding would not
damage U.N. relations with Iraq.
	   ``We are dealing with the Iraqis on a large spectrum of issues
and I hope this particular development will not destroy the
improved relations that has allowed UNSCOM to carry on with its
work,'' Annan said, using the acronym for the U.N. Special
Commission that performs arms inspections.
	   But in a statement published Wednesday in Baghdad, Saddam and
other Iraqi leaders demanded sanctions be lifted immediately. If
not, they warned they would reconsider relations with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The statement did not mention the VX findings, although the
official Iraqi News Agency dismissed them as ``baseless and mere
fabrications.''
	   In its statement Tuesday, Iraq's U.N. mission said that Baghdad
rejects the results, adding they ``cannot be accurate since VX was
not used in any kind of munitions in Iraq due to continuous
production failure.''
	   The Iraqis said the samples were too small to be conclusive and
``finding a trace of a stabilizer in one sample out of seven
analyzed is not evidence because, if VX was used, a stabilizer
would have been found in every sample.''

World Cup: Italian coach expects tough match against Norway 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ A team which defeated world champion
Brazil twice in one year deserves a lot of respect.
	   And Italy will have plenty of it when it plays Norway in the
World Cup second-round at Marseille Saturday.
	   ``We are prepared to play a tough team, physically very strong.
It's another difficult hurdle to overcome,'' coach Cesare Maldini
said Wednesday at Italy's training camp.
	   Norway, unbeaten in 17 consecutive matches, earned a
second-round berth following a last-minute 2-1 victory against the
Brazilians who still advanced as Group A winners.
	   Norway's other victory against Brazil was a 4-2 in an exhibition
game last year.
	   ``We had been expecting Norway as a possible second-round
opponent, but I must say they struggled to qualify. They play with
a single forward, Andre Flo, but midfielders are quick to come in
support. It's a team we know very well,'' the Italian coach said.
	   Maldini, reviewing Tuesday's 2-1 victory against Austria which
lifted Italy among the last 16, did not join the chorus of Italian
critics who lashed the referee for allowing Austrian defenders an
overly physical play.
	   ``It was not soccer, but wrestling, a manhunt,'' wrote Italy's
largest daily Corriere della Sera in a frontpage comment.
	   Italian star-forward Alessandro Del Piero was especially
targeted by the opponents at St. Denis and said after the match he
had been treated like a ball - kicked throughout.
	   ``I never like to speak of the referees and I'll make no
exception today, especially after a victory,'' Maldini said.
	   He lamented the loss of defender Alessandro Nesta, who returned
home with torn knee ligaments but said ``were are not faced with an
emergency in defense.''
	   As Inter Milan veteran sweeper Giuseppe Bergomi replaced Nesta
against Austria there was a single defender - Moreno Torricelli _
left on the substitutes bench.

Next feared clashes: competing German and English toughs Lens police comment; TRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS alcohol ban from Friday morning sted evening; ADDS
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Authorities on Wednesday were fearing a new and
ugly turn in World Cup violence: German toughs battling English
fans for the reputation as Europe's worst hooligans.
	   Violence has shaken and tainted the five-week soccer
championship since it began June 10, with clashes outside stadiums
leaving more than 100 injured, a policeman in a coma and an English
fan in critical condition.
	   French authorities backed by police from the countries in the
Cup have cracked down on the unrest, arresting more than 250 people
and deporting a number of English and German rowdies. But with
about half the World Cup matches played, police fear more violence.
	   The next expected hotspots are the Germany-Iran match in the
southern city of Montpellier on Thursday, and more importantly,
England versus Colombia in the northern city of Lens on Friday.
	   German toughs, like the ones that beat the policeman into a coma
in Lens over the weekend, appear ready to strike there again.
	   This time, German extremists would be there Friday ``to combat
the English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe,''' Le Monde quoted a French intelligence memo to the
Interior Ministry as saying.
	   The ministry had no immediate comment on the newspaper report,
and a Lens spokeswoman, Isabelle Isaert, insisted ``the kids got
the message'' when officials jailed several Germans after Sunday's
rioting. Three were quickly sentenced to a year in prison.
	   But a ministry source privately confirmed the hundreds of police
to be deployed for the match were alerted about the possibility of
German-English clashes.
	   German police have also privately said they were taking the
development seriously. They stepped up checks of France-bound
motorists by boosting their border force from about 200 to more
than 1,000 ahead of the matches Thursday and Friday.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
on Wednesday announced its first World Cup alcohol restrictions for
Friday's match. Officials banned its sale or possession on the
streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As in other matches,
thousands of fans were coming without tickets _ at least 10,000
English on Friday _ raising concerns of more drunken unrest.
	   Most of the dozen German police working in France as
hooligan-spotters were being deployed in Lens, German police said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The police are among 180 officers from the 32 nations in the
World Cup, with the largest contingent of 25 from England helping
look for soccer fans with a track record of violence, Le Monde
said.
	   Authorities were also concerned about more violence by French
North African youths after clashes with English fans in Marseille
two weeks ago.
	   Similar violence erupted Monday after the England-Romania match
in Toulouse, where police arrested a dozen local youths carrying
baseball bats.
	   An English fan was attacked, and remained in intensive care on
Wednesday. The status of Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge,
West Midlands, was ``more reassuring'' Wednesday, a hospital
statement said.
	   President Jacques Chirac on Wednesday evening sought to put in
perspective the unrest by a few hundred toughs at an event drawing
1 million largely sportsmanlike foreigners.
	   ``Even if there were dramatic incidents,'' he told French TV
before the France-Denmark match, ``the incidents were relatively
limited compared to what was feared.''

Next feared clashes: competing German and English toughs Lens police comment; TRIMS

	   PARIS (AP) _ Authorities on Wednesday were fearing a new and
ugly turn in World Cup violence: German toughs battling English
fans for the reputation as Europe's worst hooligans.
	   Violence has shaken and tainted the five-week soccer
championship since it began June 10, with clashes outside stadiums
leaving more than 100 injured, a policeman in a coma and an English
fan in critical condition.
	   French authorities backed by police from the countries in the
Cup have cracked down on the unrest, arresting more than 250 people
and deporting a number of English and German rowdies. But with
about half the World Cup matches played, police fear more violence.
	   The next expected hotspots are the Germany-Iran match in the
southern city of Montpellier on Thursday, and more importantly,
England versus Colombia in the northern city of Lens on Friday.
	   German toughs, like the ones that beat the policeman into a coma
in Lens over the weekend, appear ready to strike there again.
	   This time, German extremists would be there Friday ``to combat
the English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe,''' Le Monde quoted a French intelligence memo to the
Interior Ministry as saying.
	   The ministry had no immediate comment on the newspaper report,
and a Lens spokeswoman, Isabelle Isaert, insisted ``the kids got
the message'' when officials jailed several Germans after Sunday's
rioting. Three were quickly sentenced to a year in prison.
	   But a ministry source privately confirmed the hundreds of police
to be deployed for the match were alerted about the possibility of
German-English clashes.
	   German police have also privately said they were taking the
development seriously. They stepped up checks of France-bound
motorists by boosting their border force from about 200 to more
than 1,000 ahead of the matches Thursday and Friday.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
on Wednesday announced its first World Cup alcohol restrictions for
Friday's match. Officials banned its sale or possession on the
streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As in other matches,
thousands of fans were coming without tickets _ at least 10,000
English on Friday _ raising concerns of more drunken unrest.
	   Most of the dozen German police working in France as
hooligan-spotters were being deployed in Lens, German police said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The police are among 180 officers from the 32 nations in the
World Cup, with the largest contingent of 25 from England helping
look for soccer fans with a track record of violence, Le Monde
said.
	   Authorities were also concerned about more violence by French
North African youths after clashes with English fans in Marseille
two weeks ago.
	   Similar violence erupted Monday after the England-Romania match
in Toulouse, where police arrested a dozen local youths carrying
baseball bats.
	   An English fan was attacked, and remained in intensive care on
Wednesday. The status of Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge,
West Midlands, was ``more reassuring'' Wednesday, a hospital
statement said.
	   President Jacques Chirac on Wednesday evening sought to put in
perspective the unrest by a few hundred toughs at an event drawing
1 million largely sportsmanlike foreigners.
	   ``Even if there were dramatic incidents,'' he told French TV
before the France-Denmark match, ``the incidents were relatively
limited compared to what was feared.''

Welcome back: Capriati plays, and wins, at Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Updates with Seles, Davenport, Korda victories
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ For Jennifer Capriati, playing at
Wimbledon for the first time in five years was a thrill in itself.
Winning was even better.
	   ``It's great to be back here,'' she said. ``It brings back a lot
of good memories. I was really pumped up. I was really excited to
be out there.''
	   Capriati overcame nine foot faults to defeat Australia's Nicole
Pratt 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 Wednesday, her first Grand Slam victory in five
years.
	   Her return to the All England Club came on a day when the men's
field lost No. 4 seed Greg Rusedski, the bullet server who withdrew
because of an injured ankle.
	   Faring far better were Pete Sampras, Petr Korda, Goran
Ivanisevic, Steffi Graf, Monica Seles and Lindsay Davenport, all
advancing in straight sets.
	   This was Capriati's first Wimbledon appearance since reaching
the quarterfinals in 1993. She's played in only five other Grand
Slam events since, losing in the first round each time.
	   In 1991, Capriati became the youngest women's Wimbledon
semifinalist at age 15. But her career plummeted after problems
with drugs and injuries.
	   Capriati became a symbol of what can go wrong when a teen-ager
is consumed by hype and pressure. But the 22-year-old said she now
feels in control of her life.
	   ``Whatever I'm doing it's what I want to be doing,'' she said.
``I just try to be happy off the court as well as on the court,
just keep a balance.''
	   After a succession of aborted comebacks, Capriati's goal is to
return to the tennis elite. In April she was ranked 267. Now she's
up to 151.
	   ``Right now I want it pretty bad,'' she said. ``I'm really
focused and determined to play well. ... I have to believe in
myself. I believe that I can go all the way.''
	   While Capriati was reacquainting herself with Wimbledon,
Rusedski was saying goodbye.
	   Rusedski, a quarterfinalist last year, pulled out before the
resumption of his rain-delayed match with Mark Draper. Rusedski
damaged ligaments in his left ankle in a fall at the Queen's Club
tournament two weeks ago.
	   He was limping Tuesday as he split the first two sets with
Draper and was down a break at 5-4 in the third.
	   The Canadian-born Briton, with the fastest serve in tennis,
practiced in the morning and said he was ready to play. But he
changed his mind a few hours later.
	   ``I thought it would get better,'' he said. ``I thought when it
got warmed up it would get better. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.
... I thought that this year was really my year, but it just wasn't
to be.''
	   Rusedski's withdrawal left No. 12 Tim Henman as Britain's best
hope for its first men's Wimbledon champion since 1936. Henman
advanced with a 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 win over David Nainkin.
	   Sampras, the top seed bidding for his fifth title in six years,
moved into the third round with a 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) victory over
Sweden's Mikhael Tillstrom.
	   Third-seeded Korda won his second straight match in straight
sets, downing Filip Dewulf 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.
	   Graf, seeking her eighth Wimbledon title, won the first eight
games as she powered into the third round with a 6-0, 6-4 victory
over Slovakia's Henrieta Nagyova.
	   The fourth-seeded German, playing her first Grand Slam
tournament since major knee surgery a year ago, cried after her
first-round match Monday. But there were no tears Wednesday.
	   ``It was good to get the first match over, the emotions going,''
she said. ``I feel I've calmed down a little bit since then.''
	   Davenport, the No. 2 seed, advanced to the third round with a
6-1, 7-5 win over Larisa Neiland, avenging a loss to the Latvian
player at Wimbledon two years ago.
	   Seles, No. 6, beat Alexandra Fusai, 6-1, 6-1.
	   No. 5 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated Catalina Cristea 5-7,
6-2, 6-0, while No. 9 Amanda Coetzer was ousted by Naoko Sawamatsu
3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
	   Switzerland's Patty Schnyder, the women's No. 13 seed, won in
three sets over Helena Sukova, a 33-year-old Czech who came out of
retirement to play her 17th straight Wimbledon.
	   Ivanisevic, a two-time Wimbledon finalist who had won only one
match in his last five Grand Slam tournaments, beat Grant Stafford
6-3, 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``I can beat anybody when I play good here, and I can lose to
some serious bad guys,'' said Ivanisevic, the No. 14 seed. ``You
never know with me. ... Not too many people rate me as a favorite
or expect me to do good here. But I feel good. Anything is
possible.''
	   French Open champion Carlos Moya, the No. 5 seed from Spain,
needed five sets to get past India's Mahesh Bhupathi, 6-4, 4-6,
6-4, 2-6, 6-3.
	   No. 15 Karol Kucera became the fourth men's seed eliminated when
he was beaten 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, 6-4 by Vladimir Voltchkov.

Indonesia and IMF reportedly agree on revised budget reached deal on state budget. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Dow Jones Newswires reporting that negotiators
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Negotiators for Indonesia and the
International Monetary Fund agreed Wednesday to a plan that will
allow resumption of a dlrs 43 billion rescue package, Dow Jones
Newswires reported.
	   In a widely expected move, the Indonesian government and the
Washington-based lending agency revised the national budget after
weeks of talks on the paralyzed economy.
	   The deal will allow the IMF to begin disbursing loans again,
probably in early July. The new budget is loaded with subsidies
designed to ease the burden on millions of poor people in a nation
shaken by deadly riots over price increases.
	   IMF loans were suspended in May because of political turmoil
that led to the resignation of President Suharto after 32 years in
power. Indonesia is suffering a year-long economic crisis that has
driven up prices and stripped many people of jobs.
	   The revised budget predicts a deficit of 6 percent which would
largely be covered by international loans, Dow Jones said, citing a
diplomatic source close to the talks.
	   The new budget is heavily weighted with costly subsidies for
fuel, fertilizer and other commodities.
	   It is based on an exchange rate of 10,600 rupiah against the
dollar and an oil price of dlrs 13 per barrel, the source said on
condition of anonymity. The last budget plan, announced in March,
was based on an exchange rate of 6,000 rupiah to the dollar.
	   Since then, the rupiah has plummeted in value, plagued by
political uncertainty. It closed in Jakarta trading Wednesday at
14,825, down from 14,425 the previous day.
	   The budget also predicts the economy will shrink by between 12
and 15 percent this year, according to the source. It forecasts
inflation this year of 80 percent, although the costs of many goods
have already soared.
	   Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's chief economics minister,
was expected to approve the deal in a ceremony Thursday with Hubert
Neiss, the IMF's director for Asia and Pacific affairs.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Aeroflot has taken delivery of its first Boeing
777-200ER jumbo jet.
	   The Russian airline flew the plane to Moscow on Monday. It plans
to use the 291-passenger plane on flights to New York and London,
Boeing said in a news release from Seattle.
	   A Russian crew piloted the jet under the supervision of American
flight instructors in a 10-hour journey from the United States, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The aircraft, an extended-range version of the Boeing widebody,
is being leased from Beverly Hills, Calif.-based International
Lease Finance Corp.
	   Boeing Commercial Airplane Group spokeswoman Anka Dolecki said
Aeroflot is to take delivery of one more 777-200, also leased from
ILFC, later this year. The cost of the leases was not announced.
	   Aeroflot has frequently leased jets from Boeing to replace
planes in its aging fleet.
	   Another Russian carrier, Transaero Airlines, took delivery
Wednesday of the first of two Boeing 737-700 jetliners. Those
planes are being leased from Bavaria International Aircraft Leasing
Co.

US asks for formal apology from Iraq for slur against US official 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States demanded a formal
apology from Iraq on Wednesday for a letter to the United Nations
from an Iraq official who referred to a U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State as a ``known Jew and Zionist.''
	   The letter by Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
was sent to the Security Council last Monday to complain about
Martin Indyk's comments during a media seminar in Washington this
month.
	   During the seminar, Indyk said the U.S. government plans to help
political opponents of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein organize and
coordinate their campaign against him.
	   Indyk said the campaign will emphasize Saddam's ``brutality and
war crimes,'' and the Clinton Administration ``will be going
forward in a visible and effective way.''
	   Responding to those remarks, al-Sahhaf said the U.S. plan would
constitute a violation of international law against a sovereign,
U.N. member state.
	   ``The statements of the United States assistant secretary of
state Martin Indyk, who is a known Jew and Zionist, are simply an
official and documented reaffirmation of the emnity of the United
States administration toward Iraq, which is a founding member of
the United Nations,'' al-Sahhaf said.
	   Indyk was the first Jew to be named U.S. ambassador to Israel.
The British-born diplomat served in that post until last year.
	   The U.S. position is that the comment is offensive regardless of
Indyk's religion.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said he raised the issue in the
Security Council on Wednesday during discussions on findings of a
U.S. laboratory that traces of VX nerve gas was found in Iraqi
missile shards.
	   Iraq denies the finding.
	   ``Today, the United States lodged a formal protest in the
Security Council against ethnic slurs committed by the foreign
minister Iraq against an American official,'' Bill Richardson said.
``We call on the foreign minister of Iraq to apologize for this
dramatically offensive slur.''
	   Richardson said at least five other delegations agreed with the
U.S. protest but he did not identify them.
	   The president of the Security Council, Antonio Monteiro of
Portugal, said he would raise the issue with Iraq's U.N.
ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, later this week.

World Cup: Belgium and South Korea both desperate for win 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Wednesday's practice, CORRECTS de
Wilde's injury to inner thigh, graf 13
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Belgium and South Korea have different reasons for
being desperate.
	   Third in the Group E standings after draws with Mexico and the
Netherlands, Belgium must beat South Korea on Thursday to keep its
second round hopes alive.
	   Though already eliminated from the tournament, South Korea has
its last chance to post its first-ever win in five World Cup
appearances _ and before it co-hosts the 2002 tournament with
Japan.
	   ``We decided when we got here to get one win before we return to
Korea,'' said Kim Pyung-seok, promoted to coach after Cha Bum-kun
was fired after two World Cup losses. ``Thursday is our last
chance.''
	   South Korea opened with a 3-1 defeat to Mexico before losing 5-0
to the Netherlands last Saturday.
	   ``We are hungrier for the win than the Belgians,'' said Kim, who
doesn't plan to seek the permanent coaching job after the World
Cup. ``Certainly we are feeling the pressure of realizing the hopes
of our nation's people.''
	   Belgium's disastrous draw with Mexico last Saturday _ when its
blew a 2-0 lead _ coupled with the Netherlands' victory over South
Korea the same night left Mexico and the Netherlands with four
points apiece in the group. Belgium has two points and the Koreans
have zero.
	   The Dutch face Mexico on Thursday in the other Group E finale.
	   ``This is what the whole World Cup comes down to for us,'' said
Belgium coach Georges Leekens. ``We've recharged our batteries. The
upcoming match is very important because we need three more points.
I don't want to think about the past anymore; I want to keep my
sites on the future.''
	   Both teams will enter the final showdown short-handed.
	   South Korea is again without star striker Hwang Sun-hong, one of
the nation's most prolific scorers with 43 goals in 74
international matches. Hwang suffered a knee injury just prior to
the tournament after being tackled in an exhibition match against
China.
	   Belgium is without winger Danny Boffin, out with a knee injury.
First-choice goalkeeper Filip De Wilde and team captain Franky Van
der Elst are also uncertain.
	   De Wilde has a painful inner thigh. ``Every time he goes up for
a high cross, he doesn't feel good,'' Leekens said.
	   The coach said Van der Elst has been unwell since playing
against Mexico in temperatures of 37 degrees Celsius (97
Fahrenheit).
	   Even a win may not necessarily secure Belgium a place in the
second round.
	   If the Netherlands and Mexico draw, a Belgian victory would
leave all three teams with five points. In such a case, Belgium
would probably need to defeat South Korea by a margin of at least
three goals to go through.
	   But a victory would lock up a place in the next round for
Belgium if either the Dutch or Mexicans win their match in
Saint-Etienne.

Controversial cancer treatment not effective, Italy says 
</HEADLINE>
By ALESSANDRA RIZZO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A cocktail of hormones and vitamins prescribed by an
Italian doctor does not cure cancer, Italy's National Institute of
Health has concluded.
	   The Di Bella treatment, named after Dr. Luigi Di Bella, who
developed it years ago and then lobbied the government for
permission to use it, was studied by the government institute.
	   Of some 248 cancer cases between 1971 and 1997, only four people
had exclusively used the Di Bella method, and of them only one was
still alive two years after cancer diagnosis, Dr. Eva Buiatti, a
member of the Institute, told The Associated Press Wednesday.
	   Di Bella had claimed that half of more the 20,000 patients he
said were treated with his method showed improvement.
	   ``This treatment is not what the public opinion was told, it's
not the solution to the problem of cancer,'' Buiatti said.
	   Italy's health ministry asked the institute to study records to
determine whether Di Bella's formula cures cancer as he claims.
	   The report is not binding, and the final word will depend on
clinical trials conducted by the government on patients whose
cancers were not responding to other treatment.
	   Earlier this year hundreds of cancer patients streamed to his
office in the northern city of Modena for prescriptions, and they
and their relatives demonstrated in cities throughout Italy to push
for clinical trials.
	   Di Bella's treatment centers on the natural hormone of
somatostatin, coupled with vitamin A derivatives.
	   ``This (report) is the proof they want to discredit us,'' Di
Bella's attorney, Enrico Aimi, was quoted as saying in Wednesday's
Corriere della Sera newspaper. ``Nobody can possibly believe the
treatment worked so badly,'' he said.
	   But Buiatti insisted the results of the institute's study were
reliable.
	   Over the past months Di Bella went to Argentina and Canada, in
search of sponsors, but came back to Italy after a panel of
Canadian doctors found little evidence that his treatment was
effective.

	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Riot police used teargas and clubs to disperse
thousands of protesters who took to the streets Wednesday, burning
cars and piles of rubbish to protest President Gnassigbe Eyadema's
declared election victory.
	   ``We want Gilchrist Olympio,'' many demonstrators shouted,
calling out the name of the main opposition candidate.
	   The demonstrations by young opposition activists, which were
initially dispersed by police in the city center, quickly re-formed
in other neighborhoods later in the afternoon.
	   Burning tires and garbage filled the streets and several
government vehicles were torched.
	   Casualty reports were not immediately available although
journalists witnessed at least one youth being severely beaten by a
policeman. Authorities had no immediate comment on the protests.
	   Eyadema, a former dictator who has ruled Togo for 31 years, was
pronounced the winner of Sunday's presidential poll following the
resignation of the head of Togo's national election commission, who
said she had been intimidated and harassed.
	   Eyadema supporters briefly drove through Lome celebrating his
victory.
	   Eyadema's foreign minister, Koffi Panou, accused Olympio's
supporters of threatening the president of the national elections
commission, Awa Nana.
	   ``This atmosphere makes it impossible to publish the results of
the election and to finish the process as scheduled,'' Nana said,
also announcing the resignation of four members of the commission.
	   In a statement, Olympio's aides denied the charges and election
officials did not name the alleged aggressors.
	   Eyadema's victory was announced in a Wednesday morning press
conference by Gen. Seyi Memene, the minister of the interior and
the minister of security.
	   But the European Union, which sent an elections observer
mission, said the electoral process was flawed and vote counting
had been suspended before a clear winner could be determined.
	   ``The European Union urgently appeals to authorities to resume
counting without delay, and to publish official electoral results
which accurately reflect the voting of the electorate,'' the EU
said in a statement.
	   Eyadema's camp said the 61-year-old former military junta leader
had won 52 percent of the vote, with Olympio coming in second with
34 percent.
	   A day earlier, both Olympio and Eyadema supporters had claimed
victory.
	   Sunday's vote was the first round of the presidential elections.
Any candidate who wins more than 50 percent automatically becomes
president. Otherwise, the two top vote-getters face off in the
second round.
	   Olympio, while the best known of Eyadema's five challengers, had
not been expected to reach the second round.
	   The son of Togo's first president _ who was killed in 1963 by a
military junta led by Eyadema _ Olympio fled to Ghana last year
after a series of attempts on his life, including one in 1992 that
seriously wounded him. It was not clear whether he returned to Togo
for the election.
	   Eyadema ruled this tiny French-speaking country wedged between
Ghana and Benin as a military dictator for 26 years, until he won
widely criticized elections in 1993.
	   In this campaign, the president relegated opposition candidates
to occasional slices of television and radio time.

	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. envoy traveled into the
heart of the Kosovo conflict zone Wednesday and met with ethnic
Albanian militants for the first time, broadening efforts to end
the fighting before all-out war erupts.
	   Speaking against a backdrop of burned-out houses and devastated
villages, Richard Holbrooke declared it was time for Serb security
forces to ``get out of here.''
	   His tour of heavy fighting areas in the secessionist Serbian
province highlighted a shuttle diplomacy mission that many see as a
last-ditch bid to stop the conflict before NATO intervenes.
	   Over 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians have died since
fighting escalated in March between Serb-led army and police forces
and the Kosovo Liberation Army. NATO sent jets zooming over the
region earlier this month to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to stop the campaign against the rebels, but fighting
continues unabated.
	   A day after warning Milosevic that time for a peaceful end to
the violence is running out, Holbrooke planned to talk Thursday
with the president again and a Russian diplomat before returning to
Kosovo and meeting with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   But if Milosevic is close to agreeing to a cease-fire and
pullback as the West demands, Holbrooke, who helped persuade him to
sign a peace settlement to end the war in Bosnia, wasn't hinting at
it.
	   ``This is all part of a process,'' he told CNN before heading
back to Belgrade late Wednesday. ``I wouldn't want to get your
expectations up that we're going to have any breakthroughs, because
the situation is quite difficult.''
	   On a 300-kilometer (nearly 200-mile) tour of western Kosovo,
Holbrooke rode with three ethnic Albanian officials and had
protection for his 14-car convoy from a truckload of Serb security
forces carrying automatic rifles.
	   He downplayed his talks with two Kosovo Liberation Army leaders
in the town of Junik, calling them only unofficial meetings with
``armed men, some of whom were in UCK uniforms'' _ a reference to
the Albanian-language acronym for the KLA.
	   But observers saw the unprecedented meeting as tacit recognition
that the fast-growing KLA, which has the support of increasing
numbers of Kosovo's majority Albanians, must be taken into account
in any political settlement.
	   In a scene sure to anger Milosevic, Holbrooke shook hands with
the fighters in the besieged western town of Junik, near the
Albanian border, and posed for photographs with them. Along with
two other U.S. diplomats, he met with them for 45 minutes, seated
on the floor of a house inside the village.
	   ``These people are beleaguered and they don't have supplies,''
he said afterward. ``The situation is explosive. Serb security
forces are all over the place.''
	   He and the U.N. and other officials who accompanied him also
toured the towns of Djakovica and badly shelled Decane, where he
cited the charred houses with missing roofs as evidence condemning
the Serbs' actions.
	   This is ``the kind of action we saw earlier in this part of the
world,'' he said, in a clear reference to Bosnia. ``The Serbs
should get out of here, and the original inhabitants should come
back and rebuild their houses with government help.''
	   Serbian civilians along the route greeted the convoy with the
three-finger Serbian victory sign.
	   A shootout between Serb forces and KLA fighters erupted around a
convoy of reporters that was a kilometer (half-mile) away from
Holbrooke, and graphic evidence of fighting was plentiful
throughout the trip. Explosions and gunfire could be heard, and
Serb armored personnel carriers and military convoys were on the
road.
	   In Brussels Wednesday, Rugova appealed for NATO to use its
military might to end the worsening violence.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana met Rugova and insisted
Serbs and Albanians return to the negotiating table without
conditions. Solana also stressed the NATO allies support a return
to autonomy in Kosovo, but not the independence sought by both
Rugova and Albanian militants.
	   In 1989, Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy and has since
ruled the province with virtual martial law.

Security Council hears evidence of Iraqi nerve gas weapons 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: COMBINES pvs
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector told the
Security Council on Wednesday that findings by a U.S. Army
laboratory showed `there is no doubt'' that Iraq placed deadly VX
nerve gas in missile warheads.
	   Richard Butler said he would sending the missile shards to
laboratories in France and Switzerland for further analysis, as
Iraq has demanded. But he said the tests were conducted by one of
the world's premier chemical weapons laboratories.
	   ``I explained to the council that that is very serious because
Iraq has always insisted it never weaponized VX,'' Butler said.
``These findings show they did ... put it in weapons' warheads.''
	   Although Butler agreed to further testing, he was confident the
findings would be the same.
	   ``I made clear there is no doubt'' that ``VX was present in some
of those weapons warheads,'' he said. ``These degredation products
could be from no other substance. These are unique products. They
were of VX, they were found in a munition, namely a missile
warhead. That's weaponization.''
	   The allegation was among the most serious raised against Iraq by
the U.N. Special Commission, which has conducted weapons
inspections in Iraq since 1991.
	   U.N. inspectors must verify whether Iraq has destroyed all
long-range missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
before the council will lift economic sanctions imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   Iraq has admitted having maintained VX supplies but claims it
was never able to develop the technology to place the deadly nerve
agents in a weapons system.
	   If the findings are true, they could undermine efforts by
Russia, France and China to close the seven-year inspection program
and lift the sanctions.
	   French Ambassador Alain Dejammet, one of the strongest critics
of the inspection program within the 15-member council, said that
if the European laboratories uphold the findings ``it would be a
matter to be discussed very seriously.''
	   The report reinforced the U.S. and British position that Iraq
still has not released enough information on its weapons program to
warrant the lifting of sanctions.
	   ``I think Iraq is conducting its diversion and deception
campaign and it's not working,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson
said as he arrived for the meeting. ``Facts are facts. Iraq has
been deceiving the international community with weaponization of
nerve gas.''
	   The Iraqis, in a statement Tuesday, denied placing VX in
warheads and questioned the scientific basis for the report by the
U.S. Army laboratory in Aberdeen, Maryland.
	   VX is a colorless, odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it
comes into contact with oxygen. A few drops can kill in minutes.
	   Iraq said further tests should be conducted in a neutral country
_ such as Switzerland _ or in France or Russia. Butler noted that
the Aberdeen lab is certified for chemical weapons testing by the
international Chemical Weapons Convention.
	   Unless Iraq provides more information on its VX program, the
report could trigger another crisis similar to the one over access
by U.N. inspectors to presidential palaces.
	   That crisis was defused by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who won
international acclaim in February for striking a deal with the
Iraqis to open the Iraqi sites and avert U.S.-led airstrikes.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
Annan's senior aides have been pressuring Butler to ease up on the
Iraqis so the inspection program can be brought to an end.
	   Mindful of the impact on his February agreement, Annan said
before the council meeting that he hoped the finding would not
damage U.N. relations with Iraq.
	   ``We are dealing with the Iraqis on a large spectrum of issues
and I hope this particular development will not destroy the
improved relations that has allowed UNSCOM to carry on with its
work,'' Annan said, using the acronym for the U.N. Special
Commission that performs arms inspections.
	   But in a statement published Wednesday in Baghdad, Saddam and
other Iraqi leaders demanded sanctions be lifted immediately. If
not, they warned they would reconsider relations with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The statement did not mention the VX findings, although the
official Iraqi News Agency dismissed them as ``baseless and mere
fabrications.''
	   In its statement Tuesday, Iraq's U.N. mission said that Baghdad
rejects the results, adding they ``cannot be accurate since VX was
not used in any kind of munitions in Iraq due to continuous
production failure.''
	   The Iraqis said the samples were too small to be conclusive and
``finding a trace of a stabilizer in one sample out of seven
analyzed is not evidence because, if VX was used, a stabilizer
would have been found in every sample.''

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel began unearthing the bodies of
some 40 Shiite Muslim guerrillas Wednesday it plans to swap for the
remains of a single Israeli soldier in the largest prisoner
exchange with Lebanon in two years.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said the swap was scheduled to take place
Thursday at 8:00pm (17:00gmt). A plane carrying the body of Sgt.
1st Class Itamar Ilya was to arrive in Israel from Beirut, Lebanon
and then return to Lebanon with the bodies of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas.
	   Israel TV said Israel would identify Ilya's body, most likely at
Israel's pathology center, before releasing the remains of the
guerrillas. Israel TV said the French government was providing the
plane for the swap.
	   A second stage of the swap, brokered by the International
Committee of the Red Cross, was to take place Friday, Channel 2
reported. Israel would hand over an addition 16 Lebanese prisoners
held in Israeli jails and 50 more would be freed from a prison in
south Lebanon.
	   At a military cemetery in northern Israel, workers and soldiers
lifted wooden coffins out of the ground which hold the remains of
the guerrillas killed during fighting with Israel.
	   Israel's army radio said members of a special rabbinical
military unit went to the scene of the exhumations.
	   The 21-year-old Israeli soldier died in a raid last September in
south Lebanon along with 11 other Israelis. Ilya's body was the
only one not recovered after the raid, according to Israel. In the
raid's aftermath, guerrilla groups in Lebanon displayed body parts
and captured equipment.
	   Israel will also be returning the remains of the son of
Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, killed in separate
fighting last September.
	   Large-scale swaps have taken place previously, with the last one
two years ago.
	   In July 1996, Israel freed 45 Hezbollah prisoners and returned
the bodies of 123 guerrillas in exchange for the remains of two
Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon 10 years ago.
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israel and its allied
militia out of a buffer zone Israel set up in 1985 in southern
Lebanon to prevent cross-border raids. Israel has said it wants to
withdraw, but only if the security of its northern border can be
guaranteed by Lebanon.

World Cup: Ince, Southgate may miss England-Colombia 
</HEADLINE>
By MORLEY MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ Midfield dynamo Paul Ince and central
defender Gareth Southgate are doubtful starters with ankle injuries
for England's make-or-break World Cup match against Colombia in
Lens on Friday.
	   Both countries have three points from two matches, but England
has the better goal differential and can settle for a draw. Only a
Colombian victory will be enough for the South Americans to join
Group G leader Romania in the second round.
	   The injuries pose a threat to England's survival hopes.
	   Ince limped off 30 minutes into Monday's 2-1 loss to Romania in
Toulouse, while Southgate suffered a training injury one day after
playing in England's 2-0 opening victory over Tunisia in
Marseilles.
	   England coach Chris Hoddle gave Ince a 50-50 chance of playing,
saying the player had a recurrence of an ankle ligament injury
originally suffered at the end of the English Premier League
season. But Hoddle's assessment could be wide of the mark. He had
given Southgate a 60-40 chance of facing Romania, but the Aston
Villa player failed to make the lineup.
	   However, Hoddle's second-in-command John Gorman was more
optimistic about Ince's chances.
	   ``Paul has been with the physios all morning, and when we came
back from training he was on the bicycle and being put through his
routine,'' Gorman said. ``He's feeling a lot better, a lot more
confident today and he's going to train tomorrow.''
	   Romania had not scored before Ince left the field.
	   ``He's an essential player to us,'' Gorman said. ``It was a big
miss losing someone like him early in the game, but David Beckham
went on and did exceptionally well.
	   ``Like Paul, David can do a bit of both (defending and
attacking), but you don't expect him to be the same type of player
as Paul, who makes some really strong tackles. Beckham, in a
different way, gets in there quicker and puts players under
pressure.''
	   Gorman said Southgate was progressing, ``but the injury is
lingering around a bit.''
	   Gary Neville proved a reliable stand-in for Southgate against
Romania and both Martin Keown and Rio Ferdinand could slot into
those roles.
	   ``We are quite strong in that department,'' Gorman said.
	   Gorman said Monday's defeat had not dented England's confidence
and the players would be going all out for victory in Lens.
	   ``It's down to this game. It is very, very important. We want to
be there and there is a determination in the camp as never
before,'' Gorman said. ``You can never go in thinking about just
going for a draw. That won't be our attitude when we go out against
Colombia. We are certainly not going out there with thoughts of
just a draw, we're definitely going out to win the game.''

Russian Central Bank bought 10 tons of gold

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank of Russia has bought about 10
tons of gold in 1998, bringing its gold reserves to about 525 tons,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said Wednesday.
	   Sergei Kyshtymov, head of the bank's previous metals department,

Russian politician says it will take two decades to anchor democracy in Russia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Russian politician Alexander Lebed, in
Germany to receive a peace prize, said Wednesday his country would
need two generations before democracy is anchored there.
	   The former Russian general made the comments at a news
conference at the Hesse state Peace Foundation, which is awarding
him its 50,000 marks (dlrs 27,900) peace prize Thursday for helping
to negotiate peace in the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya.
	   Most top Hesse state politicians have declined to attend the
awards ceremony, citing scheduling problems. But the Frankfurter
Rundschau newspaper said earlier this week it was because they
objected to someone who took part in the war in Afghanistan getting
the prize.
	   Lebed was, as expected, critical of an austerity program
announced by Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday.
	   The radical economic and budget-cutting plan was not basically
new, Lebed said, and has no chance of being realized.
	   He said that the real basis for democracy in Russia must still
be achieved, after hundreds of years of authoritarian rule. Western
European states needed 200 years to achieve democracy, he said.
	   In another obvious jab at Yeltsin, Lebed said that up to now
nothing has been achieved in Russia, where he said corruption is in
power.
	   Lebed placed third in the 1996 presidential elections in which
Yeltsin was re-elected for a second term. Yeltsin appointed the
former general his national security adviser, but fired him months
later.
	   Lebed was sworn in June 6 as governor of the Krasnoyarsk region
in Siberia, a job seen as a springboard for another run at the
presidency in 2000.

Trinidad vows tol hang convicted killers, in growing Caribbean defiance of international courts BY TONY FRASER 
</HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ In the latest salvo in a
Caribbean rebellion against international courts reluctant to
uphold death sentences, Trinidad has announced it will ignore an
inter-American court order and hang convicted killers this month.
	   ``The hanging is going to be carried out and it's going to be
carried out in the month of June,'' a defiant Ralph Maharaj, the
country's attorney general, told reporters Tuesday.
	   Last week, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights ordered
Trinidad and Tobago not to hang five convicted murderers and
scheduled an Aug. 28 hearing for the appeals of Wenceslaus James,
Anthony Briggs, Anderson Noel, Anthony Garcia and Christopher
Bethel.
	   With drug-related crime on the rise, Maharaj's defiance signaled
an increasing willingness in the Carribean to cut ties with the
Organization of American States-run Inter-American court, and with
the Privy Council of the British House of Lords, the final court of
appeal for some former British colonies.
	   Maharaj suggested that in ordering the appeal, the
Inter-American court was colluding with the Privy Council, which
ruled in 1993 that it was inhumane to execute prisoners on death
row for five years. The five death row prisoners are approaching
the five-year deadline.
	   ``In effect what the commission and the court are saying is to
let the five-year time frame ... be exceeded so that these people
would not be executed,'' Maharaj said.
	   The 1993 Privy Council ruling virtually stopped hangings in the
region, since death row appeals can drag on for as long as a
decade.
	   But defiance is growing in Caribbean countries, where polls show
most people favor the death penalty. The region is confronting an
increase in violent crimes, as drug traffickers exploit the
region's unpoliced islets and location between South American
producers and U.S. consumers.
	   Last year nations began acting to clear the way for executions.
	   The 15-member Caribbean Community plans to establish a regional
supreme court to replace the British Privy Council. A draft
agreement is to be presented at the community's summit in St. Lucia
next week. The court would be based in Trinidad and start operating
next year.
	   Jamaica, which has commuted 105 death sentences since 1993 and
has 47 inmates on death row, has already withdrawn from the Costa
Rica-based Inter-American court, and Trinidad plans to withdraw
next year.

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ For Jennifer Capriati, playing at
Wimbledon for the first time in five years was a thrill in itself.
Winning was even better.
	   ``It's great to be back here,'' she said. ``It brings back a lot
of good memories. I was really pumped up. I was really excited to
be out there.''
	   Capriati overcame nine foot faults to defeat Australia's Nicole
Pratt 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 Wednesday, her first Grand Slam victory in five
years.
	   Her return to the All England Club came on a day when the men's
field lost No. 2 seed Marcelo Rios and No. 4 seed Greg Rusedski,
the bullet server who withdrew because of an injured ankle.
	   Rios, who held the No. 1 ranking briefly earlier this year but
whose game is not ideally suited to grass, was ousted in the first
round by Spain's Francisco Clavet, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel began Wednesday to unearth the
bodies of some 40 Shiite Muslim guerrillas it plans to swap along
with 66 live prisoners for the remains of a single Israeli soldier
in the largest such exchange with Lebanon in two years.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said the swap was scheduled to take place
Thursday at 8:00pm (17:00gmt). A plane carrying the body of Sgt.
1st Class Itamar Ilya was to arrive in Israel from Beirut, Lebanon
and then return to Lebanon with the bodies of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas.
	   Among the remains would be the son of Hezbollah leader Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah, killed in separate fighting last September.
	   Before releaseing the remains of the guerrillas, Israel would
identify Ilya's body, most likely at Israel's pathology center,
according to another report on Israel TV, which said the French
government was providing the plane for the swap.

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Brazilian Andre Da Silva clinched the men's
100-meter event at the IAAF Turin meet Wednesday, while Nigeria's
Endurance Ojokolo powered to first place in the women's event.
	   Da Silvia crossed the finish line in 10.22 seconds at the
International Amateur Athletic Federation meet in this northern
Italian city.
	   Ojokolo, in 11.33 seconds, was far off the women's world mark of
10.49.
	   Pole vaulter Emma George of Australia failed to better her world
record of 4.59 meters, but she cleared 4.40 to win the event.
Russia's Tatiana Grigoryeva cleared 4.30 to finish second.
	   George has broken the world pole vault record 15 times,
including both indoor and outdoor records.
	   The men's 110-meter hurdles went to Cuban Anier Garcia, who ran
the race in 13.48, over half a second slower than the world mark of
12.91.

Government says nearly all Sudanese approve new Constitution 
</HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's military backed government said
Wednesday that a new Islamic constitution has been approved by 96.7
percent of citizens who took part in a referendum.
	   ``This turn out shows the consensus of the people ... This is a
document that represents the people not the government,'' President
Omar el-Bashir said after receiving the referendum's results from
officials.
	   The official Sudan News Agency quoted Fatah el-Nahhas, the head
of the Sudanese National Election Commission, as saying that 10.9
million of the 11.9 million registered voters took part in the May
referendum.
	   No international monitors were allowed and the government did
not explain the unusually high turnout and yes votes.
	   Many opposition parties had called for a boycott of the
referendum on the grounds that the new Constitution maintains an
Islamic code of law and a ban political parties that do not commit
themselves to Islamic law.
	   Residents of the most southern states were not registered to
vote because of the local insurgency. Rebels there have been
fighting government forces since 1983 for more autonomy for the
region's largely Christian and animist people from the
Muslim-dominated north.
	   President Omar el-Bashir seized power in a military coup in 1989
and annulled the Constitution of the elected government. He has
ruled with emergency laws based on Islam since then and proposed
the new Constitution as a way to move toward rule of law.
	   Since el-Bashir came to power, the southern rebels have joined
hands with exiled secular opposition groups to demand an end to
Islamic law as well.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The president of Egyptian parliament's upper
house was re-elected Wednesday for a fourth three-year term, the
Middle East News Agency said.
	   Mustafa Kamal Helmy received the votes of all the 249 members
present during the vote in the Consultative Council, it said.
	   The council has little power, holding only an advisory position
to the lower house, the People's Assembly. Both the houses are
dominated by the ruling National Democratic Party.
	   The president appoints one-third of the Council's 264 members,
with elections for half the others held every three years.

	   The Chilean, who lost in the first round of a Wimbledon warmup
tournament in Nottingham, said he was fed up with the game.
	   ``I'm not enjoying playing right now,'' he said. ``I'm not

	   Rios also expressed disdain for Wimbledon, critizing the
``organization and transporation'' in particular.

Sabotage in Puerto Rico leaves one quarter of customers without telephones 
</HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A quarter of telephone customers in
Puerto Rico had their phone lines cut Wednesday as protesters
slashed wires across the island to fight the sale of the government
telephone company.
	   The sabotage left 345,000 of the 1.3 million subscribers without
service, shut down a quarter of the company's cellular telephone
antennas and disabled hundreds of automated bank machines, the
Puerto Rico Telephone Co. reported Wednesday.
	   Damages topped dlrs 325,000, company president Carmen Ana
Culpeper said. The week-old strike by 6,400 telephone workers is
already costing the company dlrs 700,000 daily in lost sales and
overtime to the 1,400 managers, she said.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello criticized the sabotage and vowed to push
forward with the dlrs 1.9 billion sale to a consortium led by U.S.
communications giant GTE Corp., which was approved by the local
House of Representatives on Wednesday.
	   ``I have the simple responsibility of making decisions based on
the well being of all Puerto Ricans, not on who makes the most
disturbances, or is the most aggressive, or who pushes the most, or
who conducts sabotage,'' Rossello said.
	   Police reported 16 acts of sabotage overnight.
	   The smaller islands of Vieques and Culebra were cut off from the
rest of Puerto Rico, and telephones at the Westin Rio Mar, one of
the island's largest resorts, went dead after protesters cut a
fiber optic line in nearby Rio Grande.
	   On Wednesday, protesters cut local telephone service at
Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, the U.S. Navy's largest base outside
of the mainland.
	   Fourteen of the telephone company's 28 offices were closed
because picketers blocked managers from entering the buildings,
Culpeper said.
	   On Wednesday, workers planned to protest in front of the
Government Development Bank, which negotiated the sale, and the
headquarters of Banco Popular, a member of the buying consortium.
	   The deal awaits only Rossello's signature and approval from the
Federal Communications Commission.
	   The telephone sale is the most ambitious yet in Rossello's
project to privatize largely inefficient state enterprises. His
government already has sold hotels and a shipping company. It is
courting private investment in the power industry and wants to
privatize health care management.

Moroccans angry, but proud, after World Cup elimination 
</HEADLINE>
By ABDELHAKIM YAMANI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ After being eliminated from the World Cup,
emotions in Morocco Wednesday ranged from pride in the national
team to contempt for a referee.
	   Although Morocco beat Scotland 3-0 Tuesday, they were eliminated
after Norway beat Brazil 2-1 courtesy of a highly dubious penalty
awarded in the final minutes.
	   The goal sent Norway through to the second round, and the Atlas
Lions back home.
	   ``It's always the case. This is what happens to small teams,''
said a desolate Mohammed N'ciri, a bank employee.
	   ``What does it matter to us now if (FIFA President) Sepp Blatter
creates a commission to look into poor refereeing?''
	   Several thousands Moroccans took to the streets of the capital,
and other cities, Tuesday night, singing the national anthem,
waving flags and taking consolation from the team's performance.
	   Many were in tears.
	   Despite losing to Brazil, Morocco earned a point with a 2-2 draw
against Norway in its first group match, and in general played
entertaining, attacking soccer.
	   One banner in downtown Rabat read: ``Damned Referee.'' Another
said: ``Look, listen: Morocco is awesome.''
	   Many said that despite elimination, Morocco had won a moral
victory.
	   ``It's the best thing that could have happened to us,'' said
Nadjib Saimi, a sports journalist. ``We were knocked out. But we've
found a good team of players. And the public is very
enthusiastic.''
	   ``That's better than getting through to the next round and
losing by four or five goals.''
	   With Cameroon also eliminated on Tuesday, most Moroccans say
they will now root for Nigeria, the sole representative from Africa
to have advanced to the second round.

German double murder suspect arrested after two months on the run 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANAU, Germany (AP) _ Two months after escaping from custody and
the double murder of a father and grandmother in eastern Germany,
the prime suspect was arrested Wednesday, police said.
	   Police in Halle in eastern Germany who were seeking Gerhard
Buech, identified him as the arrested man.
	   A police spokesman in Halle said that Buch was arrested after he
had attacked a woman in her garden in Hanau about 20 kilometers (12
miles) east of Frankfurt.
	   Hanau police would only confirm a man fitting the 50-year-old
Buech's description had been arrested.
	   Buech escaped in April from guards taking him to a dental
appointment from a prison psychiatric clinic where he had been
jailed for molesting women.
	   A few days later, on April 15, he allegedly entered the home of
a family in Sennewitz near Halle with the intention of robbing
them. In the process the 46-year-old father was shot to death and
the 71-year-old grandmother strangled.
	   Halle police said the wife and 16-year-old daughter were tied up
and sexually molested for hours before Buech fled the next morning
in a taxi that took him to Leipzig where he disappeared.

Black member buying club that banned minorities for decades AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The Bath Club stands in an elegant stretch of
oceanfront high-rise hotels and condominiums in Miami Beach, a
symbol with a history of opulence and white elitism. But things are
changing _ again.
	   R. Donahue Peebles, a Washington developer and one of the club's
first black members, is buying the private enclave that once was
all white in a city that has seen decades of racial tension
influence its business dealings.
	   Peebles has plans to build his third resort hotel there, one
with 300 to 400 rooms. He intends to preserve the club while he
builds.
	   ``It's sweet. It's just sweet,'' said Florida International
University associate professor Marvin Dunn, a black academic whose
studies of Miami's 1980s race riots blamed them primarily on black
economic exclusion. ``That was one of the great bastions of
segregation in Miami.''
	   The 71-year-old club barred blacks, Hispanics and Jews for more
than a half-century.
	   ``It was for a long time an unapologetically discriminatory
club, which reflected an ugly form of bigotry dressed in the finery
of the social elite of the time,'' said Arthur Teitelbaum, Southern
area director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
	   Details of the sale approved Saturday by the club's board were
not disclosed, but sources told The Miami Herald that the purchase
price was about dlrs 9 million.
	   ``In part what is remarkable about this sale is its
ordinariness,'' Teitelbaum said Tuesday. ``This was an ordinary
business deal with interesting implications in terms of its social
commentary.''
	   The club told the ADL in 1991 that its membership bylaws were
nondiscriminatory. Peebles was sponsored for membership in 1996;
the club currently has 100 voting members and a Jewish president.
	   The changes are indicative of a settling of some racial
problems, which saw a peak in 1990 as black leaders urged a black
tourism boycott of the city that lasted three years. They were
angry that the City Council wouldn't grant formal recognition to
anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela because he refused to denounce
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
	   An office developer and longtime friend of Washington Mayor
Marion Barry, Peebles was vacationing in 1995 when he read about
Miami Beach's search for a black developer. The result was the goal
of building the city's first minority-owned hotel; Peebles emerged
with plans for the 425-room Crowne Plaza. In December, he also won
a 99-year lease and permission to build a 500-room hotel at Fort
Lauderdale's convention center.
	   H.T. Smith, who organized the 1990 boycott, said he found the
Bath Club purchase interesting but will only get excited when
Peebles breaks ground on the dlrs 60 million Crowne Plaza.
	   ``I've spent now eight years of my life trying to make a dream
come true for the (black) community,'' he said. ``We want to see
the black-owned hotel get on the road.''

Welcome back: Capriati plays, and wins, at Wimbledon AP Sports Writer

Eds: Updates with Pioline eliminated
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ For Jennifer Capriati, playing at
Wimbledon for the first time in five years was a thrill in itself.
Winning was even better.
	   ``It's great to be back here,'' she said. ``It brings back a lot
of good memories. I was really pumped up. I was really excited to
be out there.''
	   Capriati overcame nine foot faults to defeat Australia's Nicole
Pratt 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 Wednesday, her first Grand Slam victory in five
years.
	   Her return to the All England Club came on a day when the men's
field lost three big names: No. 2 seed Marcelo Rios, No. 4 Greg
Rusedski and last year's runner-up, Cedric Pioline.
	   While Rusedski withdrew with an ankle injury, Rios and Pioline
both lost first-round matches in five sets.
	   Pioline, the No. 8 seed, was eliminated by Switzerland's Marc
Rosset in a 3-hour, 53-minute marathon that ended in semi-darkness.
The score was 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 13-11 _ with the final set
lasting 78 minutes.
	   The only service break in the fifth set came when Rosset broke
for 12-11. The Swiss then served out the match at love, with
Pioline barely able to get his racket on Rosset's huge serves.

	   ROME (AP) _ ``Ciao ciao e grazie'' -- bye-bye and thanks said
the note left by two escaping mobsters in a tunnel leading from a
courtroom steel-barred holding cage to freedom.
	   The bold escape Monday of defendants Giuseppe Autorino and
Ferdinando Cesarano during the trial in the southern city of
Salerno was the latest embarrassment to the Italian justice system,
and opposition politicians on Wednesday demanded that the justice
and interior ministers resign.
	   ``Swiss cheese courtroom, the police chief pays,'' Rome daily Il
Messaggero headlined its account about the first head to roll for
the escape.
	   Deputy Premier Walter Veltroni, briefing the Chamber of Deputies
about the escape, announced that Justice Minister Giovanni Maria
Flick had asked that Salerno's chief prosecutor be transferred.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Finnish observers conducted an inspection flight
in northwestern Russia under the Open Skies treaty on Wednesday,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The 1992 treaty, signed by 27 countries, promotes openness by
allowing participating countries to gather information about each

airfield outside Moscow and took aerial photographs.

Last-minute haggle delays OPEC deal on production cuts AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS Iranian minister saying deal back on track
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers agreed Wednesday night to
remove almost 1.4 million barrels of oil a day from the market,
hoping to reverse the price crisis they created by pumping too
much, two ministers said.
	   Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh and Kuwait's Sheik
Saud Nasser al-Sabah confirmed the figure of 1.38 million barrels
as OPEC members gathered to formally convene their delayed summer
meeting.
	   The deal was struck in a chaotic pair of informal sessions that
left oil traders unsure what to think.
	   Prices first rose on news there would be a deal, then reversed
into negative territory on some of the details, before drifting
aimlessly as matters became more confused late in the session.
	   After the OPEC ministers had their first informal talks, Saudi
Minister Ali Naimi told reporters that a deal was in hand. OPEC
delegates began privately discussing the numbers that they said
came to nearly 1.4 million barrels.
	   But just as OPEC appeared ready to formally meet and ratify the
production cuts, the ministers went back behind closed doors to
discuss concerns about the credibility of the deal.
	   Some of the ministers were worried that Iran might not cut all
of the 190,000 barrels a day it had promised, according to a
Venezuelan delegate who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
	   Zangeneh later assured the others Iran's cuts would be real.
	   The 11 OPEC nations were confronting a supply problem that
recently pushed prices of crude to 12-year lows and stirred some
concerns about a possible repeat of the disasters that struck the
global oil industry in 1986.
	   OPEC delegates said the production cuts would be led by the
Saudis, who are chopping 425,000 barrels a day from their
production beginning on July 1. Venezuela has promised to cut
325,000 barrels a day, followed by Iran's pledge to restrain output
by 190,000 barrels daily.
	   Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria each pledged to cut
production by 100,000 barrels daily, with smaller cuts coming in
from smaller OPEC members, delegates said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Even Indonesia, which has faced the double whammy of an economic
collapse at home and lower oil prices, was hoping to chip in 30,000
to 40,000 barrels of cuts, a source said.
	   But analysts have cautioned that OPEC needs to show that it can
deliver more than just promises. Even though the producers found
themselves in serious economic trouble by flooding the market this
winter and spring, they have had persistent problems sticking to
any production agreements in recent years.
	   Going into Wednesday's informal session, six of the 11 OPEC
members had pledged to slash a total of 620,000 barrels daily from
the market _ and OPEC has more than doubled that promise. Non-OPEC
producers Mexico, Russia, Egypt and Oman had also pledged to cut
another 203,000 barrels.
	   Crude oil is the world's most vital commodity and the recent
cheap prices have been a bargain for consumers but a nightmare for
OPEC and other producers.
	   OPEC found itself in a mess this winter after boosting output
just as the Asian economic crisis started eroding the growth in
world oil demand.
	   The oil ministers held an emergency meeting in March, agreeing
to cut 1.245 million barrels of daily production. They delivered
most, but not all, of those cuts and prices plunged further,
leading to the latest effort to restrain production further.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

After NATO approval, Prodi to test strength of his government Friday 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with Prodi's quotes to state TV, coalition to meet
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ After a small centrist party bailed the government
out on a crucial vote to approve NATO's eastward expansion, Premier
Romano Prodi said Wednesday he would have to test the health of his
majority.
	   On Tuesday night, the government won lower house approval for
the ratification of the inclusion of the Czech Republic, Poland and
Hungary in NATO.
	   The Senate, where the government enjoys a comfortable majority,
had earlier ratified the agreement.
	   The approval in the chamber, sparing the government an
embarrassing defeat, came thanks to an eleventh-hour decision of a
centrist opposition party, created by former President Francesco
Cossiga, to vote ``yes.''
	   Hardline Communists, who normally give Prodi's center-left
coalition a majority in the Chamber, led the opposition.
	   ``An in-depth examination'' with the Communists is necessary,
Prodi said in a statement released late Tuesday, after a brief
meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the outcome of the
vote.
	   The meeting of coalition allies was scheduled for Friday.
	   In an interview Wednesday night on RAI state TV Prodi indicated
that there were no alternatives under his leadership to the current
coalition.``This is my coalition. If there are conditions that make
this impossible, it won't be myself who will lead the government.
I've always said that and I repeat that.''
	   Prodi then indicated the coalition meeting would yield one of
the following possibilities -- either the Communists renew their
support for the government or the coalition can't continue.
	   Prodi rejected opposition requests that he resign for his
failure to have full backing from the government's regular
supporters.
	   Communist leader Fausto Bertinotti said repeatedly that his
party's position was not a vote against the government and that he
would support Prodi in any confidence vote.

	   DOLNI DABNIK, Bulgaria (AP) _ A surgeon who raises pigs and
milks cows might be taken for an eccentric in many places, but not
here. He's one of Bulgaria's new breed of successful farmers.
	   ``Surgery is my hobby. Farming is my business,'' says Dr. Mihail
Krastev, whose changed priorities symbolize a modest farming
revival and a growing glimmer of hope for one of Europe's poorest
countries.
	   Sprawled across lush fields between the Balkan Mountains and the
Danube River, Krastev's prosperous 1,700-hectare (4,200-acre)
operation looks like the model farm that the communists talked
about but never achieved.
	   He proudly walks guests through neat alleys and freshly painted
sheds with 3,000 pigs, 100 cows, 1,000 sheep and a stable of
thoroughbred horses. There's a pond with 30 tons of fish. A small
fleet of modern equipment helps him harvest 5 tons of wheat per
hectare (2 tons per acre) _ a third higher than the national
average.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel began unearthing the bodies of
some 40 Shiite Muslim guerrillas Wednesday it plans to swap for the
remains of a single Israeli soldier in the largest prisoner
exchange with Lebanon in two years.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said the swap was scheduled to take place
Thursday at 8:00pm (17:00gmt). A plane carrying the body of Sgt.
1st Class Itamar Ilya was to arrive in Israel from Beirut, Lebanon
and then return to Lebanon with the bodies of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas.
	   Israel TV said Israel would identify Ilya's body, most likely at
Israel's pathology center, before releasing the remains of the
guerrillas. The French government was providing the plane for the
swap, French foreign ministry officials said in Paris.
	   A second stage of the swap, brokered by the International
Committee of the Red Cross, was to take place Friday, Channel 2
reported. Israel would hand over an addition 16 Lebanese prisoners
held in Israeli jails and 50 more would be freed from a prison in
south Lebanon.
	   In Lebanon, officials from the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army
militia said up to 15 Lebanese prisoners were taken out of Israeli
jails and placed in their custody in south Lebanon.
	   The prisoners are being held at the Khiam detention center and
are expected to be released later as part of the swap, said the
militia officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   At a military cemetery in northern Israel, workers and soldiers
lifted wooden coffins out of the ground which hold the remains of
the guerrillas killed during fighting with Israel.
	   Israel's army radio said members of a special rabbinical
military unit went to the scene of the exhumations.
	   The 21-year-old Israeli soldier died in a raid last September in
south Lebanon along with 11 other Israelis. Ilya's body was the
only one not recovered after the raid, according to Israel. In the
raid's aftermath, guerrilla groups in Lebanon displayed body parts
and captured equipment.
	   Israel will also be returning the remains of the son of
Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, killed in separate
fighting last September.
	   Large-scale swaps have taken place previously, with the last one
two years ago.
	   In July 1996, Israel freed 45 Hezbollah prisoners and returned
the bodies of 123 guerrillas in exchange for the remains of two
Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon 10 years ago.
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israel and its allied
militia out of a buffer zone Israel set up in 1985 in southern
Lebanon to prevent cross-border raids. Israel has said it wants to
withdraw, but only if the security of its northern border can be
guaranteed by Lebanon.

New problems force Russia to postpone satellite launch again for Defense Ministry. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS new final graf to UPDATE with Kosmos satellite launched
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia postponed the launch of six satellites on
Wednesday for the second time, after new problems were discovered
with the cranky Zenit-2 booster rocket, officials said.
	   The launch from Russia's Baikonur cosmodrome had originally been
scheduled for Tuesday, but it was postponed until Wednesday because
of a failure in the rocket's orientation system. A similar problem
during a Zenit-2 launch last week sent six ``spy mailbox''
satellites into the wrong orbit.
	   The orientation was adjusted, but on Wednesday morning the
system broke down again, said Alexander Buchin, spokesman for
Russia's Strategic Missile Forces.
	   ``The malfunction is floating, which means that when the rocket
was checked before being placed in the starting position everything
was OK, but when it was taken to the site, inaccuracy in aiming was
found,'' spokesman for the Russian Space Agency, Sergei Gorbunov,
was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   An expert commission decided Wednesday that it would take at
least a week to fix the problem, Gorbunov said. The satellites
would have to be disconnected from the booster, which would be
taken back to an assembly and testing shop for repairs, he said.
	   Space experts have been cautious with the Zenit-2 booster since
it has been involved in more than a half dozen accidents and
failures since 1985. Last year, a Zenit-2 booster crashed less than
a minute after launch from Baikonur, which is located in
neighboring Kazakstan.
	   No new launch date has been set, Gorbunov said.
	   ``Of course, this is an unpleasant incident, but I think that by
postponing the launch we have avoided big problems, as the
satellites could have been put into the wrong orbit,'' he said.
	   The booster is to carry into orbit satellites from Russia,
Germany, Israel, Chile, Australia and Thailand.
	   The Russian Resurs-0 satellite will relay ecological and
meteorological information, while the others will take measurements
of the Earth's surface.
	   Russia has been pushing commercial satellite launches as a way
to help fund its space program, which is struggling after the loss
of Soviet-era subsidies. Russia launched 48 commercial satellites
last year.
	   Russia's strategic rocket forces successfully launched a Kosmos
satellite for the Defense Ministry from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in
northern Russia late Wednesday, ITAR-Tass said.

Catholic group urges Annan to send mission to East Timor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A British-based Roman Catholic
organization called Wednesday on Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
send a U.N. mission to East Timor as soon as possible to protect
those calling for a referendum on the territory's future.
	   In a letter to Annan, the Catholic Institute for International
Relations, based in London, urged him to send the team, to observe
``the emergent atmosphere of openness and protest, dubbed the `Dili
Spring''' in the predominately Catholic former Portuguese colony.
	   ``A visit from your officials at the earliest opportunity ...
would both support the processes of open debate and give Timorese
some assurance that their aspirations will be central to the
international negotiations now taking place under your auspices,''
the Institute said.
	   Other organizations joining in the letter included the Catholic
Fund for Overseas Development, the Catholic Institute for
International Relations, Christian Aid and Oxfam.
	   The statement was issued after the new Indonesian president,
B.J. Habibie, promised to withdraw some troops from disputed East
Timor and allow its people greater freedom, according to Bishop
Carlos Belo.
	   Belo, co-winner of the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize, said he and
Habibie skirted the key issue of a vote on independence.
	   Habibie has ruled out a referendum in the former Portuguese
colony, which was invaded by Indonesian forces in 1975. Instead, he
has offered special status that would grant an undefined measure of
autonomy while keeping East Timor as Indonesia's 27th province.

Cyprus plans to liberalize interest rates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The government will soon submit to
Parliament a draft bill on freeing interest rates as part of a plan
to liberalize the financial sector, the finance minister said
Wednesday.
	   The bill will be submitted before the house goes into summer
recess on July 10, Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou
said, but did not give a specific date.
	   The draft bill is in line with the government's efforts to
reform the financial sector and harmonize legislations with those
of the European Union in preparation for membership of the
15-nation group.
	   Cyprus opened accession talks with the EU in March, but is not
expected to become a member before 2002.
	   ``It is important that we give the European Union and the rest
of the world the feeling that a very important sector is being
liberalized and modernized,'' Christodoulou told reporters.
	   If adopted by Parliament, the new bill will replace an
antiquated 1944 law, which sets a ceiling of 9 percent on interest
rates. The legislation was introduced by British colonial
authorities to combat usury.
	   The interest rates on deposits and loans currently stand at 6.5
percent and 8 percent.
	   Christodoulou said the draft bill will allow for an unspecified
transitional period during which the new system will be screened
for possible inadequacies.
	   The bill is likely to be passed since the President Glafcos
Clerides' coalition government has a majority in the 56-member
house.

Referendum would be preceded by weeks-long campaign

Eds: UPDATES with State Department comment in graf 5
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A referendum on a West Bank troop withdrawal
would be preceded by weeks of campaigning, including TV and radio
spots and canvassing, the justice minister said Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu favors such a nationwide
opinion poll, believing it would silence far-right opponents who
have threatened to topple him over a troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu was expected to make a final decision in time for the
weekly Cabinet meeting Sunday, said an Israeli official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   A referendum would delay an Israeli troop pullback by at least
two more months and has been denounced by the Palestinians and
Israeli opposition leaders as a waste of time.
	   In Washington, State Department officials urged Israel again
Wednesday to approve a U.S. proposal for turning over 13 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority and said a referendum
may not a good idea if it adds to the delay. State Department
spokesman James Rubin said if a referendum ``involves significant
delay of any breakthrough, that would be of concern to us.''

World Cup: Nigeria-Paraguay 1-1 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Celso Ayala headed Paraguay's first
World Cup '98 goal after only 51 seconds Wednesday but Wilson Oruma
hit back for Nigeria 10 minutes later as the two teams walked off
at half time level at 1-1.
	   Ayala's header was the fastest World Cup goal since Bryan
Robson's 27-second strike for England against France in Bilbao,
Spain, in 1982.
	   It was the perfect start for a Paraguay team that started out
second in Group D behind the already-qualified Nigerians and hoped
to stay there and join them in round two.
	   After enduring 180 minutes of tedious, goal-less soccer against
Bulgaria and Spain, Paraguay needed less than one minute to hit the
target against Nigeria.
	   Francisco Arce swung over a free kick from the right and, with
the Nigerian defense stationary, Ayala jumped unchallenged to beat
goalkeeper Peter Rufai's attempted punch and head into an unguarded
net.
	   The goal sparked Nigeria's talented strikeforce into action and
the Africans equalized in the 11th minute.
	   Nwankwo Kanu slipped an elegant pass through to overlapping
winger Tijani Babangida and the Ajax forward cut inside, was felled
by a Paraguayan defender, but still found the unmarked Oruma 13
meters (yards) from goal. Oruma, who plays for French club Lens,
side-footed home.
	   The Nigerians didn't ease off and Paraguay's star goalkeeper,
Jose Luis Chilavert, was kept busy, saving acrobatically from
Sunday Oliseh's shot, Taribo West's header and Racheed Yekini's
shot all in the space of six minutes.
	   Lineups:
	   Nigeria_Peter Rufai; Augustine Eguavoen, Ben Iroha, Uche Okafor,

Gene appears to affect risk of getting hooked on smoking AP Science Writer

Eds: UPDATES to CLARIFY effects of previously known gene.
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists say they have identified a gene that
helps protect some people from getting hooked on cigarettes. If
confirmed, the finding might lead to medications that help smokers
cut back or quit.
	   About one-fifth of the nonsmoking population carries a
protective version of the gene, said Rachel Tyndale, one of the
study's authors. The gene's influence might have saved some 7
million current residents of North America from nicotine addiction,
she said.
	   It is at least the second gene thought to affect the risk of
getting hooked on nicotine. But genetics experts warned that the
case for the new gene is far from proven.
	   Tyndale and colleagues at the University of Toronto in Ontario,
Canada, report their findings in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature.
	   Dr. Neal Benowitz, a nicotine researcher at the University of
California at San Francisco, said the result makes sense
biologically. But he cautioned that in the past, similar initial
findings of addiction genes have not been confirmed by further
research.
	   Nonetheless, he called the finding an important early step in
finding out why some people are more vulnerable to nicotine
addiction than others. Only about a third of young people who
experiment with cigarettes get hooked, and ``we don't know why,''
Benowitz said.
	   He and others said the answer will be much more complex than one
or two genes.
	   Prior research suggests that a person's risk of getting hooked
on nicotine can also be influenced by another gene, one that is
involved in the brain's dopamine communication system.

Canada's struggling churches team up to sponsor Billy Graham visit 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Admitting to alarm over dwindling influence and
membership, dozens of Canada's Christian denominations _ including
the Roman Catholic church _ have joined in organizing a crusade
this week by U.S. evangelist Billy Graham.
	   Graham, 79, will preach for four nights in Ottawa, starting
Thursday, at the invitation of 465 congregations representing 42
denominations.
	   He is expected to draw about 25,000 people each night to the
Corel Centre, a suburban sports arena
	   It took years of negotiating and organizing for major Christian
denominations to agree on inviting Graham as a way of rekindling
interest in religion. They were spurred to a large degree by
declining or stagnating memberships.
	   ``The church in Canada, which had held a central role, was
completely and totally marginalized,'' said the Rev. Doug Ward, a
Baptist minister who is helping organize Graham's crusade.
	   ``The desperation was that we were dwindling in numbers, the
people felt that we have to do something to get this back, we've
got to reclaim the land we've lost.''
	   For the past year, a dozen employees of the Billy Graham Mission
have been based in Ottawa preparing for the four-day event. Graham,
who has been slowed in recent years by Parkinson's disease, met
Tuesday with about 50 Canadian journalists.
	   ``We love Canada,'' Graham said. ``Every time I see that Maple
Leaf anywhere in the world, my heart warms just as it does when I
see the Stars and Stripes.''
	   Graham met privately with Roman Catholic Archbishop Marcel
Gervais, who helped win support for the Graham mission from 70
Catholic churches in the Ottawa region.
	   ``He said, `We need to get back to the Bible,' and I think he is
right,'' Graham said. ``We buy Bibles but we don't read them...
We've become rather ignorant when it comes to the teachings of the
Word of God.''
	   Graham's last mission to Canada was in Toronto in June 1995. He
was hospitalized after collapsing during a speech and spoke only on
the last two nights of the five-day mission.
	   Some non-Christian churches in Canada have been growing recently
due to steady immigration from Asia, but most Christian
denominations have been struggling. Only about 10 percent of
Quebec's French Catholics regularly attend Mass, and the United
Church _ a merger of Canada's Methodist, Presbyterian and
Congregational churches _ has lost about 20 percent of its members
since 1980.

Eds: UPDATES with 15 Lebanese prisoners moved from Israel to their
militia allies in south Lebanon in grafs 6-7; SUBS graf 4 to
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel began Wednesday to unearth the
bodies of some 40 Shiite Muslim guerrillas it plans to swap along
with 66 live prisoners for the remains of a single Israeli soldier
in the largest such exchange with Lebanon in two years.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said the swap was scheduled to take place
Thursday at 8 p.m. (1700 GMT). A plane carrying the body of Sgt.
1st Class Itamar Ilya was to arrive in Israel from Beirut, Lebanon
and then return to Lebanon with the bodies of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas.
	   Among the remains would be the son of Hezbollah leader Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah, killed in separate fighting last September.
	   Israel TV said Israel would identify Ilya's body, most likely at
Israel's pathology center, before releasing the remains of the
guerrillas. The French government was providing the plane for the
swap, French foreign ministry officials said in Paris.
	   A second stage of the swap, brokered by the International
Committee of the Red Cross, was to take place Friday, Channel 2
reported. Israel would hand over 16 Lebanese prisoners held in
Israeli jails and 50 more would be freed from a prison in south
Lebanon.
	   In Lebanon, officials from the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army
militia said up to 15 Lebanese prisoners were taken out of Israeli
jails and placed in their custody in south Lebanon.
	   The prisoners are being held at the Khiam detention center and
are expected to be released later as part of the swap, said the
militia officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Arrival of Egyptians brings UN force in Central Africa to strength 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The arrival this week of 120 Egyptian
soldiers has brought a U.N. peacekeeping operation in the Central
African Republic to near full strength, the United Nations said
Wednesday.
	   The Egyptian troops arrived Tuesday in the capital, Bangui, to
join soldiers from nine other countries who will stay for at least
three months to ensure peaceful legislative elections in August.
	   The mission may be extended until at least August 1999, when
presidential elections are scheduled.
	   The Security Council authorized the 1,400-member mission in
March, using primarily African troops from Burkina Faso, Senegal,
Chad, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Gabon, Mali and Togo.
	   France and Canada are the only other non-African country playing
a role.
	   Previous peace missions in Africa mainly have involved western
nations, with token military and diplomatic support from African
countries.
	   A U.N. statement said that the Egyptians's arrival meant the
force was ``virtually at full strength'' but provided no specific
numbers.

Grains, soybeans rise sharply on renewed heat fears 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures rose sharply Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid continued speculation the
Midwestern summer will be hot and dry, stressing crops.
	   Private forecasters have been expressing conflicting views on
the severity of the heat in July. But speculators have been relying
on previous summers following El Nino years, which have been hot
and very dry. Already, parts of Texas and the southeast have been
baking under oppressive temperatures, reducing yields for corn,
soybean, cotton and peanut crops.
	   Wheat for December delivery, representing the fall harvest, rose
4 1-4 cents to dlrs 3.20 1-2 a bushel; December corn rose 4 cents
to dlrs 2.71 3-4 a bushel; December oats rose 5 1-4 cents to dlrs
1.44 1-4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 13 3-4 cents to dlrs 6.54
1-2 a bushel.

World Cup: Spain leads Bulgaria 2-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Luis Enrique drew a penalty and scored a
goal to give Spain a 2-0 lead over Bulgaria at halftime in their
final Group D match Wednesday.
	   Spanish King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia looked on as Spain
demonstrated speed and skill unseen in its first two World Cup
matches against Nigeria and Paraguay.
	   Fernando Hiero converted a penalty in the sixth minute _ sending
Bulgaria's goalkeeper Zdravko Zdravkov to his right by placing a
shot into the opposite side of the net _ after defender Ivaylo
Iordanov brought down Luis Enrique as he broke into the Bulgarian
box from the left.
	   Twelve minutes later, Joseba Etxeberria raced down the right to
cross to the Barcelona all-rounder, who beat two Bulgarian
defenders to send the ball from 8 meters past the advancing
Jordanov into the far, right side of the goal.
	   Spain pressed on with a series of flowing attacks, dominating
most of the half with a pace Bulgaria's aging veterans could not
match.
	   Spain's nearly made it 3-0 in the 39th minute, when Francisco
Morientes hit the crossbar and the ball bounced to Luis Enrique,
whose shot from 8 meters was deflected by the goalkeeper.
	   Bulgaria's star attackers Hristo Stoickov and Emil Kostadinov
were marked handily by Rafael Alkorta and Miguel Nadal, who allowed
very little past them.
	   Bulgaria's best opportunity came on a fast break in the 34th
minute, when Stoichkov heeled the ball to Luboslav Penev, whose
shot was blocked by keeper Andoni Zubizarreta. Stoickov pounced on
the rebound but his shot was headed away by Nadal.
	   Lineups:
	   Spain _ Andoni Zubizarreta, Carlos Aguilera, Rafael Alkorta,
Miguel Angel Nadal, Sergi Barjuan, Fernando Hierro, Guillermo Amor,
Joseba Etxeberria, Luis Enrique Martinez, Fernando Morientes,
Alfonso Perez.
	   Bulgaria _ Zdravko Zdravkov, Radostin Kischishev, Trifon Ivanov,
Ivaylo Iordanov, Gocho Guintchev, Krassimir Balakov, Anatoli Nankov
(Luboslav Penev, 28th minute), Daniel Borimirov, Georgi Batchev,
Emil Kostadinov, Hristo Stoichkov.

Welcome back: Capriati plays, and wins, at Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Updates with Agassi trailing Haas in suspended match
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ For Jennifer Capriati, playing at
Wimbledon for the first time in five years was a thrill in itself.
Winning was even better.
	   ``It's great to be back here,'' she said. ``It brings back a lot
of good memories. I was really pumped up. I was really excited to
be out there.''
	   Capriati overcame nine foot faults to defeat Australia's Nicole
Pratt 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 Wednesday, her first Grand Slam victory in five
years.
	   Her return to the All England Club came on a day when the men's
field lost three big names: No. 2 seed Marcelo Rios, No. 4 Greg
Rusedski and last year's runner-up, Cedric Pioline.
	   While Rusedski withdrew with an ankle injury, Rios and Pioline
both lost first-round matches in five sets.
	   Andre Agassi, the 1992 champion and No. 13 seed, was in danger
of elimination, too, trailing two sets to love against Germany's
Tommy Haas in a match suspended by darkness at 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Agassi was furious over a crucial line call in the tiebreaker,
when a forehand by Haas was ruled in, even though replays showed it
was clearly long.
	   ``It was nearly six inches (out),'' Agassi protested to chair
umpire John Frame. ``It was out both ways. It was wide and it was
long.''
	   Agassi saved one set point, but Haas hit a backhand winner on
the next to win the tiebreaker.
	   ``In 12 years, I've never seen it miss that much,'' Agassi
complained again to Frame, who was booed and jeered by the Centre
Court crowd.

Court sentences journalist for first time for insulting Islam 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A Kuwaiti court Wednesday sentenced the editor of
an opposition newspaper and a freelance Egyptian journalist to six
months in jail for publishing a joke that is deemed to have
insulted Islam.
	   This is the first time such a punishment has been handed out in
this tiny emirate, which has one of the freest media in the region.
The freelancer, who contributed the joke from Egypt, was sentenced
in absentia.
	   The Court of First Instance also fined another newspaper,
al-Siyasa, 100 Kuwaiti dinar (dlrs 306) for publishing pictures of
women revealing more body than allowed by Islamic societies. The
newspaper was given a suspended sentence of a one-week publication
ban.
	   The joke in al-Qabas daily was published Jan. 5 in its
entertainment page. Editor Mohammed Jassim al-Saqar defended its
publication, saying ``it was only a joke.''
	   In any case, he does not vet the entertainment page before its
publication, he said.
	   In the joke, a teacher asks his students: ``Why did God kick out
Adam and Eve from heaven?'' A student answers: ``Because they
hadn't paid the rent.''
	   Al-Saqar and freelancer Ibrahim Marzouk were taken to court by
the Information Ministry after some Islamic legislators objected.
	   Al-Saqar's lawyer, Imad al-Seif, said he will appeal because
``the sentence is too harsh and is not in harmony with the
charges.'' The court also ``did not take into consideration the
good intention of the editor,'' he said.
	   He said he will also appeal the court's order to close the daily
for one week.

Neighbor kills mother over rowdy children, then kills self 
</HEADLINE>
By MEKI COX
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ A man angry over the noise made by the four
children living in the house next door killed their mother in front
of the youngsters with a shotgun blast through his screen, then
took his own life.
	   George Coulson, 63, fired several rounds out his living room
window as Kim Eichhorn was getting into her minivan to go to work
Monday.
	   Mrs. Eichhorn, 35, was hit once in the face and died at a
hospital.
	   Police found Coulson dead on his living room floor, a gunshot
wound to his head.
	   Coulson ``was annoyed that the kids were out back making
noise,'' said neighbor Norma Guirate.
	   Coulson and Mrs. Eichhorn, whose row homes shared a common wall,
did not speak before the shooting began, said Jim Kedra, a neighbor
and friend of the Eichhorns.
	   Mrs. Eichhorn's four children, ages 5, 6, 9 and 12, watched the
slaying from the window of their brick rowhouse. Her husband was at
work.
	   Coulson and his wife, Florence, had feuded with the Eichhorns
for about three years, neighbors said.
	   But the tension quieted last summer after the families underwent
six months of counseling from the city's Commission on Human
Relations.
	   Mrs. Eichhorn ``was a good mom,'' said next-door neighbor
Stephanie Rodriguez. ``Her kids were wild sometimes, but all kids
are. If everyone felt like (Coulson) did, every parent would be
dead now.''

Pedroso matches season best in long jump, but no record 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES with men's and women's long jump
<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ World long jump champion Ivan Pedroso
matched his season's best result Wednesday at the IAAF Turin meet,
but landed far off the world mark.
	   The Cuban jumped 8.30 meters, 65 centimeters short of American
Mike Powell's 1991 world record.
	   Italian Fiona May scored 6.83 meters to win the women's long
jump.
	   In the 100-meter, Brazilian Andre Da Silva was fastest among the
men, while Nigeria's Endurance Ojokolo powered to first in the
women's competition.
	   Da Silvia crossed the finish line in 10.22 seconds at the
International Amateur Athletic Federation meet in this northern
Italian city.
	   Ojokolo, in 11.33 seconds, was far off the women's world mark of
10.49.
	   Pole vaulter Emma George of Australia failed to better her world
record of 4.59 meters, but she cleared 4.40 to win the event.
Russia's Tatiana Grigoryeva cleared 4.30 to finish second.
	   George has broken the world pole vault record 15 times,
including both indoor and outdoor records.
	   The men's 110-meter hurdles went to Cuban Anier Garcia, who ran
the race in 13.48, over half a second slower than the world mark of
12.91.

Ousted Rios grumbles about grass 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Marcelo Rios would rather be anywhere
but Wimbledon. And now he can be.
	   The No. 2 seed was bounced 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 by Francisco
Clavet of Spain in the first round Wednesday.
	   ``I'm leaving tonight, or tomorrow, but I've got to go,'' Rios
said.
	   Among other things, Rios was bothered by a line call that led to
him losing his serve early in the deciding set.
	   ``Well, we're in England, what do you expect?'' he said. Then,
he added, ``I'm just kidding.''
	   Kidding? Rios? Surely not when he hates the place, calling what
most people consider the greatest tennis tournament in the world
over-rated.
	   ```There are little things that are not very good at this
tournament, the organization, the transportation and all those
things,'' he said. ``They're a little bit down.''
	   Another gripe from Rios was that he didn't get enough time on
the practice courts. And he hates grass. Always has, probably
always will.
	   ``Grass is not a surface to watch tennis or to play tennis, it's
really boring,'' he said. ``You just serve, return and go in, and
that's it.''
	   But although Rios hates the event, he said it still hurts not to
be a part of it anymore.
	   ``I'm really disappointed,'' he said. ``I lost the first round
of a Grand Slam, and I thought I had a really good draw coming in
to the tournament. But that's the way it goes. It was a tough
match, he played good, and that's it.
	   ``But I'll come back next year. I think so. I'm going to try to
do better and have better preparation.''
	   Now it's a case of out of the tournament, out of mind. When he
gets back home it isn't Wimbledon he'll be watching.
	   ``I'll watch the World Cup soccer,'' he promised.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ In an apparent show of support for the
Catholic church in Vietnam, Pope John Paul II on Wednesday named a
Vietnamese prelate to a top Vatican post.
	   Monsignor Francois Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan was promoted from
vice president to president of the Pontifical Council of Justice

issues, ranging from international debt to criminal justice
matters.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ For Jennifer Capriati, playing at
Wimbledon for the first time in five years was a thrill in itself.
Winning was even better.
	   ``It's great to be back here,'' she said. ``It brings back a lot
of good memories. I was really pumped up. I was really excited to
be out there.''
	   Capriati overcame nine foot faults to defeat Australia's Nicole
Pratt 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 Wednesday, her first Grand Slam victory in five
years.
	   Her return to the All England Club came on a day when the men's
field lost three big names: No. 2 seed Marcelo Rios, No. 4 Greg
Rusedski and last year's runner-up, Cedric Pioline.
	   While Rusedski withdrew with an ankle injury, Rios and Pioline
both lost first-round matches in five sets.
	   Andre Agassi, the 1992 champion and No. 13 seed, was in danger
of elimination, too, trailing two sets to one against Germany's
Tommy Haas in a match suspended by darkness at 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4).

	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of
the radical Islamic group Hamas, returned late Wednesday to a
hero's welcome in the Gaza Strip after an extended fundraising trip
in Arab countries.
	   Yassin, a thorn in the side to both Israel and Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority, was greeted at the border crossing by about
150 supporters waving green flags and singing Islamic songs. A
larger celebration was set in his hometown of Gaza City.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The saga of Greg Rusedski's sprained
ankle took another twist Wednesday when it forced Wimbledon's No. 4
seed to pull out and prompted his coach to dump him.
	   Rusedski, going against the advice of coach Tony Pickard,
insisted on trying to play on his puffed up left ankle, sprained
almost two weeks ago in a Wimbledon warmup at Queen's.
	   On Tuesday, he limped into the third set against Australian
qualifier Mark Draper. It was even at one set apiece with Draper up
a break at 5-4 in the third.
	   Then rain mercifully ended play.
	   On Wednesday, with the ankle still stiff after morning practice,
Rusedski decided he couldn't play and pulled out.
	   And so did Pickard, who coached Stefan Edberg to his Wimbledon
titles. He said Rusedski was now relying more on the advice of
others and apparently didn't need him.
	   ``Over the last two weeks there was a total breakdown in
communication,'' Pickard said.
	   ``I didn't believe he should have played,'' he added. ``There
were outside influences telling him that he was going to be fit to
play. I didn't consider he was.''
	   ``Last night nearly killed me,'' he said. ``Sitting and watching
somebody ... almost destroying themselves out on the tennis court
was heart rending.''
	   Rusedski, who fired Brian Teacher as his coach and took on
Pickard nine months ago, is known for his strong will and tennis'
fastest serve.
	   He was also considered a serious contender this year, among a
half-dozen capable of dislodging Pete Sampras after reaching the
quarerfinals last year.
	   Rusedski accused Pickard of being disloyal by not supporting his
decision to try to play.
	   ``I guess that just shows the person's (Pickard's) true
colors,'' he said.
	   Pickard hit back quickly as the two appeared on British
television to explain themselves.
	   ``Maybe the young man would be a lot better to say nothing
because, if I was to elaborate for you, then I think you would all
tear him to pieces,'' Pickard said.
	   Rusedski's departure leaves the stage to British rival Tim
Henman, who's seeded No. 12 but has been overshadowed recently as
Rusedski has climbed to No. 4 in the ATP Tour rankings.
	   ``I was really optimistic going in Queen's,'' Rusedski said. ``I
thought I had a good chance to win the title and a good chance to
do well (at Wimbledon). I thought this year was really my year, but
it wasn't meant to be.''

Vancouver to extend its elevated rail system to ease traffic woes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Seeking to ease Canada's
worst traffic congestion, the provincial government Wednesday
announced plans for a 13-mile (21-kilometer) extension of
Vancouver's elevated light-rail system.
	   The dlrs 1.2 billion (dlrs 816 million U.S.) expansion of the
SkyTrain network includes a dlrs 450 million (dlrs 306 million
U.S.) deal with Montreal-based transportation giant Bombardier Inc.
to build SkyTrain vehicles at a new plant in British Columbia.
	   SkyTrain's existing 18-mile (29-kilometer) network carries about
140,000 riders a day between Vancouver's downtown waterfront and
four of its eastern suburbs.
	   British Columbia Premier Glen Clark said the expansion project
will create more than 2,000 jobs.

reported.
	   It said the Airbus A-300 with 238 passengers and some crew

Wimbledon's cozy corner: Court 11 AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ On a remote court at the All England
Club, while two players sweat and swear and swat shots, a spectator
nurses her baby.
	   Wimbledon's Court 11 is a place to find privacy.
	   Look elsewhere for the Duke and Duchess, Steffi, Andre or other
Wimbledon royalty. All that Court 11 can offer are empty seats and
good tennis.
	   Wednesday's matches _ Basuka-Reeves, van Lottum-Raoux,
Lapentti-Prinosil and Vasek-Mantilla _ may merit only a line of
agate in the newspaper. Still, they're Grand Slam competition in a
cozy, serene setting.
	   ``A lot of people don't realize this court is here,'' said
spectator Martin Taylor, who has been attending Wimbledon for 15
years.
	   ``You can see everything. It's very peaceful, and you're not
crowded. It feels like an English country garden rather than a
Grand Slam tournament.''
	   The layout of the outside courts at Wimbledon can be confusing,
as Venus Willams will attest. She had trouble locating Court 13 and
arrived 10 minutes late for her match Tuesday, meaning she was
within five minutes of being defaulted.
	   Court 11 is even more remote _ past the Fred Perry statue at the
main entrance and beyond Courts 3 through 10, near Somerset Road in
the southwest corner of the grounds.
	   It's difficult to reach because the narrow walkways are more
crowded than London's subway system at rush hour. This is where
Wimbledon gets physical _ bumping, pushing and even an accidental
elbow to the ribs are inevitable in such heavy traffic.
	   But at the end of the last walkway, the crowd dissipates,
leaving a patch of lawn, a couple of players and about a hundred
spectators.
	   There are three rows of seats on one side, one row of benches on
the other side and eight-foot-high hedges behind both baselines.
The atmosphere is such that fans whisper, even during changeovers.
	   For them, the rest of the tournament is a rumor. Although
applause float across the grounds from other courts, their
significance is unclear. The scoreboard on Centre Court's
ivy-covered outside wall is too far away to read the names.
	   There's a manually operated scoreboard for Court 11, and
spectators need it to keep track of the players, much less the
score.
	   The bookish fellow with glasses and bleached grayish hair who
resembles an accountant from the village up the hill? That's
Guillaume Raoux of France.
	   The blonde with the grim expression who keeps looking into the
stands at her coach, or possibly her mother? That's Samantha Reeves
from the United States.
	   Player reviews regarding Court 11 are mixed.
	   ``I don't like it,'' Raoux says. ``I don't like the atmosphere,
with people walking all around. It's the only Grand Slam like this.
It's distracting. It's an amateur tournament.''
	   ``It's still Wimbledon,'' Dutchman John van Lottum counters.
``Whatever court you're on, it's an honor to play at Wimbledon.''
	   As the tone of the comments would suggest, van Lottum beat Raoux
in four sets.
	   The best match of the day is the last one, with Felix Mantilla
edging Radomir Vasek in four tense sets. On the final point,
Mantilla slams a backhand return past Vasek and shouts ``Ahhhhh!''
in satisfaction.
	   The crowd applauds, and Court 11 has another winner.

Gore warns high-tech executives to protect privacy 
</HEADLINE>
By TED BRIDIS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore warned high-tech
executives Wednesday that the government will impose new laws
unless their industry develops ways to better protect consumer
privacy on the Internet.
	   Gore said the government is willing to give companies the chance
to come up with their own privacy solutions before looking at new
laws, but warned: ``If not, we will be obliged to take action
ourselves.''
	   ``People will not put their faith, their trust or their cash
into electronic commerce if they feel that in order to buy a
product, they must first sell their privacy,'' Gore said in a
speech sent by satellite to the World Congress on Information
Technology in nearby Fairfax, Va.
	   Gore added: ``We ought to start with strong, private-sector
efforts, like self-regulation.''
	   The Clinton administration has urged businesses that sell
products on the Internet to better protect the information they
collect about customers, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses
and tastes in reading and products. Some Web sites sell the
information to third-party advertisers and others.
	   Privacy advocates have complained that the online industry has
done a poor job, and they've urged the administration to adopt
tough new laws now. The White House has said it's worried about
stifling the growth of fledgling electronic commerce.
	   Gore praised the announcement earlier this week by nearly 50
companies to form the Online Privacy Alliance, a trade group to
develop privacy rules for businesses.
	   The group has already urged online companies not to collect
information from children under 13 and to give consumers the choice
not to have their personal data collected.
	   But it hasn't yet announced how it will punish companies that
don't follow the rules, saying it will make that contentious
decision by Sept. 15.
	   ``As any 13-year-old can tell you, no enforcement means no
rule,'' Gore told executives. ``We must have enforceable rules for
privacy for electronic commerce. It's your commercial
responsibility, and it's our civic responsibility because the
public looks to the government for consumer protection.''

Hamas leader, a growing challenge to Arafat, returns to Gaza 11 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: COMBINES Urgent series; UPDATES with color from arrival,
Yassin heading to Gaza City home, Israeli official comment in graf
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of
the radical Islamic group Hamas, returned late Wednesday to a
hero's welcome in the Gaza Strip after an extended fundraising trip
in Arab countries.
	   Yassin, a thorn in the side to both Israel and Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority, was greeted at the border crossing by about
150 supporters waving green flags and singing Islamic songs.
	   Yassin's entry into Gaza from Egypt was delayed for several
hours, apparently so the sheik could rest before making the
crossing. Together with relatives and officials who waited for him
on the Palestinian side, Yassin headed directly for his home in
Gaza City where a larger celebration was planned.
	   Yassin left Gaza in late February, ostensibly on a short trip to
obtain medical treatment. During his four-month tour, he raised
millions of dollars for Hamas and bolstered its political backing.
	   Hamas vehemently opposes peace with Israel while Arafat supports
it. Yassin's popularity is seen as a potential threat to the
Palestinian leader at a time when the peace process has foundered.
	   A freshly spray-painted graffiti on a nearby wall proclaimed:
``The Islamic nation is very proud of Ahmed Yassin who ... can lead
the nation to victory from his wheelchair.''
	   During his tour, Yassin made fiery statements _ widely reported
in Israel _ praising suicide bombers and calling on Palestinians to
carry on an armed struggle against the Jewish state. Hamas has
killed scores of Israelis in suicide attacks.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai left it open until
the last minute whether Israel would allow Yassin to return to the
Gaza Strip. Israel controls Gaza's external borders.
	   However, Israeli officials have said they considered Yassin more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his movements can be
monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for the Israeli liaison unit to the
Palestinians, said Yassin, who travels on a Palestinian diplomatic
passport, was given ``a regular security check by Israel,'' and
allowed to enter Gaza.
	   Hamas supporters chanted ``God is Great,'' in Arabic as they
greeted the tired looking Yassin. Supporters carried the 62-year
old quadriplegic and his wheelchair on their shoulders to an
awaiting van, which was to drive him to Gaza City. Yassin did not
make a statement.
	   This marks Yassin's second triumphal homecoming to Gaza in nine
months. Israel was forced to release him from prison in September
to buy the freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents who were caught
trying to kill another Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
	   Yassin had served eight years of a life term for ordering the
killings of Israeli soldiers and Palestinians accused of
collaborating with the Israelis.
	   It remained to be seen whether Yassin's return would worsen the
rift between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. Several
high-ranking Palestinian officials were part of the welcoming
party.
	   Relations between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority took a
sour turn when Arafat's camp blamed an internal Hamas feud for the
death of chief Hamas bombmaker Mohiyadine Sharif, who was found
dead March 29 at the scene of a massive car-bomb blast in the West
Bank town of Ramallah.
	   But Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz Rantisi blamed the Palestinian
Authority and several high-ranking Palestinian officials and
security chiefs for collaborating with Israel in Sharif's death.
	   Rantisi was arrested in April and charged with endangering
national security. Earlier this month, the Palestinian Supreme
Court Rantisi released for lack of evidence, but he remains jailed.
	   Palestinian security forces routinely ignore court orders and
keep detainees in custody until their release is personally
approved by Arafat.
	   Last week, Hamas spurned an offer to join Arafat's Cabinet.

OPEC fights weak market with more production cuts could take take time; analyst quotes, no pickup AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout with details, OPEC acknowledging price rise
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers, fighting the weakest oil
market since the disaster year of 1986, said Wednesday night they
will slash production _ even though they acknowledged prices won't
rise instantly.
	   OPEC will withdraw almost 1.4 million barrels of oil from the
market every day beginning July 1, ministers said, adding to an
earlier round of supply cuts that failed to reverse the damage OPEC
itself created by deciding in the winter to pump too much oil.
	   The OPEC president, United Arab Emirates oil minister Obaid bin
Saif al-Nasseri, vowed that the new cuts will ``banish the
volatility so plaguing the market.''
	   But oil traders were not immediately impressed, and OPEC said it
might take months before a global supply glut is erased and prices
can bounce back by a few dollars per barrel.
	   ``It's a slow-burn fuse,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at
the London-based Center for Global Energy Studies. ``Then it's
going to go higher if they deliver _ dlrs 16 or more.''
	   OPEC confronted a pricing crisis that pushed its average crude
price below dlrs 11 per barrel last week _ less than half the
group's target price of dlrs 21 per barrel.
	   The cheap prices have been a bargain for consumers, including
gas-guzzling Americans, but a disaster for the oil producers, who
will have problems meeting their national budget targets if the
effort to rescue oil prices falls flat.
	   The Kuwaiti minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, told reporters
he would even consider further production cuts if prices don't
respond _ an idea echoed by his Algerian counterpart, Youcef
Yousfi.
	   Others in OPEC hope the latest measures, which are aided by
203,000 barrels in daily production cuts from non-OPEC members
Mexico, Russia, Oman and Egypt, finally can end their financial
nightmare.
	   OPEC made an ill-judged decision in November to raise its
output, just as the economic crisis in Asia was starting to choke
off the growth in global oil demand.
	   OPEC ministers met informally on Wednesday, and thought they had
a deal, until last-minute questions about Iran's likely compliance
forced some quick haggling that delayed the formal start of the
group's summer meeting until lat in the night.
	   Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh assured his OPEC
counterparts that his production cuts _ 190,000 barrels _ will be
real.
	   OPEC did not immediately confirm the size of all cuts to be
made. But OPEC delegates said privately the cutbacks would be led
by the Saudis, who are chopping 425,000 barrels a day from their
production beginning on July 1. Venezuela has promised to cut
325,000 barrels a day.
	   Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria each pledged to cut
production by 100,000 barrels daily, with smaller cuts coming in
from smaller OPEC members, delegates said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Even Indonesia, which has faced the double whammy of an economic
collapse at home and lower oil prices, said it would remove 30,000
barrels from the market.
	   ``This is a powerful agreement,'' said Michael Rothman, senior
energy analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. Rothman said traders
may have initially pushed prices lower on news of the deal because
it was a bit confusing, but he predicted oil prices can rise by
several dollars if the producers stick with their promises.
	   Oil futures prices ended mixed. Light sweet crude oil to be
delivered in August rose 8 cents to dlrs 14.60 per barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude oil for August fell 31
cents to dlrs 13.61 on London's International Petroleum Exchange.
	   Other analysts have cautioned that OPEC needs to show that it
can deliver.
	   Despite the gravity of OPEC's recent problems, traders can't
ignore the fact that the producers in recent years have
persistently lacked the willpower to stick to their production
agreements.
	   The oil ministers held an emergency meeting in March, agreeing
to cut 1.245 million barrels of daily production. They delivered
most, but not all, of those cuts and prices plunged further,
leading to the latest effort to restrain production further.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Mine official says reservoir that caused toxic spill fulfilled safety requirements 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SANLUCAR LA MAYOR, Spain (AP) _ The chief engineer of the
Aznalcollar mining complex testified Wednesday that the reservoir
that burst two months ago causing a major environmental disaster in
southern Spain was as secure as it was legally obliged to be, news
reports said.
	   Aquilino Cazorla told the judge investigating the spill that the
Swedish-Canadian owner of the mine was not to blame for the spill,
the private news agency Europa Press reported.
	   Boliden Ltd's reservoir at Aznalcollar burst its banks on April
25 flooding thousands of hectares with acidic waste containing
heavy metal residues just a few miles (kilometers) from the Donana
National Park _ one of Europe's most prized nature reserves.
	   Cazorla denied an earlier testimony from a technician who
claimed the reservoir lacked the proper systems to measure leaks,
and added that the Spanish authorities were fully informed of the
safety measures in place at the mine.
	   ``Their silence authorized and allowed everything that was done
at Aznalcollar'' Europa Press quoted him as saying at the hearing
in the town of Sanlucar la Mayor located near the affected area.
	   Boliden has previously said that reservoir wall collapsed
because of uncontrollable underground movements. If proved this
would limit the company's responsibility for the damage caused.
	   In the meantime, the pace of the clean up operation has picked
up as the race continues to remove all the toxic sludge left by the
spill before expected heavy rains next fall increase the risk of
the contamination spreading to Donana.
	   The reserve provides shelter for millions of migratory birds and
houses threatened species such as lynx and imperial eagle.

Holbrooke meets with KLA fighters in Kosovo more talks Thursday, color, Rugova call for NATO intervention, other details. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Holbrooke back in Belgrade, quotes,
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke traveled
into the heart of the Kosovo conflict Wednesday to meet with ethnic
Albanian militants for the first time, broadening efforts to end
the fighting before all-out war erupts.
	   Against a backdrop of burned-out houses, devastated villages,
explosions and gunfire, Holbrooke declared it was time for Serb
security forces to ``get out of here.''
	   His tour of heavy fighting areas in the secessionist Yugoslav
province highlighted a shuttle diplomacy mission that many see as a
last-ditch bid to stop the conflict before NATO intervenes.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died since
fighting escalated in March between Serb-led army and police forces
and the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   NATO sent jets zooming over the region earlier this month to
persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop the campaign
against the rebels, but fighting continues unabated.
	   After telling Milosevic on Tuesday that time for a peaceful end
to the violence is running out, Holbrooke planned to talk Thursday
with the president again and a Russian diplomat before returning to
Kosovo and meeting with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   But if Milosevic were close to agreeing to a cease-fire and
pullback as the West demands, Holbrooke, who helped persuade him to
sign a peace settlement to end the war in Bosnia, gave no signs.
	   ``This is all part of a process,'' he told CNN before heading
back to Belgrade late Wednesday. ``I wouldn't want to get your
expectations up that we're going to have any breakthroughs, because
the situation is quite difficult.''
	   On a nearly 200-mile (320-kilometer) tour of western Kosovo,
Holbrooke rode with three ethnic Albanian officials and had
protection for his 14-car convoy from a truckload of Serb security
forces carrying automatic rifles.
	   He played down his talks with two KLA leaders in the town of
Junik, calling them only unofficial meetings with ``armed men, some
of whom were in UCK uniforms'' _ a reference to the
Albanian-language initials for the KLA.
	   But observers saw the unprecedented meeting as tacit recognition
that the fast-growing KLA, which has the support of increasing
numbers of Kosovo's majority Albanians, must be taken into account
in any political settlement.
	   In a scene sure to anger Milosevic, Holbrooke shook hands with
the fighters in the besieged western town of Junik, near the
Albanian border, and posed for photographs with them. Along with
two other U.S. diplomats, he met with them for 45 minutes, seated
on the floor of a house inside the village.
	   ``These people are beleaguered and they don't have supplies,''
he said afterward. ``The situation is explosive. Serb security
forces are all over the place.''
	   He and the U.N. and other officials who accompanied him also
toured the towns of Djakovica and badly shelled Decane, where he
cited the charred houses with missing roofs as evidence of Serb
wrongdoing.
	   This is ``the kind of action we saw earlier in this part of the
world,'' he said, a reference to Bosnia. ``The Serbs should get out
of here, and the original inhabitants should come back and rebuild
their houses with government help.''
	   Serbian civilians along the route greeted the convoy with the
three-finger Serbian victory sign. Serbia is the dominant of two
republics remaining in Yugoslavia; in Kosovo, ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1.
	   A shootout between Serb forces and KLA fighters erupted around a
convoy of reporters that was a half-mile (a kilometer) away from
Holbrooke, and evidence of fighting was plentiful throughout the
trip. Explosions and gunfire could be heard, and Serb armored
personnel carriers and military convoys were on the road.
	   In Brussels, Rugova appealed for NATO to use its military might
to end the worsening violence.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana met Rugova and insisted
Serbs and Albanians return to the negotiating table without
conditions. Solana also stressed the NATO allies support a return
to autonomy in Kosovo, but not the independence sought by both
Rugova and Albanian militants.
	   In 1989, Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy and has since
ruled the province with virtual martial law.

`ER' actor, film producer join calls for more autism research 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Hollywood producer Jonathan Shestack and actor
Anthony Edwards spoke up Wednesday for a congressional effort to
boost autism research and education.
	   Shestack, father of an autistic 6-year-old boy, said the
developmental disorder long has been neglected by many scientists
and policy makers because its causes were misunderstood.
	   ``Parents of autistic children were told it was their fault,
that it was an emotional disorder caused by bad parenting,''
Shestack said at a congressional briefing. ``Nothing could be more
wrong.''
	   Autism now is believed to have biological, possibly genetic,
causes.
	   The disability affects communication skills, social interaction,
learning and behavior. Those born with it interact with others only
slightly and often do not speak. There is no cure, although early
intervention therapy can help minimize problems.
	   Edwards, who plays a doctor on a top-rated TV medical drama,
said autism affects many more individuals than the estimated
400,000 Americans with the disease.
	   ``The circle of family and friends and support around that
individual magnifies that number well into the millions,'' said
Edwards, whose cousin has an autistic child.
	   Two members of Congress have proposed legislation to increase
spending on autism research and education to dlrs 40 million a year
over five years, triple the amount now spent.
	   The additional money would be used to create centers for
clinical and basic research at five universities. The proposal also
aims to raise awareness among doctors for earlier diagnoses and to
boost research to find a cure.

Iraq will take action if U.N. sanctions not lifted 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with reaction to U.N. developments.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq, calling itself a victim of
``hostility and evil,'' on Wednesday threatened actions against
U.N. weapons inspectors if economic sanctions were not lifted
immediately.
	   The threat marked another dip in Iraq's rapidly deteriorating
relation with the inspectors following findings by U.S. Army
scientists that traces of a deadly VX nerve gas were found on Iraqi
missile warheads.
	   Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler told the Security Council
on Wednesday that the U.S. findings were ``utterly unambiguous.''
	   The weapons inspectors are having the warheads reanalyzed in
France and Switzerland to satisfy Iraqi demands.
	   If the results stand, they will undermine efforts by Russia,
France and China to end the seven-year inspection program and lift
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   The disclosure of the lab analysis came just as the Security
Council was going to meet to discuss the sanctions.
	   ``To say this now and to say it in this way is a political
trick,'' Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in Madrid, Spain.
	   The Iraqi government insisted that the U.S. tests were
``baseless and mere fabrications.''
	   In a statement signed by President Saddam Hussein, the
government said the inspectors had lied to support the United
States, which is deeply suspicious of Iraq's commitment to
disarmament.
	   The statement warned that Iraq would reconsider its relations
with inspectors if the sanctions were not lifted. It also warned of
``grave consequences'' but did not elaborate.
	   ``When other means to lift the sanctions fail due to the
hostility and evil of some parties, there will be no alternative to
the strategy ... to get rid of the unfair embargo,'' it said.
	   Iraq has never said what that strategy is. But since May, it has
threatened to take action against the weapons inspectors, who have
been overseeing the dismantling of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction under a cease-fire agreement that ended the 1991 Gulf
War to evict Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
	   Until the inspectors give Iraq a clean bill of health, the
Security Council will not lift the sanctions.

World Cup: Paraguay advances after 3-1 win 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ A 51-second header by Celso Ayala helped
Paraguay to a 3-1 victory over Nigeria Wednesday and into the
second round of the World Cup.
	   The victory over the already-qualified Africans made sure the
South Americans clinched second place in the Group D standings and
will now face host France in Lens Sunday for a place in the
quarterfinal. Paraguay held on to second by a point despite Spain's
6-1 thrashing of Bulgaria in Lens.
	   Ayala's header was the fastest World Cup goal since Bryan
Robson's 27-second strike for England against France in Bilbao,
Spain, in 1982.
	   After enduring 180 minutes of tedious, goal-less soccer against
Bulgaria and Spain, Paraguay needed less than one minute to hit the
target against Nigeria.
	   Francisco Arce swung over a free kick from the right and, with
the Nigerian defense stationary, Ayala jumped unchallenged to beat
goalkeeper Peter Rufai's attempted punch and head into an unguarded
net.
	   The goal sparked Nigeria's talented strikeforce into action and
the Africans, fielding only four of their regular starting lineup,
equalized in the 11th minute.
	   Nwankwo Kanu slipped an elegant pass through to overlapping
winger Tijani Babangida and the Ajax forward cut inside, was felled
by a Paraguayan defender, but still found the unmarked Wilson Oruma
13 meters (yards) from goal. Oruma, who plays for French club Lens,
side-footed home.
	   The Nigerians didn't ease off and Paraguay's star goalkeeper,
Jose Luis Chilavert, was kept busy, saving acrobatically from
Sunday Oliseh's shot, Taribo West's header and Rasheed Yekini's
shot all in the space of six minutes.
	   Paraguay started the second half in the same mood as in its
opening spell and Rufai had to dive at the foot of the post to turn
an 18-meter shot from Hugo Brizuela round the post.
	   But Nigeria wasted a great chance to go ahead in the 57th minute
when Yekini turned a defender and ran clear with only Chilavert to
beat but toe-poked tamely at the 'keeper.
	   It looked an even worse miss when Paraguay regained the lead two
minutes later.
	   There seemed little danger when Carlos Paredes fed Benitez with
a sideways pass. But the Nigerian defense allowed the Paraguayan
midfielder far too much room to shoot and he powered a rising shot
that brushed the fingertips of the diving 'keeper Rufai on the way
into the net.
	   The Paraguayans could have made it 3-1 in the 74th minute when
Rufai ran out of his area and lost the ball as he tried to dribble
around Jose Cardozo. The ball ran to Brizuela who had two defenders
to beat but shot well wide of the net.
	   But the Paraguayans made sure five minutes from the end when
Cardozo was left unmarked close to the Nigerian goal and spun to
fire an angled shot inside the far post.
	   Lineups:
	   Nigeria_Peter Rufai; Augustine Eguavoen, Ben Iroha, Uche Okafor,
Taribo West; Tijani Babangida, Garba Lawal, Sunday Oliseh (Godwin

Jets drop O'Donnell; sign Testaverde AP Football Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Quarterback Vinny Testaverde has found a new
home _ signing on Wednesday with the New York Jets.
	   Neil O'Donnell, who had been the Jets' starting quarterback
until midway through last season, was waived.
	   Coach and general manager Bill Parcells said the 34-year-old
Testaverde will be given a shot at being the starter.
	   ``Glenn Foley has the benefit of the doubt, but if Vinny plays
at a level which is clearly better, he would be the starter,''
Parcells said during a celebrity golf tournament in Montclair, New
Jersey.
	   O'Donnell's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said Parcells had indicated
what would happen during a phone call earlier in the week.
	   ``Bill said that because of Neil's unwillingness to rework his
'98 contract, he felt he would go in another direction and would
probably give him his release,'' Steinberg said Tuesday night.
	   Testaverde signed a one-year contract with an option for another
year.
	   ``This is an organization dedicated to winning with a head coach
who knows to do it,'' Testaverde said in explaining his decision to
sign with the Jets. He said as a free agent, he turned down an
offer that was for ``a million dollars more'' because ``this is not
about money. It's about winning.''
	   Testaverde's deal will give him dlrs 1.5 million this year and
if he reaches all his incentive goals, he could make dlrs 5
million, according to his agent, Mike Azzarelli. He said Testaverde
rejected a dlrs 2.5 million deal from the Cincinnati Bengals.
	   In 11 National Football League seasons, with Tampa Bay,
Cleveland and Baltimore, the 1986 Heisman Trophy winner has thrown
for 29,223 yards, 175 touchdowns and 183 interceptions.
	   After making the Pro Bowl two years ago by passing for 4,177
yards and 33 touchdowns, his numbers dropped off to 2,971 yards
passing and 18 TDs in 1997. He was waived by the Ravens earlier
this month after the team signed Jim Harbaugh from the Indianapolis
Colts.

Hamas leader, a growing challenge to Arafat, returns to Gaza

<TEXT>
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of
the radical Islamic group Hamas, returned late Wednesday to a
hero's welcome in the Gaza Strip after an extended fund-raising
trip in Arab countries.
	   Yassin, a challenger to both Israel and Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority, was greeted at the border crossing by about
150 supporters waving green flags and singing Islamic songs.
	   Yassin's entry into Gaza from Egypt was delayed for several
hours, apparently so the sheik could rest before making the
crossing. After being greeting by relatives and officials who
waited for him on the Palestinian side, Yassin headed directly for
his home in Gaza City where a larger celebration was planned.
	   Yassin left Gaza in late February, ostensibly on a short trip to
obtain medical treatment. During his four-month tour, he raised
millions of dollars for Hamas and bolstered its political backing.
	   Hamas vehemently opposes peace with Israel while Arafat supports
it. Yassin's popularity is seen as a potential threat to the
Palestinian leader at a time when the peace process has foundered.
	   In Gaza City, well-wishers gathered at the home of the
62-year-old sheik, who is quadriplegic and has hearing and vision
problems.
	   A freshly spray-painted graffiti on a nearby wall proclaimed:
``The Islamic nation is very proud of Ahmed Yassin who ... can lead
the nation to victory from his wheelchair.''
	   During his tour, Yassin made fiery statements _ widely reported
in Israel _ praising suicide bombers and calling on Palestinians to
carry on an armed struggle against the Jewish state. Hamas has
killed scores of Israelis in suicide attacks.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai left it open until
the last minute whether Israel would allow Yassin to return to the
Gaza Strip. Israel controls Gaza's external borders.
	   However, Israeli officials have said they considered Yassin more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his movements can be
monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for the Israeli liaison unit to the
Palestinians, said Yassin, who travels on a Palestinian diplomatic
passport, was given ``a regular security check by Israel,'' and
allowed to enter Gaza.
	   Hamas supporters chanted ``God is Great,'' in Arabic as they
greeted the tired looking Yassin. Supporters carried the
quadriplegic and his wheelchair on their shoulders to an awaiting
van, which was to drive him to Gaza City. Yassin did not make a
statement.

World Cup: Spain beats Bulgaria 6-1 but fails to qualify 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Spain trounced Bulgaria 6-1 Wednesday for
its first World Cup win, but still failed to qualify for the next
round because of Paraguay's victory in the parallel Group D match
against Nigeria.
	   King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia looked on as Spain demonstrated
speed and skill unseen in its first two World Cup matches against
Nigeria and Paraguay. It controlled possession for much of the
game, although Bulgaria improved its performance in the midfield
and up front in the second half.
	   Fernando Hiero converted a penalty in the sixth minute _ sending
Bulgaria's goalkeeper Zdravko Zdravkov to his right by placing a
shot into the opposite side of the net _ after defender Ivaylo
Iordanov brought down Luis Enrique as he broke into the Bulgarian
box from the left.
	   Twelve minutes later, Joseba Etxeberria raced down the right to
cross to the Barcelona all-rounder, who beat two Bulgarian
defenders to send the ball from 8 meters past the advancing
Zdravkov into the far, right side of the goal.
	   Spain pressed on with a series of flowing attacks, with a pace
Bulgaria's aging veterans could not match.
	   Bulgaria's star attackers Hristo Stoickov and Emil Kostadinov
were marked handily by Rafael Alkorta and Miguel Nadal, who allowed
very little past them.
	   Luis Enrigue set up Spain's third goal on a on a fast break from
midfield in the 53rd minute, finding Francisco Morientes who
drilled it low from 14 meters into the keeper's left-hand corner.
	   Three minutes later, Bulgaria made it 3-1 when Kostadinov
swiveled around and fired from 12 meters out, squeezing the ball
between Alkorta and Zubizarreta and hitting the left post before
bouncing into the net.
	   In the 80th minute Raul Gonzales flicked the ball to the
unmarked Morientes at the edge of the area. The Real Madrid striker
pushed it past the diving Zdravkov from 6 meters.
	   Nine minutes later, Zdravkov elbowed the ball in after a header
by Kiko Narvaez bounced off the crossbar.
	   Spain made it 6-1 three minutes into injury time, when Kiko took
the ball down from a cross from the left, turned and shot it
between Zdravkov's legs.
	   But by that time there was no joy ampong the Spanish players.
They were aware that Paraguay had just beaten Nigeria 3-1, thus
qualifying for the next phase instead of the third-placed
Spaniards.
	   Lineups:
	   Spain _ Andoni Zubizarreta, Carlos Aguilera, Rafael Alkorta,
Miguel Angel Nadal, Sergi Barjuan, Fernando Hierro, Guillermo Amor,
Joseba Etxeberria (Raul Gonzales, 51st minute), Luis Enrique
Martinez (Julen Guerrero 70th minute), Fernando Morientes, Alfonso
Perez (Kiko Narvaez 65th minute).
	   Bulgaria _ Zdravko Zdravkov, Radostin Kischishev, Trifon Ivanov,
Ivaylo Iordanov, Gocho Guintchev, Krassimir Balakov, Anatoli Nankov
(Luboslav Penev, 28th minute), Daniel Borimirov, Georgi Batchev,
Emil Kostadinov, Hristo Stoichkov (Ilian Iliev, 46th minute).

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A referendum on a West Bank troop withdrawal
would be preceded by weeks of campaigning, including TV and radio
spots and canvassing, the justice minister said Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu favors such a nationwide
opinion poll, believing it would silence far-right opponents who
have threatened to topple him over a troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu was expected to make a final decision in time for the
weekly Cabinet meeting Sunday, said an Israeli official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   A referendum would delay an Israeli troop pullback by at least
two more months and has been denounced by the Palestinians and
Israeli opposition leaders as a waste of time.
	   In Washington, State Department officials again urged Israel to
approve a U.S. proposal for turning over 13 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinian Authority and said a referendum may not a
good idea if it adds to the delay. State Department spokesman James
Rubin said if a referendum ``involves significant delay of any
breakthrough, that would be of concern to us.''

Tiger aims to get out of the Woods at Western AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   LEMONT, Illinois (AP) _ Not even the Nike advertising gurus
could have come up with something this good: a victorious Tiger
Woods strolling up the 18th fairway at last year's Western Open
with thousands of fans in tow.
	   Fast forward a year. The crowds are still there, but Woods' game
isn't nearly as commanding. He's got just one victory in his last
19 starts, and he wasn't a factor in last week's U.S. Open. He's
struggling, as much as Tiger Woods can.
	   What better time for Woods to return to the Western Open, which
starts Thursday at Cog Hill Golf and Country Club's Dubsdread
course in suburban Chicago.
	   ``For some reason, I've always loved this site,'' the defending
champion said. ``I've always felt comfortable here. ... It's easier
to have your confidence come back if you're struggling and get it
back because you've come to a course that sets up well for you.''
	   Woods knows exactly what's wrong with his game. He thinks he's
driving better and with more control. Even his bad shots feel _ and
look _ better than they did last year.
	   But instead of attacking the greens, he's playing more
cautiously. Rather than firing straight at the pin and ending up
with close putts, he's going for safe shots that simply get him on
the green.
	   ``I guess I am not as comfortable with my swing as I was last
year at this time or the majority of last year,'' he said. ``I'm
playing a little more conservative, a little more safe. Just kind
of firing toward the safe side a lot.
	   ``Your golf swing is not always going to be good,'' he added.
``You can always work on it, and, hopefully, it will evolve to
where it's good, to where it's more consistent.''
	   A few days at Cog Hill could be just what he needs. Woods said
the 7,037-yard (6,404-meter), par-72 course is better suited to his
game than the tight Olympic Course. Cog Hill has some tight holes,
but it also has plenty of long, wide-open holes perfect for Woods'
booming drives.
	   But what Woods likes most is the comfortable feeling he has when
he walks onto the course.
	   ``Certain putts out there I already know instinctively which way
it goes,'' he said. ``Even though it looks to go left, it goes
right. Little things like that I've kind of picked up.''
	   Having already won on this course helps, too.
	   ``I know what it takes to win at this site,'' he said. ``Plus,
also you have some pretty good flashbacks, pretty good memories
which you can probably recall.''
	   Like his walk up the 18th, with thousands of people following
him. That picture is everywhere Woods turns this week _ on
billboards, on maps, on the program.
	   As much as his 12-stroke victory at the Masters, that scene has
become symbolic of Tigermania.
	   ``I heard them. I heard the stomping of the feet, but I was not
about to look back,'' he said. ``When I got up on the green,
though, that's when I looked back. That's what was pretty
impressive.''
	   And even if he doesn't have his best game, Woods is still the
one Western Open fans want to see. U.S. Open winner Lee Janzen is
playing, as is runner-up Payne Stewart. Masters winner Mark O'Meara
and British Open champion Justin Leonard also are in the field.
	   Tom Watson, who has played in 24 of the last 26 Western Opens,
pulled out earlier this week with a shoulder injury.
	   ``It's an honor when you are in that kind of position, people
think that highly of you, want to come out and watch you play,''
Woods said. ``I'd rather have it this way than people say, `Tiger
who?' and `I don't want to watch him, he can't play.'''

Hartford dedicates long-forgotten monument of baseball great

<TEXT>
	   HARTFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ A monument to Puerto Rican baseball
great Roberto Clemente was dedicated in a city park Wednesday,
nearly three decades after it was commissioned and then never
claimed.
	   The 6-foot-tall (1.8-meter-tall) granite monument was discovered
last fall in a debris-strewn lot in Bridgeport, Connecticut by
police officers.
	   When Hartford Councilman Luis Ayala heard about the fate of the
monument, a duplicate of one erected in Bridgeport, he decided it
must be brought to the Connecticut capital.
	   ``I felt it was important that the first Puerto Rican ever to be
inducted into the Hall of Fame be honored in our city,'' Ayala told
the largely Latino crowd at Colt Park.
	   Clemente, who played right field for the Pittsburgh Pirates,
died when his chartered plane crashed on Dec. 31, 1972, while
carrying humanitarian aid to Nicaraguan earthquake victims.
Connecticut's Latino community honored him with the pair of
monuments, one of which has been installed for years in
Bridgeport's Seaside Park.
	   About one-third of Hartford's 120,000 residents are Puerto
Ricans.
	   A Latino radio station began the effort years ago to bring the
Clemente monument to Hartford. But the monument never came because
the city had no professional baseball park, Ayala said. Then, he
said, everybody just forgot about it.
	   The monument was stored behind a furniture store in Bridgeport
and was gathering dust until police stumbled onto it.
	   Earlier this year, after news stories on forgotten monument, a
committee was formed to bring it to Hartford. It was escorted to
the city by members of the University of Hartford baseball team,
who carried the heavy monument out of the cramped lot in Bridgeport
and put it on a truck donated by two Hartford businesses.
	   Deputy Mayor Frances Sanchez was among those attending
Wednesday's ceremony at the newly dedicated Roberto Clemente Field
in Colt Park. She recalled how her former husband, Sadi Sanchez,
had grown up playing baseball with Roberto Clemente back in Puerto
Rico.
	   ``He used to tell us that he and Roberto would share the same
glove because they both were so poor,'' she said.
	   Roberto Clemente Jr, who does Spanish-language broadcasts of New
York Yankee games for Madison Square Garden, said he and countless
others have been inspired by his father's example of community
service and humanitarian acts.
	   Although he himself never made it to the major leagues because
of injuries, the son, a resident of Dobbs Ferry, New York, said his
father's life convinced him that being a good person is more
important than being a good baseball player.
	   Those sentiments also are expressed on the monument that now
stands behind home plate at Roberto Clemente Field.
	   It reads: ``The test of mankind's progress is not whether we add
more to the abundance of those who have much. It is whether we
provide enough for those who have too little.''

Capriati: ``I have no regrets'' AP Tennis Writer 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: AMS; RECASTS with new material throughout
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Five years after Jennifer Capriati
last played Wimbledon and won a Grand Slam match, she returned as a
wild card Wednesday, full of hope for the future and insisting she
regrets nothing of her past.
	   Her weight up and ranking down at No. 151, Capriati drew a large
crowd to Court 18, where she edged Australia's Nicole Pratt 6-4,
3-6, 6-4 despite nine foot-faults and six double-faults.
	   ``It brings back a lot of good memories,'' said the 22-year-old
Capriati, a quarterfinalist in 1993.
	   The memory of one miserably missed call by linesmen and the
umpire in the darkening evening Wednesday may cause sleepless
nights by 1992 champion and No. 13 seed Andre Agassi, who left the
grounds one set from elimination in the second round.
	   On a day when three of the top eight men's seeds lost _ No. 2
Marcelo Rios, No. 4 Greg Rusedski and No. 8 Cedric Pioline, last
year's runner-up _ Agassi trailed Germany's Tommy Haas two sets to
one when the match was suspended at 8:50 p.m.
	   Agassi angrily stabbed the spot beyond the baseline _ six inches
long and wide _ where he and a wildly jeering Centre Court crowd
saw a crucial ball land, but the linesmen sat impassively, the
umpire shook his head, and Haas waited across the net.
	   Television replays confirmed that Agassi was right, that the
forehand by Haas was out both ways, but the call stood and gave
Haas a 6-3 lead in the third-set tiebreaker. Agassi saved one set
point, but succumbed on the next to fall behind 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (4).
	   Meanwhile, defending champion Pete Sampras and two-time
runner-up Goran Ivanisevic cruised in straight sets, and French
Open champion Carlos Moya needed five sets to get past India's
Mahesh Bhupathi.
	   In other women's matches, Lindsay Davenport, Steffi Graf, Monica
Seles and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario advanced, and No. 9 Amanda
Coetzer was ousted in three sets by Naoko Sawamatsu.
	   The romance between Capriati and Wimbledon began when she was
14, a precocious talent with a toothy smile whose debut on Centre
Court had the air of a coronation.
	   Princess Diana came to see her, fans went wild for her, and
British newspapers splashed her ponytailed portrait on front pages,
dubbing her the heir apparent to Graf and Martina Navratilova.
	   Capriati justified that hype back in 1990, becoming the youngest
player in history to win a match at Wimbledon and going on to reach
the fourth round. A year later she became the youngest wowan to
reach the Wimbledon semifinals when she beat Navratilova in the
quarters _ her earliest exit from the All England Club in 14 years.
	   But the much-chronicled decline in Capriati's career began in
1992, and after falling in the first round of the 1993 U.S. Open
she was gone from the game. The only news she made was bad news _
arrests for shoplifting and drug possession, followed in later
years by aborted comebacks.
	   Capriati, looking uncomfortable talking about her past after
Wednesday's match, turned frequently to an official in the
interview room in hopes of curtailing the session. Asked what she's
capable of achieving now, she sought to find a balance between
optimism and realism.
	   ``I have to believe in myself,'' Capriati said. ``I believe that
I can go all the way. If I don't believe that, I see no point of me
being here.''
	   What Capriati meant by ``all the way,'' she said, was something
different from what she might have had in mind five years ago.
	   ``Having it all, I guess, winning it or being at the top of what
I can do,'' she said. ``Maybe that's not No. 1. Maybe that's just
No. 5, you know, but that's fine. Whatever my best is.''
	   Always a baseliner, Capriati's greatest success against Pratt
came at the net. Capriati hardly missed a volley. She also played
intelligently and caught Pratt with several perfect lobs.
	   For all her problems over the past years, Capriati said, ``I
have no regrets at all.''
	   Regrets, she said recently, are ``like going back to the past
and like living in the past instead of accepting what is and making
the best of it and moving on.''
	   At this point, Capriati is trying to salvage what's left of her
career, knowing it's not too late at her age to put together five
good years if her body is willing and she can summon the desire to
play. She's been working at various times with two former coaches,
Tom Gullikson and Rick Macci, in Florida, and is seeking a new
fulltime coach.
	   Chris Evert, who has been close to Capriati from the start,
believes she is still just ``50 percent of the player she could
be.''
	   ``I'm pulling for her,'' Evert said. ``But she has to make a
commitment and get a coach, and I don't think those things have
happened for a few years. She's made a half-hearted commitment.
She's a good athlete who hits the ball as well as anyone else. but
I don't think she has made a commitment.''
	   Macci similarly assessed Capriati's game recently as being as
good as ever for pure ball striking, and that the only question is
how motivated Capriati is to climb back to the top. Capriati said
she agrees.
	   ``That's everything with me,'' she said. ``How bad I want it
(affects) how well I move, and movement is a big part of my game.
If I'm there in position, I can hit it. I guess you never lose the
touch, really. It's just everything else that goes around it, and
with me it's desire and fitness.
	   ``Right now, I want it pretty bad. So, yes, I'm really focused
and determined to play well.''

World Cup: Spain beats Bulgaria 6-1 but fails to qualify

Eds: UPDATES with Spanish coach's comment

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Spain trounced Bulgaria 6-1 Wednesday for
its first World Cup win, but still failed to qualify for the next
round because of Paraguay's victory in the parallel Group D match
against Nigeria.
	   King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia looked on as Spain demonstrated
speed and skill unseen in its first two World Cup matches against
Nigeria and Paraguay. It controlled possession for much of the
game, although Bulgaria improved its performance in the midfield
and up front in the second half.
	   ``I am sad, but life goes on,'' Spanish coach Javier Clemente
said after the match. ``The pride and prestige of the team were
clearly demonstrated.''

Catholic group urges Annan to send mission to East Timor 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Jamsheed Markur plans
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A British-based Roman Catholic
organization called Wednesday on Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
send a U.N. mission to East Timor as soon as possible to protect
those calling for a referendum on the territory's future.
	   In a letter to Annan, the Catholic Institute for International
Relations, based in London, urged him to send the team, to observe
``the emergent atmosphere of openness and protest, dubbed the `Dili
Spring''' in the predominately Catholic former Portuguese colony.
	   ``A visit from your officials at the earliest opportunity ...
would both support the processes of open debate and give Timorese
some assurance that their aspirations will be central to the
international negotiations now taking place under your auspices,''
the Institute said.
	   Other organizations joining in the letter included the Catholic
Fund for Overseas Development, the Catholic Institute for
International Relations, Christian Aid and Oxfam.
	   There was no comment from Annan's staff to the request. On June
18, however, the United Nations announced that Annan's special
envoy for East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, would visit Indonesia next
month.
	   Marker will be following up an proposals by Indonesia's foreign
minister, Ali Alatas, for moving negotiations forward on the
longtime issue.
	   The Catholic statement was issued after the new Indonesian
president, B.J. Habibie, promised to withdraw some troops from
disputed East Timor and allow its people greater freedom, according
to Bishop Carlos Belo.
	   Belo, co-winner of the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize, said he and
Habibie skirted the key issue of a vote on independence.
	   Habibie has ruled out a referendum in the former Portuguese
colony, which was invaded by Indonesian forces in 1975. Instead, he
has offered special status that would grant an undefined measure of
autonomy while keeping East Timor as Indonesia's 27th province.

Official: reservoir that caused Spanish toxic spill fulfilled safety requirements 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SANLUCAR LA MAYOR, Spain (AP) _ The chief engineer of the
Aznalcollar mining complex testified Wednesday that the reservoir
involved in a major toxic spill two months ago met safety
requirements, news reports said.
	   Aquilino Cazorla told the judge investigating the spill that the
Swedish-Canadian owner of the mine was not to blame, the private
news agency Europa Press reported.
	   The banks of Boliden Ltd's reservoir at Aznalcollar burst on
April 25, flooding thousands of hectares (acres) with acidic waste
containing heavy metal residues. The accident occurred just a few
miles (kilometers) from the Donana National Park _ one of Europe's
most prized nature reserves.
	   Cazorla disputed earlier testimony from a technician who claimed
the reservoir lacked the proper systems to measure leaks, and added
that the Spanish authorities were fully informed of the safety
measures in place at the mine.
	   Boliden blamed the accident on uncontrollable underground
movements. If proved, this would limit the company's responsibility
for the damage caused.
	   The cleanup operation has continued as workers try to remove all
the toxic sludge left by the spill before expected heavy rains next
fall increase the risk of the contamination spreading to Donana.
	   The reserve provides shelter for millions of migratory birds and
is home to threatened species like the lynx and imperial eagle.

Vietnamese prelate named to a top Vatican post jailing under communists

EDS: UPDATES throughout with background on prelate, including
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ In an apparent show of support for the
Catholic church in Vietnam, Pope John Paul II on Wednesday named to
a top Vatican post a Vietnamese prelate who was once jailed by
Hanoi's Communist regime.
	   Monsignor Francois Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan was promoted from
vice president to president of the Pontifical Council of Justice
and Peace, a body that often issues Vatican pronouncements on
global social issues, ranging from international debt to criminal
justice matters.
	   Thuan, 70, was named an archbishop in what was South Vietnam's
capital of Saigon in 1975 a few days before that government's fall.
The North Vietnamese then refused to recognize Thuan's appointment
and blocked him from carrying out his duties, Vatican Radio said
Wednesday evening.
	   Thuan was first jailed under harsh conditions, then taken to a
``re-education'' camp in the north. After various internments, he
was released in 1988. After a trip to Rome, the Vietnamese
authorities refused to let him come back, the radio report said.

Top Turkish businessman Haci Sabanci dies 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Haci Sabanci, number two in one of
Turkey's largest conglomerates, died of lung cancer Wednesday,
hospital sources said.
	   Sabanci, 63, had been suffering from cancer for more than two
years, his doctor was quoted by the Anatolia news agency as saying.
	   He was vice-president of the board of Sabanci Holding, Turkey's
second-largest conglomerate. Its 50 companies are involved in
tourism, textiles, food, autos, tobacco and banking, employ 27,000
people and had sales of dlrs 6.8 billion in 1996.
	   The Sabanci family -- headed by Sabanci's brother, Sakip Sabanci
-- was listed among the world's 100 richest by Forbes Magazine in
1997.
	   He is due to be buried Friday in Adana, where he was president
of the chamber of industry, the report added.

Close call costs Agassi before darkness halts match

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Andre Agassi walked off Centre Court
angry and on the verge of being upset.
	   A controversial call went against Agassi in a third-set
tiebreaker Wednesday just before play was suspended. Darkness
forced the halt with German Tommy Haas leading 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4),
and the second-round match will be completed Thursday.
	   Agassi complained when a forehand by Haas was ruled in, making
the tiebreaker score 6-3. Television replays showed the shot landed
long.
	   ``It was nearly six inches (out),'' Agassi protested to chair
umpire John Frame. ``It was out both ways. It was wide and it was
long.''
	   Agassi saved one set point, but Haas hit a backhand winner on
the next to take the tiebreaker.
	   Play was then suspended, and Agassi resumed complaining about
the ruling on Haas' shot.
	   ``In 12 years, I've never seen it miss that much,'' he told
Frame.
	   The crowd jeered the umpire and linesmen as they left the court.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion and No. 13 seed, earned his first
Wimbledon victory since 1995 in the opening round Monday against
Alex Calatrava.
	   He'll have an edge in experience if he can push Haas to five
sets. Agassi is 12-14 in five-setters, while the 20-year-old Haas
has played just one five-setter in his career.
	   Six of the 16 men's seeds have already been eliminated.

Italian officials says she'll bring case in Virginia to EU 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian foreign ministry official said Wednesday
she will bring the case of an Italian immigrant, sentenced to the
death penalty in Virginia, to the attention of the European Union.
	   The action by Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Patrizia Toia
is in line with Italy's stiff opposition to capital punishment,
which is not allowed in this country.
	   Italian government officials and various advocate groups have
spoken out on several other pending death penalty cases in the
United States.
	   No execution date has been set by the state of Virginia for
Rocco Derek Barnabei, who was convicted of the rape and slaying of
his girlfriend.
	   He has several avenues of appeals left.

World Cup: Spain beats Bulgaria 6-1 but fails to qualify awarding 5th Spanish goal to Kiko 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Bulgarian coach's comments, UPDATES with FIFA
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Spain trounced Bulgaria 6-1 Wednesday for
its first World Cup win, but still failed to qualify for the next
round because of Paraguay's victory in the parallel Group D match
against Nigeria.
	   King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia looked on as Spain demonstrated
speed and skill unseen in its first two World Cup matches against
Nigeria and Paraguay. It controlled possession for much of the
game, although Bulgaria improved its performance in the midfield
and up front in the second half.
	   ``I am sad, but life goes on,'' Spanish coach Javier Clemente
said after the match. ``The pride and prestige of the team were
clearly demonstrated.''
	   Fernando Hiero converted a penalty in the sixth minute _ sending
Bulgaria's goalkeeper Zdravko Zdravkov to his right by placing a
shot into the opposite side of the net _ after defender Ivaylo
Iordanov brought down Luis Enrique as he broke into the Bulgarian
box from the left.
	   Twelve minutes later, Joseba Etxeberria raced down the right to
cross to the Barcelona all-rounder, who beat two Bulgarian
defenders to send the ball from 8 meters past the advancing
Zdravkov into the far, right side of the goal.
	   Spain pressed on with a series of flowing attacks, with a pace
Bulgaria's aging veterans could not match.
	   Bulgaria's star attackers Hristo Stoickov and Emil Kostadinov
were marked handily by Rafael Alkorta and Miguel Nadal, who allowed
very little past them.
	   Luis Enrigue set up Spain's third goal on a on a fast break from
midfield in the 53rd minute, finding Francisco Morientes who
drilled it low from 14 meters into the keeper's left-hand corner.
	   Three minutes later, Bulgaria made it 3-1 when Kostadinov
swiveled around and fired from 12 meters out, squeezing the ball
between Alkorta and Zubizarreta and hitting the left post before
bouncing into the net.
	   In the 80th minute Raul Gonzales flicked the ball to the
unmarked Morientes at the edge of the area. The Real Madrid striker
pushed it past the diving Zdravkov from 6 meters.
	   Nine minutes later, Iordanov elbowed the ball in after a header
by Kiko Narvaez bounced first off the crossbar and then off
Zdravkov's back. But the goal was officially creditted to Kiko.
	   Spain made it 6-1 three minutes into injury time, when Kiko took
the ball down from a cross from the left, turned and shot it
between Zdravkov's legs.
	   But by that time there was no joy ampong the Spanish players.
They were aware that Paraguay had just beaten Nigeria 3-1, thus
qualifying for the next phase instead of the third-placed
Spaniards.
	   After the match, Bulgarian coach Hristo Bonev indicated he would
resign in the near future. ``I am a man of principles and after
this result, I can't contemplate continuing,'' he said.
	   Asked what changes he would like to make in the team, Bonev
replied: ``That you will have to ask the next trainer.''
	   Lineups:
	   Spain _ Andoni Zubizarreta, Carlos Aguilera, Rafael Alkorta,
Miguel Angel Nadal, Sergi Barjuan, Fernando Hierro, Guillermo Amor,
Joseba Etxeberria (Raul Gonzales, 51st minute), Luis Enrique
Martinez (Julen Guerrero 70th minute), Fernando Morientes, Alfonso
Perez (Kiko Narvaez 65th minute).
	   Bulgaria _ Zdravko Zdravkov, Radostin Kischishev, Trifon Ivanov,
Ivaylo Iordanov, Gocho Guintchev, Krassimir Balakov, Anatoli Nankov
(Luboslav Penev, 28th minute), Daniel Borimirov, Georgi Batchev,
Emil Kostadinov, Hristo Stoichkov (Ilian Iliev, 46th minute).

World Cup: Paraguay advances after 3-1 win 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Benitez quote, first name
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ A 51-second header by Celso Ayala helped
Paraguay to a 3-1 victory over Nigeria Wednesday and into the
second round of the World Cup.
	   The victory over the already-qualified Africans made sure the
South Americans clinched second place in the Group D standings and
will now face host France in Lens Sunday for a place in the
quarterfinal. Paraguay held on to second by a point despite Spain's
6-1 thrashing of Bulgaria in Lens.
	   Ayala's header was the fastest World Cup goal since Bryan
Robson's 27-second strike for England against France in Bilbao,
Spain, in 1982.
	   After enduring 180 minutes of tedious, goal-less soccer against
Bulgaria and Spain, Paraguay needed less than one minute to hit the
target against Nigeria.
	   Francisco Arce swung over a free kick from the right and, with
the Nigerian defense stationary, Ayala jumped unchallenged to beat
goalkeeper Peter Rufai's attempted punch and head into an unguarded
net.
	   ``Finally the goal arrived,'' said Miguel Benitez, who went on
to score Paraguay's second in the 59th minute. ``This is the result
of hard work by the entire team.''
	   The goal sparked Nigeria's talented strikeforce into action and
the Africans, fielding only four of their regular starting lineup,
equalized in the 11th minute.
	   Nwankwo Kanu slipped an elegant pass through to overlapping
winger Tijani Babangida and the Ajax forward cut inside, was felled
by a Paraguayan defender, but still found the unmarked Wilson Oruma
13 meters (yards) from goal. Oruma, who plays for French club Lens,
side-footed home.
	   The Nigerians didn't ease off and Paraguay's star goalkeeper,
Jose Luis Chilavert, was kept busy, saving acrobatically from
Sunday Oliseh's shot, Taribo West's header and Rasheed Yekini's
shot all in the space of six minutes.
	   Paraguay started the second half in the same mood as in its
opening spell and Rufai had to dive at the foot of the post to turn
an 18-meter shot from Hugo Brizuela round the post.
	   But Nigeria wasted a great chance to go ahead in the 57th minute
when Yekini turned a defender and ran clear with only Chilavert to
beat but toe-poked tamely at the 'keeper.
	   It looked an even worse miss when Paraguay regained the lead two
minutes later.
	   There seemed little danger when Carlos Paredes fed Benitez with
a sideways pass. But the Nigerian defense allowed the Paraguayan
midfielder far too much room to shoot and he powered a rising shot
that brushed the fingertips of the diving 'keeper Rufai on the way
into the net.
	   The Paraguayans could have made it 3-1 in the 74th minute when
Rufai ran out of his area and lost the ball as he tried to dribble
around Jose Cardozo. The ball ran to Brizuela who had two defenders
to beat but shot well wide of the net.
	   But the Paraguayans made sure five minutes from the end when
Cardozo was left unmarked close to the Nigerian goal and spun to
fire an angled shot inside the far post.
	   Lineups:
	   Nigeria_Peter Rufai; Augustine Eguavoen, Ben Iroha, Uche Okafor,
Taribo West; Tijani Babangida, Garba Lawal, Sunday Oliseh (Godwin
Okpara, 46th), Wilson Oruma (Finidi George, 69th); Nwankwo Kanu,

U.S. official to Japan: 'Act decisively' to revive economy 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVE SKIDMORE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Just back from Japan, the Clinton
administration's chief Asia economic troubleshooter urged officials
guiding the world's second-largest economy to quickly fulfill their
promises to revive it.
	   ``We remain very concerned about Japan's economic and financial
situation,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told
lawmakers Wednesday. ``It is critical that Japan now act
decisively.''
	   Meanwhile, the yen weakened on world currency markets as traders
tested Japan's resolve. It moved back toward the eight-year low it
hit before the United States and Japan spent an estimated dlrs 4
billion last week to prop it up.
	   After the hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations' economic
policy subcommittee, Summers offered no hint to reporters about
whether the United States would jump into currency markets again
soon.
	   ``We are prepared to intervene when it is appropriate and not
intervene when it is inappropriate,'' he said.
	   He said Japan must ``take concrete and early action'' to follow
through on its promises. These include cleaning up more than dlrs
500 billion in bad loans left on the books of Japan's banks after
the collapse of its property market in 1992, opening its markets to
greater competition and stimulating domestic growth. Summers
implied action must come before the effect of last week's
intervention fades.
	   ``There is a window of opportunity, but it won't always be
there,'' he said
	   The intervention, on June 17, drove the dollar down from 146.75
yen the day before to 133.72 yen two days later. But already it has
retraced half that movement, trading at 141.32 yen late Wednesday
in New York.
	   Three years ago, it was the yen that was strong and the dollar
that was weak. At its low in April 1995, the dollar fetched only
79.85 yen.
	   With the yen's freefall last week threatening to spur a new
round of Asian currency devaluations, Summers led a U.S. delegation
to Tokyo for emergency consultations. That was followed by a joint
meeting Saturday of finance officials from the world's seven
wealthiest countries. He stopped in Singapore and Indonesia on the
way back.
	   Japan's economy accounts for roughly half of Asia's output. So
pulling it from its worst recession since World War II is seen as
the key to reviving Asia, which has been hit by a series of rolling
financial crises over the past year, forcing international bailouts
of Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia.
	   Stabilizing the yen also is seen as the key to allowing China to
avoid devaluing its currency. Such a move almost certainly would
trigger further financial turmoil in Asia and would have been
particularly distracting just before President Bill Clinton's trip
to China this week.

Committee announces package of memorials to Princess Diana 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Adds details on memorial garden, local opposition.grafs 7-10
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A ``Diana medal'' for school children, a new
five-pound coin and a memorial garden are among the ways Britain
will commemorate Princess Diana, the government's advisory
committee announced Wednesday.
	   Ten months after the princess was killed in a car crash in
Paris, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown unveiled the
government's Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Committee's
``preliminary'' advice on five memorials to mark the princess' work
and life.
	   Choosing from more than 10,000 suggestions, the committee also
endorsed a proposal for developing community nursing teams to help
children with life-threatening or severely disabling illnesses.
	   ``The proposals which we have announced today were amongst the
most popular and appropriate we received, and we expect them to be
widely acknowledged as a fitting tribute to her life and work,''
said Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, who chaired the
advisory committee.
	   ``They recognize her concern for children and their families in
times of sickness, when practical support and advice can often be
as important as medical treatment. They also encourage children and
young people, whatever their own circumstances, to take an active
and exemplary part in the life of their local communities,
particularly in helping the more vulnerable,'' Brown said.
	   The five-pound coin (worth dlrs 8.30 at current rates) is
intended to be in wide circulation next year in time for Diana's
birthday of July 1, he said.
	   The memorial garden is planned for the area of Kensington
Gardens outside Kensington Palace, where the princess lived. Many
people who live in Kensington and nearby Chelsea oppose the idea,
saying it will bring draw too many people to the area, spoil the
park, and create too much congestion.
	   ``People are overwhelmingly against it. You can't imagine how
annoyed and angry people are. They are beautiful gardens and much
loved by everybody. We are not saying people can't come and enjoy
the peace and quiet,'' said Robert Buxton of the Princess Diana
Memorial Action Group.
	   The chancellor stressed that the proposal would be put out to
public consultation beginning in July.
	   He said he believed that when people saw the plans they would be
satisfied that the committee had dealt with some of the problems,
such as traffic.
	   Members of the committee include Diana's sister Sarah
McCorquodale, her butler Paul Burrell and her lawyer Anthony
Julius.

Hasek's goal is consecutive MVPs AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BUCKY GLEASON
<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Dominik Hasek established a standard
for National Hockey League goaltenders last year when he became the
first one in 35 years to be honored as most valuable player.
	   On Thursday, the Buffalo Sabres star could become the first
goalie to win the MVP award in consecutive seasons when the Hart
Trophy is presented during the NHL awards ceremony in Toronto.
	   ``If it happens, I couldn't imagine the feeling,'' Hasek said.
``It would be great. I can't control it anymore, but it would be
unbelievable for sure.''
	   Last year, the Dominator became the first goalie since
Montreal's Jacques Plante in 1962 to win the Hart. He played even
better this year in leading the Sabres into the conference finals
for the first time in 18 years.
	   In December, Hasek became the first goaltender since the 1920s
to record six shutouts in the same month. He had a 33-23-13 record
during the regular season with a 2.09 goals-against average and
.932 save percentage.
	   ``Since December, it was probably the best four months I've ever
played in the NHL,'' Hasek said. ``I had a lot of support from my
teammates. In the beginning, I didn't play well. The last four
months were my best.''
	   The Hart is given to the player who is most valuable to his
team. Hasek was the team.
	   He had 13 shutouts and gave up more than one goal in only 31 of
his 72 games for the Sabres, whose leading scorer, Miroslav Satan,
had just 46 points.
	   Pittsburgh Penguins forward Jaromir Jagr, who led the league in
scoring with 102 points, and Anaheim's Teemu Selanne, who scored 52
goals for a weak team, also were nominated.
	   ``I don't think there's any doubt (Hasek) is going to win it,''
Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ``As far as I'm concerned, he was the
best player in the league this year.''
	   Hasek solidified his reputation as the world's best goalie when
he carried the Czech Republic to the Olympic gold medal with a 5-1
record and 0.97 GAA. Jagr was a teammate for the Czech Republic.
	   Hasek faced more shots (2,149) than any other goalie. The Sabres
can't count on their hands and feet how many games he kept close.
His shutout total is the most in one season since Tony Esposito had
15 for Chicago in 1969-70.
	   Hasek is also one of three goaltenders up for the Vezina Trophy,
which is awarded to the league's outstanding goalie.
	   Others nominated were New Jersey's Martin Brodeur and
Pittsburgh's Tom Barrasso. Hasek won the award in four of the last
five seasons.
	   Nominees for other awards:
	   James Norris Memorial Trophy (defenseman) _ Rob Blake, Los
Angeles; Nicklas Lidstrom, Detroit; Chris Pronger, St. Louis.
	   Calder Memorial Trophy (rookie) _ Patrik Elias, New Jersey;
Mattias Ohlund, Vancouver; Sergei Samsonov, Boston.
	   Lady Byng Memorial Trophy (sportsmanship) _ Ron Francis,
Pittsburgh; Wayne Gretzky, New York Rangers; Teemu Selanne,
Anaheim.
	   Frank J. Selke Trophy (defensive forward) _ Craig Conroy, St.
Louis; Jere Lehtinen, Dallas; Michael Peca, Buffalo.
	   Jack Adams Award (coach) _ Pat Burns, Boston; Ken Hitchcock,
Dallas; Larry Robinson, Los Angeles.

Protesters firebomb labor ministry Caribbean-Guyana Violence.

Eds: UPDATES throughout with Wednesday's developments. INCORPORATES
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Police braced for more violent
demonstrations against Guyana's president Wednesday as they
continued to investigate the firebombing of the country's labor
ministry.
	   Police said security guards heard the bomb crash through a
first-story window Tuesday night, then spotted four men running
away as the flames spread. Firefighters quickly put out the fire.
There were no injuries reported.
	   The building is in the same block as President Janet Jagan's
offices.
	   Protesters, mostly blacks of African descent who support the
opposition People's National Congress, claim that Jagan's party
rigged Dec. 15 elections. Jagan's People's Progressive Party is
backed mainly by Guyanese of East Indian descent.
	   An audit of the election results, sponsored by the Caribbean
Community trade group, said the vote was fair.
	   Rain on Wednesday kept many protesters off the streets, but
police were bracing for a National Congress rally scheduled
Wednesday night.
	   During a week of demonstrations, protesters have clashed
repeatedly with police in the streets of downtown Georgetown. On
Tuesday, they threw firebombs at police, and officers countered
with tear gas. Dozens of people have been arrested.
	   Police said they were still investigating a small explosion at
the health ministry on Tuesday and a fire that swept through part
of the finance ministry on Monday. Two Canadian consultants were
injured when they jumped from a second-story window to escape the
flames.
	   The Caribbean Human Rights Network urged member states of the
Caribbean Community to denounce the demonstrations.
	   On Wednesday, the Barbados-based group called for the National
Congress to end its boycott of Parliament and recognize Jagan's
government.
	   National Congress leader Desmond Hoyte claimed Jagan's party has
refused to give opposition parties equal time on the floor of
Parliament. He also accused it of ignoring proposals to balance
power among ethnic groups.

Flamengo said to be negotiaiting for Ronaldo

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The Flamengo soccer team of Rio de
Janeiro is reportedly willing to shell out dlrs 100 million for
super star Ronaldo, local newpapers said Wednesday.
	   The Jornal do Brazil newspaper quoted Flamengo's vice-president,
Michel Assef as saying the team was on the verge of signing a
contract for Ronaldo's transfer from Milan's Internazionale.
	   ``We are going to go through with this deal,'' Assef told the
newspaper, adding that he thought dlrs 100 million would be enough
to pay for the rescission of Ronaldo's contract with
Internazionale.
	   He said the 21-year-old Ronaldo, twice voted FIFA Player of the
Year, would play for Flamengo for three years. He gave no further
details.
	   ``We were approached by a businessman who told us that a bank
was interested in Ronaldo's transfer to Flamengo,'' the player's
agent, Reinaldo Pitta told the O Globo newspaper. ``But I don't
think it's possible. He is happy where he is and besides he has a
four-year contract with Internazionale.''
	   The sports news daily, Lance said Banco Opportunity, a Brazilian
investment bank and asset management company would help finance
Ronaldo's transfer.
	   Neither Flamengo nor the bank were immediately available for
comment.

Indignation and bitterness sweep Brazil in aftermath of defeat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The optimism surrounding Brazil's
national soccer squad after two consecutive World Cup victories,
turned to bitterness and indignation in the wake of its 2-1 defeat
to Norway.
	   Sports commentators Wednesday were nearly unanimous in blasting
Brazil's lackluster performance and the game's referee.
	   For Armando Nogueira, a sports commentator of the O Estado de
Sao Paulo newspaper, ``Brazil's suffered a relapse and became the
lackluster and melancholic team it was before the World Cup.''
	   ``A Ridiculous Brazil Gives Norway Its Berth as a Gift,'' read
the newspaper's headline.
	   ``Brazil played very badly, without courage or determination,''
said commentator Jose Trajano of the sports news daily Lance.
	   The newspaper also sharply criticized referee Esse Baharmast
with a front page headline that read ``Thief - American referee
conjures up a penalty and hands Norway its victory.''
	   Norway clinched its victory in the last minute of the game when
Baharmast granted Norway a penalty which most commentators said
never was.
	   Lance quoted former referee Arnaldo Cesar Coelho as saying that
``by inventing a penalty, he (Baharmast) defeated two teams, Brazil
and Morocco.''
	   But Folha de S. Paulo quoted goalkeeper Taffarel as saying that
Junior Bahiano pulled the shirt of the Norwegian Tore Andre Flo.
``The judge was right,'' Taffarel said, according to the newspaper.
	   Brazil's defeat deprived Morocco of a berth in the tournament's
second phase despite its stunning 3-0 win over Scotland.
	   ``Sorry Morocco,'' read the headline in Brasilia's Correio
Brasilienze newspaper.
	   ``A Well-Deserved Punishment for Brazil'', said the Jornal do
Brasil.
	   ``It is unacceptable for a team that has won the World Cup four
times, to enter the field with no willingness to play,'' the
newspaper added. ``It was a pathetic loss to a team with no
tradition in World Cup play.''

With UN-Iraq Despite nerve gas allegations, UN envoy says relations going on as usual 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite the controversy over Iraq's
alleged use of nerve gas in warheads, relations between Baghdad and
the United Nations have been marked by greater dialogue and
openness, the specuial U.N. envoy to that country said Wednesday.
	   The envoy, Prakash Shah of India, met with the Security Council
on Wednesday afternoon following a report by the chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler.
	   Butler told the council that tests by a U.S. Army laboratory
found traces of deadly VX on Iraqi missile warhead shards _ casting
doubt on Baghdad's claims that it never weaponized the nerve agent.
	   After his briefing, Shah told reporters that since he was
appointed earlier this year, ``there has been greater dialogue
between the U.N. and Iraqi authorities'' and there was a ``greater
awareness that dialogue and openness'' will have a ``positive
effect'' for both sides.
	   He said the United Nations' relationship with Iraq was broader
than simply weapons inspections. Other facets include the
oil-for-food program, under which Iraq is allowed to sell limited
amounts of oil to buy food and medicine for its people.
	   Iraq has been banned from freely exporting oil since 1990 when
the Security Council imposed sanctions following President Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
	   The council has refused to lift sanctions until the weapons
inspectors certify Iraq has destroyed all weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Shah told reporters that the oil-for-food program was having a
positive effect, including more stable supplies of medicines and an
``arrest of the deterioration of water sanitation.''
	   ``On the other hand, the U.N. reports of the various agencies
... indicate there is quite a dramatic adverse impact of the
sanctions on the Iraqi population,'' Shah said, including higher
death rates and incidence of malnutrition among children.

Questionable penalties help knock out another underdog

EDS: UPDATES with late game results.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Once again, questionable calls by a referee helped
knock out a World Cup outsider from the second round of the
tournament.
	   Saudi Arabia and South Africa drew 2-2 Wednesday, after Chilean
referee Mario Sanchez awarded the Saudis two penalties in
situations that appeared dubious at best.
	   Underdogs from Africa, the Middle East and Asia frequently
complain that established soccer powers have the inside track in
when it comes to refereeing, and poor officiating has been a
contentious issue since the start of the current tournament. But in
the last two days it appears to have unduly influenced which teams
will play in the knockout rounds.
	   Still, an official of world soccer's governing body said that
the federation remained pleased with the overall level of
refereeing in the tournament.
	   ``The standard remains very, very high,'' FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper said Wednesday.
	   In the two Group D matches later in the day, Spain crushed
Bulgaria 6-1 but failed again to qualify for the next round, after
Paraguay beat group leader Nigeria 3-1.
	   Francisco Morientes and Kiko Narvaez scored twice, and Luis
Enrique and Fernando Hierro contributed one each for Spain, while
Emil Kostadinov got Bulgaria's only goal.
	   Although once considered a strong favorite to finish atop the
group, Spain's fate hinged on the outcome of the Nigeria-Paraguay
match, the Africans having already qualified.
	   Celso Ayala, Miguel Benitez, Hugo Brizuela, scored for the South
Americans, while Wilson Oruma tallied for Nigeria.
	   Wednesday's tie between South Africa and Saudi Arabia, after the
Shaun Bartlett had established an early lead for the Africans,
killed their chances of challenging Denmark for the second-place
slot in Group C.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Anti-British militants
detonated a car bomb in a border village Wednesday, wounding a
13-year-old boy on the eve of the election of Northern Ireland's
new compromise government.
	   The afternoon blast outside the main police-army barracks in
Newtownhamilton, about 40 miles (65 kms) southwest of Belfast,
followed several phoned warnings to police and Belfast media
outlets purporting to come from the outlawed Irish National
Liberation Army.
	   The small anti-British gang, which rejects the larger Irish
Republican Army's July 1997 truce, has rarely detonated car bombs
in its own campaign to undermine Northern Ireland and its
pro-British Protestant majority. Police estimated that the bomb
contained several hundred pounds (more than 300 kgs) of explosive.
	   An official at the area's Daisy Hill Hospital said the teen-age
victim had suffered a shrapnel wound along his upper chest and
right shoulder but was stable.
	   The blast was the first of its kind since IRA dissidents struck
two mainly Protestant towns with car bombs in February. It
underscored continuing militant opposition to the April peace
accord and to Thursday's election, the most important in the
77-year history of this British-ruled territory.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The lower house of Mexico's congress called
Wednesday for a review of anti-drug cooperation agreements with the
United States to ensure respect for Mexican sovereignty.
	   The resolution, passed by a standing committee while congress is
in recess, came in reaction to a Monday vote in the U.S. House of
Representatives to endorse a money-laundering sting that Mexico
claims violated its sovereignty.
	   It was the second time in two days that Mexican congressmen
denounced the U.S. vote. On Tuesday, the congress' International
Affairs Committee issued a communique accusing the United States of
violating the spirit of cooperation between the countries.
	   Mexican officials have said U.S. agents in the Operation
Casablanca money-laundering investigation broke Mexican law by
operating here without permission. They have threatened to seek the
agents' extradition.
	   The House resolution also said the United States should not
extradite agents involved in the operation that led to 167 arrests,
including those of several Mexican bankers.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police shot and killed a U.S. student trying
to escape a fight scene in a pickup truck, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Juan Lopez Chavarria, 24, died at a hospital early Monday
shortly after he was shot by police in Zacapu, 175 miles (280
kilometers) west of Mexico City.
	   Lopez, a California native, had been visiting his mother's
hometown when he became involved in a drunken fight with several
other young men late Sunday night, J. Felix Lemos Saldana, Zacapu
director of public security, said.
	   When a police patrol arrived, the men scattered; Lopez got into
his truck and tried to flee, Lemos said. An officer tried to shoot
out the truck's tires but a shot entered the pick up cab, hitting
Lopez in the lower back.
	   Four officers were being held Wednesday on charges related to
the shooting. One is accused of homicide, the others of
participating in a homicide, Lemos said.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A small homemade bomb exploded in
the bathroom of a private school, shattering windows and wounding
six students late Wednesday morning.
	   One student was hospitalized with an eye injury and the other
five suffered minor abrasions from flying glass, Detective Sergio
Olgador said.
	   ``It was probably students, but that is only a hypothesis at
this stage,'' said Olgador.

	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Construction workers hurled rocks
from atop unfinished high-rises and police responded with volleys
of tear gas Wednesday in clashes over a pay raise.
	   At least 12 policemen were injured _ seven seriously _ and at
least 37 construction workers were arrested in clashes across
Panama City, according to national police spokesman Jose Zamora.
	   After five months of negotiations, the two sides are still far
apart. The workers are asking for raises of 15 to 18 cents over
each of the next four years; they say the company is offering only
3 cents a year.
	   Construction workers make an average of dlrs 2 an hour; skilled
workers make dlrs 2.72.

	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Four firefighters died Wednesday after
natural gas canisters exploded while they tried to extinguish a
fire on a public bus, the police said.
	   The accident took place in El Alto, a city that borders La Paz.
The canisters are used by the mainly Aymara Indian residents for
cooking.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A former Honduran economic minister
was shot to death when he tried to stop six thieves from stealing
his car, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Orlando Funez Cruz, 60, was shot in the abdomen Tuesday night at
his home in Miraflores, a suburb south of the capital, Tegucigalpa.
He died in a hospital.
	   Funez Cruz, a lawyer and a leader of the opposition National
Party, was Economic and Commerce minister in the government of
President Ramon Ernesto Cruz, who was overthrown by the military in
1972. He also served as Planning and Budget minister in the
government of Rafael Leonardo Callejas from 1990 to 1994.
	   He is survived by five children.

New judge appointed to Dionne quintuplets inquiry 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The inquiry into the Ontario government's
handling of the world famous Dionne quintuplets is back on track
with the appointment Wednesday of a new judge to preside over the
case.
	   The province appointed Justice Gloria Epstein, of the Ontario
court's general division, to replace retired judge Gregory Evans.
	   The review was abruptly put on hold in May when Evans resigned
after speaking publicly about his findings. Evans told The Canadian
Press that he believed the Dionnes had been fairly compensated by
the Mike Harris government, suggesting he had prejudged the case.
	   The judge, 84, also said that the government had acted properly
when it removed the girls from their parents' home and put them on
display at a theme park called ``Quintland.''
	   A cabinet order says the province will do a full accounting of
what happened to the millions of dollars the girls earned from
commercial endorsements and appearances at Quintland.
	   The three surviving Dionnes, Annette, Yvonne and Cecile, are now
64 and live in Montreal on a dlrs 4 million settlement from the
province. They have asked Epstein to broaden the scope of the
second phase of the investigation.
	   In addition, Epstein has been asked to determine whether the
young Dionnes were treated fairly when they were taken from their
parents.
	   The Liberal government of the day believed their parents _ poor
francophone farmers from Northern Ontario _ were ill-equipped to
raise such media darlings and made them wards of the province. The
sisters grew up believing they would live as adults off the revenue
they generated.
	   But after retreating from the spotlight as young adults, the
Dionnes found themselves in virtual seclusion by their retirement,
living in near poverty together in a threadbare house in Montreal.
	   The women say they were exploited by the government and that
their treatment as children ruined their lives.
	   Epstein, a judge for four years, is a member of the Women's Law
Association and a member of the Ontario Starlight Foundation for
children.
	   In a news release from Montreal, the Dionne sisters said they
looked forward to meeting Epstein, whom they described as having
``impeccable credentials.''
	   She will provide the inquiry ``with the strong leadership it
needs to uncover the wrongs of the past,'' they said.

World Cup: Attacking Paraguay beats Nigeria 3-1 to advance 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional, UPDATES with quotes.
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Paraguay attacked, for a change. Nigeria
did not, for a change.
	   Celso Ayala scored Paraguay's first goal of the World Cup after
just 51 seconds and the South Americans went on to beat a listless
Nigeria 3-1 Wednesday to reach the round of 16.
	   Nigeria, which used just four regular starters in its lineup,
had already clinched first place in Group D by beating Spain and
Bulgaria for six points.
	   The Super Eagles face Denmark, second in Group C, in the second
round Sunday at Saint-Denis, while Paraguay _ with five points _
takes on host France at Lens the same day.
	   Spain finished one point behind Paraguay despite routing bottom
Bulgaria 6-1 Wednesday at Lens.
	   ``We are euphoric. We had to win and we did,'' Paraguay coach
Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani said. ``But tomorrow is another day and we
have to start thinking about the next round.''
	   Nigerian goalkeeper, Peter Rufai, warned not to read too much
into Nigeria's first loss.
	   ``There is no cause for alarm,'' he said. ``We took the game
seriously but not to the point of going out there willing to die on
the pitch, like we usually do.''
	   Paraguay immediately showed this match would be nothing like its
two dour 0-0 draws earlier in the tournament.
	   Ayala's header was the fastest World Cup goal since Bryan
Robson's 27-second strike for England against France in Bilbao,
Spain, in 1982.
	   Miguel Benitez brought the ball down the right flank and was
fouled along the side of the penalty area.
	   Defender Francisco Arce lofted the ensuing free kick and a
completely unimpeded Ayala was able to head home. He beat poorly
positioned 'keeper Peter Rufai to the ball and no Nigerian defender
made a serious effort to get there first.
	   ``Finally the goal arrived,'' said Benitez, who went on to score
Paraguay's second in the 59th minute. ``This is the result of hard
work by the entire team.''
	   After the disastrous start, the Super Eagles did not take long
to turn things around.
	   Ayala cleared a dangerous header from Augustine Eguavoen off the
line in the 10th, and no one stopped winger Wilson Oruma's shot one
minute later. Kanu released Tijani Babangida into the right side of
the box and the Ajax of Amsterdam sparkplug slipped by two
defenders before sliding the ball to an unmarked Oruma, who drove
it in from near the penalty spot.
	   Paraguay's flamboyant 'keeper, Jose Luis Chilavert, made three
reflex saves over the next six minutes to keep the score 1-1. He
pushed Sunday Oliseh's 25-meter (yard) blast just wide of the post,
slapped away a fierce header by Taribo West and then got a leg on a
15-meter (yard) shot from Rasheed Yekini.
	   But that was about all from Nigeria.
	   Paraguay came out strong after the interval, earning four corner
kicks in as many minutes and threatening to regain the lead in the
51st, when Hugo Brizuela's shot from the edge of the penalty area
was pushed aside by an outstretched Rufai at the base of the post.
Two minutes later, defender Ben Iroha cleared a loose ball off
Rufai's line.
	   Nigeria was on its heels, responding only in the 57th, when
Yekini's weak chance was scooped up by Chilavert.
	   And Paraguay's pressure paid off in the 59th, when Benitez took
a pass from Carlos Paredes, moved atop the penalty area and fired a
strong shot that skimmed off Rufai's fingertips and the underside
of the crossbar on its way into the net.
	   ``After a difficult first half, we increased the rhythm,''
Carpeggiani said. ``We showed tonight we are a team with a lot of
strength and will. We are dynamic.''
	   The Paraguayans could have made it 3-1 in the 74th, when Rufai
ran out of his area and lost the ball as he tried to dribble around
Jose Cardozo. The ball ran to Brizuela who had two defenders to
beat but shot well wide of the net.
	   But the Paraguayans made sure five minutes from the end when
Cardozo was left unmarked close to the Nigerian goal and spun to
fire an angled shot inside the far post.
	   Milutinovic defended his decision to rest the bulk of his
starting 11. ``We had problems with yellow cards and some
injuries,'' said the Yugoslav, the first coach to take four
different countries to the second round. ``We needed to protect
some players.''
	   Daniel Amokachi aggravated a twisted right knee warming up
before the game, while Oliseh left at halftime with a bothersome
left ankle.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A judge on Wednesday ordered
the release of three of five El Salvador national guardsmen
convicted of killing four U.S. religious workers in 1980.
	   The release had been expected since a law to reduce prison
crowding took effect in April.
	   Judge Gloria Platero said Daniel Canales Ramirez, Jose Roberto
Moreno Canjura and Luis Colindres were eligible for immediate
parole because, when time for good behavior is calculated, they
have served two-thirds of their 30-year sentences.
	   Two other guardsmen, Carlos Joaquin Contreras Palacios,
Francisco Orlando Contreras Recinos, were refused release because
of misconduct in prison.
	   It was not immediately clear when the three men could leave
prison.
	   Roman Catholic nuns Dorothy Kazel, Ita Ford, Maura Clark and lay
worker Jean Donovan were stopped on a rural road Dec. 2, 1980,
raped and shot to death during El Salvador's civil war.
	   The former national guardsmen were convicted of killing the
women, whom the military saw as sympathetic to leftist guerrillas.
	   Salvadoran officials insist the soldiers acted on their own. But
in April, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a New York group
representing the women's families, said the men now claim they were
following orders from superiors.
	   Church officials and relatives of the women asked for a renewed
investigation into the case.
	   But chief prosecutor Manuel Cordova said in June that it was
``not possible to reopen the case'' because the 10-year statute of
limitations has expired.
	   A U.N. commission earlier determined that the director of the
National Guard at the time of the slayings, Col. Eugenio Vides
Casanova, and Defense Minister Jose Guillermo Garcia had tried to
cover up the killings.
	   The National Guard was disbanded after a peace agreement in 1992
ended the civil war, during which more than 75,000 people died.

Indians trade Berroa to Tigers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ The Cleveland Indians traded unhappy slugger
Geronimo Berroa to Detroit on Wednesday for a minor league
outfielder, then claimed pitcher Tim Worrell on waivers from the
Tigers.
	   Worrell, 30, brother of retired Dodgers closer Todd Worrell,
takes the roster spot of Berroa, who has been asking for a trade
for weeks. Berroa, signed to a dlrs 2.2 million, one-year contract
before the season, was unhappy with a part-time role.
	   Worrell was 2-6 with a 5.98 ERA in 15 outings _ nine starts _
for the Tigers, who acquired him from San Diego in a five-player
deal last November. He is 18-29 with a 4.55 ERA in five-plus
seasons.
	   Outfielder Dave Roberts, 26, was batting .330 with 20 steals for
Double-A Jacksonville of the Southern League. He will report to
Double-A Akron.
	   Berroa hit .283 with 26 homers and 90 RBIs last season with
Oakland and Baltimore, but was batting .200 with no homers and
three RBIs in 20 games for Cleveland. He was on the disabled list
from May 3 to June 2 with torn tendons in his right foot and fell
out of favor with the Indians when he refused to accept a
rehabilitation assignment in the minors.

Committee announces package of memorials to Princess Diana 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Graf 7 adds fifth proposal, for walkway connected to garden. 
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A ``Diana medal'' for school children, a new
five-pound coin and a memorial garden are among the ways Britain
will commemorate Princess Diana, the government's advisory
committee announced Wednesday.
	   Ten months after the princess was killed in a car crash in
Paris, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown unveiled the
government's Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Committee's
``preliminary'' advice on five memorials to mark the princess' work
and life.
	   Choosing from more than 10,000 suggestions, the committee also
endorsed a proposal for developing community nursing teams to help
children with life-threatening or severely disabling illnesses.
	   ``The proposals which we have announced today were amongst the
most popular and appropriate we received, and we expect them to be
widely acknowledged as a fitting tribute to her life and work,''
said Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, who chaired the
advisory committee.
	   ``They recognize her concern for children and their families in
times of sickness, when practical support and advice can often be
as important as medical treatment. They also encourage children and
young people, whatever their own circumstances, to take an active
and exemplary part in the life of their local communities,
particularly in helping the more vulnerable,'' Brown said.
	   The five-pound coin (worth dlrs 8.30 at current rates) is
intended to be in wide circulation next year in time for Diana's
birthday of July 1, he said.
	   The memorial garden is planned for the area of Kensington
Gardens outside Kensington Palace, where the princess lived, and
will be connected to the fifth proposal _ a walkway shadowing the
route of Diana funeral procession to Westminster Abbey. Many people
who live in Kensington and nearby Chelsea oppose the idea, saying
it will bring draw too many people to the area, spoil the park, and
create too much congestion.
	   ``People are overwhelmingly against it. You can't imagine how
annoyed and angry people are. They are beautiful gardens and much
loved by everybody. We are not saying people can't come and enjoy
the peace and quiet,'' said Robert Buxton of the Princess Diana
Memorial Action Group.
	   The chancellor stressed that the proposal would be put out to
public consultation beginning in July.
	   He said he believed that when people saw the plans they would be
satisfied that the committee had dealt with some of the problems,
such as traffic.
	   Members of the committee include Diana's sister Sarah
McCorquodale, her butler Paul Burrell and her lawyer Anthony
Julius.

	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Police braced for more violent
demonstrations against Guyana's president Wednesday as they
continued to investigate the firebombing of the country's labor
ministry.
	   Police said security guards heard the bomb crash through a
first-story window Tuesday night, then spotted four men running
away as the flames spread. Firefighters quickly put out the fire.
There were no injuries reported.
	   The building is in the same block as President Janet Jagan's
offices.
	   Protesters, mostly blacks of African descent who support the
opposition People's National Congress, claim that Jagan's party
rigged Dec. 15 elections. Jagan's People's Progressive Party is
backed mainly by Guyanese of East Indian descent.
	   An audit of the election results, sponsored by the Caribbean
Community trade group, said the vote was fair.
	   Rain on Wednesday kept many protesters off the streets, but
police were bracing for a National Congress rally scheduled
Wednesday night.
	   During a week of demonstrations, protesters have clashed
repeatedly with police in the streets of downtown Georgetown. On
Tuesday, they threw firebombs at police, and officers countered
with tear gas. Dozens of people have been arrested.
	   Police said they were still investigating a small explosion at
the health ministry on Tuesday and a fire that swept through part
of the finance ministry on Monday.
	   One of two Canadian financial consultants who were trapped by
the fire indicated Wednesday that that too appeared to be a
firebomb.
	   ``We were sitting in our office and heard the sound of glass
breaking, following by a small thud. Within a couple minutes, we
smelled smoke,'' Glenn Mason, 32, of Ottawa, told The Associated
Press from his hospital bed.
	   Mason and a colleague jumped from a second-story window and
injured their backs.

OPEC fights weak market with more production cuts conform and add comments from secretary-general. AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS with OPEC confirming exact production cuts, editing to
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Fighting the weakest oil market since
1986, OPEC said early Thursday it will slash production _ even
though ministers acknowledged prices won't rise instantly.
	   OPEC said it will withdraw 1.355 million barrels of oil from the
market every day beginning July 1. The cuts will augment an earlier
round of supply reductions that failed to reverse the damage OPEC
itself created by deciding in the winter to pump too much oil.
	   The OPEC president, United Arab Emirates oil minister Obaid bin
Saif al-Nasseri, vowed that the new cuts will ``banish the
volatility so plaguing the market.''
	   But oil traders were not immediately impressed, and OPEC said it
might take months before a global supply glut is erased and prices
can bounce back by a few dollars per barrel.
	   ``I don't know about rapidly, but we expect prices to move in
the right direction soon,'' OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman
said early Thursday morning. OPEC said its new production levels
will stay in effect for one year.
	   ``It's a slow-burn fuse,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at
the London-based Center for Global Energy Studies. ``Then it's
going to go higher if they deliver _ dlrs 16 or more.''
	   OPEC confronted a pricing crisis that pushed its average crude
price below dlrs 11 per barrel last week _ less than half the
group's target price of dlrs 21 per barrel.
	   The cheap prices have been a bargain for consumers, including
gas-guzzling Americans, but a disaster for the oil producers, who
will have problems meeting their national budget targets if the
effort to rescue oil prices falls flat.
	   The Kuwaiti minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said he would
even consider further production cuts if prices don't respond _ an
idea echoed by his Algerian counterpart, Youcef Yousfi.
	   Others in OPEC hope the latest measures, which are aided by
203,000 barrels in daily production cuts from non-OPEC members
Mexico, Russia, Oman and Egypt, finally can end their financial
nightmare.
	   OPEC made an ill-judged decision in November to raise its
output, just as the economic crisis in Asia was starting to choke
off the growth in global oil demand.
	   OPEC ministers met informally on Wednesday, and thought they had
a deal, until last-minute questions about Iran's likely compliance
forced some quick haggling that delayed the formal start of the
group's summer meeting until late in the night.
	   Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh assured his OPEC
counterparts that his production cuts _ 190,000 barrels _ will be
real.
	   OPEC delegates said the cutbacks would be led by the Saudis, who
are chopping 425,000 barrels a day from their production beginning
on July 1. Venezuela has promised to cut 325,000 barrels a day.
	   Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria each pledged to cut
production by 100,000 barrels daily, with smaller cuts coming in
from smaller OPEC members, delegates said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Even Indonesia, which has faced the double whammy of an economic
collapse at home and lower oil prices, said it would remove 30,000
barrels from the market.
	   ``This is a powerful agreement,'' said Michael Rothman, senior
energy analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. Rothman said traders
may have initially pushed prices lower on news of the deal because
it was a bit confusing, but he predicted oil prices can rise by
several dollars if the producers stick with their promises.
	   Oil futures prices ended mixed. Light sweet crude oil to be
delivered in August rose 8 cents to dlrs 14.60 per barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude oil for August fell 31
cents to dlrs 13.61 on London's International Petroleum Exchange.
	   Other analysts have cautioned that OPEC needs to show that it
can deliver.
	   Despite the gravity of OPEC's recent problems, traders can't
ignore the fact that the producers in recent years have
persistently lacked the willpower to stick to their production
agreements.
	   The oil ministers held an emergency meeting in March, agreeing
to cut 1.245 million barrels of daily production. They delivered
most, but not all, of those cuts and prices plunged further,
leading to the latest effort to restrain production further.
	   OPEC said all of the cuts _ from OPEC and non-OPEC _ announced
since March will take 3.1 million barrels off the market each day.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Precede JERUSALEM Israel warns United Nations over upgrading PLO status sources cite Albright role in delay 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with UN postponing discussion,
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Under strong pressure from the United
States, Arab states agreed Wednesday to postpone their bid to
upgrade the PLO's status at the United Nations.
	   Arab ambassadors had asked the General Assembly to consider the
request Thursday in an open debate. But the United Nations
announced Wednesday afternoon that the debate had been put off
until July 7.
	   No reason was given for the delay. But diplomatic sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had strongly urged the Palestinians and their
Arab allies against such a move.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Albright raised the issue in a telephone call to Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat.
	   Rubin said Washington believed that upgrading the status of the
Palestinian observer mission to the United Natons ``would not only
set a bad precedent'' but would constitute an ``untimely
unilateral'' that would make it more difficult to negotiate peace
between the Palestinians and Israelis.
	   ``It's not helpful to the peace process and we are hopeful they
will not move precipitously,'' Rubin said.
	   The United States has recently criticized a number of moves by
the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu which
Washington says dampen prospects for reviving the moribund peace
process.
	   U.S. efforts to block the PLO upgrade appeared part of a
campaign to show that Washington is taking an even-handed approach
to the sensitive issue.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization was granted observer
status in the General Assembly in 1974, enabling it to maintain an
office in New York but without the same privileges as missions of
U.N. member states.
	   The new designation, first proposed by the Arabs in December and
raised again about two weeks ago, would confer ``upon Palestine the
same rights and privileges of participation as those conferred upon
member states, with the exception of voting and candidature'' for
office on U.N. committees.
	   That would make little difference in the daily work of the
Palestinian mission. But it would affirm international support for
the Palestinians in the protracted peace process.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Israel appealed to the United Nations not to
upgrade the PLO's status in the world body, saying it would violate
the Mideast peace accords.
	   Aaron Yaacov of the Israeli Foreign Ministry's U.N. section,
said a change in the PLO's status now ``would have both political
and symbolic implications.''
	   During the December debate, members of the European Union used a
parliamentary maneuver to derail a vote by proposing that
Secretary-General Kofi Annan study the idea.
	   That would have shelved the proposal indefinitely. Faced with
that prospect, the sponsors, led by Egypt, withdrew the resolution
but reserved the right to raise it again at a later date.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual
leader of the militant Islamic group Hamas, returned to the Gaza
Strip late Wednesday and, surrounded by followers, called for
continued Holy war against Israel.
	   Yassin, considered a thorn in the side to both Israel and Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority, had spent the last four months
fundraising in Arab and Muslim countries and Israeli authorities
had debated whether to allow him back into Gaza.
	   Dozens of followers waited hours in the heat at the Rafah border
crossing between Gaza and Egypt for the sheik's return, waving
green Hamas flags and singing Islamic songs. But due to the late
hour, only some 50 supporters remained to greet a very tired
looking Yassin at his Gaza City home and large celebrations were
postponed until Thursday.
	   Dressed in traditonal white robe and headdress, Yassin made a
brief speech outside his home. Flanked by three armed guards and
setaed next to other leaders, Yassin said his trip had ben
successful and called for violence against Israel.
	   ``We insist on continuing our Jihad until our nation is
victorious,'' Yassin told the gathering outside his home, using the
Arabic term for Holy war. ``We will work with all our strength
until occupation ends and our dispersed nation returns to its
land,'' he said.
	   Yassin left Gaza in late February, ostensibly on a short trip to
obtain medical treatment. During his four-month tour, he raised
millions of dollars for Hamas and bolstered its political backing.
	   During his tour, Yassin made fiery statements _ widely reported
in Israel _ praising suicide bombers and calling on Palestinians to
carry on an armed struggle against the Jewish state. Hamas has
killed scores of Israelis in suicide attacks.
	   Israel left it open until the last minute as to whether it would
allow Yassin to return to the Gaza Strip. Israel controls Gaza's
external borders.
	   However, Israeli officials have said they considered Yassin more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his movements can be
monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Israeli Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon said Israel should
not have let Yassin return.
	   ``It was a mistake to let him leave Gaza several months ago, and
it is an even bigger mistake to let him back in now,'' Sharon told
Israel's Army radio.
	   Hamas vehemently opposes peace with Israel while Arafat supports
it. Yassin's popularity is seen as a potential threat to the
Palestinian leader at a time when the peace process has foundered.
	   But Palestinian Minister of Communications Imad Falouji, who was
formerly associated with Hamas, said Yassin's return a triumph of
Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   ``The sheik's return after his successful trip is a positive
Palestinian achievement,'' he said.
	   Yassin's entry into Gaza from Egypt was delayed for several
hours, so the sheik could rest before making the crossing,
officials said. Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for the Israeli liaison
unit to the Palestinians, said Yassin, who travels on a Palestinian
diplomatic passport, was given ``a regular security check by
Israel,'' and allowed to enter Gaza.
	   At the Rafah crossing, Hamas supporters chanted ``God is
Great,'' in Arabic as they greeted Yassin. Supporters carried the
62-year old quadriplegic and his wheelchair on their shoulders to
an awaiting van, which was to drive him to Gaza City.
	   This marks Yassin's second triumphal homecoming to Gaza in nine
months. Israel was forced to release him from prison in September
to buy the freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents who were caught
trying to kill another Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
	   Yassin had served eight years of a life term for ordering the
killings of Israeli soldiers and Palestinians accused of
collaborating with the Israelis.
	   It remained to be seen whether Yassin's return would worsen the
rift between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.
	   Relations between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority took a
sour turn earlier this year after Hamas blamed Palestinian
officials of involvement in the death of its chief bombmaker.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The lower house of Mexico's congress called
Wednesday for a review of anti-drug cooperation agreements with the
United States to ensure respect for Mexican sovereignty.
	   The resolution, passed by a standing committee while congress is
in recess, came in reaction to a Monday vote in the U.S. House of
Representatives to endorse a money-laundering sting that Mexico
claims violated its sovereignty.
	   It was the second time in two days that Mexican congressmen
denounced the U.S. vote. On Tuesday, the congress' International
Affairs Committee issued a communique accusing the United States of
violating the spirit of cooperation between the countries.
	   Mexican officials have said U.S. agents in the Operation
Casablanca money-laundering investigation broke Mexican law by
operating here without permission. They have threatened to seek the
agents' extradition.
	   The House resolution also said the United States should not
extradite agents involved in the operation that led to 167 arrests,
including those of several Mexican bankers.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police shot and killed a U.S. student trying
to escape a fight scene in a pickup truck, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Juan Lopez Chavarria, 24, died at a hospital early Monday
shortly after he was shot by police in Zacapu, 175 miles (280
kilometers) west of Mexico City.
	   Lopez, a California native, had been visiting his mother's
hometown when he became involved in a drunken fight with several
other young men late Sunday night, J. Felix Lemos Saldana, Zacapu
director of public security, said.
	   When a police patrol arrived, the men scattered; Lopez got into
his truck and tried to flee, Lemos said. An officer tried to shoot
out the truck's tires but a shot entered the pick up cab, hitting
Lopez in the lower back.
	   Four officers were being held Wednesday on charges related to
the shooting. One is accused of homicide, the others of
participating in a homicide, Lemos said.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A small homemade bomb exploded in
the bathroom of a private school, shattering windows and wounding
six students late Wednesday morning.
	   One student was hospitalized with an eye injury and the other
five suffered minor abrasions from flying glass, Detective Sergio

	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Construction workers hurled rocks
from atop unfinished high-rises and police responded with volleys
of tear gas Wednesday in clashes over a pay raise.
	   At least 21 policemen were injured _ seven seriously _ and at
least 37 construction workers were arrested in clashes across
Panama City, according to national police spokesman Jose Zamora.
	   After five months of negotiations, the two sides are still far
apart. The workers are asking for raises of 15 to 18 cents over
each of the next four years; they say the company is offering only
3 cents a year.
	   Construction workers make an average of dlrs 2 an hour; skilled
workers make dlrs 2.72.

	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Four firefighters died Wednesday after
natural gas canisters exploded while they tried to extinguish a
fire on a public bus, the police said.
	   The accident took place in El Alto, a city that borders La Paz.
The canisters are used by the mainly Aymara Indian residents for
cooking.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A former Honduran economic minister
was shot to death when he tried to stop six thieves from stealing
his car, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Orlando Funez Cruz, 60, was shot in the abdomen Tuesday night at
his home in Miraflores, a suburb south of the capital, Tegucigalpa.
He died in a hospital.
	   Funez Cruz, a lawyer and a leader of the opposition National
Party, was Economic and Commerce minister in the government of
President Ramon Ernesto Cruz, who was overthrown by the military in
1972. He also served as Planning and Budget minister in the
government of Rafael Leonardo Callejas from 1990 to 1994.
	   He is survived by five children.

Police fire tear gas to disperse rowdy holiday crowd in Quebec

<TEXT>
	   QUEBEC (AP) _ Police fired tear gas at rowdy young people
Wednesday after being pelted with rocks and bottles, the second
year in a row force was needed to disperse unruly crowds on
Quebec's provincial holiday.
	   Police said 35 people were arrested, many for minor incidents,
during a concert and other celebrations to mark Quebec's Fete
Nationale, which has been marred over the years by riots and other
violent incidents.
	   Several shop windows were broken late Tuesday and early
Wednesday, but the trouble-making was less serious than last year,
when Quebec City's downtown businesses suffered millions of dollars
of damage.
	   The holiday is celebrated mainly by Quebec's French-speaking
nationalists _ those who support either outright independence from
Canada or some form of increased autonomy.
	   During Wednesday's holiday parade in Montreal, the hard-line
leader of a lobby group for the English-speaking minority was
pelted with beer, water and a pie as he marched with colleagues at
the tail end of the procession despite objections from parade
organizers.
	   The heckling became so bad that police intervened, hustling
Alliance Quebec leader William Johnson into a paddy wagon and
driving him away.
	   ``We had to stop his walk for his own safety,'' said Jean-Bruno
Latour, a Montreal police spokesman.

Canadian computer firm Corel to cut jobs at Utah division 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: All figures in U.S.dollars
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Corel Corp. will cut 530 jobs from its computer
division in the U.S. state of Utah, the struggling software company
announced Wednesday.
	   The move, which is expected to save the Ottawa-based company
about dlrs 33 million annually, was announced after Corel said it
had endured another money-losing quarter.
	   The company reported a net loss of dlrs 8.3 million in the
quarter ending May 31. Net sales were dlrs 63 million.
	   The jobs in Orem, Utah, will be phased out over the next two
months.
	   Meanwhile, research and development responsibilities will be
transferred to engineering facilities in Ottawa.
	   The consolidation will lead to the creation of 190 new jobs,
most of which will be in Ottawa, Corel said.
	   ``This decision was not taken lightly, rather with the best
interests of our customers and shareholders in mind,'' chief
executive Michael Cowpland said in a statement.
	   Corel lost dlrs 231.7 million in 1997, the worst year yet for
the company as it tried to go head-to-head with its No. 1
competitor, Microsoft.
	   The problems in 1997 carried into 1998 with Corel losing dlrs
21.1 million in the first quarter ended Feb. 28.

Governor finalizes sale of telephone company despite sabotage 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with governor signing sale into law.
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Gov. Pedro Rossello signed a law
privatizing the telephone company Wednesday, ignoring outraged
protesters who slashed telephone lines to a quarter of the island's
customers.
	   The dlrs 1.9 billion deal hands 50 percent plus one share of the
Puerto Rico Telephone Co.'s stock to a consortium led by U.S.
communications giant GTE Corp. and Popular Inc., a local bank.
	   The Federal Communications Commission must now approve the sale,
a process that could take months.
	   Rossello lost no time, signing the bill the day after it was
approved by the House of Representatives. The Senate approved the
sale last week, when the telephone company's 6,400 workers began an
indefinite strike.
	   ``I have the simple responsibility of making decisions based on
the well-being of all Puerto Ricans, not on who makes the most
disturbances, or is the most aggressive, or who pushes the most, or
who conducts sabotage,'' Rossello said.
	   Sabotage left 345,000 of the 1.3 million subscribers without
service and shut down a quarter of the company's cellular telephone
antennas, the telephone company reported Wednesday.
	   The outages disabled 335 of the island's 750 automatic bank
machines, according to Banco Popular, which runs the machine
network.
	   Damages topped dlrs 325,000, telephone company president Carmen
Ana Culpeper said. The strike is already costing the company dlrs
700,000 daily in lost sales and overtime to the 1,400 managers, she
said.
	   Police reported 16 acts of sabotage overnight.
	   The smaller islands of Vieques and Culebra were cut off from the
rest of Puerto Rico, and telephones at the Westin Rio Mar, one of
the island's largest resorts, went dead after protesters cut a
fiber optic line in nearby Rio Grande.
	   On Wednesday, protesters cut local telephone service at
Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, the U.S. Navy's largest base outside
of the mainland.
	   Fourteen of the telephone company's 28 offices were closed
because strikers blocked managers from entering the buildings,
Culpeper said.
	   Workers protested Wednesday in front of the Government
Development Bank, which negotiated the sale, and a Popular Inc.
office in San Juan's historic district.
	   The telephone sale is the most ambitious yet in Rossello's
project to privatize largely inefficient state enterprises. His
government already has sold hotels and a shipping company. It is
courting private investment in the power industry and wants to
privatize health care management.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council agreed Wednesday to
maintain sanctions against Iraq for 60 more days after the chief
weapons inspector said tests by U.S. Army scientists left ``no

	   LENS, France (AP) _ Spain finally shone, but just too late.
	   The Spaniards redeemed themselves Wednesday by pummeling
Bulgaria 6-1, but it was all in vain because the victory couldn't
prevent them from being ousted from the World Cup.
	   Instead, Paraguay advanced into the elimination rounds,
clinching second place in Group D _ or ``Group of Death'' _ by
beating Nigeria 3-1 in a simultaneous match. The Africans earlier
took first place, with wins over Spain and Bulgaria.
	   ``The game showed you can't always get what you hope for,'' said
Spain coach Javier Clemente. ``Today things looked as if they were
working out for us but Nigeria didn't win and you have to accept
that.
	   ``I am sad, but life goes on. The pride and prestige of the team
were clearly demonstrated.''
	   Spain came into its 10th World Cup as one of the favorites but a
3-2 defeat against Nigeria followed by a 0-0 draw against Paraguay
left it totally dependent on the final game. It was the first of
the top seeds to be eliminated.
	   ``When we went into the lead 4-1 and I heard Paraguay was
winning I just couldn't believe it,'' said Spanish defender Carlos
Aguilera. ``We came here with such hopes. Today we gave everything
and all for nothing.''
	   Spain has been knocked out three times before in the first
round, in 1962, 1966 and 1978. It's best placing was No. 4 in 1950.
	   After the match, Bulgarian coach Hristo Bonev indicated he would
resign.
	   ``I am a man of principles and after this result, I can't
contemplate continuing,'' he said.
	   Asked what changes he would like to make in the team, Bonev
replied: ``That you will have to ask the next trainer.''
	   King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia looked on as Spain demonstrated
speed and skill unseen in its first two World Cup matches. It
controlled possession for much of the game.
	   After the game, Clemente took the opportunity to bid farewell to
Spain's goalkeeper Andone Zubizarreta, who is expeected to formally
announce his retirement Thursday.
	   ``I'd like to call for recognition for the best goalkeeper in
the world and the best person,'' said Clemente, who blamed the
press for having too harshly criticized the keeper following a
blunder in the opening game against Nigeria.
	   Spain took the lead in the sixth minute when Fernando Hiero
converted a penalty after defender Ivaylo Iordanov brought down
Luis Enrique Martinez in the area.
	   Twelve minutes later, Joseba Etxeberria raced down the right to
cross to the Barcelona all-rounder, who beat two Bulgarian
defenders to send the ball from 8 meters past Zdravkov.
	   Spain pressed on with a series of flowing attacks, with a pace
Bulgaria's aging veterans could not match.
	   Bulgaria's star attackers Hristo Stoickov and Emil Kostadinov
were out-marked with ease by Rafael Alkorta and Miguel Angel Nadal.
	   Luis Enrique set up Spain's third goal on a fast break from
midfield in the 53rd minute, finding Fernando Morientes who drilled
it low from 14 meters into the keeper's left-hand corner.
	   Three minutes later, Bulgaria made it 3-1 when Kostadinov
swiveled around and fired from 12 meters out, squeezing the ball
between Zubizarreta and the left post.
	   Spain's fourth came in the 80th minute when Raul Gonzalez
flicked the ball to the unmarked Morientes at the edge of the area.
The Real Madrid striker pushed it past a diving Zdravko Zdravkov
and then ran on to shoot it in from six meters.
	   Nine minutes later, Zdravkov elbowed the ball in after a header
by Kiko Narvaez bounced first off the crossbar but the goal was
officially awarded to Kiko.
	   Spain made it 6-1 three minutes into injury time, when Kiko took
the ball down from a cross from the left, turned and shot it
between Zdravkov's legs.
	   But by that time the Spanairds knew they were out.
	   Lineups:
	   Spain _ Andoni Zubizarreta, Carlos Aguilera, Rafael Alkorta,
Miguel Angel Nadal, Sergi Barjuan, Fernando Hierro, Guillermo Amor,
Joseba Etxeberria (Raul Gonzales, 51st minute), Luis Enrique
Martinez (Julen Guerrero 70th minute), Fernando Morientes, Alfonso
Perez (Kiko Narvaez 65th minute).
	   Bulgaria _ Zdravko Zdravkov, Radostin Kischishev, Trifon Ivanov,
Ivaylo Iordanov, Gocho Guintchev, Krassimir Balakov, Anatoli Nankov
(Luboslav Penev, 28th minute), Daniel Borimirov, Georgi Batchev,
Emil Kostadinov, Hristo Stoichkov (Ilian Iliev, 46th minute).

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A ``Diana medal'' for school children, a new
five-pound coin and a memorial garden are among the ways Britain
will commemorate Princess Diana, the government's advisory
committee announced Wednesday.
	   Ten months after the princess was killed in a car crash in
Paris, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown unveiled the
government's Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Committee's
``preliminary'' advice on four memorials to mark the princess' work
and life.
	   Choosing from more than 10,000 suggestions, the committee also
endorsed a proposal for developing community nursing teams to help
children with life-threatening or severely disabling illnesses.
	   ``The proposals which we have announced today were amongst the
most popular and appropriate we received, and we expect them to be
widely acknowledged as a fitting tribute to her life and work,''
said Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, who chaired the
advisory committee.
	   ``They recognize her concern for children and their families in
times of sickness, when practical support and advice can often be
as important as medical treatment. They also encourage children and
young people, whatever their own circumstances, to take an active
and exemplary part in the life of their local communities,
particularly in helping the more vulnerable,'' Brown said.
	   The five-pound coin (worth dlrs 8.30 at current rates) is
intended to be in wide circulation next year in time for Diana's
birthday of July 1, he said.
	   The memorial garden is planned for the area of Kensington
Gardens outside Kensington Palace, where the princess lived, and
will be connected to a walkway shadowing the route of Diana funeral
procession to Westminster Abbey. Many people who live in Kensington
and nearby Chelsea oppose the idea, saying it will bring draw too
many people to the area, spoil the park, and create too much
congestion.
	   ``People are overwhelmingly against it. You can't imagine how
annoyed and angry people are. They are beautiful gardens and much
loved by everybody. We are not saying people can't come and enjoy
the peace and quiet,'' said Robert Buxton of the Princess Diana
Memorial Action Group, which was set up specially to oppose the
garden.
	   The chancellor stressed that the proposal would be opened for
public comment from July.
	   He said he believed that when people saw the plans they would be
satisfied that the committee had dealt with some of the problems,
such as traffic.
	   Members of the committee include Diana's sister Lady Sarah
McCorquodale, her butler Paul Burrell and her lawyer Anthony
Julius.

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A judge on Wednesday ordered
the release of three of five El Salvador national guardsmen
convicted of killing four U.S. religious workers in 1980.
	   The release had been expected since a law to reduce prison
crowding took effect in April.
	   Judge Gloria Platero said Daniel Canales Ramirez, Jose Roberto
Moreno Canjura and Luis Colindres were eligible for immediate
parole because, when time for good behavior is calculated, they
have served two-thirds of their 30-year sentences.
	   Two other guardsmen, Carlos Joaquin Contreras Palacios,
Francisco Orlando Contreras Recinos, were refused release because
of misconduct in prison.
	   Prosecutor Karla Barquero said officials may seek to have the
order overturned. If they do not, the guardsmen would go free by
Tuesday.
	   She argued that none of the men has met a condition that they
must pay reparations to relatives of the victims. Platero said the
judge who sentenced the men had not set any figure for reparations.

Thousands march to demand Suriname president's resignation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Thousands of people marched through
Paramaribo on Wednesday to protest Suriname's stagnant economy and
demand the resignation of President Jules Wijdenbosch.
	   Members of opposition political parties and labor unions marched
past the presidential office and parliament, then stopped and sang
the national anthem.
	   Workers have criticized Wijdenbosch's plans to privatize
government-owned corporations, including the State Oil Co. and
Surland, a banana company.
	   Universities who had planned to give final exams on Wednesday
were forced to postpone the tests because most teachers were
marching, and business slowed as employees left offices to join the
passing crowd.
	   Organizers and news reports estimated the crowd at about 25,000
people. Police said the march was peaceful.
	   Suriname, a former Dutch colony in the northeast corner of South
America, is the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere
after Haiti.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Departing in a swirl of controversy over his
China policy, President Bill Clinton pledged Wednesday to use the
first visit by a U.S. president since the Tiananmen Square
crackdown to ``say what I have to say'' about human rights. In an
interview with Radio Free Asia, Clinton said he wants his trip to
be a springboard for the causes of democracy and freedom in China's
closed society, and hopes it will yield an agreement on nuclear
nonproliferation. Even as Clinton flew to China for a nine-day
visit, police there arrested one dissident and detained the friends
of another in a display of Beijing's hard line against
pro-democracy activists. (CLINTON-CHINA)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Wednesday threatened actions
against U.N. weapons inspectors if economic sanctions were not
lifted immediately. The threat marked another dip in Iraq's rapidly
deteriorating relation with the inspectors following findings by
U.S. Army scientists that traces of a deadly VX nerve gas were
found on Iraqi missile warheads. Chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler told the Security Council on Wednesday that the U.S.
findings were ``utterly unambiguous.'' The weapons inspectors are
having the warheads reanalyzed in France and Switzerland to satisfy
Iraqi demands. After the disclosure of the lab analysis, the
Security Council extended sanctions imposed on Iraq after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990. (IRAQ-UN).
	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke traveled
into the heart of the Kosovo conflict Wednesday to meet with ethnic
Albanian militants for the first time, broadening efforts to end
the fighting before all-out war erupts. Against a backdrop of
burned-out houses, devastated villages, explosions and gunfire,
Holbrooke declared it was time for Serb security forces to ``get
out of here.'' His tour of heavy fighting areas in the secessionist
Yugoslav province highlighted a shuttle diplomacy mission that many
see as a last-ditch bid to stop the conflict before NATO
intervenes. More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have
died since fighting escalated in March between Serb-led army and
police forces and the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO).
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Riot police used tear gas and clubs to
disperse thousands of protesters who took to the streets Wednesday,
burning cars and rubbish to protest President Gnassigbe Eyadema's
declared election victory. ``We want Gilchrist Olympio,''
demonstrators shouted, calling out the name of the main opposition
candidate. Casualty reports were not immediately available although
journalists witnessed at least one youth being severely beaten by a
policeman. Authorities had no immediate comment on the protests.
Eyadema, a former dictator who has ruled Togo for 31 years, was
pronounced the winner of Sunday's presidential poll following the
resignation of the head of Togo's national election commission, who
said she had been intimidated and harassed. (TOGO).
	   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of
the radical Islamic group Hamas, returned late Wednesday to a
hero's welcome in the Gaza Strip after an extended fund-raising
trip in Arab countries. Yassin, a challenger to both Israel and
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, was greeted at the border
crossing by about 150 supporters waving green flags and singing
Islamic songs. Yassin left Gaza in late February, ostensibly on a
short trip to obtain medical treatment. During his four-month tour,
he raised millions of dollars for Hamas and bolstered its political
backing. Hamas vehemently opposes peace with Israel while Arafat
supports it. Yassin's popularity is seen as a potential threat to
the Palestinian leader at a time when the peace process has
foundered. (PALESTINIAN-YASSIN HOMECOMING).

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose sharply Wednesday as technology
shares rallied for a third straight session and AT-and-T's dlrs 32
billion takeover of cable giant TCI ignited a new wave of merger
speculation. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 95.41 points to
8,923, 87 padding Tuesday's 117-point gain and posting its best
finish in two weeks. The Nasdaq composite index rose about 33
points after gaining 63 on Monday and Tuesday. The technology-heavy
index has now surged about 162 points, or 9.4 percent, in just
seven sessions, and sits just 40 points below April 22's record of
1,917.61. The blue-chip advance pushed other popular indexes to
sizable gains, but the broad market lagged behind with advancing
issues outnumbering decliners by just a 5-to-4 margin. The Dow's
turnaround from an early 50-point drop came despite a sharp decline
from AT-and-T, which fell the equivalent of about 20 Dow points on
news of the deal to buy Tele-Communications Inc. Shares of TCI rose
as the most active Nasdaq issue. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ministers, fighting the weakest oil
market since the disaster year of 1986, said Wednesday night they
will slash production _ even though they acknowledged prices won't
rise instantly. OPEC will withdraw almost 1.4 million barrels of
oil from the market every day beginning July 1, ministers said,
adding to an earlier round of supply cuts that failed to reverse
the damage OPEC itself created by deciding in the winter to pump
too much oil. The OPEC president, United Arab Emirates oil minister
Obaid bin Saif al-Nasseri, vowed that the new cuts will ``banish
the volatility so plaguing the market.'' But oil traders were not
immediately impressed, and OPEC said it might take months before a
global supply glut is erased and prices can bounce back by a few
dollars per barrel (OPEC)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ AT-and-T Corp. is buying cable television giant
Tele-Communications Inc. for dlrs 31.7 billion in a bold step that
would give the long-distance company to offer local telephone
service and high-speed Internet to millions of houses. The
transaction would allow AT-and-T to reach TCI's more than 13
million cable customers across the United States and make good on
AT-and-T chairman Michael Armstrong's promise to beef up the
company's weak spots and branch out into new telecommunications
businesses. Getting access to TCI's cable customers would be a
major step toward that goal. Eventually, it could give AT-and-T the
ability to offer local phone service through TCI's existing cable
hook-ups to customers' houses. The agreement would combine
America's biggest telecommunications company and one of the biggest
cable companies. (US-AT-and-T-TCI)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Negotiators for Indonesia and the
International Monetary Fund agreed Wednesday to a plan that will
allow resumption of a dlrs 43 billion rescue package, Dow Jones
Newswires reported. In a widely expected move, the Indonesian
government and the Washington-based lending agency revised the
national budget after weeks of talks on the paralyzed economy. The
deal will allow the IMF to begin disbursing loans again, probably
in early July. The new budget is loaded with subsidies designed to
ease the burden on millions of poor people in a nation shaken by
deadly riots over price increases. IMF loans were suspended in May
because of political turmoil that led to the resignation of
President Suharto after 32 years in power. Indonesia is suffering a
year-long economic crisis that has driven up prices and stripped
many people of jobs. (INDONESIA-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund will approve the
release of a delayed dlrs 670 million loan installment this week,
but a much larger potential bailout package will be ``negotiated
very hard,'' a top IMF official said Wednesday. ``We reached an
agreement with the government of Russia on measures which have to
be met to issue this tranche,'' Stanley Fischer, the fund's first
deputy managing director, told The Associated Press. Premier Sergei
Kiriyenko formally submitted his austerity plan to the IMF on
Wednesday. The plan is intended to meet key IMF conditions for
further loans, including cuts in government spending, better tax
collection and tighter control over customs and tax authorities.
Fischer said he expected the IMF board in Washington could approve
the release of the dlrs 670 loan installment by Thursday. But any
further loans would be ``negotiated very hard'' over several weeks,
he said. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

ACB to test leading players 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Cricket Board will test
its leading players for drugs this year for the first time, an
official said Thursday.
	   An ACB doping panel chaired by operations manager Richard Watson
reached the decision at a meeting in Melbourne on Wednesday.
	   ``The decision is part of the ACB's review of cricket's doping
policy. The tests will be paid for by the ACB,'' Watson said.
	   The turnaround follows pressure from the Australian Sports Drug
Agency for cricket to take out a contract for the drug-testing of
big-name players and follows several high profile cases in other
Australian sports such as rugby league and Australian Rules.
	   The Australian newspaper reported that the ACB rejected ASDA's
proposal for a contract for drug testing cricketers just six weeks
ago.
	   The ACB's existing doping policy is confined to just four
paragraphs in the ACB Playing Conditions manual.
	   It claims the ACB has ``automatically subscribed'' to the
Australian Sports Commission doping policy but with a proviso that
cricket authorities have the right to decide what action and
penalties will apply should a player test positive or refuse to
take a test.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual
leader of the militant Islamic group Hamas, returned to the Gaza
Strip and, surrounded by followers, called for continued Holy war
against Israel.
	   Yassin, considered a challenge to both Israel and Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority, had spent the last four months fund
raising in Arab and Muslim countries and Israeli authorities had
debated whether to allow him back into Gaza.
	   Dozens of followers waited hours in the heat at the Rafah border
crossing between Gaza and Egypt for the sheik's return Wednesday,
waving green Hamas flags and singing Islamic songs. But only some
50 supporters remained to greet a very tired-looking Yassin at his
Gaza City home and large celebrations were postponed until
Thursday.
	   The 62-year-old quadriplegic made a brief speech outside his
home. Flanked by three armed guards and seated next to other
leaders, Yassin said his trip had been successful and called for
violence against Israel.
	   ``We insist on continuing our Jihad until our nation is
victorious,'' Yassin told the gathering outside his home, using the
Arabic term for holy war. ``We will work with all our strength
until occupation ends and our dispersed nation returns to its
land,'' he said.
	   Yassin left Gaza in late February, ostensibly on a short trip to
obtain medical treatment. During his four-month tour, he raised
millions of dollars for Hamas and bolstered its political backing.
	   During his tour, Yassin made fiery statements _ widely reported
in Israel _ praising suicide bombers and calling on Palestinians to
carry on an armed struggle against the Jewish state. Hamas has
killed scores of Israelis in suicide attacks.
	   Israel left it open until the last minute as to whether it would
allow Yassin to return to the Gaza Strip. Israel controls Gaza's
external borders.
	   However, Israeli officials have said they considered Yassin more
of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his movements can be
monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Israeli Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon said Israel should
not have let Yassin return.
	   ``It was a mistake to let him leave Gaza several months ago, and
it is an even bigger mistake to let him back in now,'' Sharon told
Israel's Army radio.
	   Hamas vehemently opposes peace with Israel while Arafat supports
it. Yassin's popularity is seen as a potential threat to the
Palestinian leader at a time when the peace process has foundered.
	   Palestinian Minister of Communications Imad Falouji, who was
formerly associated with Hamas, said Yassin's return a triumph of
Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   ``The sheik's return after his successful trip is a positive
Palestinian achievement,'' he said.
	   This marks Yassin's second triumphal homecoming to Gaza in nine
months. Israel was forced to release him from prison in September
to buy the freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents who were caught
trying to kill another Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
	   Yassin had served eight years of a life term for ordering the
killings of Israeli soldiers and Palestinians accused of
collaborating with the Israelis.

Honduran lawyer says U.S. should extradite marshals over drug arrest 
</HEADLINE>
By FREDDY CUEVAS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The lawyer for a convicted Honduran
drug trafficker has asked a judge to request the extradition of two
U.S. marshals who he said kidnapped his client in 1988.
	   The 1988 seizure of Juan Ramon Matta set off violent protests in
Honduras that included the burning of a U.S. Embassy office. Five
Hondurans died in clashes with police.
	   Honduran law prohibits the extradition of its citizens.
	   Matta's lawyer, Jose Burgos Molina, asked the first criminal
judge of Tegucigalpa on Wednesday to order the arrests of the two
marshals, Juan Donato Morales and Roberto Escobar, and to request
their extradition.
	   He also requested arrest orders against eight former Honduran
officials, including then-President Jose Azcona Hoyo and Gen.
Rigoberto Regalado Hernandez, then-commander of the armed forces.
	   Azcona has said the decision to arrest Matta was made in
Washington, but that he authorized the capture and the departure
from Honduras.
	   The judge has six months to act on Burgos' request.
	   Matta was arrested in Tegucigalpa by U.S. agents and Honduran
police in April 1988, according to his family. He then was taken to
a U.S. air base north of the capital and flown to the United
States.
	   In 1990, he was convicted on drug trafficking charges in Los
Angeles and is serving a life sentence in a Colorado prison.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual
leader of the militant Islamic group Hamas, returned to the Gaza
Strip after four months abroad and immediately renewed his call for
holy war against Israel.
	   Yassin, considered a challenge to both Israel and Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority, had spent the months fund raising
in Arab and Muslim countries. Israeli authorities had debated
whether to allow him back into Gaza, but he was allowed back in
late Wednesday.
	   Israeli officials have said they considered Yassin more of a
threat abroad than in Gaza where his movements can be monitored by
the Palestinian Authority.
	   Dozens of followers waited hours at the Rafah border crossing
between Gaza and Egypt for the sheik's return Wednesday, waving
green Hamas flags and singing Islamic songs. But only some 50
supporters remained to greet a very tired-looking Yassin at his
Gaza City home and large celebrations were postponed until
Thursday.
	   The 62-year-old quadriplegic made a brief speech outside his
home. Yassin said his trip had been successful and called for
violence against Israel.
	   ``We insist on continuing our Jihad until our nation is
victorious,'' Yassin told the gathering outside his home, using the
Arabic term for holy war. ``We will work with all our strength
until occupation ends and our dispersed nation returns to its
land,'' he said.
	   Israeli Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon said Israel should
not have let Yassin return.
	   ``It was a mistake to let him leave Gaza several months ago, and
it is an even bigger mistake to let him back in now,'' Sharon told
Israel's Army radio.
	   Hamas vehemently opposes peace with Israel while Arafat supports
it. Yassin's popularity is seen as a potential threat to the
Palestinian leader at a time when the peace process has foundered.

England assistant pans his players 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ England assistant coach John
Mitchell said the touring rugby players were hard to motivate and
slow to learn.
	   New Zealander Mitchell is in charge of the English team while
coach Clive Woodward completes a trip home for his father's
funeral.
	   The former Waikato captain ran the development squad training at
his old club late Wednesday after taking the England training
session in Auckland.
	   ``You wouldn't mind that sort of commitment, would you?''
Mitchell said of the development squad. ``If (the English players)
see any sunshine or sea, they tend to relax too much, you have to
keep on to them.''
	   England has lost every match on tour including two record test
defeats to Australia and New Zealand. It will face the All Blacks
in a second test Saturday.
	   Mitchell said many of the players' careers had been damaged by
the tour.
	   ``There's only about five guys that will make our World Cup
squad,'' Mitchell said. ``Some of the 38 won't play for England
again. They've had their opportunity and they haven't taken it.''
	   Mitchell, who has coached Manchester club Sale for the past
three years, said the England players had failed to learn quickly
enough.
	   ``It gets a little bit frustrating, some of the players don't
pick up things as quickly,'' Mitchell said. ``Some of these guys
only started playing rugby when they were about 16 or 17.''

	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Police braced for more violent
demonstrations against President Janet Jagan as they continued to
investigate the firebombing of Guyana's Labor Ministry.
	   Police said security guards heard the bomb crash through a
first-story window Tuesday night, then spotted four men running
away as the flames spread. No one was hurt, and firefighters
quickly put out the fire.
	   The building is in the same block as Jagan's offices.
	   Protesters, mostly blacks of African descent who support the
opposition People's National Congress, claim that Jagan's party
rigged Dec. 15 elections. Jagan's People's Progressive Party is
backed mainly by Guyanese of East Indian descent.
	   An audit of the election results sponsored by the Caribbean
Community trade group said the vote was fair.
	   Rain on Wednesday kept many protesters off the streets and
postponed a National Congress rally scheduled for Wednesday night.
	   During a week of demonstrations, protesters have clashed
repeatedly with police in the streets of downtown Georgetown. On
Tuesday, they threw firebombs at police, and officers countered
with tear gas. Dozens of people have been arrested.
	   Police said they were still investigating a small explosion at
the Health Ministry Tuesday and a fire that swept through part of
the Finance Ministry on Monday.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Departing in a swirl of controversy over his
China policy, President Bill Clinton pledged to use the first visit
by a U.S. president since the Tiananmen Square crackdown to ``say
what I have to say'' about human rights.
	   Personal diplomacy is the surest way to gain a more open Chinese
society, Clinton told a crowd of military families at Elmendorf Air
Force Base in Alaska during a refueling stop en route to China.
	   ``Even in our differences, meeting with them ... face to face is
the best way to advance our ideals and our values,'' Clinton said,
receiving applause from 4,000 people gathered in an airport hangar.
	   ``Over time, the more we bring China into the world, the more
the world will bring freedom to China,'' the president added.
	   Presidential spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States will
give Chinese officials an American flag that flew over the Capitol
and copies of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S.
Constitution. The items came from Republican congressional critics
of Clinton's policy of engagement with China, who delivered them to
the White House as suggested gifts.
	   ``It struck us all as a worthy exercise,'' McCurry said, adding
that America's symbols of democracy were ``appropriate gifts'' for
China.
	   In an interview with Radio Free Asia, Clinton said he wants his
trip to be a springboard for the causes of democracy and freedom in
China's closed society, and hopes it will yield an agreement on
nuclear nonproliferation.
	   Even as Clinton flew to China for a nine-day visit, police there
arrested one dissident and detained the friends of another in a
display of Beijing's hard line against pro-democracy activists.
	   But on a more upbeat note at Clinton's first stop, the
industrial city of Xi'an, enthusiastic Chinese repainted streets
and vacuumed red carpets to greet him Thursday. His business
meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin are Saturday, beginning
with the controversial greeting at Tiananmen Square, site of the
deadly 1989 clashes between soldiers and students.
	   In the interview, Clinton defended his decision to let the
Chinese decide on summit venues, saying it would be unfair of him
to ask the Chinese to abandon their traditional greeting place for
world leaders simply for his sake.
	   But, he also said, ``It would be equally wrong for me to go
there and take no notice of the continuing difficulties with human
and political rights. I expect to honor the ceremony, and I expect
to advance what I believe in there, and what America represents.''
	   While there are no remarks scheduled during his stop at
Tiananmen, ``I will say what I have to say in other forums.''
	   Clinton said he would push for China to adhere to the U.N.
Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which would require the
Chinese to admit international observers for regular interviews
with citizens and dissidents.
	   The administration has said Clinton does not plan to meet
dissidents out of concern that Chinese authorities might harass
them after he leaves. He said he prefers to work in other ways to
address the concerns that dissidents have.
	   The president left from the White House South Lawn with his
wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea.
	   Later, Congress began the process of extending China's so-called
``most favored nation'' trading status. A House of Representatives
committee scheduled a vote Thursday on extending normal trade
relations with China.
	   Critics of the journey continued to press Clinton to speak
clearly to the Chinese government on the ties between trade and
democracy.
	   ``We must understand that today China needs the West much more
than the West needs China,'' said Chinese dissident Harry Wu. ``By
completely de-linking human rights and other considerations from
trade, the United States has given up its leverage with China.''
	   Some critics said that Clinton, in broaching human rights
concerns, should be as courageous as the lone man who forced a
column of tanks to a stop during the 1989 confrontation.
	   ``I've thought about that one man a lot,'' Clinton told Radio
Free Asia. ``I will do my best to pursue all of our legitimate
concerns and never to minimize the human rights issues.''
	   The interview was conducted with three reporters whose visas for
the trip were lifted at the last minute by the Chinese government.
Clinton said he squeezed in the interview to ``send a clear signal
that we don't believe ideas need visas and that we support freedom
of the press in our country.''
	   On other matters, Clinton assured the journalists that he would
talk with Jiang about the Chinese government's jamming of Radio
Free Asia feeds; said he hopes to make progress on issues such as
cutting the proliferation of nuclear weapons and pointing China's
nuclear missiles away from U.S. cities; and said he would advocate
``autonomy with integrity'' for Tibet.

Sosa ties record for homers in month 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Sammy Sosa tied the U.S. Major League Baseball
record for home runs in a month Wednesday night, hitting his 18th
of June in the first inning of the Chicago Cubs' game against the
Detroit Tigers.
	   Sosa, who has 31 homers overall, matched the mark set by
Detroit's Rudy York in August 1937, and broke the National League
record of 17 set by San Francisco's Willie Mays in August 1965.
	   Sosa and Mickey Morandini hit back-to-back homers off Tigers
starter Seth Greisinger to give Chicago a 2-0 lead. The
record-tying blast came on an 0-2 pitch and traveled about 400 feet
(120 meters) into the left-center field seats.
	   Sosa has connected 11 times in his last 12 games, and 22 times
in the last 25 games.

	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatia's players are taking their socks
off.
	   The white stockings with the red-and-blue national emblem that
are part of the squad's official kit proved so uncomfortable under
World Cup conditions that the players are replacing them with their
own socks.
	   The last straw came when defender Igor Stimac hobbled off at
halftime against Japan on Saturday with blisters on both heels.
	   Croatia's coach poked some good-natured fun at Stimac, usually
considered the team's tough guy.
	   ``Clearly, he's a man of cultured taste, and he wasn't catered
to,'' Miroslav Blazevic said.
	   But the problem is real. The painful spots have sidelined
Stimac, one of Croatia's most experienced defenders, for the
upcoming game against Argentina.
	   So they can still display the flag on their shins, Croatian
players are snipping away the offending bottom of the stockings and
pulling the top part over their replacement socks.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Some soccer fans will resort to extremes to get
their hands on the World Cup.
	   Scotland Yard detectives are investigating the whereabouts of a
replica World Cup trophy, which went missing from the BBC studios
in London.
	   The fiberglass gold-plated model of the World Cup was used by
BBC graphics experts to create computerized images for television
coverage of World Cup soccer games in France.
	   The replica belongs to The Studio and TV Hire company, which has
been supplying props to the BBC for 40 years.
	   The replica trophy is worth about 1,400 pounds (dlrs 2,332) and
took a special prop-maker three months to build.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Christian Vieri says he isn't better than
Ronaldo _ even though the Italian striker has four goals to just
one for the Brazilian star after two weeks at the World Cup.
	   ``He's a great player, one of the best world players,'' said
Vieri, who is tied with Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta as the
tournament's top goal-scorer. ``I'm sure he will soon begin scoring
goals. I'm not getting excited now that I'm leading the scorers'
list. I will not feel depressed if things get worse in the next
match.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Host France is closing in on Brazil as the betting
favorite to win the World Cup.
	   France, which won all three of its first-round games, was moved
from 5-1 to 4-1 by British bookmaker Ladbrokes Wednesday night
after its 2-1 victory over Denmark.
	   Brazil, which lost a meaningless first-round game after
clinching first place in its group, remains the favorite at 11-4.
	   Argentina remains third at 6-1, followed by the Netherlands at
7-1 and Germany and Italy at 8-1.
	   Paraguay, a surprise second-round qualifier after its 3-1
victory over Nigeria on Wednesday, improved from 100-1 to 40-1.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The optimism surrounding Brazil's
national soccer squad after two consecutive World Cup victories,
turned to bitterness and indignation in the wake of its 2-1 defeat
to Norway.
	   Sports commentators Wednesday were nearly unanimous in blasting
Brazil's lackluster performance and the game's referee.
	   For Armando Nogueira, a sports commentator of the O Estado de
Sao Paulo newspaper, ``Brazil's suffered a relapse and became the
lackluster and melancholic team it was before the World Cup.''
	   ``A Ridiculous Brazil Gives Norway Its Berth as a Gift,'' read
the newspaper's headline.
	   ``Brazil played very badly, without courage or determination,''
said commentator Jose Trajano of the sports news daily Lance.
	   The newspaper also sharply criticized referee Esse Baharmast
with a front page headline that read ``Thief - American referee
conjures up a penalty and hands Norway its victory.''
	   Norway clinched its victory in the last minute of the game when
Baharmast granted Norway a penalty which most commentators said
never was.

World Cup: Jacquet gambles and wins big with substitutions 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Aime Jacquet gambled big and won.
	   As a reward, France won't have to face Nigeria on Sunday in the
second round and, if the French keep advancing, Brazil won't be on
their minds until the final.
	   Coach Jacquet figured his team could beat Denmark with seven of
his regular starters on the bench. Wednesday's 2-1 victory
vindicated the strategy, clinching first place in Group C.
	   ``Even with the substitutions, the confidence was still there,''
Jacquet said. ``They kept us on the right road.''
	   France will play the second-place team from Group D, Paraguay,
instead of first-place Nigeria in the round of 16 Sunday at Lens.
	   And if it wins that match, France will play the remainder of its
games at the Stade de France, an easy commute from its training
camp southwest of Paris.
	   Three players, including half of France's formidable regular
defense, were left out at the start of the Denmark game because
another yellow card for either of them would have meant a
suspension.
	   Now they are safe for the first knockout stage of the
tournament. In fact, the full slew of regular starters who watched
proceedings from the sidelines will be raring to go against the
Paraguayans after 10 days of rest.
	   Also, by playing 20 of his 22 players in the first round, the
potential for internal strife has been reduced.
	   All because Jacquet had faith. Up to the point of stubbornness
against those who advocated the motto of that a winning formula
should never be changed.
	   ``We're very proud, with the substitutes, the confidence was
still there,'' Jacquet said. ``We have proven that each player has
his potential.''
	   Jacquet certainly has the support of France's first fan,
President Jacques Chirac, who attended Wednesday's game at the
Stade de Gerland.
	   ``Aime Jacquet has managed his affairs remarkably well,'' Chirac
said. ``I was sure of that from the beginning.''
	   There was serious concern over whether France could play
effectively without star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who sat out
the first game of a two-match suspension.
	   But Youri Djorkaeff was a satisfactory replacement. The Inter
Milan star converted a penalty in the 13th minute after a smooth
move from defender Vincent Candela found David Trezeguet in the
penalty area, giving Jes Hogh had no option but to floor him.
	   After Denmark equalized in the 42nd minute, Arsenal's Emmanuel
Petit put things right again for France in the 56th, shooting
through a maze of legs to beat goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel for the
decisive goal.
	   On Sunday, France is expected to field its strongest defense
again now that the threat of suspension has been lifted from
Laurent Blanc and Bixente Lizarazu.
	   ``We're doing well,'' Jacquet said, ``and we're going to get
better.''

World Cup: Michael Laudrup heads for another last game 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Michael Laudrup has yet another last game to
play.
	   His latest final curtain call could come Sunday evening in
Saint-Denis when Denmark takes on Nigeria in the World Cup's round
of 16. Laudrup has vowed to hang up his boots at the end of the
tournament.
	   ``Hopefully I have a few more last matches to go,'' he said
Wednesday after Denmark labored under Lyon's blazing sun and lost
2-1 to France. Despite the loss, Denmark finished second in Group C
and advanced.
	   ``I don't see it as my last. I see every game as my second
last,'' Laudrup said. ``Of course if we reach the final then that
is really my last _ but I can live with that.''
	   Denmark and Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, who
on Wednesday played his record 103rd international for Denmark,
said that although Nigeria will be tough, at least the temperature
will favor the Danes.
	   ``We have had to really battle through the heat here,''
Schmeichel said. ``But against Nigeria it will be at 9 p.m., so the
temperature will be more like home.''
	   Laudrup, who scored Denmark's only goal Wednesday from the
penalty spot, said it's not just the Dames, but soccer in general,
that suffers in France's summer heat.
	   ``I know the World Cup has to be planned around media and the
television, but I haven't yet seen a good afternoon game,'' Laudrup
said. ``My general opinion is that afternoon games are no good.''
	   Given that Nigeria has been one of the top teams in the
tournament to date, Denmark's Swedish coach Bo Johansson
immediately shoved his team into its preferred underdog's role.
	   ``Nigeria are the favorites and we are the underdogs and that is
a good position for Denmark,'' Johansson said. ``We hope to have a
good future.''
	   By advancing to the second round, Denmark has matched its
performance in its only other finals appearance, in Mexico in 1986.
That second-round game was a disaster _ Denmark was thrashed 5-1 by
Spain.
	   Laudrup, 34, is the only player left from that team.
	   To stand a chance against the Nigerians, the Danes will have to
improve on their performances so far in France. They scraped past
Saudi Arabia, could only draw with South Africa and rounded off
their group with the loss to France.
	   Schmeichel is confident that the team can improve.
	   ``We began slowly. Hopefully we can peak next time, and the next
time and the next time,'' he said. ``Nigeria is a great team, but I
am confident we can beat them.''

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Although Friday's Japan-Jamaica
game appears meaningless in the greater World Cup scheme of things,
it is serious business for first-time participant Japan.
	   After all, no one in the Japanese camp really expected to beat
Argentina or Croatia. But there's a definite chance to grab three
points against Jamaica, which also lost its first two games in its
World Cup debut.
	   ``It should be a fun game,'' striker Shoji Jo after Wednesday's
closed practice.
	   In a way, soccer's reputation in Japan is on the line Three
straight losses could hurt the popularity of the sport, even as the
country prepares to host the 2002 World Cup.
	   The problem is scoring. Japan has lost both its games by a score
of 1-0.
	   ``That's where we feel the difference with the world,'' Jo said.
``They get their goals surely, but we can't break them down. I want
to get as close to the goal as possible. Up to now, it was
difficult to create chances.''
	   Japan's defense has played well, and it may be able to loosen up
some of its offensive power against Jamaica.
	   Midfielder Hiroaki Morishima said he has been concentrating so
hard on preparing for the final game, he hasn't really had time to
think about what the World Cup has meant for him.
	   ``The next game, that's all that's on my mind now,'' he said.
	   Defender Toshihide Saito said he has witnessed a big gap between
Japanese soccer and the rest of the world.
	   ``If we play according to our standards up to now, the
foreigners have a definite advantage. We have to think more about
how to bring out the best in the Japanese players,'' Saito said.
	   ``We're used to playing a two-goal game. At this level, once
they score a goal, that's it. As a defender, I learned that giving
up one goal leads to a loss.''
	   Saito, who has been on the bench for the first two games, may
finally get to play. Defender Eisuke Nakanishi was slapped with
yellow cards in the first two games and will have to sit out
Thursday's game.

Northern Ireland voters go to polls with bomb attack fresh in mind

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Voters will elect a new
Northern Ireland government Thursday designed to get both sides of
this long-divided society to work together as never before.
	   And even as nearly 1.2 million eligible voters were being given
the chance to implement this key plank of the Belfast peace
agreement, the Catholics and Protestants of one shattered village
were already working together _ picking their way through the
familiar sea of rubble and glass shards left by a car bomb.
	   Wednesday's blast in Newtownhamilton wounded a 13-year-old boy,
wrecked shops and tore up roofs, caused cosmetic damage to a
fortified police barracks _ the supposed target _ and forced
authorities to relocate the village's polling booths away from the
devastation.
	   ``We all thought we had seen the last of these bomb attacks,''
said the area's representative in British Parliament, Seamus
Mallon, who is deputy leader of the north's major
Catholic-supported party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party.
	   Ballots will be counted all day Friday and possibly into
Saturday to determine how many seats each party will hold in the
new 108-member Assembly. More than a dozen parties and independents
are fielding 296 candidates.
	   The outcome will profoundly influence whether the peace
agreement, struck in April among eight parties after 22 months of
negotiations, will be implemented or be allowed to unravel.
	   Leaders of the largest pro-British Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists, back the agreement and are predicting they'll win the
most seats. But two other Protestant parties that boycotted the
talks are hoping to form a bloc sufficiently large to stymie the
necessary voting consensus.
	   While the agreement was easily ratified in public referendums in
both parts of Ireland on May 22, the 29 percent ``no'' vote
registered in this British-ruled territory came almost entirely
from Protestants, who constitute some 55 percent of the overall
population.
	   Protestants take as their inspiration the fate of Northern
Ireland's only previous attempt to share power between Protestant
and Catholic politicians. That cross-community administration in
1974 quickly crumbled in the face of a Protestant general strike
and unrelenting IRA violence.
	   Wednesday's attack was claimed by the outlawed Irish National
Liberation Army, a paramilitary group founded during a 1975 IRA
cease-fire that opposes the agreement on the grounds that it will
reform, rather than abolish, Northern Ireland

Borderline calls in key spots put refs in spotlight AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The old line is that a referee does the job best
when he goes unnoticed until the final whistle.
	   There hasn't been much of that going on at the World Cup.
	   The officials at soccer's world championships are in the
spotlight, taking hits from critics including players and coaches,
the sport's international boss and even government ministers
accusing them of racism.
	   And, as the final matches are played to decide who advances and
who goes home after the first round, referees' decision are
becoming keys to separating winners from losers.
	   FIFA said Wednesday it was pleased with the overall level of
officiating. But the night before, the referees' unusually high
profile was never more evident.
	   In Nantes, Hungary's Laszlo Vagner nullified a goal by Francois
Omam Biyick that would have put Cameroon ahead of Chile 2-1,
calling teammate Patrick Mboma for pushing off a defender. Replays
showed contact but no clear foul. The 1-1 tie, coupled with Italy's
2-1 victory over Austria, meant Chile advanced and Cameroon was
out.
	   ``The referee will not be welcome in Cameroon if he wanted to
spend a holiday there,'' defender Salomon Olembe said.
	   The Cameroon capital of Yaounde was the scene Wednesday of
attacks by black fans on white-owned businesses in retaliation for
what they saw as anti-African soccer bias.
	   ``What we saw is not a World Cup competition. It has been a
festival of scandal,'' Youth and Sports Minister Joseph Owona told
the African Nation newspaper.
	   Later Tuesday, in Marseille, Norway beat Brazil 2-1 on a penalty
shot by Kjetil Rekdal with a minute left after referee Esse
Baharmast of the United States called a foul on Junior Baiano.
Again, replays indicated little contact.
	   That victory moved Norway into Round 2 instead of Morocco, which
had just finished beating Scotland 3-0.
	   ``We trained for this for three years. To lose this way is more
than disappointing, it's, it's ... ,'' Rachid Azzouzi said, shaking
his head and looking at the ground.
	   The questions continued Wednesday when penalty kicks provided
five of the seven goals in France's 2-1 victory over Denmark and a
2-2 tie between Saudi Arabia and South Africa.
	   FIFA said the cases were being treated in routine fashion and
that no discipline or other actions were planned.
	   Federation spokesman Keith Cooper said no team had officially
complained about the refereeing. He also said that any suggestions
that the referees' calls were intended to influence the
second-round makeup were ``absolutely pointless.''
	   ``Decisions were taken during the course of the match by the
referees in good faith, according to the situations as they
interpreted them in the game, totally regardless of what might be
happening elsewhere, of which they were absolutely, totally
unaware,'' Cooper said.
	   The spokesman said FIFA president Sepp Blatter had no plans to
speak with referee coordinator David Will about Tuesday's games and
refused to say how the calls might effect selection of officials
for the second round and later.
	   Blatter himself earlier criticized the refs for failing to
enforce a crackdown on dangerous tackles from behind. That led to
an explosion of red cards, with 11 in next 20 games following
Blatter's tongue-lashing, compared with four in the 20 games prior.
	   Two games ended with a team two players down, including Cameroon
in the match against Chile.

World Cup: Disappointing finale for South Africa, Troussier 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By ADNAN MALIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ South Africa's first World Cup ended
with angry parting words from coach Philippe Troussier.
	   After Wednesday's 2-2 draw with underdog Saudi Arabia eliminated
the Bafana Bafana, Troussier accused most of his players of lacking
the spirit and courage needed to win.
	   The Frenchman said he was through coaching the team, but didn't
yet know where he would end up.
	   ``I am not their coach anymore,'' Troussier said. ``I am very
disappointed with the team's performance and I will take some rest
to forget about it.''
	   The draw meant South Africa now goes home instead of facing
African rival Nigeria in a second-round match. Despite two goals
from Shaun Bartlett, South Africa saw its hopes evaporate because
of two penalties granted the Saudis by Chilean referee Mario
Sanchez.
	   Troussier said South African players had enough talent to
compete at the World Cup, but other things were lacking.
	   ``We had a great opportunity to advance to the second round, but
the players were completely unspirited to make that effort,''
Troussier said. ``Except for a few, most of the players were not
serious about their work. They were just here to play around and
have fun.''
	   South Africa needed to win Wednesday and make up a four-goal
deficit to Denmark in scoring differential in order to advance.
France defeated the Danes 2-1 in the other Group C finale, and both
those teams advanced.
	   The Saudis already were eliminated from contention entering the
match and played under new coach Mohammed al-Kharashi, a longtime
assistant to Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira. Parreira was fired
following last week's 4-0 loss to France.
	   ``I'm very happy. Even though we're out of the tournament, we
proved we could do something at the end,'' al-Kharashi said. ``I
wish we had played like this before. We would have qualified,'' for
the second round.
	   Bartlett's first goal, an 18th-minute strike that caught Saudi
goalkeeper Mohammed al-Deayea anticipating a cross, fulfilled a
childhood fantasy. Before the tournament, he told how he imagined
himself scoring at the World Cup when he was a kid.
	   ``When I scored the first goal, I just saw myself playing the
second round,'' Bartlett said. ``I was really excited. But in the
end, the excitement is all gone.''
	   Sami al-Jaber got Saudi Arabia's first penalty in first-half
injury time, and captain Youssef al-Thyniyan scored the second in
the 74th minute. Bartlett's second goal, also a penalty, came in
second-half injury time.
	   Both penalties against South Africa involved defender Pierre
Issa and were questionable. On the first, near the end of the first
half, al-Thyniyan fell in the penalty area after Issa barely
brushed him with an outstretched arm.
	   The second call came in the 73rd minute after Issa wrestled with
substitute Ibrahim al-Shahrani for the ball, eventually pulling him
down.
	   ``I'm not sure about either penalty,'' Issa said. ``The first
was especially dubious.''

World Cup: American players rip Sampson AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Their frustration building with every
failure, U.S. players started spewing Wednesday, and coach Steve
Sampson was the target.
	   Veterans on the team, who for weeks have been seething in
private, vented their anger, saying Sampson's personnel moves
wrecked U.S. stability and spirit heading into the World Cup.
	   U.S. career scoring leader Eric Wynalda, benched for the
humiliating 2-1 loss to Iran, still wouldn't speak about the move.
Wynalda was threatened with being sent home earlier this month
while the team was team was based at Saint-Jean D'Ardieres, two
team sources said on the condition they not be identified. Alexi
Lalas also was threatened with getting cut, one of the sources
said.
	   Preki Radosavljevic, angry he won't start Thursday's World Cup
finale against his former nation, Yugoslavia, lashed out at Sampson
after practice Wednesday. And Lalas, who has emerged as the most
vocal of the veterans, seemed to express the feeling of most of the
players who were on the team in 1994.
	   ``Any team, regardless of what level, especially the World Cup
level, needs leadership and a spirit and personality out on the
field,'' he said. ``There's a spirit that exists within the U.S.
national team that's been existent for years _ at big games, at big
times, at historical moments ... it's a spirit, chemistry, a
personality of a group of guys who grew up together on the field.
We have missed that spirit.''
	   John Harkes, the team captain until he was surprisingly cut by
Sampson on April 14, said in a telephone interview from his home in
Virginia that several players called him from France with the same
sentiment.
	   ``It's so wrong. After all the hard work we did going into the
World Cup, to see everything end so abruptly, it's kind of sad,''
he said. ``I sensed that team chemistry is a lot different.''
	   Harkes, Tab Ramos, Wynalda and Marcelo Balboa all were veterans
of the 1990 and '94 tournaments. Sampson cut Harkes, saying he
wouldn't play a more defensive role and didn't provide leadership.
	   ``Chemistry is something you build on for years and years,''
Harkes said. ``It's what soccer is all about, what happens when you
cross that line. It just hasn't happened recently. It wasn't
there.''
	   Radosavljevic, who turned 35 Wednesday, criticized Sampson for
not starting him against the Yugoslavs, who want to win by a large
enough margin to overtake Germany for first in the group and avoid
a second-round matchup with the Netherlands.
	   Radosavljevic, who scored the lone goal in February's upset win
over Brazil, didn't play in the opening to 2-0 loss to the Germans
and played the final 33 minutes against Iran. He said he didn't
think he would start the World Cup finale and couldn't believe it,
``especially against Yugoslavia, especially against my former
country, especially because the game doesn't mean that much.''
	   ``After the Germany game, he was trying to assure me, Steve,
that he believed in me,'' Radosavljevic said, ``but I don't think
that's the case. It seems everybody he gave a shot but myself.''
	   Sampson, the first American-born coach to lead the team in the
World Cup, again said he didn't deserve to be fired for the team's
performance.
	   ``Everyone has to realize that this World Cup was more difficult
than previous World Cups,'' he said, citing the tough group and the
expansion of the field to 32 teams, which eliminated third-place
wild cards.
	   Naturally, he wasn't pleased with the players' verbal attacks.
	   ``Players came here to play. They didn't come to sit on the
bench. It's hard for players who didn't play,'' he said. ``They
have a choice whether to be professional or not. I've always been
professional with them. I will never criticize a player through the
press.''
	   Wynalda didn't believe that and was angry over Sampson's
repeated remarks about a lack of effort during practice and during
the Germany game, one source said. Sampson at times has appeared to
use his public assessments to motivate players.
	   Amidst all the turmoil, Roy Wegerle was one of the few players
to publicly defend the coach, whose contract expires later this
year.
	   ``It's no one's fault, and we didn't come here to fail,''
Wegerle said. ``When things don't go well for us on the field,
players get frustrated and disappointed. ... We're all to blame.
There's no one finger you can point at any individual.''

World Cup: Paraguay plays to win, Nigeria hardly plays 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Paraguay played like a team desperate
for a victory _ and got it. Nigeria played like a team desperate
for some rest _ and got it.
	   ``There is no cause for alarm,'' Nigerian 'keeper Peter Rufai
said after his listless team lost 3-1 to the South Americans
Wednesday night to close France '98 Group D play.
	   ``We took the game seriously,'' he added, ``but not to the point
of going out there willing to die on the pitch, like we usually
do.''
	   Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic, who knows a thing or two about
World Cup strategy, used just four regulars in his starting 11. He
gave the night off to three players who had been booked in earlier
games, and rested others, all with an eye to Sunday's round of 16
clash with Denmark.
	   ``We were obligated to make the changes,'' said Milutinovic, the
only coach to take four countries to the second round. ``We had
problems with yellow cards and some injuries. We needed to protect
some players.''
	   Paraguay's needs were quite different.
	   While Nigeria had already wrapped up first place in the group
with two hard-fought earlier wins, Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani's team
opened the World Cup with back-to-back dour 0-0 draws and had to
win Wednesday to advance past the first round for only the second
time ever.
	   The tone of the match was set within 51 seconds.
	   That's how long the South Americans needed to put the ball in
the net, on Celso Ayala's header off a free kick. It was the
fastest World Cup goal since Bryan Robson's 27-second strike for
England against France in 1982.
	   Nigeria showed its usual attacking flair and tied the game 10
minutes later on Wilson Oruma's 13-meter (yard) strike. But the
second half was all Paraguay, which took the lead in the 59th on
Miguel Benitez's goal and iced the game with five minutes left when
Jose Cardozo tallied.
	   ``We are euphoric. We had to win and we did,'' Carpeggiani said.
``But tomorrow is another day and we have to start thinking about
the next round.''
	   His side faces host France, the Group C winner, in Lens on
Sunday, the same day Nigeria plays Denmark at Saint-Denis.
	   ``After a difficult first half, we increased the rhythm,''
Carpeggiani said. ``We showed tonight we are a team with a lot of
strength and will. We are dynamic.''
	   The Nigerian players did not look like losers as they left the
locker room, joking around and smiling. Milutinovic did his usual
multilingual stand-up routine at the post-match news conference,
acting as his own translator (in English, French and Spanish) and
trading barbs with journalists, telling one to call him, ``Mr.
Bora.''
	   Milutinovic does have some concerns ahead of the Denmark match,
however. Striker Daniel Amokachi aggravated a twisted right knee
warming up before the game, while instrumental midfielder Sunday
Oliseh left at halftime with a bothersome left ankle.
	   ``This loss doesn't affect us at all,'' Rufai said. ``We had a
lot of changes, and there are more important matches.''

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Testimony at the Gucci murder trial is
lifting the veil off a dark side of life in Italy.
	   Witnesses are telling stories of betrayal and greed in a world
where the rich resort to soothsayers and the poor strive for
status, where the wealthy and powerful mix with lowlifes.
	   On trial is the former wife of Maurizio Gucci, scion of the
famous fashion clan. Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, 49, is accused
of arranging his slaying three years ago out of greed and jealousy.
	   She wanted all of Gucci's fortune, not content with the 1.5
billion lire (dlrs 860,000) a year in alimony, and feared he would
marry his companion, Paola Franchi, police witnesses testified.
	   The trial has its followers, like bar-owner Antonietta Fedele.
``I'm really curious about these types, who kill people for
money,'' she said.
	   Then there are the passersby who peak into the building lobby
where the 46-year-old Gucci was gunned down March 27, 1995.
	   But the gloss is off the scandal.
	   A public jaded by years of seeing thousands of businessmen and
politicians brought low by corruption probes, particularly in this
city of fashion and finance, have turned their attention elsewhere
_ mainly to soccer's World Cup these days.
	   A month into the trial, the tale is merely tawdry.
	   ``The final portrait is of a country where almost everybody
looks at each other with a mixture of suspicion and envy,'' wrote
Corriere della Sera commentator Carlo Bonini.
	   Gucci was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, who founded the fashion
company known for its leather goods and double ``G'' logo. After a
long history of family discord, he was the last Gucci to have an
interest in the company, selling out for dlrs 120 million in 1993,
three years after the couple divorced.
	   News accounts reveled in describing their life.
	   There was the 65-meter (213-foot) yacht, the Creole; the 150
million lire (dlrs 85,000) gift to daughter Alessandra to throw an
18th birthday party; the villa in St. Moritz.
	   No one disputes that Reggiani Martinelli wished her former
husband ill _ she even complained about her divorce settlement on a
television talk show.
	   But her lawyers argue that a brain tumor made her incapable of
planning and executing the crime. And they say her co-defendants
set up the hit to blackmail her, knowing that she would be the
obvious suspect if Gucci were killed.
	   Now shorn of the heavy jewelry and thick makeup she always wore,
Reggiani Martinelli cuts a drab figure in court, her hair unkempt
and clothes simple T-shirts or slacks.
	   The main co-defendant is Giuseppina Auriemma, Reggiani
Martinelli's longtime psychic and a Neapolitan of humble
background. Auriemma ``exploited'' their friendship, and
blackmailed her friend, the defense argues.
	   Gucci had his own psychics. One who took the stand Wednesday,
Antonietta Cuomo, said he used to advise him on business deals and
defend against evil ``spells'' cast by Auriemma.
	   The other defendants are the doorman of a seedy hotel in Milan's
prostitute zone; an indebted pizzeria owner and occasional drug
dealer; and the reputed triggerman, an unemployed auto worker
originally from Sicily.
	   Then of course, there is the other woman, Paola Franchi. Hours
after the murder, Reggiani Martinelli evicted her from the Gucci
apartment.
	   On the stand, Franchi acknowledged that the next day she flew to
the villa in St. Moritz with a notary and photographer to inventory
its contents.
	   Jealousy motivated her rival, she testified.
	   ``I think that Patrizia was bothered above all that she couldn't
call herself a Gucci any more,'' Franchi said.

Clinton's visit to showcase China's ancient past and modern hopes With China-Clinton 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos HK103, XIA101
By JOHN LEICESTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   In the stony stares of China's terra cotta warriors, U.S.
President Bill Clinton will come face-to-face with the terrible
powers wielded by Chinese leaders of old.
	   It's an experience that could prove useful when he meets Chinese
leaders of today: In a nation as old as China, with more than 5,000
years of history, understanding the past is often key to grasping
the present.
	   Starting with his arrival Thursday in Xi'an, Clinton's visit
will showcase China's ancient culture and modern aspirations.
Following are sketches of the five cities, and major sights, on
Clinton's nine-day itinerary.
	   ___
	   XI'AN: First stop, a northern city where grimy smokestacks tower
over imposing stone walls. Xi'an was China's capital for 1,100
years, and other Asian cities such as Seoul, South Korea, are
modeled on its grid-style layout.
	   The terra cotta warriors, thousands of life-size figures frozen
in time, are on Xi'an's outskirts. Uncovered in 1974 by farmers
digging a well, the exquisitely molded figures were buried in pits
to guard the spirit of tyrannical emperor Qin Shihuangdi. The first
ruler to unify China, more than 2,000 years ago, Qin had books
burned and scholars buried alive to protect his rule. A history of
strong rulers followed, through to the Communist leaders Clinton
will meet in Beijing, his next stop.
	   ___
	   BEIJING: China's political heart, the capital is undergoing
radical redevelopment, with swaths of traditional courtyard homes
making way for towerblocks. Cars clog the tree-lined boulevards,
spewing exhaust that obliterates the view of surrounding mountains.
	   Tiananmen Square, the vast plaza in Beijing's heart, bears no
visible scars of the crackdown that crushed democracy protests
there in 1989. Crowds visit daily to watch the flag-raising, visit
the mausoleum of revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, fly kites and
stroll. During Clinton's welcoming ceremony Saturday, the square
will likely be cleared.
	   At the Forbidden City, the ancient imperial palace so named
because it was out-of-bounds to commoners, Clinton will see how
China's emperors lived. The palace, north of Tiananmen and enclosed
by imposing walls the color of dried blood, is a complex of paved
plazas, intricately decorated halls for imperial rituals, tranquil
gardens, maze-like passageways and residences for the emperor, his
wives and concubines.
	   Clinton also will travel outside Beijing to perhaps the greatest
Chinese wonder _ the Great Wall. Built to keep out invaders and now
a symbol of national pride, the wall snakes over rugged mountains
from China's east coast to western deserts. Mutianyu, the section
Clinton will visit, is steep and windy, with soaring views. The
wall meanders off across mountains as far as the eyes can see _ a
sharp contrast to the next stop, Shanghai.
	   ___
	   SHANGHAI: In Shanghai, Clinton will have left China's ancient
sights behind. Housing about 15 million people in a vast urban
sprawl, Shanghai is mainland China's most aggressively modern city.
	   After decades of neglect, the city is rebounding as a shipping,
banking, finance and high-tech center. It boasts China's tallest
skyscraper and annual incomes three times the national average, at
dlrs 3,000.
	   Clinton will see Shanghai's new museum with its ceramics, jades,
paintings and other antiquities donated by wealthy overseas
Chinese, many of whom trace their roots to the city.
	   He'll likely also tour Shanghai's Stock Exchange, a symbol of
China's march toward a market economy. Reflecting dreams of
becoming a major international stock market, it was built to
accommodate future growth: At least half of its trading-floor seats
are vacant.
	   ___
	   GUILIN: From skyscrapers to limestone peaks: Clinton's stop in
Guilin will take him through verdant limestone crags that have
inspired artists for generations. A trip down the Li River to the
picturesque village of Yangshuo will offer a breath of fresh air
before the cityscape of Hong Kong, Clinton's last stop.
	   ___
	   HONG KONG: The year since Hong Kong reverted from British to
Chinese rule has been rough: Tourism is plunging and unemployment
is soaring as economic recession bites.
	   Yet the city where East meets West still looks and feels like
the bustling capitalist haven it always has been.
	   Skyscrapers tickle the low summer clouds that bathe the city in
humidity. Crowds bristling with mobile phones throng the central
business district that proclaims Hong Kong's role as an Asian
economic hub.
	   The Clintons' hotel overlooks the stunning harbor _ one of the
world's busiest and a welcome stop for U.S. Navy ships that come to
rest their crews.
	   Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport requires a heart-stopping approach
that rivals any roller-coaster ride, as jets skim rooftops to land
on an airstrip reclaimed from the sea.
	   Air Force One will likely be one of Kai Tak's last visitors: A
state-of-the-art airport on an outlying island opens three days
after Clinton leaves.

Ousted Rios grumbles about grass and everything else 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Marcelo Rios' sagging popularity
rating took another hit.
	   This time the target of the surly Chilean was Wimbledon, tennis'
most venerated tournament.
	   The 22-year-old, ranked as the most disliked man in the sport by
several magazines, showed why. Seeded No. 2, he was ousted in the
first round Wednesday by Spain's Francisco Clavet 6-3, 3-6, 7-5,
3-6, 6-3.
	   Rios _ who briefly reached the No. 1 spot on the ATP Tour
ranking earlier this year _ complained about everything from the
officiating to the transporation, and _ of course _ the grass.
	   Among other things, Rios was bothered by a line call that led to
him losing his serve early in the deciding set.
	   ``Well, we're in England, what do you expect?'' he said. Then,
he added, ``I'm just kidding.''
	   ``There are little things that are not very good at this
tournament, the organization, the transportation and all those
things,'' he said. ``They're a little bit down.''
	   ``I think Wimbledon is just a tournament, like anything else.''
	   He also complained that he didn't get enough time on the
practice courts. And he hates grass.
	   Last week in a Wimbledon grass-court warmup at Nottingham, Rios
tanked a match, losing 6-0 in the final set. The first-round loss
Wednesday showed shades of that, too.
	   ``Grass is not a surface to watch tennis or to play tennis, it's
really boring,'' he said. ``You just serve, return and go in, and
that's it.''
	   Despite trashing Wimbledon, this year's Australian Open
runner-up insisted he might eventually win here. If he's allowed
back, that is.
	   ```I'm really disappointed,'' he said. ``I lost the first round
of a Grand Slam, and I thought I had a really good draw coming in
to the tournament. But that's the way it goes. It was a tough
match, he played good, and that's it.
	   ``But I'll come back next year. I think so. I'm going to try to
do better and have better preparation.''
	   He said he'd leave England immediately for home. ``I'm leaving
tonight, or tomorrow, but I've got to go,'' Rios said.
	   And when he gets home, will he watch Wimbledon?
	   ``I'll watch the World Cup soccer,'' he replied the Chilean,
whose team qualified for the second round.

Wimbledon tradition comes at a price AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Wimbledon tradition comes at a price.
	   ``An expensive one,'' said Miguel Farina, digging into his slice
of pizza _ and billfold _ at the food court Wednesday outside Court
No. 1. ``If you want the experience, be prepared to pay for it,''
added the young Spaniard.
	   A traditional day at Wimbledon can stack up like this.
	   A tankard of pimms _ the gin-based English summer drink _ costs
5.90 pounds (dlrs 9.80). Champagne, Wimbledon's favorite elixir,
ranges between 31 and 47 pounds (dlrs 51 and 78).
	   Dessert? A dish of seven or eight strawberries and cream is 1.85
pounds (dlrs 3.05).
	   A ticket to Centre Court ranges between 23 and 56 pounds (dlrs
38 and 92). The cheapest way in is a ground pass for 10 pounds
(dlrs 16.60), but that won't get you into the top courts where the
best matches are played.
	   Need a seat cushion? It's 5 pounds (dlrs 8.30).
	   No trip to England is complete without fish and chips.
Wimbledon's battered haddock is 3.95 pounds (dlr 6.50).
	   The bill. Between 75 pounds (dlrs 125) and 125 pounds (dlrs
210), depending on your taste in tickets and champagne.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PETE WHO?: &LR;  Richard Krajicek, the 1996 champion, won his
first-round match over Brett Steven and then showed defending
champion Pete Sampras little respect.
	   ``I think he's about the 10th ranked player at the moment,''
Krajicek said. ``If you look a the results from the first of
January and after he lost at Queen's.''
	   ``He hasn't done so well in the slams either... he is really
struggling,'' Krajicek added. ``But you never know. He feels very
confident and happy here, and that could give him a boost for the
second half of the year.
	   Krajicek, once a harsh critic of the women's game, admitted it's
in better shape now, but says he still doesn't watch it.
	   ``I do not really watch women's tennis, I don't watch tennis at
all.'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   THREE DAYS LATER: &LR;  It took American Jan-Michael Gambill three
days _ and 11 match points _ to get a result at Wimbledon.
	   At least he got a good one.
	   Billed as one of next hopes in the American men's game, Gambill
won his first-round match Wednesday over Sjeng Schalken of the
Netherlands.
	   Playing his first Wimbledon, Gambill was up 2-1 when darkness
ended play Monday. Rain ended it Tuesday at two sets each with
Schalken up 1-0 in the fifth.
	   On Wednesday _ under sunny skies _ he prevailed 7-6 (7-6), 6-4,
6-7 (7-5), 4-6, 8-6.
	   ``This is my first five-set match in the first place,'' said the
Spokane, Washington, native. ``And I've never had a match that's
lasted three days.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WOODIES: &LR;  The Australian doubles duo of Mark Woodforde and Todd
Woodbridge can break a Wimbledon record that's been around for 97
years.
	   If they win their sixth straight this year they will surpass the
five straight won by Britain's Laurie and Reggie Doherty between
1897 and 1901
	   Curiously, the Woodies are only seeded No. 2 behind Jacco
Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   STEFFI COMEBACK: &LR;  Seven-time Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf has
made comebacks before, but this one _ trying to come back from a
year off with knee surgery and injuries _ is much different.
	   ``I had breaks (before) but they were usually for a couple of
weeks,'' Graf said. ``That is a big difference. (I) haven't played
many tournaments and really haven't been getting in the rhythm of
playing matches.
	   ``That is definitely the hardest task.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO COLOR: &LR;  Goran Ivanisevic, seeded No. 14, on Wednesday
lamented the lack of color in the men's game.
	   ``Bad boy, good boy, you know I enjoy who I am. I don't think
you have any more personalities in tennis. It's finished, and I
enjoy who I am and where I am.''
	   Ivanisevic, breaking a recent slump, defeated Grant Stafford
Wednesday in the first round 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``I have to prove to somebody that I can be good again,''
Ivanisevic said. ``In the top five, where I belong.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: &LR;  Six-time Wimbledon champion Billie Jean King
says the women's game has never been better. Steffi Graf disagrees.
	   ``I think that there is more depth in it,'' she admitted. ``But
I do not think it really is that much stronger. I do not really
feel that, no.''
	   Former world No. 1 Jim Courier fell in the first round for the
third straight year. Thomas Johansson of Sweden beat the American
6-4, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.
	   Attendance for the first three days was 104,949 _ up 4,159 from
last year's rain-plagued two weeks.

Agassi in danger of joining men's casualty list on Centre Court and Court 1 AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous; play scheduled to start at 1100 GMT, 1300 GMT
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Wimbledon has lost six of the 16 men's
seeds in the first three days _ and now Andre Agassi is in danger
of going out, too.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion and No. 13 seed, was trailing two sets
to one against Germany's Tommy Haas when the second-round match was
suspended by darkness Wednesday night.
	   The American was furious over a crucial line call that helped
Haas win the third set.
	   A forehand by Haas was ruled good, even though replays showed it
was clearly out.
	   Agassi stabbed the spot where he saw the ball land, then
approached chair umpire John Frame.
	   ``It was nearly six inches (out),'' he protested. ``It was out
both ways. It was wide and it was long.''
	   Frame shook his head and the call stood, giving Haas a 6-3 lead
in the tiebreaker. Agassi saved one set point, but succumbed on the
next to fall behind 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Play was then suspended, and Agassi resumed his protest.
	   ``In 12 years, I've never seen it miss that much,'' he said to
Frame.
	   The Centre Court crowd jeered the umpire and linesmen as they
left the court.
	   With the match scheduled to resume Thursday, Agassi will have a
lot of work to do to reach the third round.
	   In a sign of how wide open the men's field is, four seeds went
out Wednesday _ No. 2 Marcelo Rios, No. 4 Greg Rusedski, No. 8
Cedric Pioline and No. 15 Karol Kucera. No. 7 Yevgeny Kafelnikov
and No. 10 Alex Corretja had been ousted earlier.
	   Rios proved what many people thought: he didn't deserve to be
seeded No. 2 behind Pete Sampras. The moody Chilean's distaste for
grass was apparent as he lost in five sets to Spain's Francisco
Clavet.
	   Rios griped about the line calls, the tournament organization
and especially the surface.
	   ``Grass is not a surface to watch tennis or to play tennis,'' he
said. ``It's really boring.''
	   Rios' priority was to catch the first flight out.
	   ``I'm trying to leave tonight, or tomorrow,'' he said. ``But
I've got to go.''
	   Pioline, last year's runnerup, was eliminated by Switzerland's
Marc Rosset in a 3-hour, 53-minute marathon that ended in
semi-darkness. The fifth set lasted 78 minutes and ended 13-11.
	   Rusedski pulled out before the resumption of his match against
Mark Draper, who was up a break in the third set when play was
suspended by rain Tuesday. Rusedski, a quarterfinalist here last
year, was still troubled by the ankle injury he suffered at the
Queen's Club tournament two weeks ago.
	   Rusedki's attempts to play led to an acriminonious split with
Tony Pickard, his coach for the past nine months. Pickard announced
he was dumping Rusedski because of a ``total breakdown in trust and
communication.''
	   Two players with much to prove, Jennifer Capriati and Goran
Ivanisevic, enjoyed morale-boosting victories Wednesday.
	   Capriati, whose career was disrupted by injuries and arrests for
shopflifting and drug possession, hadn't played at Wimbledon since
reaching the quarterfinals in 1993. She'd entered only five other
Grand Slam events since then _ and lost in the first round each
time.
	   Hoping to kick start her career after a series of aborted
comebacks, Capriati asked for a wild card a week ago and Wimbledon
officials obliged.
	   On Wednesday, she made the most of her chance by beating
Australia's Nicole Pratt 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.
	   ``I have to believe in myself,'' she said. ``I believe that I
can go all the way. If I don't believe that, I see no point of me
being here.''
	   The same theme was echoed by Ivanisevic, a two-time Wimbledon
finalist, after his straight-set win over Grant Stafford.
Ivanisevic had lost in the first round in four of his last five
Grand Slam tournaments.
	   ``I'm feeling much better, much happier and I have a desire to
play and practice,'' he said. ``I feel inside of me that it's
coming. It's just a question of time when I'm going to break
through and make a good result.''

OPEC seeks to boost oil price with bold cutbacks AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: RECAPS pvs, adding details, comments.
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC said Thursday it will drastically
slash oil output, hoping to undo the damage it did to prices by an
ill-judged decision to start pumping more crude last winter.
	   World oil supplies are now so glutted that OPEC acknowledged its
plan to withdraw some 1.355 million barrels a day from the market
is not likely to have an immediate impact.
	   Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete suggested that it might take
until October or November for prices to improve by around dlrs 3
per barrel.
	   But experts say that if OPEC sticks to its promises _ and this
is far from certain given the group's previous lack of willpower _
then prices could move sharply higher by early next year, shifting
the fortunes of global economies.
	   The OPEC president, United Arab Emirates oil minister Obaid bin
Saif al-Nasseri, vowed that the new cuts will ``banish the
volatility so plaguing the market.''
	   That would be a welcome relief to oil producers who recently saw
prices plunge to levels unseen since the industry's disaster year
of 1986. OPEC's average price was less than dlrs 11 per barrel last
week, barely half the group's official target of dlrs 21, though it
since has shown a modest recovery.
	   If OPEC's plans succeed, then consumers, including gas-guzzling
Americans, and oil-dependent economies like Japan and Germany,
would stop getting such a huge break on their fuel bills.
	   Leo Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Center for
Global Energy Studies, said OPEC's new deal appears to have a
``slow-burn fuse'' but that the promised production cuts are severe
enough to make supplies extremely tight in the longer term.
	   OPEC said its new production figures will stay in effect for one
year, starting July 1.
	   ``The duration, that's the key,'' Drollas said. ``That's the
sting in the tail. This, on paper, looks hideous for next year.
You're talking dlrs 25 oil.''
	   Not so fast, though.
	   OPEC was forced into action after its disastrous decision in
November to raise stated output by 10 percent. The extra oil
started flooding the market just as the southeast Asian economic
crisis began cutting into demand for crude oil, the world's most
vital commodity.
	   OPEC's new round of cuts _ following an earlier batch in March
that failed to improve depressed markets _ would put the group's
total output at around 26.5 million barrels a day, said the OPEC
secretary-general, Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria.
	   That would be around a half million barrels less than OPEC was
pumping before its most influential player, Saudi oil minister Ali
Naimi, pushed through last year's plan for higher production.
	   A wild card remains Iraq _ which is not participating in the
effort to produce less oil.
	   The Iraqis have huge petroleum reserves, but they are still
producing limited amounts of oil under sanctions imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded fellow OPEC member Kuwait.
Iraq's eventual full-scale return to the market will eventually
cause OPEC big problems, but nobody knows when that will happen.
	   Futures markets had a lukewarm reaction to the OPEC deal, with
prices in New York closing a few cents higher per barrel on
Wednesday and prices in London closing lower.
	   Senior energy analyst Michael Rothman from Merrill Lynch in New
York said early reports on the deal may have left traders baffled.
Fuller details came out after markets had closed.
	   ``This is a powerful agreement,'' Rothman said.
	   The deal, and the earlier production cutbacks, highlight a new
partnership that conceivably could change the face of global
petroleum politics.
	   OPEC's top producer, Saudi Arabia, teamed up with Venezuela,
which has long been the biggest violator of OPEC's quota system,
and non-OPEC member Mexico to form the foundation of the cutback
arrangement.
	   In both sets of supply cuts, these unlikely partners agreed to
reduce oil output on the basis that any Saudi cuts would be matched
by the combined total from Venezuela and Mexico.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Non-OPEC
producers Russia, Oman, Egypt and Norway also participated in one
or both rounds of production cuts.

World Cup: Spain's ship comes storming in _ too late 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Spain rained down on Bulgaria but it wasn't
enough to keep them from drowning at the World Cup.
	   After a disappointing start to the World Cup, Spain recuperated
its sting Wednesay to blast Bulgaria 6-1. But the effort was wasted
as both sides automatically fell from the tournament with Paraguay
sinking Nigeria to book Group D's second berth in the next round
along with the African side.
	   Not even the presence of Spain's King Juan Carlos and Queen
Sofia could help the Spaniards.
	   ''The game showed you can't always get what you hope for,'' said
an almost tearful Spanish coach Javier Clemente. ''Today things
looked as if they were working out for us but Nigeria didn't win
and you have to accept that.''
	   Spain finished third-placed with four points while Nigeria had
six, Paraguay five and Bulgaria one.
	   ``I am sad, but life goes on,'' said Clemente. ``The pride and
prestige of the team were clearly demonstrated.''
	   Spain came into its 10th World Cup as one of the favorites but a
3-2 opening defeat against Nigeria followed by a 0-0 draw against
Paraguay surprised all and left it totally dependent on the final
game.
	   Spain was last knocked out in the first round in 1978. It's best
placing was No. 4 in 1950.
	   But while Clemente could keep his head high, Bulgaria's
elimination triggered the cup's fourth coaching casualty.
	   ``I am a man of principles and after this result, I can't
contemplate continuing,'' said coach Hristo Bonev.
	   Spain, cheered on by a majority of the near 40,000 crowd at
Lens' Felix Bollaert stadium, kept its ears constantly to the
ground to see how Paraguay fared.
	   The side wasted no time in going for goal with Fernando Hierro
converting a penalty in the sixth minute. Twelve minutes later Luis
Enrique Martinez drove in the second from eight meters.
	   Back from the break, Fernando Morientes drilled in No. 3 from 14
meters.
	   Bulgaria got its only goal in the 56th minute when striker Emil
Kostadinov fired from 12 meters out to beat 'keeper Andoni
Zubizarreta and bounce in off the left post.
	   Spain's fourth came in the 80th minute when Morientes got the
ball at the edge of the area, pushed it past a diving Zdravko
Zdravkov and then ran on to shoot it in from six meters.
	   ''When we went into the lead 4-1 and I heard Paraguay was
winning I just couldn't believe it,'' said Spanish defender Carlos
Aguilera. ''We came here with such hopes. Today we gave everything
and all for nothing.''
	   Nine minutes later, Zdravkov elbowed the ball in after a header
by Kiko Narvaez bounced first off the crossbar but the fifth goal
was officially awarded to the Spaniard.
	   Kiko made it 6-1 three minutes into injury time but by then,
with Paraguay winning 3-1, the Spanairds knew they were well and
truly out.

Dollar, stocks higher in early Tokyo trading 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar traded higher against the yen early
Thursday, but its gains were limited on fears of intervention by
Japan's central bank. Tokyo stocks rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 141.36 yen, up 1 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 141.25 yen
overnight.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 45.90 points, or 0.30
percent, in the first 30 minutes of morning trading. On Wednesday,
the index had gained 68.58 points, or 0.46 percent.
	   The dollar's strength followed its upward moves on overseas
markets, but growing concerns about possible dollar-selling
intervention by the Bank of Japan kept the U.S. currency from
rising further in Tokyo, traders said.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, vice minister for international affairs at
the Finance Ministry, said Thursday that Japan will intervene in
foreign exchange markets when necessary.
	   ``When it is appropriate, we will intervene, when it isn't
appropriate, we won't,'' Sakakibara told reporters.
	   He said the ministry remains in close contact with its
counterparts in other Group of Seven nations and Asian countries.
	   Last week, Japan and the United States sold dollars and bought
yen to reverse growing weakness in the Japanese currency, which had
fallen to eight-year lows.
	   On the stock market, prices were slightly higher on strength in
shares of exporting companies following the dollar's overnight
gains against the yen, traders said. A stronger dollar makes the
price of Japanese goods cheaper on overseas markets.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.34 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,186.27. The
TOPIX rose 5.51 points, or 0.47 percent, the previous day.
	   Technology shares received a boost from the overnight gains of
similar issues on Wall Street.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.205 percent from Tuesday's 1.260 percent, driving
its price up to 111.98 yen from 111.53 yen.

French intelligence braces for nasty turn in World Cup violence 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous; also moving on sports lines
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities fear they may not have seen the
end of World Cup violence, and that the worst may be still to come
_ a confrontation between English and German toughs.
	   So far, English and German fans have been kept apart due to
their teams playing at different venues. But hooligans from both
countries nevertheless have run amok.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying that German extremists plan to travel to Lens, northern
France, for England's encounter with Colombia on Friday.
	   The goal: ``to combat the English enemy and try to gain the
title of `best hooligans of Europe.'''
	   The interior ministry had no immediate comment on the newspaper
report.
	   A Lens spokeswoman, Isabelle Isaert, insisted ``the kids got the
message'' when officials jailed several Germans after rioting on
Sunday. Three were quickly sentenced to a year in prison.
	   But a ministry source privately confirmed the hundreds of police
to be deployed for the match were alerted about the possibility of
German-English clashes.
	   German police have also privately said they were taking the
development seriously. They stepped up checks of France-bound
motorists by boosting their border force from about 200 to more
than 1,000 ahead of the matches Thursday and Friday.
	   Violence has shaken and tainted the five-week soccer
championship, with clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100
injured, a policeman in a coma and an English fan in critical
condition.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have cracked down, arresting more than 250 people and deporting a
number of English and German rowdies.
	   As well as England-Colombia, Thursday's match between Germany
and Iran in Montpellier is also considered a possible flashpoint
for violence.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
on Wednesday announced its first alcohol restrictions for Friday's
match. Officials banned its sale or possession on the streets from
8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As in other matches,
thousands of fans were coming without tickets _ at least 10,000
English on Friday _ raising concerns of more drunken unrest.
	   Most of the dozen German police working in France as
hooligan-spotters were being deployed in Lens, German police said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The police are among 180 officers from the 32 nations in the
World Cup, with the largest contingent of 25 from England helping
look for fans with a track record of violence, Le Monde said.
	   Authorities were also concerned about more violence by French
North African youths after clashes with English fans in Marseille
two weeks ago.
	   Similar violence erupted Monday after the England-Romania match
in Toulouse, where police arrested a dozen local youths carrying
baseball bats.
	   An English fan was attacked, and remained in intensive care on
Wednesday. The status of Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge,
West Midlands, was ``more reassuring'' Wednesday, a hospital
statement said.

GM Mexican plant idled as parts makers feel squeeze 
</HEADLINE>
By ELLIOT SPAGAT
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ General Motors light-truck plant in central
Mexico was idle as the United Auto Workers strike threatened to
slow this year's surge in Mexican auto production and hurt local
suppliers.
	   Desc SA, one of Mexico's largest conglomerates, said Wednesday
that GM canceled orders affecting nearly half the products it sells
to the U.S. car maker.
	   General Motors de Mexico SA halted production indefinitely on
Tuesday at its Silao plant in the central state of Guanajuato,
where 2,455 employees assemble Silverado, Suburban and C-35 light
trucks. Half the employees are getting full pay for maintenance
work and training.
	   Production was scheduled to halt for only one day, Thursday, at
GM's Ramon Arzipe car assembly plant in the northern state of
Coahuila, where 4,919 employees make Cavaliers, Chevy Monzas,
Sunfires and Chevys.
	   Inventories at the Ramon Arzipe plant are unlikely to last more
than a few days, said Fausto Cuevas, director of the Mexican Auto
Industry Association, which includes GM.
	   Mexico's auto industry has enjoyed torrid growth throughout much
of the 1990s, interrupted only by the peso crisis in 1995. Mexican
auto production from January through May was up 12.7 percent from
last year, aided by strong domestic demand.
	   ``If the strike were resolved today or tomorrow, the impact
would be minimal,'' Cuevas said late Tuesday. ``If it were to last,
it could affect this year's production.''
	   GM surpassed Volkswagen AG last year as the top auto seller in
Mexico, largely on the popularity of its Chevy compact. GM's Mexico
production for the domestic market is up 35 percent from last year,
while exports are down.
	   GM produced 21 percent of all vehicles made in Mexico from
January through May _ 73,623 units for export and 52,551 units for
the domestic market.
	   The strike is also bad news for GM's Mexican suppliers.
	   Desc, which supplies transmissions, axles, spark plugs and other
parts, said its sales to GM amount to about dlrs 24 million a
quarter, or about 10 percent of its auto parts sales.
	   Santiago Pique, an analyst at Bear Stearns and Co. who recently
surveyed Mexican parts makers, said the strike wouldn't hurt
conglomerates' second-quarter earnings.
	   Still, Grupo Alfa SA, whose Nemak unit supplies GM with aluminum
cylinder heads, would lose dlrs 150,000 to dlrs 170,000 a day if GM
canceled orders, Pique said in a report Wednesday. GM accounts for
30 percent of Alfa's auto parts sales or 5 percent of total sales.
	   Grupo Carso SA, which makes wiring harnesses and other parts for
GM, risks losing up to dlrs 8 million in monthly revenue, about 3
percent of consolidated sales, Pique said.
	   GM has been telling parts makers that it may move its planned
two-week summer shutdown to early July and make up for lost time
once the strike is resolved, Pique said.
	   GM's Mexican unit wouldn't comment on that. ``We're looking for
ways to minimize the impact of our strike on operations,'' said
spokeswoman Maria Eugenia Santiago.
	   Delphi Automotive Systems, a GM unit that supplies Mexican
plants with electrical harnesses, steering columns and other
components, said the strike has stopped production at 25 of its 53
Mexican plants, idling 22,902 workers.

Israel warns United Nations over upgrading PLO status resolution 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with drafty Security Council
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States convinced Arab states to
postpone a bid to upgrade the PLO's U.N. status but faced a new
diplomatic challenge from Arabs and others seeking to condemn
Israel over its plans for Jerusalem.
	   Arab ambassadors had asked the General Assembly to consider the
request Thursday in an open debate. But the United Nations
announced Wednesday afternoon that the debate had been put off
until July 7.
	   No reason was given for the delay. But diplomatic sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had strongly urged the
Palestinians and their Arab allies against such a move.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Albright raised the issue in a telephone call to Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat.
	   Rubin said Washington believed that upgrading the status of the
Palestinian observer mission to the United Natons ``would not only
set a bad precedent'' but would constitute an ``untimely
unilateral'' that would make it more difficult to negotiate peace
between the Palestinians and Israelis.
	   ``It's not helpful to the peace process and we are hopeful they
will not move precipitously,'' Rubin said.
	   The United States has recently criticized a number of moves by
the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu which
Washington says dampen prospects for reviving the moribund peace
process.
	   U.S. efforts to block the PLO upgrade appeared part of a
campaign to show that Washington is taking an even-handed approach
to the sensitive issue.
	   Later Wednesday, however, Arab ambassadors circulated a draft
resolution which would have the Security Council condemn Israel for
its decision this week to extend the Jerusalem municipal authority
to nearby Jewish West Bank settlements.
	   The step falls short of annexation but strengthens ties between
the settlements and the city.
	   The resolution would condemn the proposed expansion and also
criticize Israel for building Jewish settlements in disputed areas.
The United States could veto the resolution in the council, so it
was uncertain when it would be formally submitted.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization was granted observer
status in the General Assembly in 1974, enabling it to maintain an
office in New York but without the same privileges as missions of
U.N. member states.
	   The new designation, first proposed by the Arabs in December and
raised again about two weeks ago, would confer ``upon Palestine the
same rights and privileges of participation as those conferred upon
member states, with the exception of voting and candidature'' for
office on U.N. committees.
	   That would make little difference in the daily work of the
Palestinian mission. But it would affirm international support for
the Palestinians in the protracted peace process.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Israel appealed to the United Nations not to
upgrade the PLO's status in the world body, saying it would violate
the Mideast peace accords.
	   Aaron Yaacov of the Israeli Foreign Ministry's U.N. section,
said a change in the PLO's status now ``would have both political
and symbolic implications.''
	   During the December debate, members of the European Union used a
parliamentary maneuver to derail a vote by proposing that
Secretary-General Kofi Annan study the idea.
	   That would have shelved the proposal indefinitely. Faced with
that prospect, the sponsors, led by Egypt, withdrew the resolution
but reserved the right to raise it again at a later date.

Olowokandi chosen No. 1 by Clippers AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Michael Olowokandi, a
7-foot-1 (2.1-meter) Nigerian who grew up in England and has been
playing competitive basketball for only three years, was selected
first in the National Basketball Association draft Wednesday night
by the Los Angeles Clippers.
	   With trade rumors swirling around GM Place, the Clippers decided
on Olowokandi instead of Arizona point guard Mike Bibby, the player
they had been expected to take until having a change of heart over
the last couple days.
	   Olowokandi, who averaged 22.2 points and 11.2 rebounds last
season at Pacific, said he wouldn't be surprised if he was headed
elsewhere in a trade.
	   One trade was made during the first hour of the draft, and a few
more were pending. One involved the Phoenix Suns, who were supposed
to be represented at the draft by the parents of guard Steve Nash.
But about an hour before the first pick was made, Nash's parents
said their son had been traded.
	   The selection of Olowokandi marked the second year a senior had
been selected first overall. Underclassmen had been chosen first
overall in the five previous drafts.
	   ``Seeing my name in the No. 1 spot is unbelievable, especially
when you consider where I came from three years ago _ not having
played basketball _ and then to this, not the No. 3 pick but the
No. 1 pick,'' Olowokandi said. ``That's something that'll take me a
week or so, or a little bit longer, to get over.''
	   The Vancouver Grizzlies, the hosts of the draft, selected Bibby
second to roars of approval from a crowd of about 8,000. Bibby, who
left Arizona after his sophomore season, has drawn comparisons to
Jason Kidd for his playmaking skills.
	   He had expected to be drafted first overall, and refused to hold
a workout for any team other than the Clippers.
	   The addition of Bibby gave the Grizzlies four point guards on
their roster.
	   The Denver Nuggets, coming off a season in which they won only
11 games, picked Kansas forward Raef LaFrentz with the third pick.
	   It was the first surprise of the night, since Paul Pierce,
considered by many to be the best all-around player in the draft,
had been expected to be among the top three picks. He ended up
dropping to the Boston Celtics at No. 10.
	   LaFrentz, a forward, was a first-team All-American after
averaging 19.8 points and 11.1 rebounds for the Jayhawks. He was
expected to be picked between sixth and eighth.
	   The Toronto Raptors, the subject of another trade rumor
involving Marcus Camby, also passed on Pierce and selected college
player of the year Antawn Jamison with the fourth pick.
	   The forward, who left North Carolina after his junior season,
averaged 22.2 points and 10.5 rebounds and finished his career as
the No. 7 scorer in Tar Heels history.
	   He was the third North Carolina player to win the John Wooden
Award, joining Michael Jordan (1984) and Phil Ford (1978).
	   Jamison's college teammate, Vince Carter, was picked fifth by
the Golden State Warriors.
	   Carter, a swingman projected to play shooting guard in the pros,
also left North Carolina after his junior season. An outstanding
shooter who made 59 percent of his field goal attempts last season,
Carter also shot 41 percent from 3-point range.
	   Carter was immediately traded from Golden State, along with
cash, for Jamison.
	   Selecting sixth, the Dallas Mavericks chose Michigan forward
Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor The Sacramento Kings came up with the
next big surprise of the night by choosing Florida guard Jason
Williams with the seventh pick. Williams, once a high school
teammate of much-maligned college football player Randy Moss, had
troubles of his own in college and was kicked off the team by
Florida coach Billy Donovan, reportedly after testing positive for
marijuana.
	   The Philadelphia 76ers took 19-year-old Larry Hughes of Saint
Louis with the eighth pick. The youngest player to be picked up to
that point, Hughes averaged 20.9 points for the Billikens and was
considered by many to be the player in the draft with the greatest
potential.
	   The Milwaukee Bucks, who had traded their first-round pick the
three previous seasons, took 20-year-old German forward Dirk
Nowitzki with the ninth pick.
	   The agent for Nowitzki, who is currently in the German army,
told teams that his client may choose to play professionally in
Europe for the next season or two. There were reports he would be
traded, along with the 19th pick, to the Mavericks for Traylor.

	   FARIM, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Sitting at the foot of a crumbling
Portuguese statue in a colonial-era waterfront park, Aguinaldo
Antonio Gomes watches as one canoe, then a second, and eventually
many more struggle across Guinea-Bissau's Cacheu River.
	   Filled with tired and hungry refugees on the run from mortars
and rockets, the wooden dugouts arrive in the provincial town
without supplies.
	   Two weeks of fighting between soldiers and renegade troops in
the West African nation's capital have driven most of its 300,000
residents into a countryside incapable of feeding them _ a
humanitarian disaster in the making.
	   ``I've watched hundreds and hundreds arriving here,'' Gomes
says. ``There's not enough to eat for the people already here.''
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has warned that without
immediate assistance, Guinea-Bissau will face a full-scale crisis
within days.
	   Already, as many as 250,000 people have fled to the central
towns of Canchungo, Mansoa and Bafata, UNHCR spokesman Khassim
Diagne says.
	   The refugee flight already is overwhelming Farim, which had been
a quiet town of 8,500. In the past two weeks, more than 4,500
refugees have streamed into the community, says Rev. John Muse, an
Italian missionary.
	   Last month, the canoe journeys across the Cacheu brought the
daily essentials _ cooking oil, rice and flour. Now the only cargo
is more hungry mouths to feed.
	   When June began with the promise of seasonal rains and relief
from sweltering heat, Maria Morera had three children to feed. Her
dlrs 20 a month salary was enough to make ends meet.
	   But rocket-and-mortar battles in Bissau sent her relatives _
brothers, sisters, their children, cousins and so on _ in flight
for Farim. Today, 35 people jam into her tiny house _ and there's
more to come.
	   ``I've already borrowed money to buy rice for the children,''
Morera says. ``I have only one kilo (two pounds) left and what do I
feed them after that is gone?''
	   Poverty is nothing new for Farim, but with the war, a precarious
situation has deteriorated _ and most people fear the worst is yet
to come.
	   The coup attempt in the capital earlier this month and foreign
intervention has thrown the struggling nation into new fighting
over the scraps it has to offer.
	   ``You know, it's only the people who suffer,'' Gomes says.
``It's always only the people.''
	   Endemic poverty and suffering have hounded Guinea-Bissau since
before independence from Portuguese rule in 1975. While much of the
rest of Africa was peacefully winning independence from European
rulers in the 1960s, Guinea-Bissau was waging war against Portugal.
	   Independence won, the country began with next to nothing.
	   According to U.N. studies, at the time of independence,
Guinea-Bissau had only a handful of university graduates, little
infrastructure or industry and only basic medical facilities.
	   Towns like Farim, once examples of colonial splendor, have
fallen into miserable decay.
	   In the central market, a once-bustling place of commerce,
merchants have abandoned dank, dusty and neglected buildings and
now pour onto the dirt road out front.
	   Sitting on the ground, Maria Bassene displays her spread of
eight mangos and several small bags of peanuts for sale. Farim
isn't starving, but food is running low, she says, and prices are
soaring.
	   Before Brig. Ansumane Mane attempted to wrest control of the
government from President Joao Bernardo Vieira earlier this month,
a 125-pound (57-kilo) bag of rice cost dlrs 15. Today, after much
arm-twisting and bargaining, the price is at least dlrs 25, Bassene
says.
	   The prospect of help from nearby Senegal is unlikely, with the
border sealed from Senegal's side and relief supplies sitting idle
on the other side of the frontier.
	   At the Cacheu River, a half-sunken ferry, once the lifeline
between Farim, Mansoa and the capital, Bissau, sits in rusting
disrepair.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After declaring it's time for Serb
forces to ``get out'' of Kosovo, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
scheduled a hectic round of talks aimed at stopping the fighting in
the embattled Yugoslav province.
	   Trying to head off the need for threatened NATO intervention in
Kosovo, Holbrooke prepared to sit down Thursday with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic for the second time in three days.
	   Later, he was to meet with a Russian envoy before heading back
to Kosovo to talk with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in the
provincial capital, Pristina.
	   Holbrooke, who helped persuade Milosevic to sign a peace
settlement to end the war in Bosnia, gave no indication that the
Yugoslav leader was close to agreeing to a cease-fire and pullback
demanded by the West.
	   ``This is all part of a process,'' he told CNN in Kosovo before
heading back to Belgrade late Wednesday. ``I wouldn't want to get
your expectations up that we're going to have any breakthroughs,
because the situation is quite difficult.''
	   Holbrooke traveled into the heart of the Kosovo conflict zone
Wednesday and met with ethnic Albanian militants for the first
time, broadening efforts to end the fighting before all-out war
erupts.
	   His tour of heavy fighting areas in the secessionist province of
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, highlighted a shuttle
diplomacy mission that many see as a last-ditch bid to stop the
conflict before NATO intervenes.
	   ``The situation is explosive,'' he said on a stop in the
besieged town of Junik near the Albanian border. ``Serb security
forces are all over the place.''
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died since
fighting escalated in March between Serb-led army and police forces
and the Kosovo Liberation Army. NATO sent jets zooming over the
region earlier this month to persuade Milosevic to stop the
campaign against the rebels, but fighting continues unabated.
	   On a 300-kilometer (nearly 200-mile) tour of western Kosovo,
Holbrooke rode with three ethnic Albanian officials and had
protection for his 14-car convoy from a truckload of Serb security
forces carrying automatic rifles. He called it a ``traveling
negotiation.''
	   He dismissed any political significance to his talks with two
local Kosovo Liberation Army leaders in Junik, calling them only
unofficial meetings with ``armed men, some of whom were in (KLA)
uniforms.''
	   But observers saw the unprecedented meeting as tacit
acknowledgement that the fast-growing KLA, which has the support of
increasing numbers of Kosovo's majority Albanians, must be taken
into account in any political settlement.
	   Graphic evidence of the worsening situation in Kosovo was
plentiful on the trip.
	   Besides fire-blackened and damaged houses and half-emptied
villages, explosions and gunfire could be heard and armored
personnel carriers and military convoys rumbled down the main road.
Reporters following Holbrooke's convoy were caught in the crossfire
of a gunfight between Serbs and Albanian guerrillas.
	   Rugova appealed in Brussels on Wednesday for NATO to use its
military might to end the worsening violence.
	   But NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, meeting Rugova,
insisted he return to the negotiating table with the Serbs without
conditions.

Security Council extends sanctions against Iraq 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS pvs
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council agreed Wednesday to
maintain sanctions against Iraq for 60 more days after the chief
weapons inspector said U.S. Army tests left ``no doubt'' that Iraq
placed deadly VX nerve gas in missile warheads.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Iraq threatened unspecified actions against
U.N. weapons inspectors if the sanctions were not lifted
immediately. The threat marked a worsening in Baghdad's latest
dispute with the inspectors.
	   The council's decision was made without a vote after the 15
members concluded that Iraq had not met the conditions to lift the
eight-year embargo, council President Antonio Monteiro said.
	   Chief inspector Richard Butler had briefed the council on a
report by the Army laboratory in Aberdeen, Md., that found traces
of VX on pieces of Iraqi warheads.
	   Butler agreed to send the materials to laboratories in France
and Switzerland for further analysis, as Iraq has demanded. But he
said the tests were conducted by one of the world's premier
chemical weapons laboratories.
	   ``I made clear there is no doubt VX was present in some of those
weapons warheads,'' Butler said.
	   VX is a colorless, odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it
comes into contact with oxygen. A few drops can kill in minutes.
	   The warhead fragments were taken from Taji, a military camp 20
kilometers north of the capital Baghdad, in 1995 and sent to the
United States earlier this year.
	   Iraq claims that only seven fragments of the 44 samples taken
out were examined and VX was detected in only one of them _ a
sample too small to provide conclusive evidence.
	   Iraq has admitted having maintained VX supplies but claims it
was never able to develop the technology to place the deadly nerve
agents in a weapons system.
	   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, denied
on Wednesday that Iraq had any prohibited weapons and said a new
crisis could be brewing.
	   ``I cannot get into any timeframe but I am saying that if it
looks like the sanctions are not going to be lifted this year then
Iraq may well consider a different policy,'' he said on the Public

leaders had demanded the sanctions be lifted immediately and warned

weapons inspectors.

hostility and evil of some parties, there will be no alternative to
the strategy ... to get rid of the unfair embargo,'' it said.

Russia, France and China to close the seven-year inspection program
and lift the sanctions.

Butler to ease up on the Iraqis so the inspection program can be
brought to an end.

long-range missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
before the council will lift economic sanctions imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.

report could trigger another crisis similar to the one over access
by U.N. inspectors to presidential palaces. That crisis was defused
by Annan.

information discreetly without embarrassment.

forcing the commission to go public. The diplomats said that could
make it more difficult for the Iraqis to admit that they had been
lying.

of Iraq's claims about its chemical and biological programs. That
in turn could further delay any commission certification of Iraqi
compliance with terms for lifting sanctions.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council has agreed to
maintain sanctions against Iraq for 60 more days after the chief
weapons inspector said U.S. Army tests left ``no doubt'' that Iraq
placed deadly VX nerve gas in missile warheads.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Iraq threatened unspecified actions against
U.N. weapons inspectors if the sanctions were not lifted
immediately. The threat marked a worsening in Baghdad's latest
dispute with the inspectors.
	   The council's decision was made without a vote after the 15
members concluded that Iraq had not met the conditions to lift the
eight-year embargo, council President Antonio Monteiro said.
	   Chief inspector Richard Butler had briefed the council on a
report by the Army laboratory in Aberdeen, Maryland, that found
traces of VX on pieces of Iraqi warheads.
	   Butler agreed to send the materials to laboratories in France
and Switzerland for further analysis, as Iraq has demanded. But he
said the tests were conducted by one of the world's premier
chemical weapons laboratories.
	   ``I made clear there is no doubt VX was present in some of those
weapons warheads,'' Butler said.
	   VX is a colorless, odorless liquid that turns into a gas when it
comes into contact with oxygen. A few drops can kill in minutes.
	   The warhead fragments were taken from Taji, a military camp 13
miles (20 kms) north of the capital Baghdad, in 1995 and sent to
the United States earlier this year.
	   Iraq claims that only seven fragments of the 44 samples taken
out were examined and VX was detected in only one of them _ a
sample too small to provide conclusive evidence.
	   Iraq has admitted having maintained VX supplies but claims it
was never able to develop the technology to place the deadly nerve
agents in a weapons system.
	   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, denied
on Wednesday that Iraq had any prohibited weapons and said a new
crisis could be brewing.
	   ``I cannot get into any timeframe but I am saying that if it
looks like the sanctions are not going to be lifted this year then
Iraq may well consider a different policy,'' he said in a
television interview Wednesday evening.
	   His comments echoed those in a statement published earlier
Wednesday in Baghdad. President Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi
leaders had demanded the sanctions be lifted immediately and warned
that if they were not, Iraq would reconsider relations with U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   ``When other means to lift the sanctions fail due to the
hostility and evil of some parties, there will be no alternative to
the strategy ... to get rid of the unfair embargo,'' it said.
	   Iraq has never said what that strategy is.
	   The statement did not mention the VX findings, although the

Share prices of ailing Japanese bank plunge 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Share prices of the Long-Term Credit Bank plunged
to 50 yen in early trading Thursday, adding to fears that the
institution may be foundering.
	   Share prices dropped to that level from Wednesday's close of 70
yen within the first hour of trading.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, the 22nd largest bank in the world
according to Forbes magazine, has become the focus of concern among
investors as Japan's banks struggle to get out from under a
mountain of bad debt.
	   Bank officials have repeatedly denied rumors that the bank is in
trouble, but they recently acknowledged it holds some 1.4 trillion
yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans.
	   Japan's government said Wednesday it is racing to set up an
emergency bank to provide loans to cash-strapped companies left out
in the cold by private banks struggling under mountains of bad
loans.
	   Details remain vague, but the new bank likely would fill a
breech left by bad loan-burdened private banks that could go out of
business.
	   Investors are concerned, however, that the government may be
willing to let some weak institutions go under in order to
strengthen the overall financial system.
	   That concern began to focus on LTCB last week, after Moody's
Investors Services lowered its credit rating for the bank and sent
its share prices plunging.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank is one of three credit banks established
at the end of World War II to provide long-term business loans in
an effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   But as deregulation has made it easier for companies to raise
money directly by issuing stocks or selling bonds, the banks' role
has been largely lost.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank has 3,600 employees and 28 trillion (dlrs
203 billion) in assets.

Facts and figures on Northern Ireland Assembly election 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Northern Ireland
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Facts and figures on the Northern Ireland Assembly election
Thursday:
	   HOURS: 1,228 polling stations open 0600 GMT until 2100 GMT.
	   VOTERS: 1.17 million of Northern Ireland's 1.63 million
residents are eligible to vote.
	   DECISION: Voters will elect 108 members of the Assembly, six
from each of 18 districts, among 296 candidates from more than a
dozen parties.
	   RESULTS: Because of a complex proportional-representation
system, each district's top vote-getters will be identified
starting midday Friday, but final results are unlikely until late
Friday or even Saturday.
	   SYSTEM: Voters mark their ballots in order of preference _
``1,'' ``2'' and so on, for as many candidates as they like. This
ensures that the six most popular candidates overall in each
district will be selected. It also means at least several rounds of
ballot counting.
	   Any candidate who receives one-seventh or more of all ``1''
votes cast has reached the district's ``quota'' and is elected in
the first round of counting. Because of the number of candidates
competing, few candidates will reach this goal.

With help of technology, blind work, enjoy independence 
</HEADLINE>
By OSCAR MUSIBAY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Carmen Apelgren peers closely at her computer
screen as she reviews her outgoing e-mail, making sure the grammar
is correct.
	   The letters on her specialized word processor are the size of
her palm. Her tasks would be impossible without the modification _
comparable to a sighted person trying to read an eye chart on the
head of a pin.
	   Her sight is being eaten by retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative
eye disease. ``It's a pain ... to be blind,'' said Ms. Apelgren, a
spokeswoman for the Braille Institute in Los Angeles. ``You live
your life the best you can, don't whine too much and move on.''
	   It became easier to move on about 15 years ago with the advent
of computer software that was specially adapted for the blind.
	   Ironically, though, as computers became more popular and easier
for the sighted to use, blind progress went into a tailspin.
	   As long as computers dealt with words, the technology was a
great emancipator, but as the industry became more graphics-based,
with pictures replacing words, new programs meant only blurs to the
blind.
	   ``Just by the time we think we have gained the top of the
mountain, discovering computers and using them as tools to make our
employment and schooling easier, things change to Windows 95 and we
start to lose ground,'' said Betty Bird, senior vice president for
rehabilitation programs at New York City's The Lighthouse Inc.
	   Windows 95 and other systems incorporated icons or pictures and
a mouse, instead of keystrokes, to send commands to the machine.
	   Wilson Craig, spokesman for Henter-Joyce, which makes a
voice-text program for the visually impaired, said a lot of people
lost their jobs as CD-ROM and graphic-based programs became
mainstream.
	   Now, the computer industry has turned its focus to sound-text
and other audio programs and the visually impaired are slowly
regaining their foothold so the blind revolution can continue in
places like Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and other major cities
around the country.
	   A printed page placed under the lens of a closed-circuit color
monitor can be magnified tenfold; special programs modify a
computer's text size and fonts, so files and e-mail are readable;
evolving sound equipment gives text a voice, even on the Internet;
and Braille-and-speak keyboards allow for note-taking in the
classroom.
	   In Los Angeles, Milton Mejia's career as a building inspector
ended two years ago at age 38, as the white fog of glaucoma crowded
out the palette of light and color in one eye and made the other
nearly useless.
	   ``I couldn't drive anymore,'' Mejia said. ``It was frustrating
because I didn't know how to handle it. I was at home for two
years, sitting around going crazy.''
	   Mejia began training on the equipment in the fall, so he could
return to Smith-Emery Co. as an accounting clerk. The company,
which does building inspections and testing, helped offset the
training costs and bought Mejia's computer, said Jeff Zitko,
Mejia's boss.
	   ``He is one incredible employee who is willing to do anything
and if you give him the chance he can accomplish almost anything,''
Zitko said. ``We're doing what any decent company should do for
employees that are working hard.''
	   Mejia said his new skills have allowed him to regain his
dignity. ``Now I'll be able to keep on working, being the sole
supporter of the family,'' he said.
	   According to the National Center for Health Statistics, three
out of every 1,000 people, or about 13 million people in the United
States, are blind or visually impaired. Many are elderly, while
others lose their sight to disease or injury.
	   Patricia Conlee, career services director for the Braille
Institute, said anyone who can't read the first letter of an eye
chart while wearing corrective lenses is considered legally blind,
although about 90 percent of those who meet that threshold have
some vision. In some cases, they are able to tell night from day
and discern outlines from the edges of their retinas.
	   Conlee said about 30 percent of the visually impaired are
employed nationwide, many now benefiting from the new technologies.
But it's pricey.
	   Computers and programs can range from a few hundred dollars to
dlrs 5,000, depending on the extent of a user's disability. The
cost is often shared between the school, the employer and the
student. Grants can cover some of the costs, too.
	   ``We want to provide the employer with a qualified, capable
employee that they are hiring because they are the best person for
the job not because they are visually impaired,'' Conlee said.
	   The Chicago Lighthouse for People Who are Blind or Visually
Impaired placed about 38 percent of the 362 people who participated
in their job placement program last year. Some are now working in
public relations, as janitors, executive directors, customer
service representatives and many other service-related jobs. Their
salaries range from dlrs 18,500 to dlrs 50,000, vocational service
director Greg Polman said.

Most cybersex seekers don't fit stereotype 
</HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Sex on the Internet isn't just the domain
of dirty old men and teen-agers in hormonal overdrive. A new survey
says most Web surfers are simply looking for a little anonymous
titillation.
	   More than 9,000 Internet users responded to a 47-question
survey, posted during March and April on the MSNBC Web site. The
questionnaire was directed at users who had gone to the Web for
sexual pursuits.
	   The average Internet user, it turns out, looks at erotic
material for entertainment _ and often out of curiosity, the survey
showed.
	   ``People watch `Baywatch' but they don't necessarily get sexual
gratification from it, and in the same way people look at the
Victoria's Secret catalogue without the intention of buying
anything,'' said Dr. Alvin Cooper, who led the survey. ``It's
basically the same way on the Internet.''
	   The survey, released June 9, found that only 8 percent of those
who responded spent more than 10 hours a week engaged in online
sexual pursuits. About 3 percent to 6 percent of the general
population engages in sexually compulsive behavior, said Cooper, a
Stanford University researcher and clinical director of the San
Jose Marital Services and Sexuality Center.
	   ``That's the image people have, that the Web is kind of a den of
iniquity and that people who go on line will get addicted or get
stuck online,'' he said. ``But we found that wasn't the case.''
	   Five of six Internet users who visited sexual sites were male,
the survey said. Additionally, men tended to seek out pornographic
pictures, while women sought out ``chat rooms'' for sexually
related talk.
	   The survey found that 49 percent of women participated in chat
rooms, while only 23 percent of men did.
	   ``It mirrors what we see in society. Women are more interactive
and men are more interested in visual stimuli,'' Cooper said.
	   Women on the Web tend to be younger than their male
counterparts. Fifty-nine percent of the women who responded were in
the 18- to 34-year-old age bracket, whereas men were more evenly
divided, with 46 percent from that age group and 36 percent from
the 35- to 49-year-old bracket.
	   Cooper said access, affordability and anonymity are ``allowing
young adult women to be more comfortable experimenting with their
sexuality online than almost anywhere else.''
	   The researchers cited statistics gathered by Relevant Knowledge,
a Web-tracking service that found about 9.6 million people _ or
about 15 percent of all Internet users _ logged on to the 10 most
popular sex-related Web sites in April. There are an estimated
70,000 sex-related sites on the Internet.
	   Dr. Sylvain Boies, a clinical psychology fellow at Stanford who
aided Cooper with the survey, said he was stunned at the response.
More than 5,000 people replied to the survey in the first 24 hours
it was posted.
	   In the end, researchers threw out more than 4,000 replies for
various reasons, including incomplete forms.
	   But Dr. Patti Britton, a clinical sexologist based in Los
Angeles, questions the validity of the survey, because _ by its
very nature _ it was not a random sampling.
	   ``I think it's probably going to be a little bit skewed,'' she
said.
	   However, she did say that some parts of the survey rang true,
that women prefer chat rooms and that more Internet users look at
sexual sites for entertainment and education, rather than out of
compulsion.
	   Boies said despite the nature of the survey, it still provides a
snapshot of how people use the Web.
	   ``A lot of research is done with what we call convenient
samples,'' he said. ``It's not thought to be as rigorous as
research that uses a completely random sample. But I think it still
provides data that's valuable for research.''

Imelda Marcos postpones burial of Ferdinand Marcos in heroes' cemetery 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Bowing to widespread opposition,
former first lady Imelda Marcos postponed indefinitely Thursday the
burial of her husband, former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, in a
heroes' cemetery.
	   ``In the spirit of national interest, our family is prepared to
wait,'' Mrs. Marcos said in a statement. ``The burial of the late
President Marcos will be deferred to a more appropriate time.''
	   The emotion-charged dispute over whether Marcos should be buried
at Heroes' Cemetery in metropolitan Manila nearly nine years after
dying in exile in 1989 has divided Filipinos. President Fidel
Ramos, who steps down June 30, ordered a halt Tuesday to
construction of Marcos' grave at the cemetery during the remainder
of his term.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, had
agreed, however, to allow Marcos' burial on July 11, saying it was
time to put the issue to rest. Since Estrada announced the
decision, widespread opposition to the plan was eroding the massive
popular support he received in last month's elections.
	   Marcos' 20-year rule ended in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986.
After he died in Hawaii, his body was not allowed to return to the
Philippines until September 1993. Since then it has been kept in a
glass coffin in an air-conditioned mausoleum in his northern
hometown.
	   Both Ramos and his predecessor, Corazon Aquino, refused to let
Marcos' body be brought to Manila, fearing conflicts between the
former strongman's supporters and opponents.
	   In recent days there have been almost daily demonstrations
against the planned burial. On Tuesday, opponents launched a
``Marcos is No Hero'' movement, saying that instead of
reconciliation, the burial at the cemetery, where many soldiers who
died in battle are buried, will open old wounds.
	   Some relatives of soldiers buried in the cemetery said they
planned to transfer their dead elsewhere if Marcos' burial pushed
through.
	   Marcos' supporters say his burial at the cemetery is appropriate
because he was a veteran who fought during World War II.
	   The government accuses the late president and his associates of
illegally amassing billions of dollars during his 20-year rule.
Marcos' government also was accused of torturing and murdering
political dissidents.
	   Estrada had specified that Marcos would not receive state honors
during the burial. He also forbade any rallies along the route to
the cemetery and said only family members could attend.

Basic discoveries into genetic roots of cancer begin to pay off AP Medical Editor 
</HEADLINE>

By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Twenty years of research into
the origins of malignancy jell into one profound insight: Cancer is
a disease of genes gone bad.
	   Already, this idea has revolutionized the way scientists look at
cancer, and it seems certain to change the way doctors treat it,
too. Indeed, many believe medicine is on the brink of an entirely
new approach to controlling this most feared of diseases, one that
targets the genetic mistakes at the heart of cancer and reverses
them.
	   In hindsight, the biggest cancer news of modern times is so very
simple. All tumors spring from errors in the assembly plans for
proteins that tell cells when to grow and when to die.
	   Like many big ideas, the discovery of cancer's roots dawned
gradually. One experiment at a time, seemingly irrelevant bits of
scientific fact mass into a new way of thinking.
	   Among these was an almost-forgotten experiment at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1981. A team led by molecular biologist
Robert Weinberg explored whether some genetic element inside tumor
cells could transform normal ones into cancer.
	   One day the scientists pulled the DNA out of a kind of rat
cancer called a neuroblastoma and put the genes into mouse cells.
Soon healthy cells became cancerous.
	   The seed turned out to be a flawed bit of genetic code, one of
the first discoveries in a new class known as oncogenes. The
scientists called it ``neu'' and moved on. They had no idea what
they found would ever be relevant in treating breast cancer, a
disease that kills 43,500 women yearly.
	   Yet in the completely unpredictable way basic discoveries morph
into truly useful information, Weinberg's rat gene became key. It
is at the heart of the first effective human cancer treatment based
on exploiting the genetic differences between cancer cells and
healthy ones.
	   Herceptin, the medicine that grew out of that MIT experiment, is
moving toward U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for breast
cancer and could be on the market this fall.
	   ``The translation of this basic research into the clinic is just
beginning,'' says Weinberg, now a researcher at the Whitehead
Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge. ``We are seeing the
harbinger of what is going to happen in the next decade of the new
century.''
	   If treatments work as well as many believe they can, they will
destroy malignant cells but leave healthy ones alone, sparing
patients the frightful side effects of standard cancer therapy.
	   ``Everyone in the field is excited because this black box called
cancer is not such a mystery anymore,'' says Dr. Bert Vogelstein of
Johns Hopkins University, another of the field's early explorers.
``Once you understand something, medical history shows it's only a
matter of time before you can exploit that and do something about
it.''
	   That matter of time, though, can be considerable. Several years
passed after Weinberg's discovery before other scientists found a
human counterpart of neu, a gene they called HER-2/neu. The gene
produces a protein on the surface of cells that serves as a
receiving point for growth-stimulating hormones.
	   Dr. Dennis Slamon's team at the University of California, Los
Angeles, found that about 30 percent of women with breast cancer
have many extra copies of this gene. The result: Their breast cells
reproduce out of control and spread through their bodies.
	   Scientists reasoned that they might reduce HER-2/neu's impact by
somehow blocking the extra hormone docking points created by the
gene. At Genentech Inc., they cloned antibodies designed to do
this. One turned out to be Herceptin, which eventually proved able
to shrink and sometimes even eliminate widely spread breast cancer.
	   The National Cancer Institute estimates that at least 10 to 20
drugs now in human testing are designed, like Herceptin, to stop
cancer by fixing in bad genes.
	   What's broken in cancer are the genes that rule the cell's life
cycle. Each gene contains the building plan for a protein,
including ones that trigger the cell to divide and eventually to
die in an orderly way.
	   When one of these normal genes develops a disastrous glitch,
it's called an oncogene. An oncogene may stay turned on, constantly
pouring out growth-promoting protein that ordinarily occurs only in
brief bursts. Or it may produce a protein that is overly powerful.
	   When all goes well, another class of genes, called tumor
suppressor genes, detects these mistakes and orders the cell to
either fix the foul-up or die. When the suppressor gene itself is
broken, however, cancer moves another step closer.
	   Generally it takes several different genetic flaws, accumulated
over a lifetime, to finally tip a cell into uncontrolled growth.
Even when that happens, however, another decade or two may pass
before it grows into a tumor large enough to be noticed.
	   Dr. Stephen Friend of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle, a co-discoverer of tumor suppressor genes, notes that only
this year have researchers begun to feel confident about the
potential of genetic approaches to cancer.
	   ``You can bet we will have a significant effect on curing
cancer,'' he predicts. ``It's now no longer a question. It's just
which approach will prove out.''
	   Many experts doubt that any of the drugs now in human testing
will be a slam-dunk cure for cancer _ or for any of the 100-plus
individual diseases that are called cancer. Like Herceptin, which
adds three months to the lives of terminally ill breast cancer
patients, these medicines may help some people some times, but they
are likely to be used mostly in combination with standard
chemotherapy, radiation and surgery.

	   All major pharmaceutical firms, plus many small biotech
companies, are working on genetic approaches to cancer. Among the
targets farthest along:
	   _Ras. This normal growth-signaling gene becomes an oncogene when
it mutates and sticks forever in the ``on'' position, delivering an
erroneous order to divide again and again. It's often involved in
colon, lung and pancreatic cancer.
	   Researchers are testing drugs that interfere with farnesyl
transferase, an enzyme that helps carry out one step in a chemical
chain reaction that delivers the ras gene's growth signal.
	   _EGF receptor. Short for epidermal growth factor, this spot on
the surface of cells receives growth signals secreted by other
organs. It relays the message inside the cell to the ras gene,
which takes it the next step.
	   In some cancers, cells have many extra copies of the EGF
receptor, so the growth message gets vastly amplified. Researchers
are testing antibodies, similar to Herceptin, that block the EGF
receptor.
	   _P53. This is one of more than 50 known tumor suppressor genes.
About half of tumors escape the body's anticancer surveillance
system, in part because of bad p53 genes.
	   Several teams are experimenting with treatments that introduce
good copies of p53 into tumors, where they oversee their
destruction. Another approach is targeting cells with a virus that
kills those without a working p53 gene.
	   ``This is just the very beginning,'' says Dr. Jack Roth of M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who is testing p53-based
treatments.
	   Friend, who pioneered the field of suppressor genes, notes that
the pipeline between a basic discovery and the development of a
useful drug can be up to 10 years long. Therapies based on
attacking oncogenes are farther along in the pipeline because
oncogenes were discovered first, not because they are necessarily
the best target.
	   ``The excitement is not because the first drops are out of the
faucet,'' Friend says. ``It's because the pipeline is full now of
great ideas.''
	   The next generation of genetically based cancer drugs is likely
to be built on more recent discoveries in the subtle differences
that set cancer apart. Among these are insights into the regulation
of mitosis, the way cells divide; apoptosis, the process that makes
cells die on schedule, and telomerase, an enzyme that cancer uses
to short-circuit the cell's built-in limit on the number of times
it can divide.
	   Since 1980, the National Cancer Institute has spent more than
dlrs 13 billion for scientists like Weinberg to study the basic
biology of cancer. Weinberg is deeply pleased to see the start of a
payoff with the advent of Herceptin.
	   ``It's the first time in my life that anything I've done has had
any favorable effect on anybody's health,'' he says. ``I feel very
good about it.''

World Cup: FIFA note _ only Nigeria survives as four go out in first round AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ According to FIFA, Africa is the future of soccer.
So how many of the record five African nations have made it to
round two of the World Cup?
	   One.
	   After Wednesday's elimination of South Africa following the
disappearance of Cameroon, Morocco and Tunisia, only Olympic
champion Nigeria has made it to the last 16.
	   With the World Cup expanded to 32 teams from 24 for 1998, FIFA
increased Africa's number of qualifiers from three to five.
	   The results make FIFA's pronouncement that it is looking to
Africa to lead soccer into the 21st century a little premature at
least. If 1998's results are anything to go by, Africa _ Nigeria
apart _ has a lot of catching up to do.
	   Europe and South America have remained the major forces in world
soccer for decades and look like staying so. Africa has shown real
signs it has the talent but not the organization.
	   Most of the biggest African stars, such as AC Milan's Liberian
striker George Weah and Internazionale's Nigerian, Nwankwo Kanu,
earn their fortunes in Europe because clubs and federations in
Africa can't afford to keep them.
	   Bora Milutinovic, a Yugoslav who coaches Nigeria, and Philippe
Troussier, a Frenchman in charge of South Africa, are witnessing
the development of African soccer. They both see a wealth of talent
but lament the lack of a structure to compete with Europe and South
America.
	   South Africa and Cameroon say they may have been robbed of
places in round two by dubious referees' decisions. Morocco
appeared to be on its way after outplaying Scotland 3-0 but was
ousted by two late Norwegian goals against Brazil.
	   Tunisia was beaten by England and Colombia without scoring a
goal so have no excuses.
	   South Africa was the last of the four to go. The Bafana Bafana
needed a three-goal victory over the last place Saudis and was a
goal ahead when referee Chilean referee Mario Sanchez awarded a
dubious penalty.
	   Sami al-Jaber's spot kick made it 1-1 and that effectively
finished off South Africa's slim chance. The 2-2 tie meant that
Denmark gained the qualifying place despite a 2-1 loss to group
winner France.
	   On Tuesday it was Cameroon who was moaning at the referee.
	   Coach Claude Leroy and his players insisted they were robbed by
Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner's refusal to allow a second-half
goal by Francois Omam Biyick. The ``goal'' would have given
Cameroon the lead and a victory would have propelled the
Indomitable Lions into the second round. The score remained 1-1 and
Chile made it to round two instead along with group winner Italy.
	   Moroccan fans cheered wildly at Saint-Etienne when their team
beat the Scots. When news came that Norway had beaten defending
titlist Brazil 2-1 with two goals in the last seven minutes
including a penalty that shouldn't have been, they were weeping
along with the players.
	   Nigeria, despite its 3-1 loss to Paraguay Wednesday after it had
already qualified, remains a beacon of hope for the Africans.
	   Many of its Olympic squad remain, including 10 players from the
1994 World Cup in the United States. Having scored a 3-2
come-from-behind victory over Spain _ another of the fancied teams
_ the Nigerians downed 1994 semifinalist Bulgaria 1-0 to gain a
place in the second round.
	   With its talented strikeforce and midfield, including Augustine
``Jay Jay'' Okacha, Nwankwo Kanu, Rasheed Yekini, Finidi George,
Victor Ikpeba and Sunday Oliseh, the Nigerians look capable of
making the last eight at least.
	   Coach Bora Milutinovic, whose World Cup experience includes
taking Mexico, Costa Rica and Mexico to round two as well as the
Nigerians, believes he could even have a World Cup winner this
time.
	   ``Everything about the team convinces me,'' the Yugoslav said.
``These players can beat anyone. We have a lot of talent and
confidence. There are teams that are better than us but, like in
life, anything is possible at the World Cup.''
	   After seeing his team go out, South African coach Philippe
Troussier said the problem with African soccer was organization on
the field.
	   ``African players have great talent in soccer, but at the same
time they lack the collective effort,'' the Frenchman said. ``The
teamwork doesn't exist. Players go in and just shoot aimlessly.
They don't think when they have to pass.''
	   ``I'm impressed with Nigeria's performance. I saw real hope in
Nigeria. They have the talent and the players, as far as I can see,
are thinking and looking for ways toward the openings.''
	   ``Nigeria puts its opponents under pressure from the start. They
don't slow down,'' Troussier said.
	   ``I have a strong feeling that they will make it to the
quarterfinals.''

Authorities begin shifting panicky villagers from tiger zone 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Authorities in northern Malaysia
are shifting villagers from their homes into fenced pens to avoid
attack by a man-eating tiger, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The Star daily quoted Deputy Commissioner Mariman Taib of Perak
state as saying Wednesday that it was not safe for the villagers to
remain home at night.
	   Local police joined in a massive tiger hunt in the region after
the tiger ate two people last week. The area, located 250
kilometers (156 miles) north of Kuala Lumpur, is inhabited by
indigenous people who earn their wages from working in oil palm
plantations.
	   Villagers have commissioned a local magician to lure the tiger
into a trap. On Monday night, a ``bomoh,'' or magician, dressed as
a tiger, performed rituals aimed at trapping the man-eater.
	   ``The bomoh transformed himself into a tiger and acted the way a
tiger will normally do, such as growling, walking and lying down,''
said Latif Wahab, 49, a resident of one of the villages.
	   ``However, the tiger ran away because someone got scared and
switched on a torchlight,'' he said.
	   Game wardens were trying to determine why the tiger has started
to attack humans.
	   Unchecked development that has encroached into the forests could
have depleted the tiger's natural prey or the animal could be old
or ill and no longer able to hunt, wildlife officials in Perak
said.
	   The area was formerly designated as the Chior game reserve, but
recently it has been included under a land development scheme, the
Star said.
	   There are no reliable estimates of how many tigers live in the
many forests across tropical nation, but the World Wildlife Fund
has recently started a tiger census in Malaysia.

SOCOG sues activist over modified logo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Federal Court has ordered an animal
rights activist to stop using a modified Sydney Olympic logo, which
she used to protest against the abuse of chickens.
	   Pam Clarke, a battery hens campaigner from Hobart, was sued by
the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG).
	   The modified logo was used on T-shirts, stickers and posters,
prompting the legal action for breach of copyright.
	   Nearly two years ago, Clarke modified the Sydney Olympics
graphic, which then featured a runner with boomerang-shaped limbs
and the words ``Sydney 2000''.
	   She said the logo resembled a sad chicken and replaced the
slogan ``Sydney 2000'' with ``Free Battery Hens 2000'', added five
eggs to replace the Olympic rings, and added bars, to represent the
cages which enclosed battery hens.
	   Justice Catherine Branson found Thursday that Clarke had
infringed the logo and ordered her to stop doing so and to give up
all copies of material which featured the logo.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Departing in a swirl of controversy over his
China policy, President Bill Clinton pledged to use the first visit
by a U.S. president since the Tiananmen Square crackdown to ``say
what I have to say'' about human rights.
	   Personal diplomacy is the surest way to gain a more open Chinese
society, Clinton told a crowd of military families at Elmendorf Air
Force Base in Alaska during a refueling stop en route to China.
	   ``Even in our differences, meeting with them ... face to face is
the best way to advance our ideals and our values,'' Clinton said,
receiving applause from 4,000 people gathered in an airport hangar.
	   ``Over time, the more we bring China into the world, the more
the world will bring freedom to China,'' the president added.
	   Presidential spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States will
give Chinese officials an American flag that flew over the Capitol
and copies of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S.
Constitution. The items came from Republican congressional critics
of Clinton's policy of engagement with China, who delivered them to
the White House as suggested gifts.
	   ``It struck us all as a worthy exercise,'' McCurry said, adding
that America's symbols of democracy were ``appropriate gifts'' for
China.
	   In an interview with Radio Free Asia, Clinton said he wants his
trip to be a springboard for the causes of democracy and freedom in
China's closed society, and hopes it will yield an agreement on
nuclear nonproliferation.
	   Even as Clinton flew to China for a nine-day visit, police there
arrested one dissident and detained the friends of another in a
display of Beijing's hard line against pro-democracy activists.
	   In Xi'an, where Clinton was to visit on Thursday, police also
detained Yan Jun, a dissident who took part in a letter signed by
70 people asking Clinton to meet democracy activists while in
China, the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.

Dollar edges higher, stocks gain slightly in Tokyo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen
Thursday morning, but its gains were limited on fears of
intervention by Japan's central bank. Tokyo stocks rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 141.26 yen at midday, up 0.90 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 141.25
yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 69.63 points, or 0.46 percent, to 15,192.81 at the end of the
morning session. On Wednesday, the index closed up 68.58 points, or
0.46 percent.
	   Despite a slew of yen-supportive comments by Japanese officials,
the dollar gained ground in the absence of firm hints that there
would be joint central bank intervention.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, vice minister for international affairs at
the Finance Ministry, said Thursday that Japan will intervene in
foreign exchange markets when necessary.
	   ``When it is appropriate, we will intervene, when it isn't
appropriate, we won't,'' Sakakibara told reporters.
	   He said the ministry remains in close contact with its
counterparts in other Group of Seven nations and Asian countries.
	   Separately, Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the international
bureau at the same ministry, told reporters that he was
``concerned'' about recent movements in foreign exchange markets.
	   Last week, Japan and the United States sold dollars and bought
yen to reverse growing weakness in the Japanese currency, which had
fallen to eight-year lows.
	   On the stock market, prices advanced slightly on strength in
shares of exporting companies following the dollar's overnight
gains against the yen, traders said. A stronger dollar makes the
price of Japanese goods cheaper on overseas markets.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.01 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,185.94. The
TOPIX rose 5.51 points, or 0.47 percent, the previous day.
	   But trading remained sparse as shares of the Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan dropped, rekindling concerns about Japan's banking
industry.
	   Shares in LTCB fell to their par value of 50 yen during the
morning before recovering slightly to end the session at 57 yen,
down 13 yen from Wednesday's close.
	   Many investors continued to watch the government's progress in
mapping out steps to revive the ailing financial sector.
	   Technology shares received a boost from the overnight gains of
similar issues on Wall Street.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.200 percent from Tuesday's 1.260 percent, driving
its price up to 111.96 yen from 111.53 yen.

SOCOG sues activist over modified logo

EDS: Retransmitting to correct category code
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Federal Court has ordered an animal
rights activist to stop using a modified Sydney Olympic logo, which
she used to protest against the abuse of chickens.
	   Pam Clarke, a battery hens campaigner from Hobart, was sued by
the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG).
	   The modified logo was used on T-shirts, stickers and posters,
prompting the legal action for breach of copyright.
	   Nearly two years ago, Clarke modified the Sydney Olympics
graphic, which then featured a runner with boomerang-shaped limbs
and the words ``Sydney 2000''.
	   She said the logo resembled a sad chicken and replaced the
slogan ``Sydney 2000'' with ``Free Battery Hens 2000'', added five
eggs to replace the Olympic rings, and added bars, to represent the
cages which enclosed battery hens.
	   Justice Catherine Branson found Thursday that Clarke had
infringed the logo and ordered her to stop doing so and to give up
all copies of material which featured the logo.

MetroStars down Revolution 5-3 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Rookie defender Mike Petke
snapped a 3-3 tie with the first goal of his professional career in
the 69th minute Wednesday as the New York-New Jersey MetroStars
beat New England 5-3, the Revolution's seventh straight loss.
	   The victory was the sixth in eight games for the MetroStars
(9-7), who moved into second place in the MLS Eastern Conference
one point ahead of the idle Columbus Crew.
	   Petke, the MetroStars' first-round pick out of Southern
Connecticut, had just one assist in his first 12 appearances.
	   Although the MetroStars dominated the first half, it was the
Revolution (4-10) who tallied first when Raul Diaz Arce notched his
ninth goal of the season in the 31st minute.
	   Diaz Arce beat an offside trap and ran onto a through pass from
Oscar Pareja then beat MetroStars goalkeeper Tony Meola with his
shot into the far corner from a sharp right angle.
	   New York-New Jersey equalized in the 40th minute on a goal set
up by a brilliant individual effort by Paul Dougherty. The
diminutive midfielder dribbled past his defender and ripped a shot
off the bar. The shot rebounded to teammate Brian Kelly who headed
the rebound home.
	   The MetroStars made it 2-1 less than two minutes before the
interval after New England defender Ivan McKinley was called for a
handball in the penalty box. Revolution keeper Ian Feuer was able
to deflect Diego Senora's penalty kick off the post but Giovanni
Savarese pounced on the rebound and tucked in home for his eighth
goal of the year.
	   Kelly added his second goal of the match in the 53rd minute
heading in a cross from Senora.
	   But New England battled back to tie the game on Edwin Gorter's
goal in the 64th minute and Diaz-Arce's second score of the match
in the 68th minute.
	   That set the stage for Petke who drilled his game-winning goal
into the upper right corner of the net from the top of the box.
Dougherty added an insurance goal in the 87th minute giving the
MetroStars a team record for goals in a match.

Share prices of ailing Japanese bank plunge 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with morning close; ADDS restructuring plan, byline
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Share prices of the Long-Term Credit Bank plunged
to 50 yen in early trading Thursday, adding to fears that the
institution may be foundering.
	   Share prices dropped to that level from Wednesday's close of 70
yen within the first hour of trading. LTCB closed the morning
session at 57 yen per share.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, the 22nd largest bank in the world
according to Forbes magazine, has become the focus of concern among
investors as Japan's banks struggle to get out from under a
mountain of bad debt.
	   Bank officials have repeatedly denied rumors that the bank is on
the verge of failure, but they recently acknowledged it holds some
1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans.
	   At the bank's annual shareholders meeting Thursday, bank
officials detailed plans to shut down about half of its overseas
outlets and cut staff by 20 percent. That plan had been formulated
in February, before its current crisis began.
	   Bank spokesmen refused to comment on reports that the bank is
seeking a merger in order to stay afloat.
	   Japan's government said Wednesday it is racing to set up an
emergency bank to provide loans to cash-strapped companies left out
in the cold by private banks struggling with bad loans.
	   Details remain vague, but the new bank likely would fill a
breech left by bad loan-burdened private banks that could go out of
business.
	   Investors are concerned, however, that the government may be
willing to let some weak institutions go under in order to
strengthen the overall financial system.
	   That concern began to focus on LTCB last week, after Moody's
Investors Services lowered its credit rating for the bank and sent
its share prices plunging.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank is one of three credit banks established
at the end of World War II to provide long-term business loans in
an effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   But as deregulation has made it easier for companies to raise
money directly by issuing stocks or selling bonds, the banks' role
has been largely lost.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank has 3,600 employees and 28 trillion (dlrs
203 billion) in assets.

Eds: RECAPS Angola to UPDATE with council extending deadline
By ROBERT H. REID

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council agreed to give
Angola's UNITA movement five more days to comply with terms of a
peace plan after receiving assurances from the former rebels that
they would meet the new deadline.
	   The council this month approved a resolution freezing UNITA's
foreign bank accounts and banning its diamond exports effective
Thursday unless it handed over its central highland strongholds to
the government and took major steps to demilitarize its armed
forces.
	   Less than two hours before the sanctions were to take effect,
the council agreed to give UNITA more time. The new resolution,
approved unanimously late Wednesday, says the sanctions will go
into force at one minute after midnight next Wednesday New York
time unless Secretary-General Kofi Annan declares UNITA has
complied with terms of the 1994 peace accord.
	   The council acted on a recommendation from the international
commission which oversees the accord. The commission _ which
includes representatives of the United Nations, the Angolan
government, UNITA, the United States, Russia and Portugal _ met
Wednesday in the Angolan capital Luanda.
	   After the meeting, the U.N. special envoy to Angola, Alioune
Blondin Beye, reported that UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi had
``expressed his willingness to cooperate'' in the transfer of four
designated localities by Tuesday.
	   But the meaning of ``willingness to cooperate'' was unclear and
whether it constituted a specific promise to complete the transfer
or simply take steps in that direction.
	   The United Nations has long complained that UNITA has stalled in
fulfilling terms of the agreement, signed four years ago in Lusaka,
Zambia, to end the two-decade civil war.
	   U.N. officials said the Angolan government complained that no
extension should be granted until Savimbi agreed to a specific
timetable. But U.N. and other international officials put pressure
on the government to accept the delay, arguing that the extension
was so short that no timetable was necessary.
	   In Luanda, U.N. spokesman Moktar Gueye said there was ``no
straightjacket'' on how much time the former foes would be given to
resolve their differences, as long as they were talking to each
other.
	   However, he noted that the patience of the international
community was running thin _ an observation U.N. officials have
been making for years.
	   Some U.N. officials acknowledged that it would be very difficult
to enforce the ban on UNITA diamond exports, from which the
movement earns hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said diamond
trading is one of the world's most secretive enterprises. A million
dollars worth of diamonds can be smuggled in a pocket.
	   Travel sanctions were already slapped on UNITA in October, in
addition to an oil and weapons embargo in effect since 1993.
	   UNITA has complained of police brutality and harassment of its
supporters in areas returned to government control.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war for nearly two
decades against the government following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.

Campaigning begins for Japan's July 12 parliamentary elections 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Candidates took to the streets nationwide as
campaigning kicked off Thursday for a key parliamentary election
that comes amid Japan's worst economic crisis in half a century.
	   The July 12 vote, besides covering half the 252 seats in
Parliament's upper house, is also widely seen as a referendum on
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's management of Japan's tottering
economy.
	   The immediate goal of Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party is to regain a single majority in the body _ an advantage it
already enjoys in the more powerful lower house.
	   But Japan's fragmented opposition and even some elements within
his own party have blamed Hashimoto for poor policies that they say
have prolonged Japan's recession.
	   Japan's economy, once the envy of the world, has been slumping
this decade, weighed under by a banking crisis and its worst
recession since the end of World War II.
	   During the campaign, LDP candidates are expected to emphasize
the upcoming implementation of measures included in a 16.65
trillion yen (dlrs 118 billion) pump-priming package aimed at
restoring growth.
	   Opposition parties, meanwhile, are expected to promise a major
tax cut while attacking the policies of Hashimoto, whose popularity
is at the lowest level since he took office at the beginning of
1996.
	   ``Please trust me and the Liberal Democratic Party,'' an
emotional Hashimoto said during a campaign speech in Tokyo Thursday
morning. ``We need your support so we can have stable politics and
make this country better.''
	   Local media have reported that some 480 candidates were expected
to run, down from 567 in the last upper house election in 1995.
Registration ends later Thursday.
	   Hashimoto's party has officially endorsed 57 candidates for
single-seat electoral districts, 20 more than in the previous
election.
	   In an apparent attempt to gain broader support, the party has
added scholars, artists and writers to its list of candidates
running under a nationwide proportional representation system.
	   The Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition force, has
put forward 46 candidates for single-seat constituencies and
proportional representation.
	   Analysts say it is banking on the the popularity of telegenic
party president Naoto Kan, a tough-talking former Health and
Welfare Minister, to increase its seat count.
	   ``Let's say no to the Liberal Democrats,'' Kan said in his
opening speech Thursday.
	   The Social Democratic Party, which recently ended its
non-Cabinet alliance with the Liberal Democrats, and the Japan
Communist Party are expected to target undecided voters.

Asian crisis hurting China's finances 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The Asian financial crisis is adding to the
already heavy burdens of the China's overstrained state coffers,
the state-run newspaper China Daily reported Thursday.
	   Between January and May, state tax revenues grew by 7.7 percent,
while expenditures rose 12.8 percent, the newspaper quoted Finance
Minister Xiang Huaicheng as saying.
	   A drop in tax collections, slugging consumer demand and poor
performances by state-run firms had caused a ``serious financial
situation,'' Xiang told the standing committee of the national
legislature.
	   ``The financial situation is full of comparatively severe
problems,'' Xiang was quoted as saying.
	   The crunch comes as the government is stepping up investment in
infrastructure and other areas to fight slackening demand caused by
the regional downturn.
	   A need to spend more on grain purchases, export promotion and
unemployment insurance and other social welfare are adding to state
burdens, the report said.
	   China recorded a financial deficit of 55.8 billion yuan (dlrs
6.7 billion) in 1997, it said.

Navy resumes work to lift sunken North Korean sub 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ With a storm approaching, navy
divers struggled in high seas Thursday to raise a captured North
Korean submarine that sank as it was being towed to port.
	   After suspending salvage operations during the night, divers
went down again at daybreak to try to attach four car-sized air
bags to the sunken sub with cables.
	   If the bags can be attached, air will be pumped into them in an
attempt to lift the sub 33 meters (110 feet) to the surface and tow
it to a pier at this South Korean naval base for examination.
	   Having detected no signs of life, military officials thought the
submarine's crew was either dead or had escaped before the ship was
captured Monday.
	   Used primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct surveillance, the
small, 70-ton Yugo-class submarine normally carries a crew of about
six.
	   A storm warning was expected to be issued for the area in the
afternoon and officials said salvage work could be further delayed.
Heavy rains and strong winds already were buffeting the region.
	   ``Our tentative conclusion is that there is no one alive
inside,'' said Lt. Col. Kim Chong-sook, a spokesman for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
	   Kim acknowledged, however, that the crew could have fled after
the submarine was found entangled in a fishing net by a passing
fishing boat.
	   ``There was a 50-minute gap between when it was first found
stuck in the fishing net and when it was captured by navy ships,''
he said.
	   The submarine broke loose from a tow line and sank 1.6
kilometers (a mile) off shore Tuesday while being towed to this
east coast naval base by a South Korean frigate.
	   In Seoul, President Kim Dae-jung reaffirmed that his policy of
engagement toward the communist North would not be swayed by the
discovery of the submarine.
	   ``As shown in the intrusion of our territorial waters by the
North Korean sub, military tensions persist even now on the Korean
peninsula,'' Kim said in a speech marking the 45th anniversary
Thursday of the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950.
	   ``But the new government will continue to strive to safeguard
peace and expand South-North exchanges and cooperation on the basis
of a firm defense posture and a flexible policy toward the North,''
he said.
	   The sub's intrusion was a serious test of the so-called
``sunshine policy'' of the Kim's government, which was inaugurated
in February with a pledge to open up the reclusive North through
expanded civilian contacts and cooperation.
	   Opposition politicians and some newspaper editorials have
criticized Kim for not taking a harder line with North Korea
following the sub's discovery.
	   The sub was found in the general area where another, larger
North Korean sub ran aground two years ago. The 1996 incursion
triggered a 53-day manhunt that left 24 North Korean infiltrators
and 13 South Koreans dead and relations between the two Koreas at
their worst in years.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

China landslides, floods kill at least 112, injure more than 100 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Landslides and floods caused by heavy summer
rains have killed at least 112 people and injured more than 119
others in three southern provinces, state media reported.
	   More than 60 others people were still missing following the
landslides Monday in Jiangxi and Zhejiang and the severe flooding
in Fujian, the reports said.
	   The scenic southern city of Guilin, where President Clinton is
due to visit next Thursday, is suffering its worst floods in nearly
50 years, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said in a report late
Wednesday.
	   Many city districts were inundated, and more rains were
expected, it said.
	   At least 43 villagers were buried alive in massive landslides in
a hilly region in Jiangxi's Lichuan county, Xinhua said. More than
100 people were injured and over 20 others left missing, it said.
The landslides also destroyed 500 houses.
	   Another landslide in the Zhejiang village of Xinjian followed
heavy rainstorms that destroyed 14 houses and left 151 homeless.
The landslide killed 17 people, injured 19, and left 6 missing,
Xinhua said.
	   The village in the southern part of Zhejiang, on China's eastern
seaboard, has been hit by rains since June 12, the heaviest
downpour of its kind in five decades, Xinhua said.
	   Severe floods have killed 44 people and left another 34 missing
in Fuzhou, capital of southeastern Fujian province, the China Daily
said Thursday. The floods have damaged more than 60,000 buildings,
leaving 20,000 people homeless, the official newspaper said.
	   Another eight people have been killed by flooding in Jiangxi as
major rivers reached or surpassed flood warning levels, the
newspaper said. Roads, and electricity and telephone lines were
damaged, and more than 150,000 houses destroyed, it said.
	   The floods, caused by torrential rains since mid-June, are the
heaviest to hit the two provinces this century, the newspaper said.
