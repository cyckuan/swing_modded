<HEADLINE> Deputy Yugoslav Minister Denied Access into Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides Tuesday confirmed reports that a deputy Yugoslav
minister was denied access into Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Kasoulides said the decision is part of
the policy of the Cypriot government to align with European Union
(EU) measures against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus has opted to go along the path leading to
Europe. Cyprus is holding membership talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said the entry denial decision does
not constitute a hostile action. He did not mention the name of
the deputy Yugoslav minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the bilateral relations between Cyprus and Yugoslavia
remain friendly and "we believe Yugoslavia understands the
difficulties we are facing."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has decided to align itself as far as
possible with the EU sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include a ban on the entry of some 300 Yugoslav
politicians, military officials, journalists and members of
President Slobodan Milosevic's family into EU member states.

<HEADLINE> Integration Must Be Balanced: Ugandan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Regional integration must be
balanced, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said at the closing
ceremony of the fourth summit of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) in Kenyan capital Nairobi Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By emphasizing balanced integration, Museveni noted the
balanced investment and the free movement of capital and labor are
as important as that of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Without investment, the rich hydro, mineral, tourism resources
in the sub-region couldn't be tapped, he said.
</P>
<P>
Regional integration is not easy to achieve, the president
said, hinting that if not properly managed, it might ignite
business wars.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no opportunity of development without
integration because the individual markets in the sub-region are
too small and fragmented to compete in the world trade.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, the newly-elected chairman of
 COMESA, also noted at the summit that globalization has
threatened to marginalize the sub-region, causing capital outflow
and provoking protectionism.
</P>
<P>
Regional integration is both essential and crucial to offset
the impact of the globalization, he said, urging the COMESA
members to buy goods and services from within the region and to
develop industry.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA is counting down toward the attainment of a
free-trade area by October 31, 2000. And the trade bloc is also
aiming to create a free investment area as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Angolan-Zambian Ties Normal: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Ambassador to Zambia Manuel
Augusto said Tuesday that his country enjoys normal relations with
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a rally to mark 36th anniversary of African
Freedom Day here, he told the press that although the two
countries are having a tense time at the moment, the Angolan
people are grateful to Zambia for what it did for the liberation
of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Augusto said that once peace is achieved in Angola it will be
of advantage to the Zambian people and their government because
the economy of the country will be boosted.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that the talks held in Mbabane, Swaziland,
between Zambia and Angola were meant to be a first step to find
ways of resolving the problems.
</P>
<P>
The talks went on as scheduled and the presidents of the two
countries will eventually meet to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the Angolan government would like the
Zambian government to fire its ministers, who have been charged by
Angola with supplying arms to the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), he said Angola can't interfere in
the decision of the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year Angola repeatedly accused Zambia of supplying
arms to UNITA rebels while Zambia strongly denied the charge.

<HEADLINE> Germany Reports Billions Losses in Alpine Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Losses up to 2.1 billion marks (1.1
billion U.S. dollars) have been caused by days of floods that hit
Germany's southern regions near Alpine Mountains, officials said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the southern state of Bavaria, regions of about 120 square
kilometers were over-flooded, said Environment State Secretary
Christa Stewens, adding that 25,000 properties were damaged by the
floods.
</P>
<P>
At least 4 people were killed in Bavaria by floods, and other
two, who were missing 3 days ago, were feared dead.
</P>
<P>
The Bavarian state government has deployed thousands of workers
to cope with the floods. But cities near the river of Donau and
the lake of Bodensee were still in a state of emergency until
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Konstanz, the water gauge remained 5.65 meter on
Tuesday, 2 meters over normal level. If the water rises over 6
meter, the old city would be submerged.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of workers were busy blocking the dam breaks to defend
the tiny city of Neustadt on Tuesday. The city with 12,000
residents is in "top crisis", said local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Although fewer clouds over the region were expected in coming
days, experts warned against threats from melting mountain snow.
People in the region may have to live with floods for weeks, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The German Weather Service on Tuesday forecast an early Summer
in Alpine region. A much warmer weather will prevail in the
mountainous region, parts of which are covered by meters-deep
snow.
</P>
<P>
Because large amount of snow will melt in the mountains, there
is a danger that further floods hit the Alpine region following
weeks, said Gerhard Benz, geologist with Muenchner Rueck, world's
largest reassurance company.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian FM Urges African Nations to Unite for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Africa should unite to
develop economy, and fight for debt relief so that it will not be
dropped out in the next century, Tanzanian foreign minister Jakaya
Kikwete said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Russian Cultural Center in Dar es Salaam in an
occasion to mark the African Day, Kikwete told the African
diplomats accredited to Tanzania that the continent needs unity
now than ever before.
</P>
<P>
"We need to speak in one voice, particularly when facing rich
and powerful nations and international financial and economic
entities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said it is important that African countries, which have
not joined any economic groupings, make a move to join the nearest
one.
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest challenge in the next millenium is to ensure the
realization of the African Economic Community in concrete terms,"
he said. " Our survival depends on it."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to African countries to invest more in education,
science and technology if it wants to ensure development in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
"If we have to make the next century as Africa's we have to
invest more in education and advancement of science and
technology," he said, adding that the continent is not doing
enough at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister cited Japan and the Republic of Korea
which committed themselves to education and training as countries
that have made great strides in human development and economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete further spoke of the exigency of African countries
jointly fighting to ensure the removal of debt burden, saying that
if the step is not taken, the continent will lose another chance
to develop.
</P>
<P>
Africa's debt has been growing at a rate of more than 23
percent annually, which is higher than the growth rate of gross
domestic product (GDP) and exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
"By 1999 the debt and debt servicing rose to 203.9 dollars per
person while the income is barely 221.4 dollars per capita," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister lauded the founding fathers of African countries
for their commitment and dedication to forming the Organization of
African Unity on May 25, 1963.
</P>
<P>
But he said it is imperative to restructure the organization
and amend its charter.
</P>
<P>
The objective, he said, is to "have a leaner and more efficient
 organization that will advance both political and economic
interests of Africa."
</P>
<P>
He said the amendment task should be completed before the
continent enters the next millenium.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A strong opening on Wall Street
halted the slide in Europe in late trade Tuesday, but it wasn't
enough to prevent all bourses finishing in the red.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 ended the day 72.8 points lower at 6249.3,
having touched a mid-afternoon session floor of 6184.8.
Provisional volume for the whole market was 1bn shares traded.

talks. Alliance stock, which surged Monday, fell 2 percent at the
close.
</P>
<P>
Others in the sector to suffer included mortgage lender
Halifax, down 2.8 percent, and investment bank Schroders, which

In Paris, the Cac 40 index of leading shares pared its losses
after Wall Street's opening, ending down 24.35 points at 4373.78,

France Telecom was the main loser, with its shares falling 1.40
euros, or 2 percent, to 72.50, and accounting for 10 percent of
the index's overall decline.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' EU Access Course Faces New Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government said Tuesday
that it will not to respond immediately to some obstacles that
have arisen in its European Union (EU) accession process.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that Britain, France and Germany have
attempted to raise obstacles to Cyprus' EU course because of the
pro-Yugoslav position the Cyprus' Parliament has adopted.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Estonia and the Czech
Republic started substantive accession negotiations with the EU in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the three countries will be willing to close
the chapter of EU accession negotiations, one of 31, for the other
five candidate countries but keep it open for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"At the stage, the government does not consider it appropriate
to comment in public on this issue," Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will respond if the matter, being
watched closely, moves on for discussion at the EU institutions.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also noted that there were difficulties on other
issues in the past, but they were coped with.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Spyros Kyprianou described the attempts of
Britain, France and Germany as a kind of pressure.
</P>
<P>
A parliament resolution, adopted in early April, unanimously
condemned North Atlantic Treaty Organization's bombing against
Yugoslavia and stressed that its territorial integrity and
sovereignty should be respected.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Parliament also called on the international
community to exert pressure to end the bombing and seek a
political settlement.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: COMESA on Fast Track of Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The heads of state and government
and representatives from the 21 member states of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) have voiced their
determination and commitment to the realization of the COMESA free
trade area by next year.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "Countdown to the COMESA free trade area,"
the fourth COMESA summit ended in Nairobi Tuesday, calling on all
member states to adhere to the provisions set in the COMESA Treaty
for zero tariff and to eliminate non-tariff barriers and other
obstacles to trade by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
As globalization is enhancing stiff competition toward the 21st
century, African countries are finding it increasingly difficult
to compete in the world market. The globalization has threatened
to marginalize Africa as the current trade volume of some 23
billion U.S. dollars in the COMESA only accounted for less than
0.42 percent of the world total of 5,583 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA leaders agreed that the only solution lies in the
formation of regional economic blocs and they attached great
importance to the integration into the global economic
architecture.
</P>
<P>
In a final communique issued by the summit, the leaders
recalled the decision of declaring the region as a common
investment area for balanced and sustainable development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
They also encouraged the member states, particularly those with
growing cross-border trade, investment and tourism, to introduce
limited currency convertibility between themselves in a bid to
reduce transaction costs, facilitate the flow of trade and
investment, and promote the exchange of local currencies among
member states.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the summit endorsed the
establishment of a special free trade area committee comprising
Kenya, Mauritius, Zambia, Uganda, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Malawi and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to assist in the preparatory
activities culminating in the launching of the free trade area
next October.
</P>
<P>
The leaders have also decided to form a co-ordinating body of
experts from central banks and ministries of finance to oversee
the implementation of policy measures on economic policy
harmonization toward the eventual goal of a monetary union by
2025.
</P>
<P>
For promoting cross-border trade within the region, the leaders
decided that all member states should adopt the harmonized
commodity description and coding system for customs and
statistics, and agreed to the need of setting up a guarantee
facility for covering political risks in intra- COMESA and
international trade.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that peace, unity and stability are the keys to
the economic growth in the region. "Peace is of paramount
importance," Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, the newly-elected
COMESA chairman, pointed out. " Without peace, there would be
nothing but poverty."
</P>
<P>
The leaders also appealed to those member states involved in
regional or civil conflicts to cease fire immediately for the sake
of trade growth and regional economic integration as well as the
improvement of the well-being of the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1994, the COMESA has made
commendable progress toward the attainment of the goals of a free
trade area by October next year and a common external tariffs by
2004, said Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, the outgoing
COMESA Chairman.
</P>
<P>
As of February 1, 1999, Chiluba said, 14 out of the 21 member
states had reduced their tariffs by between 60 percent and 90
percent. Non-tariff barriers like licenses, import quotas and
foreign exchange restrictions have been removed in most of COMESA
members.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the regional body has pursued the goal of creating a
common market where goods, services, labor and capital can move
freely across the borders of its member states, Chiluba told the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA covers an area of some 12.88 million square
kilometers with a population of 380 million. However its current
gross domestic product (GDP) is only 165 billion dollars, just as
much as that of Belgium or the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Endowed with rich natural resource and a big market, the COMESA
would be like a magnet for potential investors within and outside
the region.
</P>
<P>
As Kenyan President Moi said at the opening ceremony of the
summit that African countries must be united in pursuing issue of
common concern. " Together under the COMESA umbrella, we must
work for freedom in trade that will enable us to participate
effectively in and gain from the global economy."
</P>
<P>
Presidents from Zimbabwe, Uganda, Namibia, Tanzania, Sudan,
Malawi, Rwanda, the DRC, Burundi and Djibouti, and ministers from
other COMESA countries, also attended the two-day summit.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia plans to launch in
July this year a national livestock development capacity building
project at a cost of 39 million U.S. dollars, the country's
agriculture ministry announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Project coordinator Hassen Ali was quoted by the Ethiopian News
Agency as saying that 84 percent of the said sum is secured from
the African Development Bank while the federal and state
governments are to cover the balance.
</P>
<P>
Hassen said the five-year project is aimed at bolstering the
country's food security program by way of improved animal
productivity and helping farmers augment their income through the
optimum exploitation of livestock products.
</P>
<P>
He said activities to be carried out by the project include
building the national livestock breeding capacity, improving
veterinary services and distributing hybrid species to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to produce 288,000 tons of milk, 43,400
tons of beef and mutton as well as 511,000 tons of fodder products
annually, according to the coordinator.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-British Warplanes Bomb Iraqi Civilian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes on
Tuesday bombed some civilian facilities in northern Iraq and
inflicted damage on some civilian buildings, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said that at 11:34 local time (0734 GMT),
11 formations of enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enemy formations attacked civilian facilities including
some civilian buildings in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, said
the spokesman. He did not mention whether casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back
and forced the enemy planes to flee at 14:45 local time (1045 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Enemy warplanes also violated southern Iraqi airspace at 11:00
local time (0700 GMT) when 11 formations coming from Saudi and
Kuwaiti bases flew over Basra, Thi-Qar, Muthana and Qadisiya
provinces, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets, causing severe
civilian casualties and property damage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these restricted
zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied plane violating
its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Stepashin Tables Russian Cabinet's Objectives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said Tuesday that his cabinet would strive to solve
urgent social issues and increase industrial and agricultural
output as its priority objectives.
</P>
<P>
Delays in payment of pensions, wages and child benefits have to
be resolved, Stepashin said in an interview televised from his
Moscow-bound airplane from Sochi, where he met President Boris
Yeltsin on the formation of the government.
</P>
<P>
Increasing the output of manufacturing industries and
agriculture is another objective, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We should at last break the vicious circle of taxes strangling
the Russian producer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Long-term programs of economic development have to be drafted,
Stepashin said. These issues will be handled by his first deputy,
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, he said.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the presidential headquarters and the cabinet
are acting as one team, brushing away allegations that "somebody
is pressuring somebody else in making appointments."
</P>
<P>
"We found an optimal procedure in which we discussed for a week
several candidates for every cabinet position," Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
"I discussed them with Presidential Chief of Staff Alexander
Voloshin and First Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Aksyonenko, and
then we submitted the proposals to the president."
</P>
<P>
"We succeeded within a week to agree on the appointments to 80
percent of the posts. This is a good result," Stepashin said.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Launch Negotiations on Tobacco Control Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Assembly, the
governing body of the World Health Organization (WHO) has
unanimously decided to open the negotiation process on the
Framework Convention on tobacco Control (FCTC).
</P>
<P>
FCTC is a new legal instrument that will address issues as
diverse as tobacco advertizing and promoting, agricultural
diversification, smuggling, taxes and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in its 50-year history that WHO is
exercising its constitutional mandate to negotiate a convention,
said the United Nations agency in a press release here Tuesday.
When ready, the FCTC will be the world's first global tobacco
control treaty.
</P>
<P>
A FCTC working group will soon begin work on proposed draft
elements of the FCTC, thereby paving the road for formal
negotiations to commence in about one year's time. WHO and its
members plan to have the convention process completed by 2003,
after which it will be open for ratification.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on the tobacco control treaty is one of the
major resolutions adopted at the 52nd World Health Assembly, which
met from May 17 to 25 in Geneva.

PARIS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Director General of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), Federico Mayor, Tuesday made a strong appeal for a stop
of NATO bombing on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It is my duty, in accordance with the Constitutive Act of
UNESCO and the United Nations Charter, to make a new appeal for a
stop of the Kosovo conflict," said Mayor.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the use of force by NATO has increased the
sufferings of the people without remedying any problem in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We should stop the war and its procession of horror. The
dynamism of violence and the force of inertia of the machine of
war will only lead to new excesses," he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on NATO to immediately stop the bombing, because it
is never too late to stop the war.

<HEADLINE> Student Enrollment Increases in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of Education
Genet Zewdie said Tuesday that student enrollment at all levels of
education has grown steadily over the past few years throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the official Ethiopian News Agency, the
minister said the number of primary school students has increased
to nearly six million now from 1.8 million seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
She said the number of secondary school students has now
reached 467,669 from 363,686 six years back with annual average
growth rate of 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The annual capacity of higher educational institutions to admit
new students today stands at 12,000 as against only 6,000 a couple
of years ago, she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the rise in the number of student
population to the construction, expansion and up-grading of
schools in all regions side by side with the production and
training of new teachers.
</P>
<P>
She said 358 new primary schools have been built and a number
of others expanded while 3,449 fresh graduate teachers were
employed over the years.
</P>
<P>
Various colleges will be up-graded to the level of university
at a cost of 196.5 million birr (24.9 million U.S. dollars) soon,
she added.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Tobacco Is More Than Public Health Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday said that "Tobacco is more than a public health
issue; it is an issue that concerns the development of the whole
planet."
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion of the World N0 Tobacco Day,
which falls on May 31, Annan said, "In many developing countries,
where the ill-effects are not well-known, smoking puts an
intolerable strain on health care resources. Coupled with the
premature deaths of so many people, the impact is staggering."
</P>
<P>
"Today, one third of the world's adult population uses tobacco.
The harmful effects of tobacco use are well documented; yet many
people are still unaware of them, and many who are aware of them
are unwilling or unable to quit," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A shocking four million people die every year as a result of
the effects of tobacco products. This number is expected to
increase to 10 million per year in the first half of the next
century," he said. "If this trend continues, 250 million of the
children alive today will have their lives cut short by
tobacco-related illnesses."
</P>
<P>
"We can and must do more to reduce the use of tobacco -- both
through legislation to curtail access to tobacco products, and
through education to prevent young people from starting and to
help those addicted to quit," he said.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme for the World No Tobacco Day is Smoking
Cessation. The slogan is "Leave the pack behind."

The U.N. chief called on the parties to exercise restraint
and cease the fighting which had reportedly caused a number of

KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni returned
home Tuesday after attending the two-day fourth summit of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) in Nairobi,
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
At the summit which called for intensifying efforts to
eliminate non- tariff barriers and other obstacles to free trade
in the region, Museveni said that economic integration is
essential for the development of Africa and progress in the COMESA
region, a press release from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is need to ensure a common market in the
region because Africa as a continent is too fragmented to
guarantee sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old president stressed the importance of goods,
services, labor and capital in the region which are necessary for
a regional common market.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the region should be left mostly to the private
sector, he said, calling for national and regional support for the
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
He also addressed issues concerning regional security and
stability, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who left for the regional summit Sunday afternoon,
was met by Vice President Specioza Kazibwe and other senior
government officials at the Entebbe International Airport Tuesday
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Remains Strong In May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer confidence rose
in May for the seventh consecutive month, the Conference Board,
a prominent research group, reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence Index, a key indicator of future
economic activity, rose about one-half point to 135.8 in May
from a revised 135.5 in April, the Board said.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the crisis in Kosovo nor recent price surges at the
gas pump have cooled consumer optimism," said Lynn Franco,
Associate Director of the Board. "Low inflation and a strong job
market are providing a durable foundation for historically-high
levels of consumer confidence."
</P>
<P>
The strong consumer confidence came despite recent reports
that the April consumer price index rose 0.7 percent, the
biggest jump in nearly nine years that prompted the Federal
reserve to lean to monetary tightening.
</P>
<P>
Some 44 percent Americans said current business conditions
are "good", up from 43 percent last month, the Conference Board
said in the report. Only 8.4 percent called business activity
"bad," down from 9.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed a modest improvement in the outlook
for the next six months. Only 5.5 percent looked for business
conditions to worsen in the next six months, down from 6.2
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence is an important economic indicator in
the United States because consumer spending accounts for about
two-thirds of the nationa's overall economic activity. The
Consumer Confidence survey is based on representative sample of
5,000 U.S. households.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Team Meets Likud Officials Over Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to form a broad-based
coalition government, the negotiating team appointed by Israel's
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak Tuesday met with right-wing Likud
Party officials in the northern city of Herzliya.
</P>
<P>
The Likud representatives did not discuss with Barak's team
about the possibility of their joining the new government at the
meeting, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
But they only asked questions on Barak's guidelines concerning
political, security and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the Likud representatives will present
what they heard to the party's central committee. And senior Likud
officials are expected to meet on Thursday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Barak, leader of the left-wing One Israel coalition, won a
landslide victory over outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly wants to form a broad-based coalition government
with the support of more than 90 Knesset (parliament) members.
</P>
<P>
Likud, which won 19 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, is still
split over whether to join the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Some Likud officials said joining the coalition would give the
party a chance to have an impact in the final-status talks with
the Palestinians, while others insisted that the party could more
easily expedite a recovery program in the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Barak has 45 days to form a government and his team is
expected to meet with Likud representatives again next week.

HARARE, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans must desist from the
sins of tribalism, racialism and nepotism to bless the nation,
Lands and Agriculture Deputy minister Olivia Muchena said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the National Day of Prayer gathering held in Harare, capital
of the southern African country, Muchena urged Zimbabweans to
meditate on the sins of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"If we look at ourselves as tribes and different races, we see
that our sins are gigantic like mountains. We have sins of
nepotism, oppression and separatism," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chairperson of the event Dawson Masuku said there was need for
the government to put up measures that will bring the economy back
on track, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are today praying for the country which is economically,
politically and socially sick. This is a healing process for
Zimbabwe which, at the moment, is beset by many problems," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the escalation of prices of basic commodities was an
indication that the country was "sick".
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is no longer the same as its currency, which was
stable only a few years ago, has suddenly plunged to embarrassing
levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is failing to click because of massive corruption
within government circles," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also lamented the social behavior of today's youths which he
said was the cause for the spread of the deadly AIDS disease.
</P>
<P>
"The moral fibre of most of our youths today is in tatters and
this is largely because of the infiltration of foreign cultures,"
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS May 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said here
Tuesday that it has approved a merger between the British company
Vodafone Group plc and the Californian AirTouch Communications,
Inc.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) executive body said the companies' main
activity is the operation of mobile telecommunications networks.
The new company is active in most European countries either
through joint ventures or own networks and will have a combined
turnover of 10.3 billion euros (10.9 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Commission also said it has identified a competition
problem in the German market in relation to mobile
telecommunications. Both the companies are active in German market
through joint venture, E-Plus and D2 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Vodafone has agreed to sell its stake in E-Plus, which
eliminates any overlap between Vodafone and AirTouch in the German
market for mobile telecommunications, the commission added.
</P>
<P>
The commission in its investigation concluded that the relevant
geographic market for mobile telecommunication is national since
permanent roaming is currently not an economically sensible
alternative.
</P>
<P>
Based on national markets, the commission said, the merger is
largely complementary. There are only two EU member states where
the two companies are active, namely Germany and Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Die in Nigerian Ethnic Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of the ethnic clashes
in Nigeria's northern town of Kafanchan have surpassed 100.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out on Saturday between the Moslem
Hausa-Fulani aristocracy and the minority communities subject to
its rule. Nigerian government has sent armed police and soldiers
to the troubled region, a government official told Xinhua on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the secretary to the State Government, Charles
Bonat said the government had agreed in principle to create a new
chiefdom in the area, and communicated the decision to the
indigenes.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds were killed when fighting flared at Kafanchan in 1987
as Christians from minority ethnic groups clashed with the Moslem
Hausa-Fulani they accused of trying to dominate them.
</P>
<P>
The dominance of the emirates was established across most of
northern Nigeria two centuries ago during a jihad war waged by
cleric Uthman Dan Fodio on inhabitants who mostly practised
traditional African religions.
</P>
<P>
Nigerians from other parts of the West African country of at
least 108 million often accuse the Hausa-Fulani of manipulating
both military and civilian rulers -- mostly northerners -- since
independence from Britain in 1960.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Administration Will Continue Engagement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Tuesday that his administration will continue the policy of
engagement with China.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe that our continuing engagement with China
has produced benefits for our national security," Clinton said in
a speech in Edinburg Town, Texas State.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks after a U.S. congressional report
which asserted China obtained nuclear secrets through "espionage"
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure you and all the American people that I will
work very hard with the Congress to protect our national security,
to implement the recommendations, and to continue our policy of
engagement, because both of them are in the national interest,"
said Clinton, who was in south Texas State attending a White House
conference on developing rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The 872-page report by a House special committee headed by
Republican lawmaker Chris Cox claimed that China got secret
information on seven nuclear warheads and the neutron bomb in "two
decades of espionage" at U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
Cox's report was merely a fallacy dreamed up by a few people in
the United States with ulterior motives and in essence an attempt
to stir up anti-China feelings and divert people's attention.
</P>
<P>
Some Americans are sticking to the Cold War thinking and are
making a great effort to dream up stories about China's spying on
U.S. nuclear technology, Zhu said at a regular press conference.
"Their despicable attempt is doomed to fail," he added.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Credit Tranche Payment for Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Alassane Ouattara announced on
Tuesday that IMF's executive board has approved the release of the
next credit tranche of 51 million U.S. dollars for Pakistan to
support the government's economic program.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to announce, that in support of the Pakistan
government's economic program, the IMF's executive board approved
the completion of the third review under the Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) and the release of the next 51-million-dollar
credit tranche," said Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
Including this release, Pakistan to date has drawn 153 million
dollars under the EFF, with a further 459 million dollars
available in period to October 2000, the IMF official said.
</P>
<P>
Ouattara said the Pakistan government has achieved favorable
developments in strengthening investor confidence, easing
pressures in the foreign exchange market, and keeping inflation
under check.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "Pakistan's macroeconomic situation
remains difficult."
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to continue its efforts in fiscal
consolidation and the restructuring of the budget. "Resolution
action is needed to broaden the tax base and further strengthen
tax enforcement."
</P>
<P>
"The authorities also need to accelerate structural reforms to
build a solid foundation for high economic growth in the
medium-term," said Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the authorities to move expeditiously in
concluding bilateral arrangements with Paris Club creditors, and
seek comparable treatment from all other bilateral, commercial and
private creditors.
</P>
<P>
"All these measures will help in restoring investor confidence
in Pakistan," he said.

<HEADLINE> Home PC Penetration in U.S. Climbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A just-released study from a
market research firm found that more than half of U.S. households
now had at least one personal computer installed.
</P>
<P>
Home PC penetration in the United States has been climbing
sharply the last few years, reaching 50.3 percent earlier this
year, according to the study by La Jolla, California-based ZD
Market Intelligence. This is an increase of 6.4 million households
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on more than 10,000 interviews, also found
that households with higher income represent higher percentage in
PC homes. Nearly 40 percent of all U.S. households have annual
income under 30,000 U.S. dollars, but they represent only 23
percent households with a PC. In contrast, households with annual
income 75,000 dollars or more are the minority, accounting for
only 19 percent of al U.S. households, but this smaller group
makes up 27 percent of PC homes.
</P>
<P>
According to the research firm's study last year, of the 102
million U.S. households, 45.6 million, or 44.8 percent, had at
least one PC as of early 1998. The fat part of the PC homes is in
those with middle and upper-middle incomes.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates predicted last year that 65
percent of U.S. households will have at least one PC by the end of
2001.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Target Missile Problem Thwarts Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army scratched
Tuesday's test flight of an antimissile missile because of a
problem with the one that was to serve as its target.
</P>
<P>
The Hera target missile -- a modified Minuteman 2 -- was fired
from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico State of the
United States. The Army had planned to launch a Theater
High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile to knock the target
missile out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known what the problem was, said Jim
Eckles, a White Sands Missile Range spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The THAAD missile had failed in six previous flights to hit
flying targets. The system has cost at least 3.8 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department charged Lockheed Martin Corporation, the
maker of the antimissile system, a 15-million-U.S.-dollar penalty
for not achieving a hit during a March 29 test as required by its
15 billion U.S. dollars contract.
</P>
<P>
The THAAD is designed to strike enemy missiles fired from at
least 800 miles away _ the kinds of weapons nations such as Iran,
North Korea and Pakistan are developing, raising the threat to
U.S. troops and allies overseas.
</P>
<P>
The antimissile missile has technology that is the most
sophisticated military weaponry, and it would contribute to
development of a system that could protect the United States.

<HEADLINE> Britain Announces Tough Measures to Tackle Drugs Misuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government proposed a
217 million pounds (347 U.S. dollars), 10-year program for
reducing drug misuse on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Office minister Jack Cunningham told the Commons that
the strategy would concentrate on reducing misuse by young people,
reducing their access to drugs -- particularly heroin and cocaine
which cause the most harm, halving re-offending by drugs offenders
and doubling drug users participation in treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
The government's plans are based on the first annual report and
national plan on drug misuse in England and Wales by "drugs czar"
Keith Hellawell.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said drug misuse was a subject for everyone since
drug addicts were responsible for 30 percent of crime, mainly
burglary and theft.
</P>
<P>
Addicts may need up to 20,000 pounds (32,000 U.S. dollars) a
year to fund their habit, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we can make a positive impact on drug abuse we can say with
some confidence that we can make a positive impact on crime," said
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
he said the government would focus on reducing the number of
under 25 year olds who abused drugs and on lowering reoffending
rates.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that up to 90 percent of people convicted of
drugs crimes re-offend.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes Coca-Cola's Decision to Drop Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- European Commission expressed
satisfaction Tuesday with the Coca-Cola Company's recent decision
to drop its plans to acquire the soft drinks business of Cadbury
Schweppes plc in continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
Karel Van Miert, the European Commissioner responsible for
competition policy, said in a statement that he is pleased with
the cooperation between the European Union (EU) executive body and
EU member states' competition authorities throughout the
investigation of the Coca-Cola acquisition case. "The companies
decision to drop their initial plans is judicious," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Van Miert had earlier this month warned against the
possible anti-competitive effects of the purchase and had
requested the companies to notify the acquisition to the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola and Schweppes announced Monday a radical
restructuring of their purchase agreement. The original
agreement, signed last December, provided for Coca-Cola to acquire
all of Schweppes' soft drinks business worldwide, with the
exception of US, France and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Now, the two companies have excluded from their deal all EU
member states with the exception of Britain, Ireland and Greece.

<HEADLINE> Germany, U.S. Talk Stress NATO "Unity" on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and visiting German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer Tuesday stressed the "unity" of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization on Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference, Albright and Fischer said
they "see eye-to-eye" on a great deal of issues on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I think that we really have spent a lot of time talking about
the unity of the alliance, our determination to follow through on
the air campaign and working towards, as I said, preparing for
success," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Germany has voiced strong opposition to any consideration of
sending NATO combat troops into the Kosovo conflict, now in its
third month, threatening to veto such a move. But Britain strongly
support a ground invasion.
</P>
<P>
As the air campaign against Yugoslavia enters its third month,
sharp splits emerge among the alliance members.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said nothing at the news conference about Germany's
opposition to employing ground troops against the Serbs - an
option that Albright said was still on the table.
</P>
<P>
Both the foreign ministers agreed that there should be a role
for the United Nations and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"We also do agree that...that there should be a Security
Council resolution. The question is about the timing of it," she
added.
</P>
<P>
On the questions of an ground invasion, Albright reaffirmed
that the United States has not taken options off the table.
</P>
<P>
"But we are very focused now on the air campaign, on having
the expanded K-FOR (Kosovo Implementation Force) be able to
operate effectively and make sure that the planning and early
deployment of that is possible, and keep our eye on what we're
doing," Albright added.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said nothing at the news conference about Germany's
opposition to employing ground troops against the Serbs. "I can
tell you that just now, we are working very hard for a political
solution."
</P>
<P>
"On the other side, we have to prepare ourselves for the case
of the success fo the political solution," He added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Drop 2.3 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods declined by 4.5 billion dollars last month to a
seasonally adjusted 194.4 billion dollars, the Commerce Department
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop of 2.3 percent in April is the second decline in
the past three months. It followed a 2.7 percent increase in March
and was the biggest setback since a 3.9 percent fall in February.
</P>
<P>
Since the world financial crisis began in 1997, one of the U.S.
industries suffering the most has been steel, due to a flood of
cheap imports from countries like Japan. But today's report of the
government showed that the worst may be over.
</P>
<P>
Primary metals, the sector which includes steel, saw orders
increase by 1.3 percent last month following a 0.6 percent decline
in March.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the April's 2.3 percent drop in durable goods orders
was led by a sharp 12.4 percent fall in demand in the
transportation sector, which included decreases in all components
including autos and aircraft, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the big drop in the transportation, orders would have
risen by 0.9 percent. That compared to a 2 percent increase
excluding transportation in March.
</P>
<P>
In April, orders for industrial machinery also rose by 3.5
percent, the fourth increase in this sector in the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
But orders for electronic and other electrical equipment were
down 0.7 percent last month following a big 4.5 percent March
increase.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign of current
demand, were down 0.6 percent in April after having risen 1.9
percent the previous month.

<P>
More than 700 diplomats listened to speeches made by three
officials of the embassy in Belgrade and two colleagues of the
late journalists.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing Victims' Alma Mater Hears Deeds Of Former Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Lectures highlighting the heroic
deeds of the three Chinese journalists killed in the U.S.-led NATO
missile attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade early this month
were given today by a group of the embassy staff at the Beijing
Foreign Studies University (BFSU), the alma mater of two of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
The three victims, Shao Yunhuan of the Xinhua New Agency and Xu
Xinghu, Zhu Ying of the Beijing-based Guangming Daily, have been
honored with the title of "revolutionary martyrs" by the Chinese
government. Shao and Xu both graduated from the BFSU.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 teachers and students attended the lecture,
given by staff of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia returning home
after the NATO bombing. The lecture was punctuated by applause
almost every two minutes.
</P>
<P>
"The so-called theory of 'human rights being more important
than sovereignty' upheld by the United States is in fact a logic
of bandits," said Xue Yanan, a student from the Serbian language
department where Shao and Xu studied.
</P>
<P>
Cao Lei, Shao's son who was recruited by the BFSU shortly after
his mother's tragic death, also attended today's lecture.
</P>
<P>
"I hope some day I will, like my mother, become a competent
journalist," said the 19-year-old boy.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Africa Water Resources Policy Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from 22 sub-Sahara
African countries gathered here Wednesday for a three-day
conference on water management polices, which aims to chart the
direction in the field for the 21st century and alleviate the
looming water crisis in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Water security will soon rank with military security in the
war room of defense ministries", said Klaus Toepfer, executive
director of United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).
</P>
<P>
"The signs are clear that the world community must elevate the
issue of water to a position of highest priority," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti officially opened the
conference following the performance of traditional Kenyan dance
in the conference room.
</P>
<P>
The conference will provide a forum for senior policy and
decision makers to share and draw lessons from their experiences
in water management policy and institutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Participants are expected to develop a network of African water
 resources professionals and define a program of short-term
actions for management and exchange of water resources knowledge.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. research report, the scarcity of water will
be felt by most African countries soon unless effective measures
are taken. Meanwhile, about 80 percent of all diseases, and more
than a third of deaths in developing countries, are caused by
contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, the Kenyan government and the UNEP hosted the
conference from May 26 through 28. UNEP is the lead agency for
water resources management in the U.N. system.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges UN to Send Envoy to Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday urged the U.N.
secretary general to send an envoy to the disputed area of Kashmir
to inspect the deteriorating situation there.
</P>
<P>
Referring to India's airstrikes in the India-controlled part of
Kashmir against "infiltrators," a spokesman of the Pakistani
Foreign Office said, "The secretary general should send an envoy
to the region for the preservation of peace and security."
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here, the spokesman lashed at India's
airstrikes as "brutal repression of the innocent Kashmiris who are
engaged in an indigenous struggle for their right of
self-determination."
</P>
<P>
Conflicts erupts in the Line of Control (LoC) area from time to
time during the past 50 years. But this is the first time in
recent 20 years that a side resorted to air force in that region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said some bombs have fallen on the Pakistani
side, which is "clearly a violation of the LoC."
</P>
<P>
"We believe such an escalation (of conflicts) is unwarranted
and it should be avoided," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
For the last two weeks, Pakistani and Indian troops have been
exchanging fire across the LoC.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian military action with aircraft and helicopters
against the Kashmiri Mujahideen once again underscores the
urgency of finding a political solution to the Kashmir dispute,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have noted with satisfaction the statement of the U.N.
secretary general calling for such a solution," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also reiterated that Pakistan is committed to the
 Lahore Declaration signed by the prime ministers of the two
countries in February and to the dialogue process with India.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon India to join us in intensifying efforts to
resolve all disputes specially the core dispute of Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
"We also call upon the international community to recognize the
 serious implications in a continued impasse in the Kashmir
dispute on account of the Indian intransigence and to engage
meaningfully with the process of finding a just and final
settlement of the dispute," the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
signed 76 projects, valued at 1.85 billion yuan, with central
China's Henan Province during two days of talks on economic and
technology cooperation which ended today in Zhengzhou, the capital
of Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Henan Province introduced 16 name brands and 18 high
technologies from Guangdong, indicating that cooperation between
the two provinces has entered a substantial stage.
</P>
<P>
Years of effort have seen Henan set up a number of large-scale
wholesale markets, which make it possible and very convenient for
nearly 500 million people in neighboring provinces and cities to
do business locally.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province has shown great interest in the markets in
Henan, which, on the other hand, is badly in need of technology,
expertise, funds, and information for the further development of
its local economy.
</P>
<P>
The two provinces have proposed to transfer some of Guangdong's
favorable industries like household electric appliances,
foodstuffs, electronics and garment, to Henan Province, as a way
of making full use of their advantages and ultimately to promote
their economic growth.

<P>
KARACHI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Karachi Stock
Exchange (KSE) plummeted by 6.55 percent on Wednesday amid panic
selling in the wake of air strikes by India in the disputed area
of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The KSE 100-share price index fell 91.28 points to 1,300.7 from
Tuesday's 1,391.98 points with a total trading volume of 210.242
million shares.
</P>
<P>
The volume of Tuesday's trading of 290.059 million shares
created a new record. Earlier, the record was 279.04 million
shares registered on July 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The market opened with a weak note as the news of air strikes
by India at Kargil zone on the Indian side of Kashmir forced weak
holders to resort to selling as they fear that Indo-Pakistan war
would erupt," said Shahid Rawjani, a dealer with Prudential
Securities Pvt. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
He said the market was also heavily overbought and this news
activated the sellers who thought that the economy of the country
would again derail if a war broke out.
</P>
<P>
Of the 185 active issues, losers outnumbered gainers by 128 to
20 while 37 remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Safe Working Environment Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Public Service, Labor and
Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro Wednesday urged
organizations to invest in safe and healthy working environments
for their employees.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a National Social Security Authority (NSSA)
conference in Harare, Chitauro said adequate investment in safety
would make good business sense.
</P>
<P>
"Investment in the short term might look like a waste of
resources to many, but one has to appreciate that the net benefits
derived from accident- free business concerns are many," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, organizations with sound safety
management investment and resultant good safety records were
poised to enhance their corporate images in the business world.
</P>
<P>
"While the government is calling for enterprises to embark on
environmental audits, on its part it is in the process of
reviewing all pieces of legislation which have safety and health
components," she said.
</P>
<P>
"This is with a view to finding the best way to coordinate the
management of safety and health issues in the work environment,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
It was essential that workers be protected against hazards in
the workplace if safety provisions were to have meaning, she
added.

<HEADLINE> Thai FM Leaves for Visit to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan Wednesday left for Libya in a bid to boost bilateral ties
and enhancing economic and labor cooperation between the two
countries, the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to the Muslim country by a minister
from member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day visit, Surin is scheduled to meet senior
Libyan officials, but whether he would also meet Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi has yet to be confirmed, TNA said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Foreign Ministry reportedly may discuss the
possibility of establishing a Thai embassy in Tripoli, capital of
Libya, in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Libya's handover of two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1998, which led to the
U.N. removal of economic sanctions against the oil-rich North
African country early last month, has prompted Thailand and other
ASEAN countries to resume cooperation with Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
There are now 7,000 Thai workers in Libya.

China is willing to tap the potential of cooperation with
Kyrgyzstan.

</P>
<P>
Japan Urged to Maintain Only Defense Policy
</P>
<P>
A leading official of the Subcommittee of Foreign Affairs of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
said here today that Japan should adhere to its Peace Constitution
and maintain a defense-only policy.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks after the Japanese Senate passed
new Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines. Its House of
Representatives had already approved the documents despite of the
opposition of the Japanese people and the Asian people.
</P>
<P>
Senior CPC Official Meets Bolivian Delegation
</P>

<HEADLINE> India Denies Development of War-Like Situation With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- New Delhi Wednesday dismissed
apprehensions of the development of a war-like situation between
India and Pakistan following the air strikes in the Kargil sector
of the disputed Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry said in a press
briefing that India's military operations had been well inside the
line of actual control, not on the line or across it.
</P>
<P>
"The entire exercise has been to root out intruders" from the
Pakistan side, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Indian fighters and helicopters attacked the Kargil sector in
Kashmir to flush out alleged Pakistan-backed infiltrators who
India said had occupied ridges there.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused the Pakistan army of systematically
preparing these intrusions, saying they were in blatant violation
of the Simla Agreement between the two countries and the Lahore
Declaration signed by the prime ministers of the two neighbors
last February.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government was in touch with all foreign missions
here to explain to them the situation in Kargil and the reasons
for the air strikes by the Indian Air Force, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also charged that Pakistan had attempted to
change the status quo by force or otherwise, saying the Indian
armed forces would take all necessary actions to complete their
task of putting an end to this intrusion.
</P>
<P>
He said India had always desired to make every effort to build
a relationship of lasting peace, friendship and cooperation with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "there cannot be a resolution of complex
issues (between the two countries) as long as Pakistan continued
to engage in confrontational and hostile activities."
</P>
<P>
He told the press that directors general of military operations
of the two countries had established contact on the hotline.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Solve Water Shortage Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will slove the water
shortage problem before the end of the year 2000, a senior Cypriot
official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, National Resources and Environment Minister Costas
Themistocleous told reporters that in about 18 months, the Cypriot
government would have completed its desalination program and all
water restrictions imposed now would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage has been a problem for many years on the Cyprus
island. Now Cyprus has only one desalination plant, of which the
maximum daily output is 40 million litres of water.
</P>
<P>
Environmental studies are under way for a second unit to be
sited outside the southern coastal town of Larnaca, and efforts
have been making for the construction of two smaller desalination
plants.
</P>
<P>
Themistocleous said the desalination plants "will allow us to
lift the water restriction measures being enforced."
</P>
<P>
He said the government had abandoned its plans to operate
mobile desalination units from June this year, because needs
could be satisfied through the water collected in dams.

<HEADLINE> Beckham Likely to Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- David Beckham is now expected to be
fit for Manchester United's European Cup Final against Bayern
Munich in Barcelona Wednesday evening, according to local reports
today.
</P>
<P>
The England midfielder appeared to injure his right thigh
during a training session at the Nou Camp Stadium on Tuesday,
local.
</P>
<P>
Beckham walked carefully to the sideline holding his leg for
treatment before United physio, David Fevre, placed an ice pack on
his thigh.
</P>
<P>
Beckham is expected to be given the central midfield role left
vacant by the suspensions to Roy Keane and Paul Scholes.
</P>
<P>
Some observers have suggested that Beckham's ice pack could be
a ruse to fool Bayern into thinking he would be absent.
</P>
<P>
But that suggestion is rejected by United director Sir Bobby
Charlton.
</P>
<P>
"He's very important," the 1968 European Cup winner said of
Beckham.
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not a ploy. This is too important and we're
playing against one of the best teams in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a case of mind games or anything like that."
</P>
<P>
Phil Neville also needed treatment for a slight ankle injury
during the session.
</P>
<P>
He was able to return to action soon after, although he is not
likely to start the game anyway.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Trading System Passes Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) announced Wednesday that its computerized trading system has
passed a comprehensive test, which assesses its ability to
recognize the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The SET said in a statement that the test, conducted on May 22,
involved all connected systems and networks, including those of
member companies and subscribers to the SET's information service
systems.
</P>
<P>
While all systems tested on May 22 were 100 percent compliant,
the SET will test other related systems on June 5, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Programmed to use double digits to represent the year, many
computers would either fail to interpret the double zeros to
designate the year 2000, or would interpret them as 1900, causing
the computers to fail.
</P>
<P>
Businesses and governments worldwide have been rushing to
reprogram their computer systems before the new millennium comes.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
Riyadh -- The number of manufacturing industrial firms in the
member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) rose to 962,
involving investments of 30.5 billion U.S. dollars. The GCC is a
share-holder in these firms that employ some 125,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
About 57 percent of the joint ventures are located in the
United Arab Emirates while over 72 percent of the investments in
joint manufacturing industrial firms are in Saudi Arabia, the
Egyptian local daily Al-Alam Al-Youm reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The joint ventures contribute more than 50 percent to the
capital of the manufacturing industries while the foreign
contribution accounts for 36 percent, the daily quoted a report by
the Gulf Organization of Industrial Investments as saying.
</P>
<P>
Damascus -- The Syrian government is amending the Investment
Act No. 10 for 1991. It is also seeking to offer tax and non-tax
exemptions to the projects to be launched in rural areas with a
view to expanding the development scope countrywide, the Arab
daily Al-Hayat reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The value of the overseas investment in Syria did not exceed one
billion dollars in 1995, i.e. one percent of the investment
market in the country, a local economist said.
</P>
<P>
Beirut -- There is no indication of growing inflation in
Lebanon due to the fiscal stability policy, Governor of the
Central Bank of Lebanon (CBL) Riyadh Salamah was quoted by the
Arab daily Al-Hayat on Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Salamah pointed out that the inflation rate went down to less
than 5 percent last year, adding the fiscal policy of the CBL
"brought down the interest rates and controlled the monetary
inflows," he added.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has planned to spend a
total of 7.5 billion U.S. dollars on infrastructure projects
in the upcoming five years, the As Safir newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the five-year plan of the state-run Council
for Reconstruction and Development(CDR), some 4.1 billion dollars
will be used on projects currently underway and the rest on
projects to be carried out in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The CDR plan, which still needs the approval of the cabinet,
earmarks 1.26 billion dollars for infrastructure projects, 18.43
billion dollars for social projects, 88 million dollars for
productive sectors and 193 million dollars for administrative
development.

<HEADLINE> Aung San Suu Kyi Meets Elder Son in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Aung San Suu Kyi, general secretary
of Myanmar's opposition National League for Democracy, met her
elder son Alexander here Tuesday, according to a government
Information Sheet issued here Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Alexander, who arrived here Tuesday, is another son of Aung San
Suu Kyi coming over from Britain to meet his mother after their
father, Michael Aris, died of prostate cancer in Britain in March
this year.
</P>
<P>
The younger son, Kim, came on April 16 and was permitted to
stay for a fortnight with his mother.
</P>
<P>
When Aris was dying in Britain, Aung San Suu Kyi refused the
Myanmar government's offer to allow her to leave the country and
join her husband, fearing that once she left Myanmar, she would
not be able to come back.
</P>
<P>
Aris' visa application to join Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon
before his death was also reportedly denied then by the Myanmar
government.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi was married to Aris, a British citizen, in
January 1972 in England and they have two sons. She returned to
Myanmar to see her then dying mother Daw Khin Kyi in 1988 when the
country was in a political crisis and has since then resided in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges G8 to promote Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday called on the Group of 7 industrial nations and
Russia to adopt policies favoring economic growth and attach
importance to development needs of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, Annan urged
them to consider more steps to protect the international financial
system against instability, to take quick action to reduce the
debt of the poorest countries and to increase aid.
</P>
<P>
Germany chairs the annual summit of the Group of 8 scheduled
for June 18-20.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he advocated the measures as recent financial crises
have reversed the economic and social gains of decades, returning
large sectors of the world population to impoverishment and
threatening to leave billion in perpetual misery.
</P>
<P>
Proposals for strengthening the international financial system
put forward by the United Nations merit serious consideration,
said Annan. He urged additional measures to prevent the recurrence
of devastating crises like those of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, unveiled in January, call for greater liquidity
to fight off financial contagions, regional reserve funds, debt
standstill mechanisms and closer oversight of capital markets.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. position paper also called for letting developing
countries to determine their own capital control and exchange rate
policies.
</P>
<P>
Annan said further action is needed to relieve the debt burden
of the poorest countries, most of them are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The decline of official development assistance (ODA) should be
reversed and there is a need for innovative ways to mobilize
additional resources for development, he added.

<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Djibouti President Ismael
Omar Guelleh Wednesday called on France to increase investment in
his country and play a major role in the regional economy of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with French business leaders, Guelleh, who was
elected president in April, said that the common market of Eastern
and Southern Africa, which groups 21 African states engaged in
establishing a free trade zone in 2000, represents a population of
380 million.
</P>
<P>
One fourth of French investment in Djibouti has been withdrawn
recently because of poor economic resources of the Red Sea state,
but France remains the biggest aid provider of the country with a
240 million franc (40 million U.S. dollars) aid for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Because of its geographically strategic importance, Djibouti
also has France's largest overseas military base, with 3,000
French soldiers permanently stationed there.

<HEADLINE> UK: 12,000 Troops on Kosovo Stand-by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Wednesday that some
12,000 British troops were being put on stand-by to be ready to go
to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary George Robertson told parliament the exact
number Britain would deploy to Kosovo would depend on the
commitments made by other countries.
</P>
<P>
The move follows NATO's decision to double the number of its
ground troops in the Balkans to ensure that Kosovo's hundreds of
thousands of refugees can return home.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said the troops earmarked for Kosovo would be put on
shortened notice to move. They would include three infantry
battalions, three commando brigades, combat support groups and air
force support helicopters.
</P>
<P>
There are some 7,000 British troops in Balkans. NATO expects to
deploy up to 60,000 forces there.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the most hawkish within NATO, has led in the calls for
an early deployment of ground troops around Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) will extend a
helping hand to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) and
other local agencies to implement an initiative to improve air
quality in the capital city, a WB statement said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at helping reduce health impact in a
cost-effective and environment-friendly manner, increasing public
awareness on the issue and strengthening long-term transport
planning, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The project objective would be achieved through a blend of
pollution control reduction measures, primarily in the urban
sector, and the formulation of a long-term strategy for transport
and other priority sub-sectors.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day workshop, which ended Wednesday in Pattaya, a
famous beach resort some 200 kilometers southeast of here, Bangkok
Governor Bhichit Rattakul said there is now a clear willingness of
all agencies to join forces and work together to ensure that
Bangkok citizens could breathe clean air.
</P>
<P>
Elimination of lead from gasoline in Thailand has been regarded
as an example for other countries to emulate, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it claimed that these actions have been insufficient
to reverse the air pollution trend, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Argentina on Wednesday
began to hold talks over the disputed Falkand Islands. The talks
were set to focus on restoring air links between the islands and
South America.
</P>
<P>
The British delegation was headed by junior Foreign Office
minister Tony Lloyd and the Argentine side was led by Foreign
Minister Guido Di Tella, a British Foreign Office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said a statement would be issued at the end of the talks,
which began at 0900 GMT Wednesday and were expected to last about
two days.
</P>
<P>
Britain repeatedly said that there can be no discussion of the
sovereignty of the islands, which Argentina calls the Malvinas and
has claimed since 1833.
</P>
<P>
"Sovereignty is not on the agenda," the British spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Carlos Menem has repeatedly promised that
his country's flag will fly over the islands before his term
finishes at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, a war broke out between the two countries over the
sovereignty of the Falklands, which costed about 1,000 lives, most
of them Argentine servicemen.
</P>
<P>
The London talks, which are not expected to result in formal
decisions, were proposed by the British government at the request
of the Falklands Legislative Council.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Britain Favor Peace Efforts to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Britain on Wednesday
expressed their "full support" to a meeting in Moscow of Finnish,
Russian and U.S. officials on seeking a political solution to the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, after meeting with his
visiting British counterpart Robin Cook on Wednesday,said that
Italy and Britain fully supported the peace efforts of Russian
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is holding talks in Moscow
Wednesday with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and
European Union envoy and Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
Dini also explained that "the two countries fully support the
diplomatic efforts based on the Group of Eight (G8) proposals, but
we must be ready to enter Kosovo once an agreement is reached and
Belgrade withdraws its troops."
</P>
<P>
A peace plan, drawn up by Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States, calls for the return
of refugees to Kosovo, the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from the
Serbian province, the deployment of a peacekeeping force in Kosovo
and negotiations on a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that "when an accord is reached, no time must be
wasted, NATO's decision to expand its ground forces reflects the
latest developments."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, British Defense Secretary George Robertson declared
that NATO troops could, if necessary, enter Kosovo without
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's agreement.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that "such a decision would have to be taken by the
Alliance and not just Great Britain."
</P>
<P>
Cook, who arrived here Wednesday morning, is scheduled to fly
to France and Germany Wednesday afternoon for further talks on the
Balkans conflict.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM to Visit Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee will visit Bangladesh in the third week of June this
year, the BSS news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee "will arrive here on June 19," Acting Foreign
Secretary Mohiuddin Ahmed was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"His visit is linked to the inauguration of a regular bus
service between Dhaka and Calcutta," but details of the visit were
being worked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
This will be Vajpayee's first visit to Bangladesh as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The trial run of the Dhaka-Calcutta bus service, delayed
several times, took place early last month, after the two
countries signed a two-year agreement in India in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 Bangladeshi nationals visit India each year and
the direct bus service would greatly reduce the hassle of the
passengers who had to undergo in the past, according to Karar
Mahmudul Hasan, joint secretary of the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
The service would facilitate movement of people and provide an
opportunity for greater interaction between the two peoples, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Striving To Accomplish Export Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital plans to take
effective measures to fulfill its target of achieving 2.87 billion
US dollars worth of exports this year.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Yi Xiqun, director of the Beijing Foreign
Trade and Economic Commission, at a local export boosting
conference which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be focused on re-orientating export markets,
optimizing the export mix, granting more eligible enterprises with
the rights to handle exports, and encouraging investment  abroad
and processing with exported raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will increase efforts to develop export markets in
Africa, Latin America along with western and southern Asian
regions.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to the export of computer software,
which is estimated will hit 50 million US dollars this year and
exports of vegetables, fruits and flowers.
</P>
<P>
It will encourage more powerful local enterprises to do
countrywide and trans-national businesses in the wake of such
successful examples as the Capital Iron and Steel Company and the
well-known Legend Group computer company.
</P>
<P>
The measures are expected to effectively check the export
decline which began in the early part of the year and within the
next few months, Yi added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Fingers Crossed for Pak-India Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The latest escalation of military
confrontation between India and Pakistan along the
720-kilometer-long Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed Kashmir
has cast a shadow over the official talks between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have committed themselves to the continuation
of high-level official talks aimed at settling all outstanding
issues, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
However, tensions along the LoC "would bode ill for the efforts
to improve the atmosphere" between the two countries, Pakistan's
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said amidst reports that
India has sent in reinforcements after two weeks of heavy
artillery duel along the LoC.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Kashmir, the Indian Air
Force Wednesday launched a series of air strikes to "clear
Pakistan-backed infiltrators" in the Kargil sector of
India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Air Force is reported to have used various aircraft
including jet fighters and helicopters from various bases to
strike in Drass, Batalik and other regions in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the two estranged South Asian neighbors is
mounting these days because of the intense artillery dual that has
been going on uninterrupted for more than two weeks along the LoC
in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
At least 35 soldiers are reported to have been killed along
with scores of civilians on both sides in the renewed clashes in
Kargil and Drass sectors of the LoC which divides the Kashmir
region between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India have fought three wars, mainly over Kashmir,
since their simultaneous independence in 1947. Large-scale
military clashes erupted along the LoC between the two nations in
July last year after they respectively conducted nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The renewed cross-border shelling has ended a three-month
cease-fire that began before the Lahore Summit between the prime
ministers of the two countries in February.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here expressed doubt about the normalization process
to which both India and Pakistan are committed.
</P>
<P>
India's caretaker Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee paid a
historic visit to Pakistan in February this year and signed the
Lahore Declaration with his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Lahore Declaration commits both countries to intensifying
their efforts to resolve their outstanding issues including the
Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
India blamed Pakistan for the recent border flare-up by sending
a large number of heavily armed Muslim militants into its troubled
part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
But Islamabad shrugged off the charge as a pretext "to justify
their unwarranted military action" against the Muslim militants.
</P>
<P>
India-controlled Kashmir has been the scene of insurgency for
the past 10 years. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of fomenting the
trouble but Pakistan denies the charge and says it only lends
political, diplomatic and moral support to "Kashmir freedom
fighters."
</P>
<P>
"It should be made clear to them (Indians) that to lay blame on
Pakistan or any effort or a misguided plan will be taken very very
seriously and consequences will lie on India," a report by the
Associated Press of Pakistan quoted army chief General Pervez
Musharaf as saying earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
His warning came as reports said India has placed four brigades
and two fighter-squadrons of the Indian Air Force on high alert
for possible strike operation in Kashmir's Kargil sector.
</P>
<P>
Similar stern statements were also heard from the Indian side.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted Indian Ambassador to Pakistan G. Parthasarthy as
saying his country "will use weapons of its choice" to defend the
LoC.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic sources ruled out the possibility of a
full-fledged war between the two nations which last year stunned
the world with their tit-for-tat nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"It will remain localized and will be sorted out at the level
of military commanders (at the LoC)," an Islamabad-based diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the foreign ministers of the two
countries have proposed dates to each other for the expert-level
talks on nuclear-related issues.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign secretary-level talks are not expected to
take place until a new government takes power in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"While India is facing a period of political uncertainty, we,
on our part, remain committed to carry the process forward in the
spirit of the Lahore Declaration," Prime Minister Sharif said in
his address at the National Defense College recently.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said Wednesday that Pakistan has
agreed in principle that the two countries should hold
expert-level talks before India's general elections and the
foreign secretary-level talks should be held after the polls.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here believe that the normalization process
between Pakistan and India has suffered major setbacks due to the
recent military clashes along the LoC in the Kashmir region.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for Regional Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar commerce
official Wednesday called for stronger regional economic
integration to bring about stronger competition.
</P>
<P>
"In part, the motivation is also geopolitical," said Myanmar
Minister of Commerce Major-General Kyaw Than in his opening
address at a business forum of the Chambers of Commerce and
Industry of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Kyaw Than stated that through economic integration, regional
groupings will be better able to withstand the pressure of an
unpredictable world.
</P>
<P>
He added that such integration is in essence the hedge against
the uncertainties of the global economic environment.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is a close relationship between trade,
investment and development, with foreign direct investment (FDI)
becoming more closely interconnected with trade in the framework
of integrated international production strategies.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to pay equal attention to controlling
capital movements wherever possible while inviting FDI to improve
the investment climate in ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the Asian financial crisis has made
clear the necessary function of restrictions on capital movements
and on trade in times of balance of payment difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier On Agricultural Development Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China will no longer encourage its
farmers to open up wasteland for cultivation in order to protect
the ecological environment, Vice Premier Wen Jiabao said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"We must combine the improvement of our comprehensive
agricultural production ability with the protection of the
ecological environment, reclaiming as little wasteland as possible
and even completely stopping reclamation," the vice premier told a
national conference on comprehensive agricultural development held
in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
"The farmers should be advised to upgrade farmland which now
only generates medium or low production to seek higher
agricultural output which should be the country's main task in
terms of agricultural development," said Wen, also a member of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Those regions with poor ecological conditions must spare no
efforts to plant grass and trees to prevent soil erosion and land
desertification," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, it is necessary for China to develop a high-
efficiency agriculture with high yields and high-quality products
through the advancement of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
While giving a briefing on China's agricultural development
plan, the vice premier said that the country will step up its
efforts to develop the northern region into a high-quality wheat
production base and build an animal feed production base in the
northeastern region.
</P>
<P>
"We will also develop water-saving agriculture by adopting an
advanced irrigation system nationwide, and encourage all
mountainous and hilly regions to build terraced fields on the
mountain slopes," he added.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Almost All Greeks Oppose NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Almost all Greeks opposed the NATO
bombing of Yugoslavia and the alliance's possible ground campaign
in the country, according to the findings of a poll released here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which was conducted by the Panteios University on 1,
000 Greeks in the cities of Athens and Piraeus between April 29
and May 5, showed that at least 99.5 percent of those questioned
said they opposed NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia while 99.3
percent were against a possible ground campaign by NATO in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
85 percent said that the reasons for the air strikes were to
show off the power of the United States. 70 percent believed that
the main culprit was U.S. President Bill Clinton, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, NATO Commander Wesley Clark and NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, and 25 percent said that these
leaders should be charged as war criminals.
</P>
<P>
80 percent said that they found the Greek news media objective
in reporting NATO bombing, and 56 percent believed that the Greek
government should have vetoed the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that 52 percent of Greeks said that the "
closest" people to them were now the Serbs while the English,
Americans and French were considered further back.
</P>
<P>
A previous poll had shown that 95 percent of Greeks were
opposed to the NATO bombing, which started on March 24.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Campaign to Learn From Martyrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Publicity Department of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee today launched a
campaign for people to learn from the three Chinese journalists
killed in the NATO missile attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade early this month and those journalists still working
there.
</P>
<P>
The three victims, Shao Yunhuan of the Xinhua News Agency and
Xu Xinghu, Zhu Ying of the Beijing based Guangming Daily, have
already been honored with the title of "revolutionary martyrs" by
the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"This campaign will be of great significance to our efforts to
improve our contingent of publicity and ideological work and do a
good job in various works at present," according to a circular
issued today to all departments engaged in publicity and
ideological work across China.
</P>
<P>
The circular praised the three deceased journalists and their
colleagues remaining in the battlefield of Yugoslavia as "having
reflected the fine mental outlook of Chinese journalists in the
new period" and having set an excellent example for those staying
at home.
</P>
<P>
"We should learn from their loyalty to the Party, the
motherland and the people, from their selfless dedication to their
career and duty, as well as from their heroic spirit of daring to
fight against brutality and defying the threat of death," said the
circular.
</P>
<P>
It urged all news media and other publicity and ideological
organs to focus on spreading and encouraging patriotism among the
people, and also to try and "expose and criticize in a profound
manner the hypocritical and reactionary nature of the so-called
'democracy', 'human rights, 'humanity' and 'press freedom'
preached by the U.S.-led NATO".
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we must adhere to the principle of mainly doing
positive and inspiring publicity so as to promote unity and
stability, and try to make new contributions to promoting reform
and development, maintaining social stability and the advancement
of the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century," it concluded.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Minister on Asian Financial Crisis Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar government
official admitted Wednesday that Asia's currency and financial
crisis has had some effect on Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Although the country's undeveloped capital market, tight
foreign exchange control and the non-convertible and non-tradable
local currency spared the country from the initial financial
crisis shock,
Myanmar was impacted by the "contagion" effect as the crisis
deepened and turned into an economic turmoil, Brigadier-General
D.O. Abel, minister at the Office of the Chairman of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council said.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address at the opening session of a two-day
ASEAN business forum here, Abel recalled that Myanmar achieved a
steady economic growth rate prior to the on-set of the financial
crisis, saying Myanmar's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate
averaged 7.5 percent between fiscal 1992 and fiscal 1995.
</P>
<P>
The two-day business forum is held in conjunction with the 56th
Council Meeting of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (CCI) of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate fell from 6.4 to 5.7 and to 5.6 percent
in the fiscal years of 1996,1997 and 1998 respectively, he
complained, also attributing the decline to unfavorable weather
conditions arising from effect of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the most adversely affected is foreign
direct investment (FDI), with ASEAN investments falling by 70
percent in 1998. ASEAN investments accounted for almost 60 percent
of the total prior to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
As recovery measures, he stated, intensified efforts are made
in the agricultural sector with new arable land developed and the
private sector growing cash crops on a large scale to ensure food
security.
</P>
<P>
On the financial side of the recovery measures, he added,
Myanmar has tightened budgetary control, disallowing new large
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
On the impact on trade, he denied that the crisis had a
spill-over effect on Myanmar's trade as 45 percent of the
country's trade is with ASEAN nations and is complementary rather
than competitive. Trade with these countries has been increasing
over the past three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that the country's tourism industry has been
affected, saying tourist arrivals increased by 5 percent in 1998.

<P>
URUMQI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Urumqi Customs today set up a
special police bureau in a bid to crack down on the rampant
smuggling in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
It is the biggest customs unit in China in terms of the number
of posts within its supervision. Under its jurisdiction there are
now 16 state-level category-one posts and 11 category-two posts of
entry and exit.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, customs officials have solved
nearly 100 smuggling cases, involving 170 million yuan worth of
goods.
</P>
<P>
The new police bureau will focus on fighting the smuggling of
imported goods like ammunition, explosives, drugs, automobiles,
auto parts and cigarettes, as well as other criminal and law-
breaking activities.

CHANGSHA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's first high speed train,
which can reach speeds of 200 kilometers an hour, has come off the
production line today in Changsha, the capital city of central
China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Only a few countries in the world are now capable of
manufacturing locomotives which can hit such speeds.
</P>
<P>
Two years of research and design work on the locomotive, which
looks like the head of a bullet, was carried out by Zhuzhou
Electrical Locomotive Plant and a number of engine and railway
institutions and colleges.
</P>
<P>
The train will run on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen semi-express
railway route.
</P>
<P>
Now railway sources say China is planning to build locomotives
that can hit speeds of more than 250 km by early in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Railway transport in the country has long lagged behind the
pace of economic growth and in recent years, the Ministry of
Railways has been making efforts to increase the speed of trains.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Court Adjourns Case of Rwandan Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The extradition case
concerning Bernard Ntuyahaga, a former army officer wanted by both
Rwanda and Belgium for his role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide, has
been adjourned to next month because the counsel for him has not
got prepared.
</P>
<P>
Appearing at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in Dar es
Salaam, the lawyer, Jwain Mwaikusa, said he was assigned to defend
for Ntuyahaga only last week.
</P>
<P>
He further said he met his client just ten minutes before the
court heard the case in the morning and he has not got time to
read legal documents related to it.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as a teacher at the Law Department of the
University of Dar es Salaam, Mwaikusa said his students start
their final exams this week and he will have to mark the
examination papers later.
</P>
<P>
He said the matter at his school will be fixed in the week
beginning June 14. "It's my request we begin hearing on the
15th," he added.
</P>
<P>
Projestus Rugazia, the principal resident magistrate, agreed to
the request and announced to hear the case on that day. It has
been the fourth time for the court to adjourn the case.
</P>
<P>
Before that, Ntuyahaga is expected to appear in the court on
June 8. According to the Tanzanian legal proceedings, a case must
be mentioned within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Major Ntuyahaga, former head of logistics at Kigali military
camp in Rwanda, allegedly murdered former Rwandan Prime Minister
Agathe Uwiningiyimana and 10 Belgium U.N. peacekeepers escorting
her in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old man is wanted by both Rwanda and Belgium for
extradition and trial.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have requested the Tanzanian government to hand
over the accused to their countries for trial. The Tanzanian
government said it will abide by court ruling.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga was handed to Tanzania in March this year after the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), created by the
United Nations Security Council in the Arusha town in north
Tanzania, dropped charges of genocide and crimes against humanity
against him and set him free.
</P>
<P>
The accused, however, was re-arrested shortly after he was
released. The Tanzanian police caught him in the name of illegal
entry as he came into the country without going through normal
immigration procedures.
</P>
<P>
Mwaikusa told reporters after Wednesday's court session that
what he is trying to do is to keep Ntuyahaga in Tanzania as a
refugee and not to be extradited to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"You know, Tanzania has many refugees," he said.

aged over 60 have applied to the Dongcheng (eastern city) District
Government of Beijing to join the civilian parade on this year's
National Day, although the district's allocated quota is only 100.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China will celebrate its 50th founding
anniversary on October 1 this year and the Chinese capital is
stepping up the preparations for what is expected to be the most
splendid and magnificent national day celebrations in decades.
</P>
<P>
"On October 1, a mammoth civilian parade with some 140,000
participants and a grand military parade will be staged in
Tian'anmen Square. The square will also be the site of a 100,000
people get-together and a large fireworks display in the evening,"
said an official with the Beijing city government.
</P>
<P>
The selection and training of local residents who will
participate in the parade and the get-together have been going on

open bidding have started production, added the official.
</P>
<P>
Many local schools have introduced periods of physical exercise

According to another source with the city government, the
renovation project of Tian'anmen Square is also progressing

<HEADLINE> Iran Denounces U.S. Official for Anti-Iran Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi Wednesday denounced recent remarks made by
U.S. Commander in the Middle East Anthony Zinni against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that Zinni's "irresponsible" remarks were the
result of his full lack of knowledge of the situation in the
region and an attempt to create tensions and sow discord among
regional countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a lecture to Britain's Royal United Services Institute on
Monday, Zinni criticized the British government for improving
relations with Iran and termed the recent promotion of
Tehran-London ties as an "over-hasty engagement with Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iran and Britain announced on May 18 to promote their
relations to ambassadorial level from charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
However, Zinni said that Tehran has yet to show changes on the
issues which the United States are concerned.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Iran severed their relations in 1980 following the
take-over of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by Iranian university
students in 1979.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, Washington has been accusing
Tehran of seeking weapons of mass destruction, supporting
terrorism and undermining the Middle East peace process. But Iran
rejected all the accusations.

<HEADLINE> Stamp Market Booming in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- When the Tibet Stamp Collection
Company was first established in 1983 there were no more than one
hundred stamp collectors in this southwest China Tibet Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
However, ever since then the company has been trying to create
public awareness among people by sponsoring lectures, auctions and
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
Now there are some 20,000 local collectors including over 4,000
members of over 30 stamp collecting associations.
</P>
<P>
The company has also issued nearly 100 philately products
including commemorative envelopes, postcards, memorial stamps and
albums, all with typical Tibetan characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan-made postcards and memorial envelops featuring the
Tibetan landscape and temples have been bestsellers for years.
</P>
<P>
To date, Tibet has issued 15 sets of envelopes and postcards,
while the central postal authorities have published six sets of
Tibet dedicated postage stamps since 1952.
</P>
<P>
This year, a series of postal products have been and will be
issued to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the democratic
reform in Tibet, which was launched in 1959.

He called on all the ABC branches to take individual consumer
credit business as a strategic opportunity for business
development, and make effective efforts to expand the business.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Outgoing Head Pledges Readiness for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar declared Tuesday that he was ready for any
corruption investigations into his 10-month administration, the
Nigerian Tribune newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said this against the increasingly tense
criticism that high officials in his regime have been looting the
federal treasury.
</P>
<P>
He said he was satisfied with the performance of everybody that
served during his regime.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar was quoted as saying that he was ready to stand up for
the integrity of members of his cabinet and the Provisional Ruling
Council, which is to disband Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the outgoing Head of State told the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) on a interview Tuesday that "It is good to give
little gifts, but then gifts of high financial magnitude, we'll
begin to wonder where the resources come from, they must have come
from sources that somebody really needs to think about. Then this
needs to be looked into."
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also extended thanks to the provisional ruling council
members for their contribution to the stability in the most
populous African country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's foreign currency reserve has quickly collapsed to a
dangerous sum of three billion dollars from seven billion at the
end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some Nigerian people as well as many international
organizations have been constantly criticizing officials in
Abubakar-led government for corruption and looting the treasury.

<HEADLINE> Disease Wipes Out Young Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- As many as 60,000 young trees in
northeast China have died of a plant disease called "rotten willow
disease".
</P>
<P>
In Harbin alone, the provincial capital of Heilongjiang
Province, about 10,000 young trees, mostly willows and poplars,
have died or are dying of the disease, which has caused a direct
economic loss of 2.2 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A similar disaster has also been reported in Qiqihar,
Mudanjiang, Daqing, all in Heilongjiang Province, and in Changchun,
capital of Jilin Province, as well as in Shenyang, capital of
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the abnormal climate from late autumn of
last year through to spring this year weakened the growth of the
trees and led to the rampant reproduction of a parasitic bacteria
attacking the trees.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments of different localities have taken
measures including felling and destroying seriously sick trees,
spraying pesticides on healthy or slightly affected trees to
prevent further contagion of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The city government of Harbin, for instance, has allocated one
million yuan for curing the tree disease. While felling and
destroying 6,000 doomed trees, city government officials have also
whitewashed all the trees lining streets and courtyards.

<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Certain pollution control measures
on the Taihu Lake in east China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang province
are proving effective, according to the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
A survey, which was conducted by the SEPA and the Ministry of
Supervision on May 20 and 21, has found that relevant departments
in both provinces are doing a good job in controlling pollution in
the lake and along its banks.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the part of lake in Jiangsu Province
almost now has no floating pollutants and the banks are also clear.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey also found certain problems in the lake's
overall environmental protection with large amounts of garbage
from freighters and fishing boats not treated. In some areas,
where large numbers of tourists and food outlets are located,
there is not enough garbage disposal and treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
And it seem that the awareness of the need for environmental
protection is not widely spread amongst local people and tourists.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Launch Road Repair Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
embark on a 176-million-U.S. dollar drive to rehabilitate its
badly damaged road network, the Ministry of Transport and Energy
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project will start next year when the government finally
establishes the Road Fund, which is meant to oversee the
transformation of the country' s roads into a sound network, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report on the Road Sector Reform and
Development Program released by the ministry in Harare, more than
half of the country's roads are badly damaged, some of them due to
incessant rains which pounded the country during the last rainy
season.
</P>
<P>
The situation had been further worsened by the fact that
funding for the road rehabilitation and maintenance had dwindled
by more than 25 percent over the years.
</P>
<P>
The Road Fund will be expected to derive its revenue through
road user charges to cater for the full routine and periodic
maintenance of the entire road network.
</P>
<P>
The fund will require about 36.8 million dollars annually,
which is three times more than what is currently being spent.
</P>
<P>
The private sector will be expected to play a key role in the
implementation of the program, said the report, adding that the
road repair drive would create 30,000 new jobs.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militiaman Killed in south Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and another two wounded Wednesday
morning in attacks by Lebanese guerrillas in south Lebanon, the
Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The casualties occurred when a SLA military vehicle travelling
on a road in Biyeda in the western sector of the Israeli occupied
zone in south Lebanon was hit by rockets launched by Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Among the two injured is a militia woman who works in a SLA
checkpoint inside the border encalve, the radio quoted security
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
later claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The assault came apparently in retaliation for an earlier
deadly attack by Israeli troops and SLA on the group, during
which two Hezbollah fighters were killed on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The latest fatality raised to seven the number of Hezbollah
guerrillas killed in south Lebanon since the start of this
year. Nine Israeli soldiers and six SLA members were killed over
the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its ally
South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Agrees to Renew Oil-for-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi government has agreed to
renew the oil-for-food program for another six months, or the
sixth phase, well-informed sources told Xinhua on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said on conditions of anonymity that Iraq had
agreed officially to extend the oil-for-food program for another
six months, adding that Iraq informed the U.N. of its decision
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has not formally announced its acceptance
of the extension of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the U.N. Security Council agreed unanimously to
extend the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program for the sixth phase,
starting on May 26.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has voiced its worry several times that the U.S. and
Britain are trying to make the oil-for-food program an
alternative to the lifting of sanctions imposed on the country
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi newspapers have carried articles recently, declaring that
the oil-for-food program failed to alleviate the suffering of the
Iraqi people, and that the only solution to the Iraqi issue is to
lift the nine-year-old sanctions immediately and unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraq-U.N. memorandum of understanding, since
December 1996 the U.N. has allowed Iraq to export limited amount
of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the fourth phase of the oil-for-food program, the
U.N. raised the ceiling of the amount of oil Iraq is allowed to
export to 5.26 billion U.S. dollars from 2 billion dollars for the
first three phases.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was just able to export some 3 billion dollars worth of
oil in the fourth phase due to the sagging oil prices on the world
markets and the severe lack of oil spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi oil officials have said that if necessary oil spare parts
are available, Iraq can increase its oil production to the
pre-sanctions level of 3.25 million barrels per day (bpd) from the
current 2.65 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British representatives
in the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking its contracts
concluded with foreign companies, holding the two countries
responsible for the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in
Iraq.

<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Green education and environmental
protection should be a priority topic in Chinese universities
according to a number of academic experts who are in Beijing this
week attending an international symposium focusing on these
important issues.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental problems and the issue of sustained development
have become a focus of concern in the international community, and
universities in China should attach greater importance to
education in that regard," said Wang Dazhong, president of the
nation's prestigious Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
The symposium opened today and experts from more than 20
universities at home and abroad are attending along with officials
from the World Wildlife Fund, the Ministry of Education, and the
State Environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
"China's universities have been engaged in environmental
education for more than 20 years, and many of them have set up
special colleges, research institutions, departments or research
centers in that regard, and established an education system to
produce undergraduates, masters and doctors in environment-related
majors," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Qinghua was one of the leaders in green education introducing
the topic as early as 1977. Last year, it kicked off a project to
building Qinghua into a "green university".
</P>
<P>
The three day symposium is expected to hold discussions on
topics such as teaching methods in green education, the use of
multi-media and network technologies and evaluation systems for
green education.

The remark was made in response to the just published report by

"Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong is a separate customs territory
which has full autonomy in regulating the import and export of
goods, including strategic commodities. Our strategic trade
control system is backed up by transparent laws, comprehensive
licensing requirements and vigorous enforcement. All companies,
regardless of their background, are subject to the same set of
rules and regulations," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain close cooperation with our major trading partners
in combating the illegal diversion of strategic commodities. We
follow the highest standard of control practiced by international
non-proliferation regimes. We are determined to continue doing so
for our own economic interests," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Seminar On China's Entry Into WTO Issue Held In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Professionals from various
sectors attended a seminar here Wednesday afternoon, discussing
the impacts of the Chinese mainland's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Their major topics centered on how the Hong Kong industrialists
and businessmen get everything ready in face of new opportunities
and new challenges after the mainland's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a welcoming speech at the seminar, Herbert Liang,
president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong,
said China's accession to the WTO will benefit the expansion of
its imports.
</P>
<P>
At present, nearly half of the mainland's products are re-
exported via Hong Kong. Increasingly expanding the mainland's
foreign trade will bring benefits to Hong Kong's trade, shipping,
banking, insurance and other sectors of the services industry.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said the mainland will accelerate the
opening of its market in services industry, which will provide
Hong Kong enterprises with opportunities of investment in the
mainland's industries of finance, retail sales, foreign trade and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Liang said the mainland's accession to the WTO may probably
lead to a new upsurge in attracting more foreign investment. It is
expected that a mediate role that Hong Kong is playing for the
transnational corporations and Taiwan-funded enterprises to enter
the mainland market will be surely strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Good opportunities will bring about intense competitiveness.
Therefore, it is necessary for Hong Kong industrialists and
businessmen to get everything ready ahead of time and make full
use of its unique advantages both in geography and traditional
culture and of their rich experience for doing business, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shanzhai, deputy director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch, said that China takes a positive attitude toward its
entry into the WTO and its stand on this issue remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
However, he said China will never give up its principles or
sacrifice its state fundamental interests for the sake of joining
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
No country is allowed to demand an exorbitant price in this
issue. Otherwise, it will not benefit the stable growth of China's
economy, nor the process of global economy, he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Gears Up Government Procurement Drive (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China moved one step closer to
opening its government procurement market to the outside world by
adopting the first national guideline in this respect recently.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Regulations on Administration of Government
Procurement issued by the Ministry of Finance incorporates
international norms in a framework of policy and principles of
establishing an open, just and fair government procurement system
in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The provisional regulations pave the way for China to open its
government procurement market and access the international market
in the future," said Zhang Tong, deputy director general of the
Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The provisional regulations establish rules for government
procurement in terms of the entities, methods, public tendering
procedures and legal liabilities.
</P>
<P>
China will open its government procurement market to members of
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization by 2020.
If it joins the World Trade Organization (WTO), it will also open
the market to other countries and regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China is striving to grasp the last chance to
set up and rein-in its government procurement mechanism so as to
prepare local enterprises for foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
The provisional regulations stipulate that governments at all
levels are not allowed to procure foreign goods and services
without approval by relevant authorities. The regulations also
exclude state-owned enterprises from the entities to be put under
the government procurement system.

<HEADLINE> China Gears Up Government Procurement Drive (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So far, all but three autonomous regions have started
government procurement on a trial basis. In 1998, more than 2,000
procurement orders were placed by the provincial governments,
worth 3.1 billion yuan. Over a dozen local governments have also
promulgated their own regulations in this respect.
</P>
<P>
However, China is yet to promulgate national laws on government
procurement. The provisional regulations released by the Ministry
of Finance recently serve as standard guidelines for the local
rules, which sometimes are not in conformity with international
norms. On the other hand, it leaves room for local governments to
promulgate more detailed regulations according to local conditions.
</P>
<P>
Now Chinese authorities are in the process of drafting formal
regulations on government procurement and the Government
Procurement Law.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the establishment of a government procurement
system will greatly increase the central government's leverage of
the economy. It will shift the control of procurement money from
various government institutions to a centralized system. This will
actually then have an effect on economic growth and industrial
development through adjusting the total volume and scope of
procurement.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance estimates that through public tendering
of supply of goods and services, the government will save at least
30 billion yuan of tax payers' money every year and minimize
misuse of public funds. It is reported that 80 percent of the
biggest embezzlement cases in the country involve an inadequate
transparency of government expenditures.

<HEADLINE> NRP Wants to Join Barak's Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's National Religious Party
(NRP) will join the coalition government led by Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak if it is asked for, said NRP leader
Yitzhak Levy Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the coalition talks with the One
Israel's negotiating team in Herzliya near Tel Aviv, Levy said
that Barak, leader of One Israel, has expressed his desire to ask
NRP to join the coalition and NRP is ready to enter into further
negotiations with One Israel to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
NRP's future negotiations with One Israel, which won 26 seats
in the 120-member Knesset (parliament) in the May 17 election,
will be conducted on one condition that NRP takes the education
portfolio of the next government, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
NRP won only five seats of the 15th Knesset in the election as
compared to nine it held in the former parliament.
</P>
<P>
Local media attributed this to NRP's hardline policy towards
the peace process which caused the Likud-led government to fall
early this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, One Israel's negotiating team concluded its talks
Wednesday with the Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home) headed by
Avigdor Leiberman, which also expressed its interests of joining
Barak's coalition.
</P>
<P>
Leiberman, former Director-General of the incumbent Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, formed this new party before
the elections during which it won four Knesset seats. The party's
supporters were mainly Russian-speaking immigrants from the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"The Yisrael Beiteinu has a common ground with One Israel
and there will be no problem for it to join the coalition
headed by Barak," Yuri Stern, head of the party's negotiation
team said after the talks.
</P>
<P>
So far, One Israel's negotiating team has concluded its first
round of coalition talks with all 15 political parties which have
won Knesset seats and will submit its report to Barak for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
The second round of talks are expected to be conducted soon.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Committee officially announced the
election results Tuesday evening. Barak has 45 days to form his
government and submit the cabinet lists to the Knesset for
approval under the election law.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Implement Government Procurement Regulations Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital Beijing has
issued a set of regulations on government procurement aimed at
efficient management of fiscal funds.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, which will take effect as of June 1, contain
stipulations on the means of government procurement, procurement
through public biding, application for procurement, budget
management, fund settlement, supervision on procurement, and legal
responsibilities of the bidders and sellers.
</P>
<P>
Ten kinds of commodities are listed for government procurement,
including cars, limousines, motorcycles, and personal computers.
</P>
<P>
Also included in the list are equipment with per unit price of
over 100,000 yuan, labor and services, public utilities, auto
insurance, auto maintenance and any purchase worth more than 300,
000 yuan at a time.
</P>
<P>
The practice, which is based on public bidding, is designed to
provide an important safeguard to protect the interests of the
state, combat corruption and ensure economic order.
</P>
<P>
Beijing began the practice in 1997, and introduced a trial
government procurement system in 1998. By last March, the
municipal government has made purchases of over 180 million yuan
through public bidding, saving more than 20 million yuan in fiscal
fund.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia to Withdraw From S.Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's proxy militia South Lebanon
Army(SLA) is planning to evacuate south Lebanon's Christian town
of Jezzine within the next few days, the Voice of the People radio
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources as saying that
Maj. Gen. Antoine Lahd, the militia's commander, had formally
notified Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens of his decision to
pull out the SLA garrison from Jezzine within days.
</P>
<P>
The sources said senior officials of the SLA's regiment in
Jezzine have already evacuated their families into the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon, which Israel declared as a
"security zone" in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, Lebanon's largest Christian town in the south, has
never been incorporated into the border enclave although it has
long been policed by the SLA.
</P>
<P>
The town sits on the northern rim of a salient jutting some 10
kilometers northward from the border zone.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Lahd's reported decision to pullback was largely
the result of escalated guerrilla's bombing attacks around the
town, whose population has dwindled from 35,000 before the 1975
outbreak of Lebanon's 15-year civil war to 5,000 at present.
</P>
<P>
Some 15 SLA officers and militiamen and 20 civilians have been
killed in bombing ambushes around the town in the past nine months
by Lebanese guerrillas, notably the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, which is leading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli
troops and SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Media reports speculated the militia commander would personally
visit Jezzine in the next 48 hours to discuss his decision with
the town's notables.
</P>
<P>
Lahd, along with his 2,500 followers, is termed in Lebanon as
traitors and has been sentenced to death in absentia by a Lebanese
military court.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING,May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese mainland will support a
long-term stable growth in Macao, and wishes to further economic
and trade cooperation with Macao, according to Chen Bangzhu, vice-
minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with a Macao delegation of
senior civil servants today.
</P>
<P>
"The future practice of "Macao people governing Macao" and high-
degree of autonomy are both an opportunity and challenge for the
development of Macao's economy," Chen said. The SETC will deal
with the economic and trade ties between the mainland and Macao by
strictly abiding by the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"We support the long-term stable development of Macao," Chen
said, "And we are willing to strengthen exchanges with the
economic and trade circles of Macao and to promote bilateral
understanding."

</P>
<P>
Ho attributed the new changes he had observed on the mainland
to the powerful leadership of the Central Government and the
economic policies that meet and suit China's needs.
</P>
<P>
China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20, ending over 400 years of Portuguese rule.

<HEADLINE> 2,000 Black Australians Mark National Sorry Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 indigenous Australians
in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra marked the first anniversary of
National Sorry Day Wednesday to commemorate victims of the
country's white assimilation policy earlier this century.
</P>
<P>
In Canberra, the country's capital, around 1,000 people
gathered at Australian Parliament House to launch The Journey of
Healing between 300,000 black Australians and 18 million white
Australians.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by government, opposition and minor
party figures.
</P>
<P>
National Sorry Day began last year when thousands of
Australians acknowledged the consequences of the government's
policies forcibly removing aboriginal children, better known as
the stolen generations, from their families during 1910-1970.
</P>
<P>
The children, totaling approximately 100,000, had been raised
at government-funded welfare centers or churches, with many of
them losing contact with their families for good.
</P>
<P>
But the Australian federal government, including Prime Minister
John Howard, has repeatedly refused to apologize for the stolen
generations, saying his government cannot be held responsible for
the actions of past governments.
</P>
<P>
In Australia's biggest city of Sydney, about 800 people have
taken part in a march to mark National Sorry Day.
</P>
<P>
The parade featured colorful cardboard cutouts of hands
representing reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous
people and a giant rainbow serpent led the march.
</P>
<P>
In Melbourne, more than 300 people marched through central
Melbourne Wednesday to commemorate the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Members of the stolen generations and other indigenous as well
as non-indigenous Australians reflected on their history at the
end of the march.
</P>
<P>
Larry Walsh, who was part of the stolen generations, said it
had taken him nearly 46 years to recover, and he still felt he had
not quite recovered.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony ended with traditional music and dancing.
</P>
<P>
Some political figures in Australia, including Australian
Governor-General William Deane, have been calling for more efforts
for the country to achieve reconciliation between the indigenous
and non-indigenous Australians.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the governor-general again highlighted the plight of
indigenous Australians and his concerns about the reconciliation
process.
</P>
<P>
"These days, it is sometimes difficult not to feel discouraged
- even depressed - about the slow course of the reconciliation
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
At a national reconciliation conference in 1997, he apologized
over the stolen Aboriginal children when Prime Minister John
Howard had refused.

<HEADLINE> West African Community Recognizes New Nigerien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has recognized Niger's new military
leader, Major Daouda Wanke, after a heated debate at the emergency
session of foreign ministers in Togolese capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
A final communique issued by the meeting started Monday said
that the ECOWAS "stressed the need for an independent committee of
enquiry that would look into the death of President Ibrahim
Mainassara Bare."
</P>
<P>
Mainassara was killed on April 9 this year by members of his
guards at the start of a military coup in Niger, The Guardian
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, a row broke out among the foreign ministers
of the 16-member ECOWAS over whether to recognize or isolate the
new military leadership in Niger which came to power after the
killing of President Mainassara.
</P>
<P>
After a marathon debate lasting until 3:00 a.m. Tuesday, the
ECOWAS ministers moved not to adopt the draft resolution which
called for Niger's isolation until "democratic elections" were
held there.
</P>
<P>
However, the final communique of the meeting, which was
designed to discuss regional insecurity in Niger, Guinea Bissau
and Sierra Leone, has warned that it would deny recognition to
future coup makers in the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Guinea Bissau where President Joao Bernardo Vieira
was ousted by a junta earlier this month, the ECOWAS agreed that
some 600 soldiers from west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG
would be pulled out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS also called on the junta to allow safe passage of
President Vieira and his family who are holed up in the Portuguese
embassy in capital Bissau "to any country of their choice."
</P>
<P>
On the conflict in Sierra Leone, the ECOWAS appealed to the
government and rebels delegations to sit down at the negotiating
table to "demonstrate flexibility and spirit of compromise and
conciliation".

<HEADLINE> Scientists Explain Ozone Losses over Qinghai-Tibet Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- New studies by Chinese scientists
indicate that particular thermodynamic effects have caused ozone
depletion over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Zou Han, a researcher from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that a recent study shows
that the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a major geothermal source for
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
"And as a result, air with a low content of ozone is heated and
rises to the ozone layer and dilutes its density," said the
scientist.
</P>
<P>
Gao Dengyi, former vice-director of the institute and an expert
in this field, said that vegetation on the plateau has decreased
rapidly in recent years, and large areas of rock are exposed. As a
result, a great amount of heat is reflected into the atmosphere in
spring, summer and autumn.
</P>
<P>
Zou Han said that similar phenomenon can also be found in other
large mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountain in the United
States and the Andes Mountains in South America.
</P>
<P>
Spectral analysis of the data sent back from satellite surveys
shows that the ozone content over the plateau is lower than other
regions at the same latitude.
</P>
<P>
Observations have shown that the depletion is more rapid in
spring, approaching ten percent of the total volume, and most
serious at 18 kilometers above sea level.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have also found that the formation of the monsoons
in South Asia has close connections with the ozone loss over the
plateau.
</P>
<P>
Ozone is regarded as one of the protective green houses that
scientists believe modifies the strength of ultraviolet radiation
reaching the earth.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the natural landform, the disappearance of
forests and large scale urbanization are other major causes of
ozone loss, according to the scientists.

<P>
KATHMANDU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Swedish climber Thomas Sjogren
and his wife Dina Sjogren on Wednesday became the first couple to
scale the 8,848-meter Mount Qomolangma from the Nepali side, the
Nepali Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation announced.
</P>
<P>
Hugo R. Barroso and Corlos G. Pereda from Mexico also climbed
the world's tallest mountain with seven Nepalese Sherpas including
Babu Chhiri Sherpa, who set another record of climbing the summit
two times in the same season after establishing earlier this
season a record of staying at the summit for 21 hours, the
ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
All the summiters left the South Col (8,000m) at 9 o'clock
Tuesday evening and reached the top at 9:15 Wednesday morning.
They all stayed on the top for 30 minutes before retreating to the
South Col, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said they are from the Swedish '99 International Qomolangma
Expedition led by Tina Sjogren, a 40-year-old businesswoman from
Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The spring season for mountaineering in Nepal began on March 1
and will end on May 31.

<HEADLINE> Pak FM Calls for Restraint on LoC Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz said Wednesday that the escalation of firing by the Indian
side along the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed Kashmir
region is against the spirit of the Lahore Declaration.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides should exercise restraint," Aziz said here during
his talks with reporters, adding that "we don't know why India has
escalated its firing on LoC."
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Wednesday from Kashmir, the
Indian side launched air strikes with jet fighters and helicopter
gunships on three positions against the "Muslim militants" on the
Indian side along the LoC.
</P>
<P>
Tension between India and Pakistan is soaring these days
because of the intense artillery dual that is now going on
uninterrupted for more than two weeks along the LoC in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that "Pakistan is showing restraint to avoid further
escalation of the situation."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is retaliating and will retaliate if our positions
are targeted," Aziz said. "We will take every necessary action to
defend our positions."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the telephone call to Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif by Indian caretaker Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Monday, Aziz said, "We are assessing the situation and will
respond to this telephone call likely today (Wednesday)."
</P>
<P>
Media reports quoted Vajpayee as saying that India will not
allow any more cross-border attacks in Kashmir. He claimed that
about 400 Muslim fighters intruded into the India-held part of
Kashmir this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has called for a
halt to clashes between Indian and Pakistani troops in the
disputed Kashmir region.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is currently visiting Sweden, Tuesday called on
India and Pakistan to "exercise restraint and cease the fighting
which has reportedly caused a number of casualties to the civilian
population and displaced others from their villages in the area,"
a U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Pakistan has agreed in principle that the two
countries should hold expert-level talks on peace and security
issues before the Indian general elections and the foreign
secretary-level talks should be held after the polls.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said that the Indian deputy high
commissioner was summoned to the Foreign Office Monday and was
told that firing on the LoC is against the spirit of the Lahore
Declaration signed by the prime ministers of India and Pakistan in
February this year.

<HEADLINE> Fluoro Test in Australia Lights Up Early Signs of Lung Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A new test in which the bronchial
tubes are probed with fluorescent light may lead to detection of
lung cancer before it becomes invasive, the Australian Associated
Press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fluorescence bronchoscopy, used at only 30 medical centers
worldwide, is being tried at Princess Alexandra (PA) Hospital in
Brisbane, the third biggest city in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Respiratory physician Dr. David Fielding said the test could
pick up very early and small cancers which glowed red, compared
with healthy tissue which shone green, when viewed through a fiber
optic tube passed through the airways.
</P>
<P>
"Virtually all cancers present late. Only 13 percent of
patients with lung cancer survive five years, including those who
we get early enough to operate on," he said.
</P>
<P>
"By detecting cancers early we will be able to ablate them
completely, raising the five-year survival to around 95 percent,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
A study published in the journal, Chest, showed fluorescence
bronchoscopy had a six-fold increase in sensitivity over
conventional bronchoscopy for detecting superficial lung cancers.
</P>
<P>
The challenge was now to find a good method of sorting out high
risk patients from the general community, so they could be
screened with the new type of bronchoscope, Fielding said.
</P>
<P>
Diagnosis still requires a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
"Lung cancer is the commonest cause of cancer deaths among all
ages over 40," he said.

<HEADLINE> Second Runway of HK Int'l Airport in Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The second runway of the Hong
Kong International Airport was officially put into use here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region said at the opening ceremony that the day "
marks an important milestone of the Hong Kong International
Airport" since it is the first time in the history of Hong Kong
that two runways operate simultaneously at its airport.
</P>
<P>
The second runway will immediately relieve peak hour congestion
and will greatly reduce the waiting time of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
With the second runway becoming fully operational in August,
this will offer additional landing and take-off slots which will
enable airlines to achieve maximum operational efficiency and will
enhance passenger convenience.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that the additional capacity of the second runway
will facilitate the further development of the extensive air
services network serving Hong Kong and will strengthen Hong Kong's
position as an international and regional aviation hub.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong International Airport, located at Chek Lap Kok on
Lantau Island 25 kilometers west of Hong Kong island, was opened
on July 6, 1998. The airport has won acclaim for its quality
services despite some chaos during its initial period.

<HEADLINE> Better Sunshine Blocking Cream Developed in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists have
discovered a way to make zinc cream transparent and twice as
protective against harmful rays from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Terry Turney from the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization's (CSIRO) manufacturing science
and technology division, said that by reducing the size of
particles of the active ingredient, zinc oxide, the cream-like
sunscreen gave better coverage.
</P>
<P>
Australia ranks first in the world in terms of the incidence of
skin cancer due to depletion of ozone layer over Australia and
cream-like products to block harmful rays from the Sun are widely
used in summer time in this sunshine country.
</P>
<P>
Zinc oxide particles are normally about 250 nanometers but the
CSIRO treatment reduces them to as small as 10 nanometers and
gives more control over their surface chemistry.
</P>
<P>
"We can get them down to 1,000 times smaller than the diameter
of a human hair," Turney said at a forum at University of
Technology in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Zinc creams work by physically blocking UVB rays which cause
redness and burning, as well as UVA rays which lead to
photoageing.
</P>
<P>
The use of ultrafine particles means fewer rays can get through
to the skin, he said.
</P>
<P>
Normal particles both absorb and scatter light, which is why
zinc cream looks white.
</P>
<P>
"We're already running tests with several of the world's
leading cosmetics companies overseas and we expect there to be a
good export market there," Turney said.
</P>
<P>
Early versions of such sunscreens are already on the market,
but there will be a major push next summer after the production of
45 tons of the product, called Sunsorb.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Army Leader Rebukes Abacha Wife's Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Chief of General Staff Vice
Admiral Mike Akhigbe has rebuked a statement of the wife of former
military ruler Sani Abacha that the deceased head of state made
decisions on a collective basis.
</P>
<P>
The vice admiral, who had served as Chief of Naval Staff under
Abacha's regime, told a valedictory press conference in Abuja
Tuesday that the claim by Abacha's wife is groundless.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on what aspect. We collectively agreed to return
to civil rule," the Daily Times newspaper quoted the senior
officer as saying. "But some decrees were later churned out."
</P>
<P>
"You are also living witnesses when all the five political
parties returned one single presidential candidate for election",
he said.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe said he had spoken at every turn in the affairs of
state and vowed not to associate himself with policies and
decisions which he did not take part in making.
</P>
<P>
On the outgoing government's stacked deficits, the vice admiral
said that the reserves were depleted by inadequate resources
inflow from the sale of oil, the need to keep international
obligations, payment of contractors and suppliers, as well as the
instability in the Niger Delta among others.

<HEADLINE> 2 Hezbollah Guerrillas Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Two guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, were killed overnight
in conflicts with Israeli forces in south Lebanon, the Voice of
the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two dead fighters, Hasan Haik and Ahmad Ali Rida, both
unmarried and aged at 73, will be buried in a funeral held by
Hezbollah officials and it supporters in the country's southern
coast city of Sidon Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The fatality raised to seven the number of Hezbollah
guerrillas killed in south Lebanon since the start of this
year. Nine Israeli soldiers were killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its ally
South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<P>
The move is a violation of the desires of the people of the
Asia-Pacific region for peace and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed firm opposition against including Taiwan in the
scope of the Japan-U.S. security cooperation and strongly demanded
Japan give explicit explanation on the indication of the "
surrounding situation".
</P>
<P>
Japan's explanation of the "surrounding situation", however,
has been ambiguous and vague, which will have a negative impact on
the steady development of Sino-Japanese relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that any attempt to, directly or indirectly, include
Taiwan in the scope of Japan-U.S. security cooperation constitutes
an infringement on the Chinese sovereignty and territorial
integrity and an interference in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
All parties, all ethnic groups and all circles in the CPPCC and
all the Chinese people are firmly opposed to the attempt, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Japan should abide by the principles of the Japan-China Joint
Statement and Japan-China Friendship Treaty and refrain from doing
anything that interferes in China's internal affairs, obstructs
China's reunification cause, and jeopardizes Sino-Japanese
friendly ties, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Arab Parties to Enter Coalition? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Arab parties concluded
their first round of coalition talks with the negotiating team of
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak Tuesday, but no decision was made
on joining the new government.
</P>
<P>
All the three Arab parties, namely the United Arab List (UAL),
Hadash and Balad, had mobilized their supporters to vote for One
Israel leader Barak in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
The Arab votes, which numbered nearly 1 million out of the 4.3
million eligible ballots, constituted a decisive factor for
Barak's victory and even One Israel has admitted the fact.
</P>
<P>
The three Arab parties reiterated their positions for joining
the coalition at Tuesday's talks.
</P>
<P>
Though the UAL, comprising the Islamic Movement and the
Democratic Arab Party (DAP), expressed its desire for a minister
portfolio as a full partner of a possible coalition, it opposes
the entry of the Likud, the National Religious Party and other
right-wing factions.
</P>
<P>
"We expressed our stance, that we supported Barak in order to
bring down the incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
change the government and its lines--something in which the Arab
community played an important part," said DAP leader Wahab
Darawshe after Tuesday's talks.
</P>
<P>
"We also made it clear that we are prepared to be full and
equal partners in a coalition with guidelines that we can live
with," he added.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the UAL, Israel's communist party Hadash does not see
itself becoming a member of the coalition, and this feeling was
strengthened after the party's meeting with Barak's negotiating
team.
</P>
<P>
Hadash spokesman Dror Nissan, who participated in the talks,
said that they had a distinct impression that prime purpose of
Barak's negotiating team was to "listen and make notes."
</P>
<P>
"If the Likud and the NRP are in the coalition, we will
definitely be in the opposition... and we will obviously support
moves to promote the peace process and all interests of the
Israeli Arab sector, but all other matters would be considered
individually and on their merits," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Leader of Balad Azmi Bishara, who withdrew from the race for
prime minister just before the voting, said after the talks that
it is highly unlikely Balad will join a Barak-led coalition even
without the Likud or the NRP, in the light of the comments made on
Jerusalem and other issues by Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that he will move ahead the peace talks with the
Palestinians, but there would be no return to the 1967 border, no
foreign military presense in the west of the Jordan River, and
Jerusalem will be under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
All three Arab parties called on Barak to state publicly his
commitment to the full implementation of all signed agreements
with the Palestinians, including the Wye accords, and to agree to

<HEADLINE> No More of "Human Rights Above State Sovereignty" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- As the U.S.-led NATO bombardment of
Yugoslavia under the pretext of humanitarianism has created an
unprecedented humanitarian disaster in the Post-War history, it is
time now to put an end to the fallacy that human rights are above
state sovereignty cooked up by the United States and its major
allies.
</P>
<P>
The wanton bombing of Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO has
lasted more than two months, leaving it a devastated land and its
people in misery and suffering, with an exodus of over one
million refugees. In face of the largest catastrophe in Europe
since the end of World War II, people all over the world,
including the American people, have determinedly called for peace.
But, on the other hand, NATO leaders have plausibly argued that
they launched the bombing to stop a humanitarian disaster. This is
a profound confusing of right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
In fact, this fallacy that human rights are above state
sovereignty has been used by the United States and its major
allies as a justification for their extremely cruel acts of
aggression.
</P>
<P>
This fallacy sells the idea that "human rights know no borders,
" "human rights are not part of the internal affairs of nations,"
"the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of
others is not applicable on the human rights issue," etc.
</P>
<P>
Its producers have even become bold enough to claim that "we
might not be very far away from the time that undemocratic
countries or countries which do not care much about the respect of
human rights will not be viewed as sovereign countries."
</P>
<P>
This is indeed a logic of gangster; and its producers are
actually trying to find excuses for the United States to bully the
weak nations by sheer strength, to wantonly interfere in their
internal affairs and implement its gunboat diplomacy in the world.
</P>
<P>
The fallacy, by placing human rights above the sovereignty of
nations, fundamentally reverses the relationship between the two.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that only by having national sovereignty can
people have their human rights guaranteed. Having suffered a great
deal from imperialist aggression and oppression in history,
peoples of the Third World countries are fully aware that, once
losing sovereignty, they are slaves to be trampled upon by others,
let alone the enjoyment of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Both history and reality of the international community have
proven that sovereignty is the basis for the realization of human
rights and interference in it is violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty is the supreme power of nations and an independent
political authority internationally. Sovereignty, the power of a
nation to decide its domestic and foreign policies on its own will
and to handle all internal and international affairs free of
foreign interference, is actually the collective human rights of a
country.
</P>
<P>
Thus, it is untenable that the United States does not
understand that to spread the fallacy is spreading nonsense. For
a long time, the United States has given enormous publicity to the
"protection of human rights" internationally and acted as "human
rights judge," while itself is troubled by serious problems of
human rights at home.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. media, sentiment against foreign
immigration in the United States has been running high over recent
years and racial discrimination has become increasingly rampant.
</P>
<P>
The number of racist organizations in the country soared to 474
in 1997, an increase of 20 percent over the previous year. These
organizations have engaged themselves in such criminal activities
as burning down minority churches, damaging minority property and
killing minority people in apparent violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Then, in its logic, will the United States allow other
countries to bomb Washington or other cities, "mistakenly" kill
innocents and destroy infrastructures such as hospitals, schools,
power plants, highways and bridges for "protection of human rights
"?
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, by advocating the fallacy, the United
States is intended to seek hegemony under the pretext of
humanitarianism, having nothing to do with the protecting of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The Times newspaper of Britain, commenting on a new doctrine of
the U.S.-led NATO on interference in the internal affairs of other
countries, said on March 29, "The new doctrine has two leading
characteristics. It extends the justification for war from self-
defense to defense of human rights inside another state. It leaves
the judgment to the individual nation or alliance, and does not
refer it to the United Nations, or any other international body.
It thereby removes both consensus and certainty from international
law."
</P>
<P>
By the same token, the outrageous bombing of Yugoslavia by the
U.S.-led NATO is downright hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
As early as in the Cold-War era, human rights were used by the
United States as a major pretext to interfere in the internal
affairs of others. While preaching profusely about the so-called
"freedom of speech," it never mentioned the right to existence,
the right to development, the right to education, the right to
being free from want and the right of not being subject to racial
discrimination, in a vicious attempt to incite a few foreign
trouble-makers in destabilizing their countries and to conquer
these countries "by default."
</P>
<P>
After the end of the Cold War, the United States, instead of
giving up the Cold-War mentality, deemed that chance had come for
it to dominate the whole world, and openly advocated for the
establishment of a unipolar world, with itself as the sole
dominator and the Western value the sole value.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, "protection of human rights" has
become a tool in the hands of the United States to build such a
world and a synonym of the U.S. value. And, whoever refuses to act
in accordance with its value will simply be blamed for "violating
human rights" or creating "humanitarian disasters."
</P>
<P>
The fallacy has already posed a serious threat to world peace.
Respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity of other
countries and non-interference in their internal affairs are the
basic principles of modern international law and also an important
guarantee for world peace.
</P>
<P>
The advocating of the fallacy amounts to a denial of the
concept of state sovereignty as the corner stone of modern
international law and a violation of the United Nations Charter
and all existing international laws.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO's indiscriminate bombing of Yugoslavia has
proven to be a "major experiment" for this fallacy, and also a
precedent that can be followed in large scale in the next century.
</P>
<P>
However, lies can never cover up bloody facts. An increasing
number of people are clearly seeing the nature of the fallacy and
solemnly condemning the heinous crimes committed by U.S.-led NATO
in Yugoslavia. As a Chinese saying goes: "He who is unjust is
doomed to destruction." The United States will never achieve its
ambition for hegemony and for building a unipolar world.

<HEADLINE> New Wave of Kosovo Refugees Flood into Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A new wave of Kosovo refugees has
occurred at the border crossings between Yugoslavia and Macedonia
over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
According to the Macedonian news agency MIA, 13,222 from Kosovo
entered Macedonia in the 24 hours from 7 a.m. Monday to 7 a.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the new comers, 11,742 crossed into Macedonia through the
Blace border point, 1,214 through Jaznice and 266 through
Tabanovce.
</P>
<P>
This new influx of refugees brought the total number of Kosovo
refugees in Macedonia to more than 263,000.
</P>
<P>
Due to resource shortage and insufficient international aid,
only about two fifths of the refugees are accommodated at seven
refugee camps in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian government has asked the Western countries to
take the refugees and reduce the burden on it.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,161 refugees were taken by planes to Italy, Sweden,
Norway and Britain on Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 300 refugees left for Norway and Portugal on Tuesday
morning and another 14 flights were scheduled for the day.
</P>
<P>
So far 66,991 Kosovo refugees have been transferred to
countries including Norway, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Holland,
France, Britain, Ireland and the United States, the MIA said.

<HEADLINE> Metallurgical Industry Enhances Energy Conservation Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical industry
aims to reduce the energy consumption required to produce one ton
of iron and steel to 1.23 tons of standard coal this year,
according to a report released by the State Administration of
Metallurgical Industry (SAMI) here today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the sector saved six million tons of standard coal
valued at 3.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The average amount of standard coal used to produce one ton of
iron and steel dropped to 1.29 tons in 1998, down 58 kg. from the
1997 level.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that China's metallurgical industry consumes
substantially more energy than its foreign counterparts. For
example, the average amount of standard coal needed to produce one
ton of iron and steel was 245 tons more than that used in Japan
last year.
</P>
<P>
They cited the main reasons as the lower quality of energy and
raw materials used by the sector, as well as the lack of advanced
energy conservation technology.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the industry will work diligently to
fulfill its long-term target of reducing energy consumption
required to produce a single ton of iron and steel to one ton of
standard coal by the year 2003.

<HEADLINE> China Breeds New Crop Varieties With Nuclear Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China has bred over 510 new crop
varieties with nuclear technology, accounting for a quarter of the
world's total.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Jiang, vice secretary-general of the China Isotope and
Radiation Industry Association, said the maximum yearly planting
area of the new varieties has reached nine million hectares.
</P>
<P>
"They add about four million tons of grain, cotton and edible
oil every year to the country's total output, producing some 3.3
billion yuan of profit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear technology has been widely used in agriculture in China
to raise the production of crops and livestock, and food safety
and quality. It also helps reduce pollution caused by food and
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
"Years of research show that the new varieties pose no harm to
the human health," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has used nuclear technology to help local
residents make full use of resources in feed production, raise the
breeding efficiency of livestock and prevent animal diseases.
</P>
<P>
China has also successfully conducted small-scale tests on
eliminating fruit flies with nuclear technology.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indian Air Force Continues to Strike Kargil Sector, Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Air Force (IAF)
Wednesday afternoon continued its air strikes in Kargil sector of
Kashmir where alleged Pakistan-backed infiltrators have occupied
ridges at 16,000 to 17,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
"The strikes have been very effective and they will continue,"
Air Commodore Subhash Bhojwani told newsmen at a special briefing
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At present, "the camps of heavily-armed militants comprising
Pakistan army regulars and Afghan mercenaries have been hit by the
air force mainly in the Drass sub-sector of Kargil," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the start of operations and they would continue till
our defense forces reoccupy our territory," an official statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Over 160 militants have already been killed and a large number
injured in the army operations which began on May 14. The
casualties on the Indian side include 17 killed, 14 missing and 90
injured, the official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the air force operations was to help the army get
the infiltrators out of the Indian territory and allow no
interference from across the border, Air Commodore Bhojwani said.
</P>
<P>
There had been no combat between Indian and Pakistan armed
forces so far, he further said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Wednesday was reported to have vowed to retaliate
against the Indian aerial strikes on "unmanned" areas at the Line
of Control in the Kargil sector of Kashmir and dismissed India's
assertion that Pakistan was pushing in militants into Indian
territory.

<HEADLINE> Armed Conflicts Intensify in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The forces of faction leader
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of the Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA) have been intensifying their attacks against each other over
the control of regional capital town of Baidoa and some 25 people
were killed in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The most serious fighting so far between the two sides flared
up Tuesday afternoon at El-Don and at Munawir just 12 and three
kilometers respectively north of the important town.
</P>
<P>
According to confirmed sources, the attack in which more than
20 battle wagons were involved has been launched by the forces of
Aidid on the militia base of the RRA at El- Don.
</P>
<P>
There are no exact casualty figures available, but sources
received through the VHF radio indicate that more than 25 people
from both sides were killed and as many as 50 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The RRA spokesman in Mogadishu, Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh, told
the press Wednesday morning that his men have defeated what he
called the coalition forces of the Oromo and Aidid's men in the
fighting Tuesday by killing 35 of them on one spot.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that foreigners were involved in the
fighting between the Somali clans over the control of Baidoa town,
Qalinleh noted.
</P>
<P>
However, residents in Baidoa have not confirmed the presence of
any Oromo fighters in the fighting for the town.
</P>
<P>
According to independent and informed sources, the RRA forces
have captured a double-barrel anti-aircraft heavy machine gun
mounted on a four wheel drive lorry belonging to Aidid's forces.
</P>
<P>
Qalinleh claimed that his forces have likewise captured 60
assault rifles from what he called the aggressors, a claim
disputed by eyewitness in Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses confirmed that Aidid's men have lost seven
rifles to the RRA.
</P>
<P>
Qalinleh admitted that five of the RRA fighters were killed and
seven others wounded.
</P>
<P>
There was no comment from Aidid's side.
</P>
<P>
It is not known what intensifies the fighting for the control
of Baidoa at this moment, but there had been rumors that Aidid's
faction is bringing a new consignment of Somali bank notes which
are to land at the airport of the town.
</P>
<P>
Even though there has been no official word from Aidid's side
over the arrival of the money, still the faction leader himself
accompanied by dozens of battle wagons remain stationed in the
town since last week, trying to dislodge the RRA bases surrounding
Baidoa.

<HEADLINE> China's Research Bodies Face Shake Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China is to reshape its research
institutions in a major shake up which will involve a total of 242
scientific bodies attached to China's 10 administrations directly
transferring to industrial enterprises, becoming independent
ventures or science and technology development related match-
makers.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 5,100 independent research institutions
registered in China but one third of them are basically redundant.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guanhua, vice-minister of Science and Technology, said here
today at a forum focusing on this significant reform that the
restructuring work is scheduled to be completed by the end of this
June.
</P>
<P>
He said the reform of these research institutions is expected
to become a major breakthrough in China's overall reform of the
sector and will greatly encourage the development of inventions.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhigang, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, explained that of the 242 research organs led by his
commission, 131 will become a part of big enterprises or
industrial groups, 40 will become independent ventures and 18 will
become science and technology development intermediary organs. The
rest will be become a part of universities or dismantled.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the research bodies are involved in ten industries
including coal, metallurgy, nonferrous metals, petro-chemicals,
building materials, machinery, light industry and textiles.
</P>
<P>
He said the reform will help improve the market competitiveness
of the country's industrial enterprises and speed up China's
development of high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
The restructured research organs in enterprises will be allowed
such preferential policies as exemption from income tax, sales tax
and some other kinds of taxes apart from receiving their original
government financial subsidies in the coming five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Share prices edged down on
Singapore Stock Market Wednesday following Wall Street's second
straight day of losses.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index slid by 2.48 points to end at
1,893.73 points,
</P>
<P>
Total turnover contracted to 1,066.48 million shares worth
1,086.02 million Singapore dollars (628.12 million U.S. dollars).
Gainers led losers by 267 to 84 with 93 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
GES topped the volume list of the day with a turnover of 45.34
million shares. It was followed by Popular which had 30.83 million
shares done. InnoP was the next with 28.64 million counters
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
OUB F and Tong Meng led the ascent of the day picking up 50
cents to close at 9.55 and 2.80 Singapore dollars respectively.
SembLog rose by 43 cents to finish at 5.05 Singapore dollars.
Creative 50 and DBS F climbed up 40 cents to end at 22.30 and
17.70 Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Goodwood led the losers of the day, incurring
a loss of 100 cents to close at 25.00 Singapore dollars. SPH sank
80 cents to finish at 24.20 Singapore dollars. GE Life retreated
40 cents to end at 12.20 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that share prices nudged lower at open but later
bargain-hunting, especially in property stocks, erased some of
early losses and offset the impact of the slide in U.S. stocks.
</P>
<P>
They said that foreign investors stayed on the sideline in the
absence of fresh news and on the perspective that some blue chips
may have become overvalued.
</P>
<P>
They also said the government's renewed efforts to get the
financial sector consolidate have incurred re-emergence of the
speculation on bank takeover.

LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere called on the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in
Nigerian capital Abuja Tuesday to reject coup-induced leaders in
African countries.

His speech at the National Seminar on Democracy, Good

Nyerere sharply criticized the organization's accepting member

power through illegal means.
</P>
<P>
"Such state heads should be excluded from future OAU meetings,
because as soldiers, they have failed to protect the people of
their country, " he said.
</P>
<P>
It will be a mockery to accept coup-induced leaders for the
OAU, said the president-elect.

Nyerere hoped that the incoming president could materialize the
high expectations of Nigerians and African people.

XI'AN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A pair of ibises, an endangered bird
species, recently built a nest on a mountain slope in Xixiang
County in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, where they laid two
eggs.
</P>
<P>
They are the first ibises to settle on Bashan Mountain on the
Sichuan-Shaanxi border.
</P>
<P>
Liu Gaoming, who works at a nearby nature reserve, reported the
event to the provincial ibis observation center which sent people
to monitor it.
</P>
<P>
The ibis population in China has grown from a mere 7 in 1981 to
the present 136, as a result of environmental protection measures.
</P>
<P>
There used to be large flocks in most of China, Japan, and
Germany, but today the species is found only in China.

JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The negotiating team appointed by Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak Tuesday continued its efforts to form a
broad-based coalition government. The team met separately with
the religious Shas Party and the right-wing Likud Party in the

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Improve Irrigation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Agriculture Secretary
Edgardo Angara Wednesday disclosed that his top priority is to
improve the country's irrigation system to enhance crop output.
</P>
<P>
Angara, a former senator who took his oath as secretary of
agriculture Tuesday, said he plans to build more irrigation
canals and repair existing ones, which are vital in improving
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture plays a vital role in the economy, accounting for
20 to 25 percent of the gross domestic product, or the total goods
and services produced in the country.
</P>
<P>
Angara said that President Joseph Estrada has already issued a
directive to the Department of Budget and Management that the
Department of Agriculture should get the second highest budgetary
appropriation for next year, second only to the Department of
Education, Culture and Sports.
</P>
<P>
The new agriculture chief also promised to prioritize
assistance to Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"The whole of Mindanao can be our food basket," he said.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the National Statistical Coordination Board showed
that from 1990 to 1996, Mindanao produced about 75 percent of the
country's total coconut output, around 68 percent of corn, some 78
percent of banana, and 54 percent of rice.

<HEADLINE> Japan Should Maintain Only Defense Policy: CPPCC Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A leading official of the
Subcommittee of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) said here today that Japan should
adhere to its Peace Constitution and maintain a defense-only
policy.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks after the Japanese Senate passed
new Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines. Its House of
Representatives had already approved the documents despite of the
opposition of the Japanese people and the Asian people.
</P>
<P>
Japan should continue on the path of peaceful development and
implement its own commitments, he said, calling the increased
Japan-U.S. military cooperation and expanded military role in the
Asia-Pacific region a serious step, one that worries the Chinese
and countries and regions in other parts of Asia and makes them
uneasy.
</P>
<P>
The key point of the documents, which were formulated by the
Japanese and U.S. governments and approved by the Japanese Diet,
is stronger military cooperation, he explained.
</P>
<P>
They empower the Japanese self-defense forces to leave Japanese
territory and cooperate with the United States in military
operations in the guise of "safeguarding regional security", but
will in fact threaten the peace and stability of the region.  (

sector of India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The IAF used various aircraft including fighters and
helicopters from various bases to strike in Drass, Batalik and
other regions in the sector, official sources said here. Indian
caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who had spoken to
his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif over telephone Monday, has

ALMA ATA -- Turkmenistan is to pull out of a treaty with Russia
later this year on the joint protection of the Central Asian
republic's southern border with Iran and Afghanistan, said a
report reaching here Tuesday from Ashgabat, capital of
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed between Turkmenistan and Russia in
December 1993. Under the treaty, any side which wants to leave the
treaty is required to present a note to the other side six months
in advance. Turkmenistan's Foreign Ministry confirmed it has
already submitted the note to Russia, saying it plans to quit the
treaty on November 19. Vladimir Konovalov, head of the Russian
border guards in Turkmenistan, said Turkmenistan's decision was "
reasonable," because "the Turkman border service has been fully
formed and is capable of guarding the border without Russia's help.

WASHINGTON -- Li Zhaoxing, Chinese ambassador to the United

report about so-called China's "theft" of nuclear secrets is to
slander China and derail the bilateral relations which are
important to the peoples of China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The allegations are sheer fabrications out of ulterior
political motives," Li said in a CNN interview. A special U.S.
House committee headed by Republican lawmaker Christopher Cox
issued an 872-page report Tuesday, asserting that China obtained
secret information on seven nuclear warheads and the neutron bomb
in "two decades of espionage" at U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King to Meet Arafat in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
is expected to visit the Gaza Strip Wednesday to brief Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat on his just-concluded European and North
American tour.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day trip to Gaza, Abdullah will also discuss
with Arafat bilateral ties between Jordan and the Palestinians and
recent developments concerning the Middle East peace process,
Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
The monarch`s visit to Gaza itself is a sign of Jordan`s
support for the Palestinian people, Radio Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process, particularly the
Israeli-Palestinian track, had been high on the agenda of
Abdullah`s three-week visits to Germany, Britain, Canada and the
United States earlier in May.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian ruler had reaffirmed the rights of the
Palestinian People, including setting up an independent state, and
called for just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East during
his talks with Western leaders.
</P>
<P>
He also tried to persuade the United States and other countries
to pardon nearly half of his kingdom`s debts of some 6.8 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is also expected to visit Tunisia, Algeria, France and
Italy in the coming weeks on bilateral ties and regional issues.

KUWAIT CITY, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said that he would go to Iraq soon and
discuss the outstanding problems between Iraq and Kuwait,
especially the issue of Kuwaiti and third country detainees in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to the Kuwaiti Arabic daily Al-Seyassah published
Wednesday, Abdel-Meguid expressed hope that his visit to Iraq
"will be fruitful and beneficial, especially that Iraq will chair
the next AL meeting in September."
</P>
<P>
He also called for an immediate solution to the issue of over
600 Kuwaiti and third country nationals allegedly still held in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Iraqi side to reveal the whereabouts of the
prisoners of war (POWs), the missing and detained people and to
present evidence on those who have died if there are any.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief stressed that Kuwait has the right to ask for its
POWs, adding that he could feel the extent of sorrow and grief of
the POWs' families during his visit to Kuwait last February.
</P>
<P>
The POWs issue, which Abdel-Meguid termed as a priority of the
AL's agenda, dominated his talks with Kuwaiti leaders.

CAIRO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian Authority Tuesday called on Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak to recognize the rights of the
Palestinians in establishing an independent state as that is the
only way to reach a real peace agreement in the region.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government decided to offer Egypt 20 million
Egyptian pounds (5.88 million U.S. dollars) to finance environment
and development plans in Upper Egypt over the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Jordanian King Abdullah will make his first visit as monarch
to the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip Wednesday for talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the prospects for Middle East
peace after the election victory of Israel's Labour leader Ehud
Barak last week.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, seeking a
broad-based government to back peace moves, Tuesday faced his
stiffest challenge since defeating Benjamin Netanyahu -- coalition
talks with former foes in the Likud and Shas parties. The push to
include the ultra-Orthodox Shas and the hawkish Likud places the
incoming prime minister at the epicenter of Israel's deepest
ideological, ethnic and religious rifts.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Leader Urges S. African Moslems to Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi
has appealed to Moslems in South Africa not to boycott the
upcoming elections in the country, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported from Libya Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to make an appeal to my brother Moslems to take
part in the election and support the African National Congress
(ANC)," Gadaffi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gadaffi's call came at a meeting with a top-level South African
 government delegation which held in a desert location, a
45-minute drive away from the town of Sirte -- 450 kilometers
south of the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Gadaffi said he was speaking in his capacity as the leader of
the World Islamic Peoples Command and as Moslem Imam.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was represented at the meeting by Deputy Minister
of Foreign Affairs Aziz Pahad, Minister of Mineral and Energy
Affairs Penuell Maduna and President Nelson Mandela's
director-general, Jakes Gerwel.
</P>
<P>
Gerwel said Mandela had not appealed to Gadaffi to make the
call, saying that the Libyan leader had possibly read about the
boycott call in news reports.
</P>
<P>
Gadaffi said there were good prospects for a strong
relationship between South Africa and Libya.
</P>
<P>
He praised Mandela's role in ensuring solution of the Lockerbie
dispute and also praised Gerwel and the South Africa's ruling
party ANC.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Maduna said that South Africa was interested in buying
oil from Libya if the price was right.
</P>
<P>
"If they give us a good deal we'll lift it," he told SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Maduna said South Africa currently obtained about 45 percent of
its oil from Iran and 30 percent from Saudi Arabia, with the
balance coming from a variety of sources including its own
synthetic fuels industry.
</P>
<P>
Libyan oil is of good quality, and meets South Africa's
industry specifications.
</P>
<P>
South African energy companies are hoping for a stake in
several large petro-chemical deals in Libya, and several of them
are confident of signing the deals soon.
</P>
<P>
Maduna told Gadaffi that South Africa was more than satisfied
with the business discussions.
</P>
<P>
Gadaffi said he was committed to unifying the African continent
as a whole, hoping this day will come soon.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with South African business executives in Sirte on
the same day, the Libyan leader predicted a thawing of relations
between his country and the United States, now that the issue of
handing over the two men suspected of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing
of a Pan Am flight had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
"They have no reason to delay the resumption of relations
between the two countries now that the problem has been resolved,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Gadaffi laughed at a report that he had personally ordered the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about it. We don't deal with the media, we deal
with ministers and governments."
</P>
<P>
Gadaffi said Libya had suffered under sanctions for the case to
be resolved in the manner that it eventually had been.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Transport Board Urges Workers Not to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Land Transportation, Franchising
and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) of the Philippines Wednesday appealed
to members of transport groups who announced their plans to
participate in a nationwide strike to reconsider their decision.
</P>
<P>
LTFRB Chairman Dante Lantin said millions of commuters all over
the country will be the ones hurt by the strike, not the three oil
firms they want to send a strong message of protest to.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, various labor and transport groups in Metro Manila
announced that they will stage a transport strike on May 27 to
dramatize their protest against increase in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The striking transport groups can demonstrate their strong
opposition and resentment against the recent oil price increases
by peaceful and orderly means other than making their own
countrymen suffer, Lantin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the LTFRB assigned fixed routes of buses just in
case there will be a strike.

<HEADLINE> China to Deal with Light Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's construction department is
drafting laws and regulations on the design, installation and use
of glass walls in a bid to reduce the light pollution caused by
reflection.
</P>
<P>
Since China initiated the reform and opening up drive in 1979,
attractive glass walls have been rapidly spread to most of the
inland cities from coastal cities including Guangzhou and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics show that China has more than 1.7
million square meters of glass walls in use, and the number is
still soaring up.
</P>
<P>
The light pollution produced by concentration, reflection and
refraction because of glass walls has drawn attention from both
experts and residents.
</P>
<P>
Light pollution not only makes people's head swim, but can also
directly causes frequent traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Construction experts said that the reflection coefficient of
glass walls in summer can reach 80 percent, ten times more than
that of the walls covered by coating and ceramic tiles.
</P>
<P>
Environmental officials here said that the glass wall has been
widely applied in construction but the management of its use has
not be very effective.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that light pollution cannot be eliminated with
current technology and could only be prevented through strict
control of the use of glass walls.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government turned down nearly 30 designs
of glass walls last year.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Depositors Swamp Bank to Withdraw Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of panic depositors
swamped Housing Finance Company of Uganda Limited Tuesday to
withdraw massively from the bank which was rumored to be closed
down very soon.
</P>
<P>
The clients filled up the hall at the bank's headquarters on
Kampala road at the Entebbe Road junction and crippled normal
operations half-way through the day.
</P>
<P>
Customers withdrew a total of 250 million shillings (200,000
U.S. dollars) from the bank on that day alone, Wednesday's Monitor
daily quoted the bank manager Sam Rutega as saying that the rumor
started Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Uganda Spokesman Walugembe Musoke later Tuesday
dismissed the panic of withdrawal, saying that the bank was too
viable to go under.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Treasury and Permanent Secretary of the
Finance Ministry Tumusiime Mutebile also refuted rumors that the
bank was about to be closed, adding that everything there was safe
and sound.
</P>
<P>
The rush was well-grounded because the Bank of Uganda, the
country's central bank, had closed two big commercial banks so far
this year and five banks within 10 months. The visibly volatile
financial sector gives rise to public worries about the safety of
their hard-earned money.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up Food Supply Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Safety checks on food sources and
supply have been listed as one of the priority projects for
China's "Agenda 21 Agriculture Action Plan" and authorities assess
that introducing such systems will require an investment of 15
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The procedures will include setting up an information network,
an early warning system and a comprehensive analysis of available
foodstuffs, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China is a big food producer and consumer and feeding its 1.2
billion population is a major issue which affects the country as a
whole, and indeed the whole world, said an expert of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Considering that analysts believe the population will reach 1.3
billion by the end of this century, protecting and maintaining the
safety of food sources is of the utmost importance, according to
the expert.
</P>
<P>
The new procedures, already in the planning stage, will enable
the ministry to carry out short-, medium- and long-term food
supply forecasts, establish a proper agriculture policy and plan
for optimizing food sources through the collection, processing,
analysis and feed back of food production and marketing
information.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Largest Natural Forest Needs More Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have called for the
setting up of a preservation zone in the Houdingshan Mountains in
northeast Beijing to protect the water quality of the Miyun
Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Writing in a recent scientific report, experts said that the
establishment of a nature reserve will help ensure the quality of
one of Beijing's major drinking water sources as well as the
precious primeval forest and its bio-diversity.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Beijing University of Forestry and the
Institute of Botany under the Chinese Academy of Sciences carried
out a thorough investigation in the Houdingshan Mountain area, one
of the largest natural forest locations in Beijing Municipality,
last year.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that protecting the forest will also benefit
Beijing's environment and help keep the ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
The forest in Huairou County, 150 kilometers from the urban
area, covers more than 300 square kilometers, 89 percent of the
Houdingshan Mountain.
</P>
<P>
The forest is home to many precious animals and plants which
are under state protection. Experts say it has a wide diversity of
animal species and is an important water source on the upper
reaches of the Miyun Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The scientists warn that 14 species of plants in the forest are
on the brink of extinction while a further 36 species are in
imminent danger of dying out. Indeed, they say, 12 species which
were existing only thirty years ago when the last survey was
carried out could not be found this time.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say if there is no further protection given to the
forest, the plants, animals and the ecology and environment will
all be endangered.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: COMESA on Fast Track of Free Trade Process by Shen Jian and Li Jinqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The heads of state and government
and representatives from the 21 member states of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) have voiced their
determination and commitment to the realization of the COMESA free
trade area by next year.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "Countdown to the COMESA free trade area,"
the fourth COMESA summit ended in Nairobi Tuesday, calling on all
member states to adhere to the provisions set in the COMESA Treaty
for zero tariff and to eliminate non-tariff barriers and other
obstacles to trade by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
As globalization is enhancing stiff competition toward the 21st
century, African countries are finding it increasingly difficult
to compete in the world market. The globalization has threatened
to marginalize Africa as the current trade volume of some 23
billion U.S. dollars in the COMESA only accounted for less than
0.42 percent of the world total of 5,583 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA leaders agreed that the only solution lies in the
formation of regional economic blocs and they attached great
importance to the integration into the global economic
architecture.
</P>
<P>
In a final communique issued by the summit, the leaders
recalled the decision of declaring the region as a common
investment area for balanced and sustainable development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
They also encouraged the member states, particularly those with
growing cross-border trade, investment and tourism, to introduce
limited currency convertibility between themselves in a bid to
reduce transaction costs, facilitate the flow of trade and
investment, and promote the exchange of local currencies among
member states.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the summit endorsed the
establishment of a special free trade area committee comprising
Kenya, Mauritius, Zambia, Uganda, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Malawi and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to assist in the preparatory
activities culminating in the launching of the free trade area
next October.
</P>
<P>
The leaders have also decided to form a co-ordinating body of
experts from central banks and ministries of finance to oversee
the implementation of policy measures on economic policy
harmonization toward the eventual goal of a monetary union by
2025.
</P>
<P>
For promoting cross-border trade within the region, the leaders
decided that all member states should adopt the harmonized
commodity description and coding system for customs and
statistics, and agreed to the need of setting up a guarantee
facility for covering political risks in intra- COMESA and
international trade.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that peace, unity and stability are the keys to
the economic growth in the region. "Peace is of paramount
importance," Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, the newly-elected
COMESA chairman, pointed out. " Without peace, there would be
nothing but poverty."
</P>
<P>
The leaders also appealed to those member states involved in
regional or civil conflicts to cease fire immediately for the sake
of trade growth and regional economic integration as well as the
improvement of the well-being of the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1994, the COMESA has made
commendable progress toward the attainment of the goals of a free
trade area by October next year and a common external tariffs by
2004, said Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, the outgoing
COMESA Chairman.
</P>
<P>
As of February 1, 1999, Chiluba said, 14 out of the 21 member
states had reduced their tariffs by between 60 percent and 90
percent. Non-tariff barriers like licenses, import quotas and
foreign exchange restrictions have been removed in most of COMESA
members.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the regional body has pursued the goal of creating a
common market where goods, services, labor and capital can move
freely across the borders of its member states, Chiluba told the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA covers an area of some 12.88 million square
kilometers with a population of 380 million. However its current
gross domestic product (GDP) is only 165 billion dollars, just as
much as that of Belgium or the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Endowed with rich natural resource and a big market, the COMESA
would be like a magnet for potential investors within and outside
the region.
</P>
<P>
As Kenyan President Moi said at the opening ceremony of the
summit that African countries must be united in pursuing issue of
common concern. " Together under the COMESA umbrella, we must
work for freedom in trade that will enable us to participate
effectively in and gain from the global economy."
</P>
<P>
Presidents from Zimbabwe, Uganda, Namibia, Tanzania, Sudan,
Malawi, Rwanda, the DRC, Burundi and Djibouti, and ministers from
other COMESA countries, also attended the two-day summit.

<HEADLINE> China Redoubles Efforts to Protect Tibetan Antelope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Wildlife protection officials today
burned 361 Tibetan antelope furs which had been confiscated from
poachers in this capital city of northwest China's Qinghai
Province.
</P>
<P>
"The move indicates the determination of the Chinese government
to combat the poaching and smuggling of such pelts," said Zhang
Jianlong from the Wildlife Protection Department under the State
Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
"We destroyed the furs because if they were somehow returned to
the market it would encourage rather than discourage poachers," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan antelope is an endangered species and is top of
China's protected species list. It is native to the grasslands in
and around Qinghai Province, Xinjiang Uygur and Tibetan Autonomous
Regions and normally lives up in the mountains between 3,700 and 5,
500 meters high.
</P>
<P>
The animal's fur, known as the "king of wool", has been sold
illegally around the world since early 1990. Shawls, called
shahtoosh, made of such wool can sell for as much as 11,000 U.S.
dollars each on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, poachers are keen to kill these antelopes because
of the huge financial returns which has led to a drastic decline
in their numbers almost to the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
According to wildlife experts the number of Tibetan antelopes
has fallen from 50,000-75,000 in 1995 to the present 30,000. In
the past ten years Chinese police and forest rangers have solved
over 100 cases of smuggling, confiscating 17,000 furs.
</P>
<P>
The state has set up many reserves in an attempt to protect the
Tibetan antelope and launched a series of campaigns against
poachers in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The latest is jointly organized by the State Forestry
Administration, Qinghai Province and the Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet
Autonomous Regions at the Hoh Xil Nature Reserve, which is located
on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is home to more than 20 rare
animal species such as the Yak and Tibetan antelope.
</P>
<P>
The effort is hugely successful and has resulted in the capture
of thirteen gangs of poachers and the confiscation of 388 Tibetan
antelope pelts.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Chinese to Cross Desert by Wheelchair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A crippled Chinese man has just
left here for northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
to make an attempt at crossing the Taklimakan Desert, the world's
second largest desert, by wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
Yin Xiaoxing, 29, is expected to start his epic journey across
the 340,000 sq km desert, dubbed "the sea of death", in Xinjiang
by the end of this month and plans to travel some 500 km across it
alone.
</P>
<P>
The man, born into a rural family in east China's Jiangsu
Province, has been confined to a wheelchair since childhood. He is
now less than one meter in height and weighs only 41 kg.
</P>
<P>
"I'm disabled which is a fact I can't change, but I try to live
as a normal person," Yin said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Yin began to challenge his disability by traveling
widely across the country, and has since covered more than 57,000
km, including climbing 17 mountains.
</P>
<P>
He set himself the goal of traversing the Taklimakan in 1996
and has been making preparations in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Yin has chosen to cross Taklimakan in summer because the
natural conditions in the desert become extremely difficult in
this season, with its temperature climbing to as high as 70
degrees centigrade during the day and dropping to 30 degrees below
zero centigrade at night.
</P>
<P>
"I have seven years of traveling by wheelchair, and I'm ready
to face any difficulties ahead," Yin said.
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang Disabled Persons' Federation and the Zhejiang
Tingdeshuai Clothing Company have donated spare tires, sleeping
bags, cotton-padded clothes and other goods necessary for desert
travel.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Disabled Persons' Federation will also provide him
food and fresh water.

<HEADLINE> NZ's Protests Likely if US Imposes Trade Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand may protest to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) if the United States bows to its
protectionist farm lobby and erects barriers to lamb imports, the
Dominion Wednesday quoted New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper reported that Shipley also
appears to leave open the possibility of telephoning U.S.
President Bill Clinton next week about the escalating trade
dispute between New Zealand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the United States International Trade
Commission (ITC) has recommended a range of measures to "protect
the U.S. sheep meat industry", including a tariff of around 20
percent on all lamb imports and a quantitative restriction.
President Clinton will decide by the end of next week on the ITC
proposal for tariffs to be used against New Zealand and Australia,
which supply most of the United States' lamb imports.
</P>
<P>
Recently Meat NZ Chairman John Acland returned from Washington
fearful that Clinton may approve the ITC measures to impose
tariffs on New Zealand and Australian lamb.
</P>
<P>
After receiving Meat NZ Chairman Acland in her Beehive office
Tuesday, Shipley threatened to take the United States to the WTO
if President Clinton's ruling is unfavorable to New Zealand trade,
the Dominion said.
</P>
<P>
"It is most certainly an option that's available to our
country. I can tell you that the work has been done. Obviously
though we don't want to pre-empt their decision," Shipley told the
paper.
</P>
<P>
She added that New Zealand is going to defend its right to
trade freely.
</P>
<P>
The United States imported a record 31.6 million kilograms of
lamb in 1998, up from just 18 million kilograms in 1993. New
Zealand earns about 120 million NZ dollars (66 million U.S.
dollars) from its share of the trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's ability to compete
in the new information economy is slipping behind its trading
competitors.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Herald, a newspaper published in the country's
biggest city of Auckland, reported Tuesday that New Zealand ranked
 the ninth in 1997, but slipped to the 13th last year, according
to the Information Society Index of the International Data
Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
The index takes into account 23 variables, including social
factors, information infrastructure, computer infrastructure and
Internet connections and usage, to measure how a country or a
region is placed to access, absorb and effectively take advantage
of information and information technology.
</P>
<P>
IDC country manager Dinesh Kumar was quoted as saying that
while New Zealand was still growing, "other countries grew faster
than we did, so we slid down the scale." That slide is expected
to continue, with New Zealand languishing at 19 by 2002, according
to him.
</P>
<P>
Top of the chart in 1998 was the United States, followed by
Sweden, Finland, Singapore, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands,
Australia, Japan, Canada, Switzerland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Kumar said New Zealand was dragged down by a poor score in
information infrastructure category, which measures things like
telephone, fax and television ownership, telephone prices, cable
subscriptions and the number of fault calls on the telephone
networks.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Ministry of Health, in
coordination with the Swedish International Development Agency
(SIDA), launched in Hanoi Tuesday a National No-Smoking Week from
May 25 to 31, local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It has been a traditional no-smoking campaign in Vietnam since
1997.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the campaign is to promote no-smoking habit among
people, especially youth and teenagers, in the interest of the
individuals themselves as well as of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Health calls for concrete rules on the
habit, such as an official ban on smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
With half of its male population and 3.4 percent of females
smoking, Vietnam ranks the 22nd in the world in this term, smoking
up 5,834 billion Vietnamese dong (roughly 416 million U.S.
dollars) worth of cigarettes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's armymen, police, youth and teenagers in rural areas
or urban unemployed youngsters are found among the heavy smokers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Restructure Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will push
through with the privatization of the National Power Corporation
(Napocor) and the restructuring of the power industry, the
Philippines News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the government's efforts to make the
economy more competitive in the years ahead, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Senior Deputy Executive Secretary Ramon Cardenas was quoted as
saying the government will have to tackle difficult economic
problems, such as the privatization of the Napocor, to make the
economy more competitive.
</P>
<P>
"With our present cost of power as reportedly the second
highest in Asia, we have to open up the industry and introduce
more competition, specifically in the areas of power generation
and distribution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cardenas ruled out subsidies for the power industry, saying
this would simply aggravate the Napocor's total indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging competition in the power industry would pave the
way for lower electricity rates, which in turn will benefit not
only residential consumers but industrial users as well, he said.

<HEADLINE> UAE Newspaper Urges for Stronger GCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A newspaper in the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) Wednesday urged Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries to speed up the process of integration and make
the regional alliance stronger.
</P>
<P>
To achieve full GCC integration, much needs to be done on the
national level, said the English daily Gulf News.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial marking the 18th anniversary of the creation of
the GCC on May 25, 1981, the paper urged the six member countries
- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the UAE - to "take
the next step" to achieve its wider goals.
</P>
<P>
While praising the alliance as the only functioning regional
organization in the Arab world which has made well-known
achievements, the editorial said "it has yet to achieve its full
potential."
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that in some cases, member states' national
interests have prevailed over those of the region. As a
result, "the process of integration seems to be moving in the
opposite direction," it added.
</P>
<P>
"Whether it is the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners in Iraq, the
integration of Iraq into the Arab world, the establishment of a
mutual defense or the adoption of a unified tariff, the states
have been more eager to overlook the greater regional benefits
than to act in unison," the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
It did not mention the UAE's conflict with Iran over the
sovereignty of three Gulf islands. The UAE, which calls for united
actions among GCC states, has been uneasy over recent efforts made
by Saudi Arabia and some other GCC states to improve relations
with Iran, regardless of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"What needs to be done is for each state to recognize that
there is need for a stronger GCC, even if it means compromise on
some of their national objectives," the paper stressed.

<P>
Zhang Zheng, an associate professor at the journalism school,
told a forum that Chinese students used to have a kind of worship
of press freedoms in the United States, and thought that American-
style press freedoms represented purity and should be followed.
</P>
<P>
But the NATO attack on the Yugoslav Television Station and the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade completely dispelled this illusion and
showed them the true face of American-style press freedoms that
means the American privilege to dominate global publicity, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
Yao Lili, who will soon graduate from the journalism school,
said that they used to have a fancy for the Western media, but the
missiles fired by NATO and the blood of the Chinese martyrs helped
them see more clearly the hypocrisy of the U.S. press freedoms
that serve political groups and bang the drum for power politics
and unjust wars.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng Mei, another professor, the press freedoms
of the United States, characterized by a double standard, have
always been used to serve hegemonism, fabricate lies wantonly,
spread rumors and carry out subversive activities. If you report
the facts you will be accused of destroying the press freedom and
get killed.
</P>
<P>
Professor Guo Qingguang, who is head of the journalism school,
said the U.S. practices hegemonism through invasions, economic
sanctions, and more importantly, by news reports and culture that
help stir up contradictions among people of different ethnic
groups, start internal feuds and cause political chaos. He blames
the NATO attack on Yugoslav Television Station and the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade on the U.S.'s fear of the voice of justice.
</P>
<P>
On the night of May 7, NATO fired missiles from different
directions into the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, killing three
journalists instantly, injuring 20 others and destroying the
building.
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter of protest to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing,
the students of the journalism school said that the United States
had removed the deceptive mask of freedom of the press and had
shown the true face of a hegemony.

<HEADLINE> HK to Further Invest in Infrastructure: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here
Wednesday that over the next five years the SAR will continue to
invest in infrastructure development estimated at 30 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Third Ministers' Forum
on Infrastructure Development in the Asia-Pacific Region, Tung
said that this figure is 50 percent higher than what Hong Kong has
spent on its new international airport at Chek Lap Kok and the
associated development.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that Hong Kong has in the past years invested
substantially in infrastructure development. The SAR continues to
find ways to accommodate population growth and relieve urban
congestion, he added.
</P>
<P>
The new airport, which was completed and opened last year, has
been named one of the Top Ten Construction Achievements of the 20
th century at a recent international construction trade show, Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
It will enable Hong Kong to handle passengers and cargoes more
than double the volume at the old airport in a more efficient
manner, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that with the arrival of the digital era, digital
technology will open up new possibilities and offers tremendous
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"We will position ourselves as a leading city in the world for
the development of information technology," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"In pursuit of this vision, we will embark on the development
of a Cyberport in partnership with the private sector," he added.
</P>
<P>
It will provide facilities to attract a strategic cluster of
companies engaged in leading-edge information technology and
services.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this development will help create the synergies
required to turn Hong Kong into an international multi-media and
information service center and link up our vast hinterland with
the rest of the Region through state of the art communication
networks," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Another response the SAR will make to the challenges of the 21
st century is to make Hong Kong an innovation-led, technology-
intensive economy.
</P>
<P>
"We will broaden and upgrade our economic base by actively
encouraging high value-added and high productivity activities,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The realization of this new vision calls for investment in
technological infrastructure, which is the technological support
given to industrial production and distribution activities through
research and the transfer of research results.
</P>
<P>
Addressing some 70 delegates from 14 members of the forum, Tung
called for more bilateral and multilateral communication and co-
operation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The first Ministers' Forum on Infrastructure Development in the
Asia-Pacific Region was held in 1995 in Osaka, Japan, and the
second in 1997 in Santiago, Chile. The current one will last till
May 28.

<HEADLINE> Omanis Prefer Local Goods: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Consumers of Oman overwhelmingly
prefer locally-manufactured products, the Dubai-based Khaleej
Times daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 62 percent of people in the country, both nationals
and expatriates, opt for "Made in Oman" goods, the paper said,
quoting results of a country-wide survey made by the Omani
Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
"There exists a significant positive momentum in favor of Omani
products which the local manufacturers can effectively utilize,"
the survey report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The study also revealed that a campaign launched by the
ministry to promote local products has had a significant impact
on creating consumer awareness about goods manufactured in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive survey covered consumers, dealers and
manufacturers, and involved 27 durable and non-durable items
produced in the country.
</P>
<P>
46 percent of the consumers surveyed gave high rating for Omani
products for their quality. While 36 percent felt the quality was
on par with imported items, 18 percent said it was inferior to
foreign brands.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 76 percent of the population is aware of
locally produced goods.
</P>
<P>
Like other Gulf countries, Oman has been trying to develop
manufacturing industry in recent years as part of its effort to
diversify the national economy, which depends much on oil export.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Nepal to Lay More Stress on Ties With India, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Prime minister designate of Nepal
Krishna Prasad Bhattarai said Wednesday that his new government
will lay more stress on relations with India and China.
</P>
<P>
"There shall be no change in the foreign policies that have
been pursued for ages in our country, but there will be only
difference on putting the stress on the issue of our friendship
with our two immediate neighbors, namely India and China," he told
Xinhua in an interview at his residence in Lalitpur, which
neighbors Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
"Stress shall be more on these countries than other neighbors,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress, to which Bhattarai belongs, is poised to
form the next government as it has won a majority of 110 seats in
the elections to the 205-member House of Representatives held on
May 3 and May 17. Party President and Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala has offered the post-poll premiership to Bhattarai, a
senior leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said that he shall assume the top executive post on
Friday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that in further boosting ties with China, there will be
more visits to China, more cultural and student exchanges between
Nepal and China and more publicity about each other in favor of
friendship in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
The septuagenarian leader described both India and China as
very great countries with great cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
"For the last thousand years, we have been keeping very good
relationship with both countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
But since Nepal and India have the same religion, thousands of
the Nepalese people go to India for pilgrimage and millions of
Nepalese nationals are employed there, "naturally our relationship
with them, compared to China, are deeper," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the 11th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) scheduled for November in Kathmandu, Bhattarai
pledged to do everything possible to ensure a "very pleasant and
comfortable" stay in Nepal for the heads of state or government
from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
He said Nepal will make the summit "an important question" and
cultivate deeper relations with the other SAARC member states.
</P>
<P>
On his priorities in the national front, the prime minister
designate put poverty eradication as his top priority followed by
education and creation of jobs for the youth. He said it is a very
difficult task.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank listed Nepal as one of the 25 least developed
countries in the world while the Asian Development Bank put the
level of poverty in the kingdom at 42-50 percent.

<HEADLINE> Utah Beats Portland 88-71 to Avoid Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Karl Malone set the tone early
with another vicious elbow on Brian Grant and the Utah Jazz
avoided elimination and finally displayed the type of poise that
has led them to back-to-back Western Conference titles.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz pulled within 3-2 in their conference semifinal series
with a convincing 88-71 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers
but more importantly watched their less-experienced opponents wilt
under pressure with a chance to close them out.
</P>
<P>
Malone, who sparked the Jazz to a 93-83 victory in Game One
with a left elbow to Grant's jaw, scored 23 points, grabbed eight
rebounds and found the bridge of Grant's nose with an elbow in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Utah jumped out to a 14-4 lead and never trailed in front of a
raucous crowd at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
Game Six is Thursday at Portland, where the Jazz have dropped
nine of their last 11, including Games Two and Three of this
series.
</P>
<P>
Grant, who outplayed Malone in each of the previous three games,
was held to eight points in 39 minutes as Portland lost its cool
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Mike Dunleavy, the NBA Coach of the Year, went after the
officials after a questionable technical foul was called on Grant.
Dunleavy had to be restrained and eventually was ejected Grant and
Malone had to separated during the fracas.
</P>
<P>
Bryon Russell scored 22 points and John Stockton handed out 14
assists for Utah, which shot a blistering 63 percent in the first
half for a 49-42 lead at the break.
</P>
<P>
Damon Stoudamire drained a jumper to start the second half
before Malone sparked the rout with six straight points, including
consecutive dunks. Jeff Hornacek collected 14 points.
</P>
<P>
Isaiah Rider scored 16 points and Rasheed Wallace had 15 for
Portland, which was held to its lowest point total of the season.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Funeral Industry Has Enormous Potential (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua)-- The friends of Fan Jiayue are often
shocked when they step into his exhibition hall by the 1.4m. by 1.
1m. black and white photo of him on an electronic screen in what
appears to be a funeral hall, and they puzzle: didn't he just
invite me a few days ago?
</P>
<P>
But they are soon relieved to see that the 52-year-old man is
alive and well, as he explains that this is just his way of
demonstrating his new projector that was designed for use at a
funeral service.
</P>
<P>
Fan is one of just a few people with MBAs among the managers of
China's state-owned enterprises and he has been racking his brains
in search of ways to market products.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition hall and his company headquarters are in a blue
two-story building inside the Beinei Group Corporation compound
within walking distance of the China World Trade Center in eastern
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Since establishing the Beijing Interment and Funeral Facilities
Company in 1993, Fan has been using printed matter and photos to
reach potential customers, mainly funeral homes and officials of
local government divisions that see to it that burials and
funerals are conducted properly. But the fliers got a lukewarm
reception and business moved ahead at a snail's pace.
</P>
<P>
Fan attributes this to the relatively low education level of
people who work at funeral homes, who "prefer to see things that
can impact directly on their eyes."
</P>
<P>
So, he opened the exhibition hall on April 18 and has invited
heads of funeral homes and local government officials to see his
nearly 40 different types of products that range from a plastic
card to ash boxes to gravestones to hearses. Fan's business really
took off.
</P>
<P>
"Once they're here, they instantly see what I'm trying to sell
and they place orders on the spot," he says. Some of the products
have been developed by his company.
</P>
<P>
Fan, also an advisor to the China Interment and Funeral
Association, says that revenues for the past month showed a more
than 3-fold rise over the same period last year. He expects the
company to have sales of more than 7 million yuan this year. Last
year, it sold more than 3 million yuan worth of goods.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fan says that he is actively looking for new technology that
can be used in the growing business, because much of it here is
still old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
One example was when he turned to the diminishing numbers of
people who can use writing brushes to write elegant characters for
elegiac couplets and commissioned Qingdao University and Beijing
University to design software that would allow computers to print
out elegiac couplets written in various styles of calligraphy. The
software is now available.
</P>
<P>
Another innovation came when his company started working with
an American company to produce much more cost-effective cremators
than those available in China. The results of this are scheduled
to go on display in November.
</P>
<P>
Fan feels optimistic about his company's prospects, because
every year 7.5 million Chinese die and five million are buried and
2.5 million cremated, meaning a growing demand for services,
equipment, and goods, so "This market will never be weak, it will
be a huge market forever!"
</P>
<P>
China's population is approaching 1.3 billion but there are
only slightly more than 1,300 funeral homes across the country,
most of them using outmoded equipment.
</P>
<P>
The United States has only 250 million people or so but 10,000
funeral homes, Fan says. He has studied the business in about 10
highly developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has a funeral company with profits matching those of
McDonalds," he says enviously, shaking his head in amazement.
</P>
<P>
Civil Affairs Ministry statistics show annual interment and
funeral business in China amounting to more than 20 billion yuan.
But, to put it in a different perspective, this is the same as the
turnover in the commodity market of the city of Yiwu in coastal
Zhejiang Province, one of several big markets in China.

<HEADLINE> Corrupt Chinese Grain Officials Being Exposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north China has
declared war on official misconduct in the grain business and is
straightening out the grain industry and penalizing them.
</P>
<P>
The province has dealt with 93 acts of official irregularities
in the grain procurement, reserve and distribution sector 1998 and
97 officials have been penalized, some of them with disciplinary
warnings, some being expelled from the Party or from their
official position, and some brought to court.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial government official, irregularities
in violation of State Council regulations on grain procurement
account for the bulk of the case. Some officials took bribes by
issuing fake invoices and certificates.
</P>
<P>
The misappropriation of state funds for grain procurement has
been harshly dealt with. One accountant in the Yongji city grain
bureau was sentenced to three years in jail for lending more than
280,000 yuan of state funds to an individual.
</P>
<P>
Officials in state grain enterprises have also been penalized
for the mismanagement of state procurement funds and fraudulent
activities.

<HEADLINE> World Gas Demand To Grow 2.7 Percent Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- World natural gas demand is
expected to grow at an average annual rate of 2.7 percent to the
year 2010, a senior energy analyst predicted here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Han Dakuang, of the China National Petroleum Corp.
(CNPC) the world's total demand for natural gas will climb to a
little over 3 trillion cubic meters in 2010 from around 2.1
trillion cubic meters in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Demand in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow from
around 200 billion cubic meters in 1995 to around 470 billion
cubic meters, he said, with about 6 percent annually growth, well
ahead of the world average.
</P>
<P>
He says that the rapid growth in gas use is the result of
several factors. For a decade, during which time environmental
protection has risen to the top of political agendas, the inherent
cleanliness of gas has been a major factor. But, it is also an
extremely convenient and efficient form of fuel. And the economic
restructuring and urbanization worldwide will sharply increase
demand for gas.
</P>
<P>
In China, Han says, fast economic growth has led to a sharp
increase in demand for gas and he expects the country's demand to
go from the 18 billion cubic meters in 1995 to 100 billion cubic
meters in 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Nuclear technology has been widely
used in medicine in China, playing an important role in
safeguarding the public health and preventing the spread of
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Jiang, vice secretary-general of the China Isotope and
Radiation Industry Association, said today that China has some 4,

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: History of China's Arctic Expedition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China announced Tuesday that it
will make its first state-sponsored North Pole scientific
expedition from July to September.
</P>
<P>
What follows is a brief history of China's Arctic expedition
work:
</P>
<P>
In 1950, Gao Shiliu, a student at the University of Toronto,
went to the arctic region to do scientific research and the
following year reached the magnetic pole and became the first
Chinese known to have made it to the Arctic region.
</P>
<P>
In 1958, Li Nan, a correspondent of the Xinhua News Agency's
Moscow Branch, made it to the Arctic to interview a group of
Soviet scientists there and was able to reach the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Rebecca Lee Lok-sze, a female Arctic explorer and
travel writer from Hong Kong, successfully reached the North Pole
and planted a Chinese flag there. That same year, with approval
from the Chinese Association of Science and Technology,
preparations began for a Chinese arctic expedition in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, with non-government financial backing, the Chinese
Association set up an Arctic expedition team with help from 25
scientists, journalists, and rear echelon personnel. They left for
the Arctic on March 31 of that year and reached the North Pole on
May 6.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists at the North Pole studied oceanographic, ice,
snow, atmospheric, and environmental phenomena and remote sensing
devices. They also gathered 542 various types of samples.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Rejects U.S. Report on Espionage Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Zhaoxing, Chinese ambassador
to the United States, said Tuesday that the purpose of the U.S.
congressional report about so-called China's "theft" of nuclear
secrets is to slander China and derail the bilateral relations
which are important to the peoples of China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The allegations are sheer fabrications out of ulterior
political motives," Li said in a CNN interview.
</P>
<P>
A special U.S. House committee headed by Republican lawmaker
Christopher Cox issued an 872-page report Tuesday, asserting that
China obtained secret information on seven nuclear warheads and
the neutron bomb in "two decades of espionage" at U.S. nuclear
weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
"China does not have any policy of stealing high-tech or any
thing from other countries. China has not stolen anything from the
United States in the field of technology," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, is the country which abides by the spirit of
the charter of the United Nations and the norms of governing
international relations.
</P>
<P>
Some Americans are trying to insult the wisdom and creativeness
of the Chinese scientists and engineers, Li said. "Please don't
underestimate the wisdom of creativeness of the Chinese scientists.
"
</P>
<P>
China has indeed developed its own limited nuclear capability,
the ambassador said, adding that this has been done through self-
reliance and by relying on the efforts and wisdom of the Chinese
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Li said China is a country that loves peace, needs peace and
wants to live in peace with other countries including the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
the Cox report was merely a fallacy dreamed up by a few people in
the United States with ulterior motives and in essence an attempt
to stir up anti-China feelings and divert people's attention.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said at a regular press conference that some Americans are
sticking to the Cold War thinking and are making a great effort to
dream up stories about China's spying on U.S. nuclear technology.

role against tobacco by making the people conscious of the deadly
effects of tobacco.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Issue Bonds for Small Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved the
issuance of government bonds worth 25 billion baht (675.7 million
U.S. dollars) for small investors starting from June 1, a
Government House press release available Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The five-year bonds will pay annual interest of 6.75 percent
and be sold for 1,000 baht (27 dollars) each, with a minimum
investment of 10 bonds, or 10,000 baht (270 dollars) per person.
</P>
<P>
Bonds can be transferred and traded in the secondary market,
giving investors flexibility if interest rate conditions change.
</P>
<P>
Priority would be given to retail investors and charity
organizations, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors, including financial institutions,
might be able to buy the bonds if available after the subscription
period began.
</P>
<P>
The issue, used to cover the 1999 fiscal deficit, would also
help draw excess liquidity from the money market.
</P>
<P>
Regulators say about 100 billion baht (2.7 billion dollars) in
excess liquidity is in the market, but once the economy picked up,
the funds would be utilized as new loans by financial institutions
to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said earlier that the
government had to be cautious when issuing new bonds to avoid
adversely impacting domestic liquidity in the future.
</P>
<P>
Another 15 billion baht (405.4 million dollars) in bonds could
be issued if the first lot proved successful. The Finance Ministry
was also considering the merits of bond issues for state
enterprises in the local market.
</P>
<P>
Government bonds now trade in the market at 6.4-6.5 percent,
and investors can subscribe to the bonds at the Bank of Thailand,
the Government Savings Bank and their regional branches
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Thai Traders to Seek Government's Market Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- About 600 Thai export companies are
keen to take up an offer of government help to find new markets,
said a Commerce Ministry report, which is available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the government program, the Export Promotion Department
will spend 120 million baht (3.24 million U.S. dollars) on
marketing assistance, the Export-Import Bank will make available
loans totaling 150 million baht (4.05 million dollars) at a
discount rate, and exporters finding new markets can claim double
tax rebates on the costs involved.
</P>
<P>
The five-year assistance program, which is subject to annual
review, was approved by the cabinet shortly after the economic
stimulus package worth 53 billion baht (1.45 billion dollars) was
announced in late March, the report said.
</P>
<P>
All elements of the program are in place, although allowing
double tax rebate claims requires Council of State approval, a
move seen as a formality.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at boosting revenue from new markets to at
least 50 percent of the country's total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
This could counter any risk of major declines in trade with
Thailand's major partners including the United States, the
European Union and Japan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Government House press release available
Wednesday, the Thai cabinet has acknowledged that the country's
exports in the first quarter of this year dropped four percent
from the same period last year to 13 billion dollars, while
imports increased 5.8 percent to 11.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Immense Potential Insurance Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
manufacturing center, has immense potential for the life insurance
business, according to a recent survey that showed that nearly
half its people said they would like to have insurance.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Economic Society queried 10,400 people about their
attitude towards insurance and found that Shanghai residents spent
only 444 yuan per person on insurance last year, which can be
compared with the more than 20,000 yuan per capita in savings, and
this indicates great possibilities for the insurance business.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of people who would like to buy policies is
17.48 percent more than it was in 1997, respondents said they were
dissatisfied with the insurance and services provided by local
insurers. About 56 percent said that they lack characteristic
products and services.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the service most needed include
nursing care coverage for the elderly, accident coverage, and
greater coverage for diseases.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed a lack of knowledge about insurance
among local people, only 4.03 percent of whom knew that the main
function of insurance is not to save money but to provide security.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has some 13 million people and 15 domestic and
overseas-funded insurance companies whose total annual premiums
amounted to 10.3 billion yuan in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Ban Arms Possession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRAZILIA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso announced here Tuesday a prohibition on arms
sales and eventually a similar prohibition on the possession of
arms, due to the country's growing crime rate.
</P>
<P>
"I am sad to admit that according to United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Brazil has the
highest rate of crimes committed with firearms," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Next week the president said he will send an initiative to ban
the sale and possession of arms to congress for approval. Nowadays
all Brazilians are threatened by the use of arms, so the present
situation must be changed, said the president.
</P>
<P>
The initiative requests that individuals turn their firearms
over to any unit of the armed forces, the federal police, or the
civil police. Only personnel of the armed forces, the police,
intelligence organizations, and security companies, which are
registered in accordance with the law, may carry arms.
</P>
<P>
Those who carry weapons illegally will be sentenced to two
years imprisonment, with no right to bail, said Renan Calheiros,
Brazil's justice minister.
</P>
<P>
Those who now possess firearms will have two years to hand them
in, and will receive a lawful indemnity, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to UNESCO, Brazil has the highest murder rate in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the crimes committed in Rio de Janeiro are
not solved and in San Paulo only 1.9 percent of all crimes are
resolved, said Calheiros.
</P>
<P>
Rio de Janeiro last year reported the sale and registration of
5,444 firearms, while the figure for Sao Paulo was 3,635.

<HEADLINE> Cheaper Films More Popular In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Vice-director of the
Changchun Film Studio in northeast China's Jilin Province Han
Zhijun says that the Chinese filming business is still in a slump
and that high costs means high risks, so the studio has turned to
low-cost films to attract audiences.
</P>
<P>
The studio shot "The Election of a Village Head" and three
other films that cost only 1.7 million yuan (200,000 U.S. dollars)
each, but that the low cost does not mean low quality. Many low-
cost films have had good returns.
</P>
<P>
"The Day without a Hero", for example, made by the Beijing
Forbidden City Film Company last year, cost only 3.8 million yuan,
but it got 20 million yuan at the box office and a lot of domestic
prizes.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an Film Studio, which produced "Red Sorghum", has made
many films in recent years, most costing less than 3 million yuan
each, and, the 7 films made by the Shanghai Yongle Film Company
this year are low-budget.
</P>
<P>
But, the cost of Chinese films over the last few years has been
increasing to more than 4 million yuan each, some even costing
hundreds of millions of yuan, but many didn't break even.
</P>
<P>
"A Time to Remember", directed by Ye Daying, the producer of "
Red Cherry", cost over 20 million yuan, but it was a complete
failure and only 3 of the 82 films last year showed a profit.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yimou, the well-known director, says that the Chinese
don't produce films with lots of technology at a high cost and
should focus on taste, content, and reflecting real life.
</P>
<P>
People at Changchun say that a lot of imported low-budget films
like "The Bridges of Madison County" had tremendous box-office
results and that the Chinese film industry should learn from them.
</P>
<P>
Many professionals in the film industry say that low-budget
films are the best way for China to reduce risks in the fickle
business, but the Central Government should support films that are
important like "the Opium War" to ensure quality.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Disagrees to House Espionage Case Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said Tuesday that there is no evidence of wholesale
loss of information in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The (U.S. House) report discusses the possible theft of
neutron technology discovered in 1996. This allegation is based on
one piece of intelligence reporting, and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation has been unable to identify a logical suspect,"
Richardson said when commenting on the so-called espionage case at
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
A special U.S. House committee led by Republican lawmaker Chris
Cox issued the 872-page report Tuesday, alleging that China
obtained secret information on seven nuclear warheads and the
neutron bomb in "two decades of espionage" at U.S. Nuclear weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
"I also want to put this report into proper perspective. This
is no evidence of a wholesale loss of information," Richardson
said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It would be a mistake to attempt to use this report
for political gain."
</P>
<P>
"China is not up to par with the United States on nuclear
development. It is far behind us," the energy secretary said. "
There is no evidence that is changing."
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
the Cox report was merely a fallacy dreamed up by a few people in
the United States with ulterior motives and in essence an attempt
to stir up anti-China feelings and divert people's attention.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said at a regular press conference that some Americans are
sticking to the Cold War thinking and are making a great effort to
dream up stories about China's spying on U.S. nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
"Their despicable attempt is doomed to fail," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Inn Cozy Home For Qomolangma Climbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The inn has no luxury rooms and no
attentive maids, but many Chinese and foreign mountain climbers
think it's great before or after climbing Mt. Qomolangma.
</P>
<P>
The Hahu Inn, a small structure with 23 sparse rooms built out
of earth, in Dingri County in Tibet is well-known among
international mountaineers and people can easily locate the tiny
inn alongside the Sino-Nepalese Road.
</P>
<P>
Nema, the hostess, is always there, busy pouring hot butter-tea
into the cups of guests who are discussing their experience on the
Himalayan peak or in other parts of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
May and June are the high season for mountaineering in the area,
Nema says. The inn is more than 100 kilometers from Mount
Qomolangma. Her family were farmers who opened the tiny guesthouse
nine years ago and she became the manager when her son died. The
family of three now operate it.
</P>
<P>
"I've got used to this kind of life with many guests around,
talking and laughing," she says, "and I feel uneasy and lonely
during winter days when the visitors are scarce." Photos taken by
the climbers are the main decoration in the rooms.
</P>
<P>
Nema says that all guests, no matter where they come from, need
a clean toilet, so Hahu's toilet is the most beautiful place at
the inn.
</P>
<P>
The inn offers Tibetan dishes, or, if the guests are not
accustomed to Tibetan flavors, they can get instant noodles and
mineral water.
</P>
<P>
To many guests' surprise, Nema only charges 10 yuan per night
per person, no matter where they're from.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, Cambodia Agree to Solve Border Issues Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Cambodia have agreed to
finalize all outstanding border problems before the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This was reached during the talks between Vietnamese leaders
and visiting Cambodian parliamentary speaker Prince Norodom
Ranariddh who is on an official visit to Vietnam at the invitation
of his Vietnamese counterpart Nong Duc Manh, according to reports
of the local press on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and Cambodia share a common border of about 1,130 km.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai told Ranariddh at a
separate meeting that Cambodia and Vietnam should actively settle
border problems before the 21st century to have a border of peace
and friendship for the younger generations of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Khai asked Ranariddh in his capacity as parliamentary speaker
to facilitate conditions for Vietnamese residents in Cambodia to
live and work in line with Cambodian law as Cambodians enjoy.
</P>
<P>
Khai also told Ranariddh that Vietnam wanted to resume and
develop trade with Cambodia and had nearly completed drawing up a
program on trade cooperation with Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh expressed his thanks to Khai for their support for
Cambodia in becoming an ASEAN member.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the implementation of the agreements signed
between the two countries during Prime Minister Hun Sen's visit to
Vietnam last year, and agreed with an acceleration of negotiations
to reach a border agreement between the two countries before the
new century.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh held talks with Chairman of Vietnam's National
Assembly Nong Duc Manh on Tuesday morning and was also received by
Party General Secretary Le Kha Phieu and President Tran Duc Luong
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He told Phieu that the Cambodian people were eagerly waiting
for the upcoming visit by Phieu and hoped that the visit would
contribute to the strengthening of solidarity, friendship and
comprehensive cooperation.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom's Monopoly Being Challenged (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China Telecom will soon find
stronger competition in telecommunications and my risk losing its
monopoly as more competitors enter the market.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways has sent a strong challenge to China
Telecom. The ministry already has a complete nationwide
telecommunications network, second only to China Telecom,
consisting of 120,000 kilometers of telecommunications lines, 66,
000 kilometers of long-distance telecommunications lines, and 4,
593 kilometers of digital microwave lines.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry officials, they are planning to establish
a large telecommunications company that will be able to do exactly
what China Telecom does, over these existing networks and
preparations are underway for the "China Railway
Telecommunications and Information Group", with the Ministry and
its administrative bureaus as shareholders.
</P>
<P>
"We have no problems in getting permission and a license from
the State Council, and once approved, the company can provide
comprehensive telecommunications services within 6 to 8 months,
after having improved its networks," says Peng Peng, a ministry
official.

Peng is in charge of preparations work and says that
telecommunication services will become a pillar of the state-owned
railroad industries.
</P>
<P>
He attended the "China Telecommunications Development Forum" in
Beijing on May 15, which was sponsored by the State Development
Commission, to discuss reforms of networks operated by the
railways and how to give them a commercial function.
</P>
<P>
He says that officials agreed with a proposal on how to go
about this at a recent meeting, but that the switchboards on the
railroad network have a capacity of only 1.5 million lines, or one
percent of China Telecom's capacity.
</P>
<P>
But, their switchboards can be increased more than 10-fold.
</P>
<P>
China has only three telecommunications companies -- China
Telecom and the smaller China Unicom and China Jitong, which have
to pay the big brother for the use of its telecommunications
networks.
</P>
<P>
China's railways provide channels for China Unicom's GSM (
global system of mobile phone) system, which is currently the
second largest telecommunications service provider in China.
</P>
<P>
China Jitong is also doing business via the railroad
telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
Market analyst say that money and know-how will not be a big
problem for China's railroad sector to expand telecommunications
quickly and that they can easily become the second largest player
in China's telecommunications business.

The Ministry of Information Industry is also drafting its "
Telecommunications Administration Regulations" and many other
telecommunications networks that were previously used only for
specific purposes will be encouraged to move into commercial areas.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the State Administration of Radio, Film and
Television is making preparations for possible telecommunications
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The cables owned by Beijing cable television departments have
been used for data exchanges and for several internal ministry
networks under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In April, 1999, the administration announced a plan to
establish the "China Cable Television Networks Corporation", which
is expected to get involved in telecommunications rather than just
the cable business.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission also approved the
China Express Networking Demonstration Project in April, 1999,
which will become another major telecommunications company. It is
jointly funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ministry of
Railways, State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, and
Shanghai's Municipal Government.
</P>
<P>
The project will provide basic telecommunications services that
are integrated into existing wide-band optical fiber networks
operated by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television
and Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
The project uses network technology to provide telephone
services, on-line services, and multimedia data transmission.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A business forum of Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (CCI) of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) opened here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day business forum is held in conjunction with the 56th
Council Meeting of the ASEAN CCI which was inaugurated Tuesday.
The council meeting is discussing ways and means to overcome the
current economic crisis and to face challenges of the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister of Commerce Major-General Kyaw Than said in
his inaugural address that the world economy has passed through
two phases of development in the last 50 years, warning that it is
now entering the third phase of globalized economy.
</P>
<P>
Globalization, which calls for greater integration and
interlocking economic relationships among national economies and
is a natural outgrowth of technological advances in
communications, transport and access to information, has become an
irreversible process, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This interconnected economy is transforming the world in more
fundamental ways than is implied by the globalization of goods and
services," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that there are signs of adding a new dimension
to the integration process with the world approaching the end of
the 1990s, adding that rapid advances in digital technologies and
communications networks are creating the possibility of borderless
economy in key sectors.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for further deepening the integration and
cooperation within ASEAN, both in public and private sectors not
just to face the challenges of the borderless globalized economy
only, but also to make best use of the business and investment
opportunities arising out of it in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The forum highlights promotion of foreign direct investment in
ASEAN countries, investment potentials and opportunities in
Myanmar, small and medium enterprises development in Myanmar and
ASEAN region, and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
There are eight ASEAN CCI member nations -- Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar joined the ASEAN CCI in October 1997 after it became an
ASEAN member earlier in July that year.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Experts Play Active Role In Chinese Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 80,000 foreign experts
come to work in China every year in all kinds of jobs in industry,
agriculture, transportation, finance, medicine, and tourism,
according to a State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs
official.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 740,000 foreign experts in all from more than 50
countries and regions have worked in China since the late 1970s,
according to Luo Weilin, who is in charge of the administration's
Economy and Technology Department.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has done its best to provide them with
favorable living and working conditions and to protect their
rights in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Their technology and expertise have brought good results, Luo
said. One Japanese expert who is above 80, for example, has helped
save work and improve rice yields in northern China by 10 to 20
percent with growing techniques he introduced a decade ago. The
technique is now being used all over northern China and even in
some southern areas.
</P>
<P>
To honor those outstanding experts, China set up the Friendship
Award in the early 1990s. About 40 experts get the award every
year and 395 in all have received it, according to Luo.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The government of Xi'an, one of
China's imperial capitals, recently announced a protection list of
600 old trees, most of them rare species.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two are more than 1,000 years old and date back to the
Tang (618-907) or even the Han (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
A group of botanists, headed by Tian Wenjia, took 10 years to
complete a thorough study of the trees and have set up files that
contain the names, ages, and serial number of each tree and they
have put fences around them and lightning rods on them.
</P>
<P>
According to a city regulation, no one can cut or move them at
will and construction projects will have to find ways to avoid
damaging them.
</P>
<P>
Tian says that the protected trees are valuable for plant
studies, afforestation, environmental protection, and history and
culture.

<HEADLINE> Warmer Weather Drawing Tourists To Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Tourists are coming to China's Tibet
Autonomous Region in larger numbers and earlier than usual because
of its warmer weather and better transportation service and
facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to local analysts, average temperatures on the
plateau have been up half a degree centigrade annually and in 1998
hit a record high of 9 degrees, as a result of which, plants are
turning green earlier and the amount of oxygen in the air is
increasing. The peak tourism period used to run from May to
September, but it now starts in April and ends in November.
</P>
<P>
The length of roads is up to 22,400 kilometers. They link all 7
cities and 73 counties in Tibet and go to the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, and Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has 47 travel agencies and 77 hotels that can accommodate
foreigners, with over 8,000 beds. The Regional Tourism
Administration also has offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, last year, Tibet had over 390,
000 tourists, 92,000 of them from overseas, the largest number of
tourists the region has seen since tourism began here 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists went up by 60 percent in the first
quarter of this year, from the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Struggles at French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- World number two Pete Sampras on
Tuesday struggled five sets on center court to survive little-
known Costa Rican Juan Antonio Marin in a French Open first round
match.
</P>
<P>
The American second seed, chasing the only Grand Slam to elude
him, won 6-7, 6-4, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4 in four hours and 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who went out in the second round last year to
Paraguay's Ramon Delgado, had mostly himself to blame. In a match
peppered with unforced errors and inaccuracies, Sampras looked
rusty in his first major tournament of the season after missing
the Australian Open in January.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other action, Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten, a
potential quarter-final opponent of Sampras, went past Spain's
Galo Blanco with a comfortable 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Pat Rafter of Australian came back from one set down
to crush Swiss Roger Federer 5-7, 6-3, 6-0, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Last year's losing finalist Alex Corretja, fellow-Spaniard
Felix Mantilla and Sweden's Thomas Enqvist were the other seeds in
action who made it easily into the next round.
</P>
<P>
In the women's tournament, former French Open champions Steffi
Graf of Germany and American Monica Seles both advanced to the
second round with easy victories.
</P>
<P>
Graf, back in Paris after a one-year break through injury, beat
Bulgarian Magdalena Maleeva 6-2, 6-0 while Seles, a three times
winner between 1990 and 1992, dismissed China's Fang Li 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Local favorite Mary Pierce, a losing finalist in 1994, was also
impressive in her 6-4, 6-3 win over South African Joannette Kruger.
</P>
<P>
American Jennifer Capriati, the youngest semifinalist of a
Grand Slam tournament in Paris in 1990 aged just 14, won her first
match in six years at Roland Garros against Virginia Ruano Pascual
6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Seeded second Davenport also had an easy first round, sweeping
past fellow-American Jane Chi 6-3, 6-1.

<HEADLINE> China Protecting Ecology Environment Along Major Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China has a number of environmental
and ecological projects on the middle and upper reaches of the
Yangtze and Zhujiang rivers to help sustained social and economic
development in the areas.
</P>
<P>
A third of China's population and 40 percent of its industries
and agricultural production are in the two river basins. To
maintain the ecological balance on the upper and middle reaches is
important to the development along the lower reaches, where much
of the country's economic power is found in the city of Shanghai
and in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the central government began the first phase of the
Yangtze River Protective Forest Project and since then, over 763
million yuan has been spent on 34.88 million hectares of forests.
In 1996, a similar project was begun along the Zhujiang River.
</P>
<P>
To further stop soil erosion, the central government has issued
a ruling on turning mountainside fields with a slope of 25 degrees
or greater, back into forests.
</P>
<P>
Last October, governments in the south moved to ban the logging
of natural forests and some provincial and ethnic autonomous
region officials are expected to meet next month to discuss
further cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Poland Sees Foreign Trade Shrinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Poland's foreign trade fell in the
first quarter of the year with exports dropping to 6.5 billion U.S.
dollars, down by 8.2 percent from the same period last year, while
imports were down by 6.5 percent to 10.4 billion dollars, the
General Statistics Bureau said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's total foreign trade deficits in the first quarter
of the year were 3.9 billion dollars, as compared with 4.1 billion
dollars during the same period last year, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The Polish News Agency, however, cited preliminary statistics
by the Central Bank as saying that foreign trade deficits in the
first quarter of 1999 were only 2.9 billion dollars while those of
the same period last year were 3.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The discrepancies stem from the different statistical materials
used by the two organizations. The Central Bank based its
statistics on transferred accounts figures, while the General
Statistics Bureau based its calculations on registered materials
at customs.
</P>
<P>
The statistics authority also said that Poland's current
accounts income deficits rose sharply from 488 million dollars in
February to 844 million dollars in March. The balance of payments
deficits in the first quarter amounted to 2.2 billion dollars
while those at the same period last year were two billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Reports here attributed the worsening foreign trade situation
to its shrinking trade volume with Russia, which has disappeared
from the list of Poland's top 10 trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Poland's exports to Western industrial nations in the first
quarter of the year increased by two percent as compared with that
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The drastic contraction in foreign trade has triggered the fear
that it could lead to a further drop in the country's economic
growth rate. The Polish government has already lowered its gross
domestic product growth target from its originally planned 5.1
percent to 3.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> First Batch of 201 Seats Declared in Nepal Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of 201 seats in
the 205-member House of Representatives of Nepal have been
declared by Wednesday. Two breakaway factions suffered a
humiliating rout.
</P>
<P>
The elections, the third in the kingdom since the multi-party
system was restored in 1990, were held on May 3 and May 17.
</P>
<P>
As in the past two elections, the Nepali Congress and the
Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML)
remain the two dominant powers in national politics. The Nepali
Congress clinches 110 seats while the CPN-UML bags 68, the
state-run radio said.
</P>
<P>
The former is prepared to form its majority government while
the latter has expressed its commitment to perform its role as a
constructive opposition in the house.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Party (RPP) comes third with 11, the
Nepal Sadbhavana Party and the National People's Front 5 each, and
the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party and the United People's Front
1 each, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML) and the
RPP (Chand), which broke away from the CPN-UML and the RPP
respectively early last year, fail to win even a single seat.
</P>
<P>
And their top leaders, including CPN-ML President Sahana
Pradhan, General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam, RPP (Chand) President
Rajeswor Devkota and parliamentary leader and three-time prime
minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, all lost.
</P>
<P>
But Gautam has a chance in the No. 1 constituency of Kathmandu,
where elections were rescheduled for June 8 with the capital's No.
3 constituency due to the death of CPN-UML candidate Man Mohan
Adhikari.
</P>
<P>
Elections in the No. 5 constituency of Siraha district and the
No. 3 constituency of Sunsari district were refixed for June 23
and June 26 respectively due to the death of candidates.
</P>
<P>
The elections in the four constituencies will produce the
remaining four seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
Twelve women were elected and 10 of them are new faces. But
none of the 619 independents won.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Association Told to Evaluate Its Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The losing Indonesian badminton
team returned here on Tuesday from the Sudirman Cup and the World
Championships in Denmark along with leader of the National Sports
Council (KONI) promptly calling for some serious soul-searching
over the failure.
</P>
<P>
"Take a lesson from this failure and evaluate everything that
needs improvement," KONI chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar said after
receiving the badminton contingent at the airport here.
</P>
<P>
In a simple ceremony to mark the athletes' homecoming, Wismoyo
and the Indonesian Badminton Association (PBSI) executive chairman
Karsono placed garlands of flowers around the necks of deputy team
manager and head coach Christian Hadinata and official Hadi Nazri.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo also told the shuttlers not to lose spirit even though
they failed to bring back the Sudirman Cup and earn a title in the
World Championships.
</P>
<P>
The failure, he said, should become the biggest motivation for
the shuttlers to improve their training.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is our attitude toward the failure.
We shouldn't drown in deep disappointment," Wismoyo was quoted by
The Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has a formidable record in world badminton, but the
squad did not look to be so promising this year because they
failed even before the finals.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which were deprived of the country's number one
female player Mia Audina, were beaten by Denmark in the semifinals
of the Sudirman Cup and neither player was able to get into the
semifinals of the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
PBSI blamed its failure on the short period of intensive
training and a number of injuries which plagued the team.
</P>
<P>
Christian pointed out that the performance of Indonesia's
shuttlers was declining. He admitted that he had ignored the
progress made by many countries, which blurred his analysis on
their strengths.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to find a better way to groom shuttlers for the
Thomas and Uber Cups and the Olympic Games next year.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, mixed double player Ricky Subagja said his
team had tried in both championships but fortune was apparently
not on their side.
</P>
<P>
"We did not lose effortlessly. We fought our best, but maybe we
are not lucky," said Ricky.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to try his best in following events, such as the 20th
Southeast Asian Games in Brunei Darussalam in August and the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan to Quit Border Treaty with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan is to pull out of a
treaty with Russia later this year on the joint protection of the
Central Asian republic's southern border with Iran and Afghanistan,
said a report reaching here Tuesday from Ashgabat, capital of
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed between Turkmenistan and Russia in
December 1993. Under the treaty, any side which wants to leave the
treaty is required to present a note to the other side six months
in advance. Turkmenistan's Foreign Ministry confirmed it has
already submitted the note to Russia, saying it plans to quit the
treaty on November 19.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Konovalov, head of the Russian border guards in
Turkmenistan, said Turkmenistan's decision was "reasonable,"
because "the Turkman border service has been fully formed and is
capable of guarding the border without Russia's help."
</P>
<P>
Under the 1993 treaty, some 300 Russian soldiers, largely
officers, are posted in the former Soviet republic. Most of the
soldiers serving in Russian units are from the local population,
but commanded by Moscow.

<HEADLINE> China's Worst Erosion Being Put Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Bijie Prefecture in southwest
China's Guizhou Province was once the worst eroded area in China,
but it has brought the serious erosion problem under control with
financial assistance from the central government, the United
Nation's World Food Program, and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The 26,800-square-kilometer prefecture is located in the Wumeng
Mountainous area, where, for decades, there was severe soil
erosion that caused catastrophic mud-slides. There were 93 in the
'70s that killed 387 people and over 4,000 head of livestock and
damaged more than 25,000 houses.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, when the government set up a pilot zone to deal with
poverty, the forest coverage in Bijie was as low as 5.8 percent,
compared with 15 percent in 1949. For the past decade, local
people have made a strenuous effort to change the barren lands and
to plant trees and grass, and 1.93 billion yuan has been used for
the purpose, 100 million yuan of that from the UNWFP and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The forest coverage in Bijie is now 18.97 percent and 296,000
hectares of trees and 444,000 hectares of grass have been planted
there.
</P>
<P>
The project has curbed the decades-old soil erosion and has
brought better incomes to villagers who have benefited from
planting economic crops like mushrooms, medicinal herbs, and wild
vegetables.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A film about the life of Liu
Shaoqi, who began to serve as the chairman of the People's
Republic of China in 1959, has been completed by the Changchun
Film Studio in northeast China's Jilin Province and will soon be
seen on the China Central Television Station.
</P>
<P>
The film was made by the Radio, Film and Television
Administration's Center for Programs for Film Satellite Channel
and covers an episode in early 1957, when Liu, who was Vice-
chairman of the Communist Party of China Central Committee at the
time, took a special train from Beijing to visit grassroots units
in the South where he dealt with many practical problems in the
lives of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Liu is played by Guo Fazeng. The film was directed by Sun Yu as
part of the activities for the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shaoqi was born in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, in
November of 1898 and died in November of 1969. He was elected Vice-

<HEADLINE> New Drugs to Treat Arthritis Developed in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- After 9 years' work, Australian
scientists have created a series of drugs to turn off the
inflammatory process that causes tissue and eventual bone
destruction in rheumatoid arthritis and similar diseases.
</P>
<P>
Professor Mark Hogarth, acting director of the Austin Research
Institute, said that it is a platform technology that will pave
the way for the development of drugs to treat allergy and asthma.
</P>
<P>
According to an article published by The Age Wednesday,
Australian scientists have discovered the structure of the Fc
receptor, part of a family of receptors, that plays a crucial role
in the inflammatory process.
</P>
<P>
The Fc receptor acts as a "lock", preventing the release of
inflammatory cells unless they are needed to fight infection.
People with auto-immune diseases have aberrant antibodies which
open the Fc receptor lock, unleashing continuous inflammatory
destruction of tissue.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hogarth said that by knowing the shape of this lock,
they were designing drugs specifically to "plug up" the key hole
of the lock to prevent it being activated.
</P>
<P>
The drugs are being tested in the laboratory and should be
ready for clinical trials in two to three years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Oil Giant Decreasing Production Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Daqing Oilfield, China's largest,
in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, has decided to lower
production quotas by 1.2 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
While cutting quotas, the oilfield will increase efforts to use
natural gas and developing more diverse operations. Sources say
the field will produce 54.5 million tons of crude this year, 500,
000 tons more than the state plan calls for.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield produced 55.7 million tons of oil in 1998 and
local officials say that the adjustment was a strategic step to
improve efficiency and to deal with the gradually shrinking oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Daqing expects profits of 11.5 billion yuan in 1999 in spite of
the cut and this will be a rise of 2.87 billion yuan from last
year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Authorities say they believe that the cut will not have a
negative impact on China's strategy of stabilizing oil production
in eastern areas and exploring for more oil reserves in western
areas, but will provide more job opportunities for unemployed
people by building substitute industries and a more diverse
economy.
</P>
<P>
Daqing produces 40 percent of China's continental oil and has
produced 1.5 billion tons of crude since it opened 39 years ago.
It has paid 211.9 billion yuan in taxes.
</P>
<P>
In a similar move, the Liaohe Oilfield and Dagang Oilfield will
also reduce oil production quotas this year.

<HEADLINE> Sperm Quality Drops Because of Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The sperm quality of Chinese men
has dropped considerably over the past decade and a half,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The quality declined 10 percent in the 16 years from 1981 to
1996, a recent survey result shows.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 healthy Chinese men participated in the
investigation. Three indicators, namely the quantity of sperm
cells, the amount of sperm and the number of living sperm cells,
were analyzed.
</P>
<P>
Findings show that the three indicators have dropped 10.3
percent, 18.6 percent and 10.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The survey was recently conducted by a scientific research
institute under the State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Men from 39 cities and counties across China, including Beijing,
Shanghai and Tianjin, took part in the survey.
</P>
<P>
The areas with a higher level of industrialization recorded a
larger drop in the three indicators.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating environmental condition is to be blamed for
the plunge in sperm quality, researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Boxing Authority Won't Block Tyson's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Nevada boxing officials said
Tuesday they won't do anything to block Mike Tyson's return to the
ring after the former heavyweight champion's early release from a
Maryland jail yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that Tyson could make his comeback fight as
early as August 21, with a possible bout in Las Vegas against the
likes of Axel Schulz or Brian Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
"August 21 is certainly a date we're looking at," said Larkin,
who runs boxing for the Showtime network. "Hopefully in the next
couple of days we'll have something concrete."
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that he has a license," said James Nave, vice
chairman of the Nevada Athletic Commission. "I don't see the need
for a hearing."
</P>
<P>
Larkin said: "We all agreed that while Mike Tyson was in jail,
we wouldn't make any plans for his fights. Now, he's been out only
24 hours and we just haven't gotten to that point yet. But we're
going to start right now."
</P>
<P>
Tyson had his last fight on January 16 with a fifth round
knockout of Francois Botha. Tyson remains one of the biggest pay-
per-view attractions in the United States.

WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Sacramento Kings vice president
Geoff Petrie, who built a team that made the playoffs for just the
second time in 13 years and threw a scare into the Utah Jazz in
the first round, today was named the 1998-99 NBA Executive of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
Sacramento earned the sixth playoff spot in the Western

Petire, who is in charge of the coaching and scouting staffs,
team negotiations and player acquisitions, made several bold
offseason moves to improve the team.

Webber, Williams and Rick Adelman, who was hired as coach in
September, led the Kings into the postseason for the first time
since 1996. They extended the two-time defending Western

<HEADLINE> Jazz Try to Stay Alive Against Blazers in Western Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- When the season began, the Utah
Jazz felt it was their time to win the NBA championship. But
tonight is the crucial time for the two-time Western Conference
champions, who must beat the Portland Trail Blazers or head home
for the summer.
</P>
<P>
Utah trails the best-of-seven semifinal series, 3-1, has lost
three straight after a victory in Game One and is on the verge of
its earliest playoff exit since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz advanced to the NBA Finals in each of the previous two
seasons, losing to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls both times.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz-Blazers encounter is the only conference semifinal
series yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
Utah, which many people considered the favorite to win the NBA
title after Jordan's retirement, appears to have met its match in
an athletic and deep Portland squad.
</P>
<P>
Isaiah Rider scored seven of his 24 points in the final 30
seconds on Sunday as the Blazers continued to perform like playoff
veterans down the stretch while the Jazz have faltered. Portland's
three victories in the series have come by an average of just six
points.
</P>
<P>
If the Jazz can remain alive, Game Six of the series would be
Thursday night in Portland.

<HEADLINE> Decoding Message Of 300 Year-Old Tibetan Music Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A Tibetan scholar has been able to
interpret a collection of 300 classical Tibetan musical works that
were played by imperial musicians 300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Gengduipeijie, 46, an associate professor in the Art Department
at Tibet University, started his work on decoding the classical
book, which is entitled "Joyful and Bright Festive Banquet".
</P>
<P>
This is the only imperial Tibetan music book known, according
to the Tibetan scholar. The works include preludes, dance tunes,
light music, instrumental music, and epilogues, he explains and
says he is going to put the decoded musical works in computer
files or on a CD.
</P>
<P>
Cebai Jogma, a history teacher at a middle school in Lhasa, the
capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, says that the musical
works are mostly related to classical stories and religious
matters and that many are cheerful enough that they are a must on
festive occasions.
</P>
<P>
The musical works have been recorded and broadcast by Tibet TV
and some Tibetan musicians are planning on playing the pieces
abroad.
</P>
<P>
In 1688, the Tibetan local government summoned a large group of
Tibetan musicians to work on the musical collection, according to
the teacher.

ZHENGZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A 110-cm giant salamander
weighing 21.5-kg has been found in the capital of China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The huge amphibian was discovered two months ago by a local
farmer at a market in Xishan County. To protect the rare animal,
Sun Jizhang, the farmer, bought it for the princely sum of 30,000
yuan (3,610 U.S. dollars) and took it home.
</P>
<P>
The timid, gray animal has four small flippers, Sun said, and
sometimes produces a baby-like cry at night.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiantang, the deputy-director of the city's zoo, says that
the giant salamander is on the list of animals that have state
protection. A salamander of this size is rarely seen in China, he

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Graduates will no longer specialize
in the study of specific aspects of law - Chinese law schools are
now trying to bring up a new generation of legal practitioners
with a broader understanding of the law in general and a better
grasp of analytical argument, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
"Undergraduate education should help train all-round legal
personnel with a certain depth of knowledge of particular laws,"
the paper quotes Zhao Xianglin, vice-president of China University
of Political Science and Law (CUPL) as saying during an
international conference on legal education for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a major reform of the curricula of law schools in China last
year, all specialties were abolished with the result that every
student had to study basic courses for all major branches of law,
the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The reform also means more emphasis will be put on practical
programs instead of the former concentration on book knowledge to
enable students to get hands-on experience in the profession.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, hosted by CUPL, which began yesterday,
is being attended by nearly 90 law school deans and experts on
legal education from 13 countries and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Police Officer Admits Torturing Haitian Immigrant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 25 (Xinhua) -- After devastating testimony from
fellow police officers, a white police officer in New York
admitted Tuesday to the brutal beating and sexual torture of a
black Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
Justin Volpe, 27, pleaded guilty in his federal trial on civil
rights charges.
</P>
<P>
He admitted sodomizing Albert Louima with a wooden stick in a
police station house bathroom and threatening to kill him if he
tells anyone.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say the assault took place after Volpe mistakenly
thought Louima, 32, punched him in a disturbance outside a
Brooklyn's nightclub on August 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Volpe admitted that he realized later that it was not Louima
who had originally hit him in the face.
</P>
<P>
The incident shocked New York and heightened tensions between
the city's minority community and the police department. It even
has drawn national attention over police brutality.
</P>
<P>
Volpe, son of a retired police detective, faces a maximum
sentence of life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
A sentencing date is to be set after the trial of four other
white police officers accused of violating Louima's civil rights.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Embassy: U.S. Report on Espionage Case Is </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The allegations about the
so-called China's "theft" of nuclear weapons and missile secrets
are sheer fabrications out of ulterior political motives, the
Chinese Embassy in the United States said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is an attempt to stir up anti-China feelings and divert
people's attention," the embassy said in a press release. "We
firmly believe that the American public can make its judgement and
reach a fair conclusion."
</P>
<P>
A U.S. House special committee headed by Republican lawmaker
Chris Cox issued a 872-page report Tuesday, asserting that China
obtained secret information on seven nuclear warheads and the
neutron bomb in "two decades of espionage" at U.S. nuclear weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese embassy press release said China has all along
strictly abided by norms governing international relations in its
ties with other countries.
</P>
<P>
"China has developed a limited nuclear capability through
self-reliance. Our nuclear weapon systems are purely for defense
purpose," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said some people in the United States are clinging to Cold
War thinking and trying to derail China-U.S. relations by dreaming
up stories about China's spying. "Their attempts will not succeed
because what they are doing does not serve the interests of the
United States, nor is it in conformity with the common aspiration
of the Chinese and American peoples for friendly relations between
the two countries," the Chinese embassy said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liu Xiaoming, minister of the Chinese Embassy in the
United States, said Tuesday that Cox's report is not new in
tracing China as an enemy.
</P>
<P>
The American public is for better relations with China, Liu
said in a CNN interview.

<HEADLINE> Britain Loses One Olympic Place in Equestrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's three-day eventing team
has lost the Olympic place it won at the World Equestrian Games
after a horse at the event was found to have broken drug rules.
</P>
<P>
Rider Polly Phillips and her mount Coral Cove were disqualified
from last October's games after the horse was found to have
breached prohibited substances regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Tuesday, the Judicial Committee
of the International Equestrian Federation ruling has cost the
British team the bronze medal, and the Olympic place that went
with it.
</P>
<P>
The horse, which finished seventh individually, had higher than
permitted amounts of salicylic acid in its body.
</P>
<P>
The committee rejected evidence put forward by Ms Phillips
about the amount of the substance found in the horse.
</P>
<P>
But it did agree that there was no deliberate attempt by the
rider to affect her horse's performance.
</P>
<P>
Ms Phillips was given a mandatory disqualification, a one-month
suspension and ordered to pay 2,118 pounds towards costs.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal has now been awarded to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Italy has taken the place at the Sydney 2000 Olympics lost by
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The British team still have a chance to qualify, at the
European Championships in Germany in September.
</P>
<P>
Ms Phillips has yet to decide whether to mount an appeal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cox Committee Releases Anti-China Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Congress selected
committee released an anti-China report Tuesday, alleging that
China obtained nuclear secrets through "espionage" from the United
States. The U.S. allegation was entirely denied by China.
</P>
<P>
The 872-page report was drawn up by the Cox Committee, a
special House of Representatives committee headed by
Representative Christopher Cox.
</P>
<P>
The report, released after months of wrangling between the Cox
Committee, the White House and the intelligence agencies, asserted
that China got secret information on seven nuclear warheads and
the neutron bomb in "two decades of espionage" at U.S. nuclear
weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
In response to the U.S. allegation, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said in Beijing on Tuesday that the Cox
report was "merely a fallacy" dreamed up by a few people in the
United States with ulterior motives and in essence an attempt to
stir up anti-China feelings and divert people's attention.
</P>
<P>
Some Americans are sticking to the Cold War mentality and are
making a great effort to dream up stories about "China's spying"
on U.S. nuclear technology, Zhu said at a regular press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The attempt to stir up feelings about "China threat" and
anti-China sentiment is "doomed to fail", he said.
</P>
<P>
Cox, a Republican from California, claimed at a press
conference that the "illegally transmitted information" is useful
for the design and improvement of China's ballistic missiles,
but he said the report should not cast a shadow over China's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"I personally think it is a useful thing for China to be
admitted to the WTO on commercially acceptable terms," Cox said.
</P>
<P>
Following the release of the Cox report, U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Tuesday that his administration will continue the
policy of engagement with China.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe that our continuing engagement with China
has produced benefits for our national security," Clinton said
</P>
<P>
Norm Dicks, a member of the Cox Committee, said that "the
Unites States still possesses overwhelming nuclear superiority
over China with more than 6,000 strategic nuclear warheads,
compared to China's total of about two dozen".
</P>
<P>
"China has for years had nuclear weapons capable of reaching
the United States, but China's nuclear force is retaliatory in
nature. The information obtained from the U.S. will not change
that character," he said.
</P>
<P>
China launched its own satellites and successfully tested its
atomic bomb years before it established diplomatic relations with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Dicks, a Democratic Representative, said the U.S. government
should continue its engagement policy towards China.
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a mistake for us to change our basic
policy towards China, so I hope that we will still continue a
policy of engagement with our eyes open." Dicks said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said some Cold War-minded Americans try to
increase military spending by stiring up "China Threat".
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee reportedly
boosted spending for security and intelligence by 53 million
dollars, a 40 percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Internet Services Revenues Projected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Revenues in the worldwide
Internet services market will earn a compound annual growth rate
of nearly 60 percent in the next five years and pass 78 billion
U.S. dollars by 2003, according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide revenues in the emerging market grew 71 percent in
1998 to reach 7.8 billion U.S. dollars, said U.S. research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
In addition to becoming more prominent, said IDC explaining the
rapid market expansion, Internet projects are becoming more
sophisticated and complex, demanding different skills of
programmers, designers and business strategists. Because companies
are having extreme difficulties locating and hiring employees with
these skills, they are turning to outside service providers to
fulfil their needs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, corporations are under increasing pressure to
execute projects faster and with greater reliability, which is
also causing them to turn to outside providers.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the United States currently spends more than
other regions on Internet services. In 1998, it accounted for more
than half worldwide spending, with 4.6 billion U.S. dollars.
Western Europe is the second-largest market and will maintain a
five-year compound annual growth rate of 67 percent between this
year and 2003.
</P>
<P>
Unlike traditional, established markets where brand, reputation
and years of experience play an important role in the purchasing
decision, in today's Internet services market issues such as
flexibility and creativity are important. Therefore, IDC said, the
emerging market offers a relatively even playing field, allowing
for some of the new breed of Internet service firms to capture
market share, although large, traditional information technology
service firms currently dominate the market.

<HEADLINE> NATO Clears Revised Plan for Kosovo Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Decision-making body of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Tuesday approved a revised
plan for an expanded Kosovo ground troops to police law and order
after Serbs withdraw from the southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The NATO's North Atlantic Council will handed over the new plan
to NATO generals for final authorization. Under the plan, an
estimated 50,000-strong force will be sent into Kosovo from the
Republic of Macedonia once Serb forces withdraw from Kosovo on the
basis of a political agreement between the West and the Republic
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The forces will be mainly formed by European allies with a
sixth of the unit sent by the United States. The original plan,
drawn up last year, called for a NATO-led international force of
about 28,000 to implement a peace agreement between the Yugoslav
government and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
But a NATO spokesman said that the force will have "very sharp
teeth as well as very big teeth if anybody should try to oppose it
carrying out its mandate or to threaten its personnel".
</P>
<P>
"I would imagine the bulk of the operational maneuver
battalions that would constitute the force would come from the
NATO countries," NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters at NATO
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The NATO military authorities are expected to assess the plan
and detail the force's needs before the end of the month, NATO
sources said.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana also said here today that
NATO is determined to stick to its strategy of air strikes against
Yugoslavia as the war entered its third month.
</P>
<P>
There had already been results, and progress towards a
political plan had been made in the past two months, the NATO
chief told a news conference after meeting with Spanish Prime
Minister Aanar.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell sharply
again on Tuesday as investors continued to be concerned with
higher interest rates despite sound economic reports.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 123.58 or 1.2
percent at 10.531.09. The index suffered a loss of 174.61 points
or 1.6 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two separate economic reports boosted the market briefly but
concerns about the interest rates among investors outweighted
optimism sparked by the reports, giving up all the gain of nearly
100 points in early session. The Conference Board reported that
consumer confidence rose nearly one-half a point in May while a
manufacturing group forecast stronger growth in the second half of
this year with little inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
In response to a 0.7 percent increase in consumer price, the
Federal Reserve decided a week ago to leave interest rates
unchanged but leaned to monetary tightening if more inflationary
pressures emerge in the coming months. The move pulled most
indexes down in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 22.25 at 1,284.40 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 72.76 at 2,380.90.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 7-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,941 down, 1,089 up and 534
unchanged.

increase to 44.5 percent as the industry continues to see strong
demand for devices pricing between 200 and 300 U.S. dollars, and
the emergence of new smart phones from major handset suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Listing as a key factor driving the accelerated growth for the
market, IDC said that there is a rising interest for deploying
smart handheld devices in the enterprise to meet the needs of
mobile workforce.
</P>
<P>
From a regional perspective, the United States accounts for 45
percent of worldwide shipments of the devices today. But IDC said
that Western Europe and Japan will quickly become stronger areas
of growth.
</P>
<P>
There is a need for a low-cost integrated wireless device and
value-added service that enables users to conduct voice calls,
send and receive short e-mails and access snippets of Internet
data, IDC said. Regions such as Western Europe and Japan are
poised to be the market leaders due to their wireless
infrastructure and propensity for adopting cellular technology.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone's Peace Talks Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The west African regional bloc ECOWAS
formally launched much-desired Sierra Leone peace talks Tuesday in
Lome, Togo's capital.
</P>
<P>
But representatives of the rebel Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) and the government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah were not
expected to start direct talks until Wednesday because of a delay
in agreeing procedures, according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The two sides went to the negotiation table under great
international pressure. The ECOWAS, the United Nations and the
United States had earlier jointly brokered the ceasefire to be
followed by the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The rebels argued that they should join an interim
power-sharing government, prior to holding general elections in
four year's time, and gaining some key posts in the government.
</P>
<P>
But President Kabbah, who was elected to office in 1996,
insisted that the rebels must transform themselves into a
separate political party first and then take part in the general
elections.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Cancellation of Debts Owed by Poorest Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Italy is actively campaigning for the
complete cancellation of debts owed by the world's poorest
nations, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference here in celebration of the 36th
anniversary of the Organization of African Unity, Dini said that
Italy was working on a set of proposals to be presented to the
world's seven most industrialized nations when they meet in next
June.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on a project to identify the world's poorest
and most indebted nations, particularly in sub-Saharan regions,"
Dini said.
</P>
<P>
"We want their debts to be completely canceled, along with
those of a number of countries in central America," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that such a gesture by "more developed countries"
would be a unique sign of generosity and solidarity which would
"allow these countries to resume their development."
</P>
<P>
He also said that other developing nations which were less poor
but still struggling under the weight of massive debts should have
their burdens lightened.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Italy seized the initiative in this area by
announcing that it would be writing-off 1.56 billion U.S. dollars
in debts owed to it by the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
Dini was optimistic that Italy's proposals would be well
received, saying that "there seems to be substantial agreement on
this position."
</P>
<P>
He also announced that Italy would work to ensure that greater
resources were put aside for boosting collaboration with
developing states and assisting their development.

<HEADLINE> Youth Crime Rises in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN May 25 (Xinhua)--More German children and young people
were involved in crimes last year though the country's overall
crime rate declined, Bonn's Interior Ministry reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Totally 152,774 children aged under 14 were caught by police as
crime suspects in 1998, 6 per cent more than the number in 1997,
the ministry said in its annual crime survey.
</P>
<P>
Most of them were involved in shoplifting, it said.
</P>
<P>
And youths aged 14 to 18 were linked by police with crimes in
3.4 per cent more cases, with 5 per cent more young people aged 18
to 21 being suspected with criminal involvement.
</P>
<P>
Drug-related crimes in Germany also rose by 6 per cent, to
216,682 cases. The ministry attributed it to the rising use of
drugs such as cannabis.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Germany filed 6.5 cases of crimes in 1998, dropping 2
per cent from a year before, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Cases of murder and manslaught dropped by almost 10 per cent in
1998, to 2,383, but the total number of violent crimes fell by
mere 0.1 per cent to 186,306.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry pointed out it was the first decrease in
violent crime in Germany since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The number of car thefts fell by over 18 per cent to 112,717
cases in 1998. The survey said this was partly due to improving
car anti-thefting technology.
</P>
<P>
More crimes were solved by German authorities last year, said
the survey, quoting that some 3.4 million cases were solved by
police, a rate of 52.3 per cent and 1.7 per cent higher than year
1997.
