<HEADLINE> G.P. Koirala Named New PM of Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Girija Prasad Koirala,
president and parliamentary leader of the Nepali Congress (NC),
was appointed as new prime minister of the Himalayan kingdom
Sunday by King Birendra, said a communique issued by the king's
Principal Press Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa resigned last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new appointment was made as no submission was received in
response to the king's call for any member of the lower house of
parliament, who can establish one's majority in the house with the
support of two or more parties, to stake a claim to power, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
A simple majority of 103 votes is needed in the 205-seat House
to form a government.
</P>
<P>
The king had set 6:00 p.m. Sunday as the deadline. But the NC
could not find a ruling partner as the talks between it and other
parties on formation of a coalition government failed over
allocation of portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, in the event that a coalition
government is not available, the king may ask a member of the
largest party in the House to form a government.
</P>
<P>
Coalition politics emerged in the Himalayan kingdom after the
mid-term polls in November 1994 produced a hung parliament where
no single party holds a majority.
</P>
<P>
But the NC, the largest party in the House with 87 MPs, has
decided to form a minority government on its own strength.
</P>
<P>
However, the move was called a "suicidal game" by a minister of
the care-taker government.
</P>
<P>
The minority government led by Man Mohan Adhikari of the
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) three
years ago lasted only 10 months.
</P>
<P>
And as the general elections are due by November 1999, the
scramble for power is expected to become more tense.
</P>
<P>
Surya Bahadur Thapa resigned to make way for the NC, one of his
ruling partners, to head a new government under an agreement he
had reached before he took office last October.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Dalian Wanda

</P>
<P>
Hans Eklund of Sweden scored the sole goal of the match with a

<HEADLINE> China Pledges to Help Indonesia Overcome Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China Sunday expressed sympathy
for the Indonesian people over the current monetary crisis in the
country and pledged efforts to help overcome their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan voiced the
sympathy during a meeting here with his Indonesian counterpart Ali
Alatas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after the three-hour
meeting, Tang said China will soon provide medicine and food
assistance worth 3 million U.S. dollars to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the Indonesian government will receive a 200
million U.S. dollars export credit facility offered by the Chinese
government for a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both sides also agreed to expand bilateral
economic cooperation through barter trade and other trade forms.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the assistance from China is outside the framework
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aid package worth 43
billion U.S. dollar to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, Indonesia, along with other Southeast
Asian countries, has been badly hit by the monetary crisis. The
Indonesian rupiah (national currency) has lost more than 70
percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Indonesia has been faced with spiralling
inflation, growing unemployment and other serious economic and
social problems.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who arrived here Saturday for a three-day working visit,
said China believed that Indonesia will overcome its current
difficulties under the leadership of President Soeharto and with
help from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also exchanged views on bilateral, regional
and international issues of common concern, and reached consensus
on many important issues.
</P>
<P>
Tang said he will meet with Soeharto on Monday and pass an
important letter from Chinese President Jiang Zemin on to the
Indonesian president.
</P>
<P>
Tang and his party are scheduled to leave here Monday
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, Syria to Coordinate Stances on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Transportation Minister
Umar Miskawi said on Sunday that Lebanese and Syrian leaders will
coordinate stances on the Israeli offer to withdraw from south
Lebanon, the Voice of Arab Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese-Syrian summit comes within the context of
coordination vis-a-vis Israel's recent offer on conditional
implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution
425," Miskawi told the Cairo-based Arabic-language radio.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and his Lebanese counterpart
Elias Hrawi will meet on Monday in Syria's Latakia to scrutinize
the Israeli proposal.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to accept the U.N. resolution 425,
which demands an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
But it meanwhile insisted that security arrangements for border
areas be worked out with Lebanese government before any pullout
can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which agree to coordinate their positions on
all key issues, have rejected Israel's offer, insisting that
Israel withdraw unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
"This refusal does not contradict Lebanese endeavor to achieve
peace and stability in the region," Miskawi told. He called on the
United States to seriously consider Lebanon's clear-cut attitude.
</P>
<P>
Beirut was asked by the U.S. to thoroughly study the Israeli
offer. On Friday, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz received
a message to this effect from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
According to the Egyptian Al Ahram daily newspaper, Albright in
the message stressed that Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai "seriously" wished to pull out the forces from south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Round-up:  Carlsen, First Dane to Win ATP Tour Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 12 (Xinhua) -- An expectedly long and grueling
battle came out to end in just 72 minutes -- that was the case for
the men's singles final at the 340,000 U.S. dollars Salem Open
Hong Kong tennis tournament here on Sunday, with Danmark's eighth
seed Kenneth Carlsen outscoring Zimbabwe's Byron Black to take the
title.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, 76th-ranked Carlsen became the first Dane to
win an ATP Tour title. He turned professional in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Left-handed Carlsen, 24, overwhelmed Black 6-2, 6-0 in the
final which was interrupted by rain time and again, from Sunday
afternoon to the evening. The two had split honors in their six
previous meetings.
</P>
<P>
The 1.90-meter-tall Carlsen broke Black's first service game in
the opening set before there came a waiting game for more than
three hours due to the rain.
</P>
<P>
But it was Carlsen's explosive serving and steady baseline play
that worked so well to bring him to the triumph.
</P>
<P>
Black, Zimbabwe's hero who downed U.S. Open champion Pat Rafter
in Zimbabwe's Davis Cup win last week over Australia, felt it hard
to find the consistent double-handed backhand and forehand game
which had helped him to defeat in the final Brazil's French Open
champion Gustavo Kuerten in last October's Marlboro championship
here.
</P>
<P>
Black had been ousted in the first round in both of his
previous appearances in the Salem Open, in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable to become the first Dane to win a title on
the ATP Tour -- I have been waiting for a title for many years and
I am glad I have finally done it," said Carlsen.
</P>
<P>
He owed the victory to his "unbelievable rhythm". "During the
rain break I just read a book and tried to relax - it seemed to
have worked," he added.
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Black, ranked 81st in ATP Tour, had made hard efforts
during the week-long tournament and looked tired and out of shape
in the title clash.
</P>
<P>
Carlsen, a left-hander and the only seed of the tournament to
survive for the final, said the victory was "unbelievable".
</P>
<P>
"I have been waiting to win a title for many years. I'm glad I
have
eventually done it...I had unbelievable rhythm today," he added.
</P>
<P>
Carlsen, who was to celebrate his 25th birthday five days
later, said he had tried to stay focused during a four-hour break
caused by steady rain between the first and second games of the
first set.
</P>
<P>
Reading and some sleep helped him to stay focused. "It worked
well," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Carlsen, who was to celebrate his
25th
birthday five days later, had advanced to the final of the Salem
Open
after three appearances.
</P>
<P>
Later Sunday, Black teamed up with American Alex O'Brien to
beat Neville Godwin from South Africa and Tuomas Ketola of Finland
7-5, 6-1 and won the men's doubles title.

<HEADLINE> Home for Angolan War Orphans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- 10 kilometers east of the
Angola's capital city, on the side of the highway is a courtyard
enclosed by yellow walls. Under the green trees are rows of
houses, clean and peaceful. Here is Palanca Orphans' Home.
</P>
<P>
In order to see how the children are living now, the
correspondent of Xinhua News Agency recently paid a visit to the
orphanage.
</P>
<P>
There are now 220 children aged from six to eighteen living
here. They have come from 12 provinces, including Luanda,
Malanje, Zaire, Kuanza-sul, Moxico, Huambo, Bie and Benguela.
</P>
<P>
The dormitories in which these children live are both spacious
and bright. There are four double-berth beds in each room and
the beddings are orderly arranged. In the yard, several children
are playing merrily.
</P>
<P>
The dining room and the kitchen are just around the corner.
Inside the dining room, tables and chairs are put in good order.
Great attention has been paid to the sanitation in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
According to the coordinator of the center, Antonio Julho, who
accompanied the visiting correspondent, Palanca Orphans' Home was
initiated by some 20 teachers in Luanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the end of 1992, civil war broke out again in Angola after
only one year of ceasefire. The fierce fighting lasted for about
one year, leaving 500,000 dead and more than 70,000 orphaned.
These children who had been deprived of their families in the war
began to wander in the streets with scare food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
In order to help these street children, Palanca Orphans' Home
was soon established with the help of the society and some
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program provides food; Africare, a
non-governmental organization, provides fund for education; while
the Angolan state-owned power plants and water works provide
electricity and water, all free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Julho said that the authorities of the Home had tried their
best to provide enough food for children. Now, three meals with
adequate nourishment are guaranteed. Rice, flour, beans, meat,
fish, chicken, butter, milk are among the staples in Palanca.
</P>
<P>
Besides the general courses provided in ordinary elementary
schools, Palanca also arranges some special classes for children
living there, teaching them skills of carpentry, blacksmith,
tailoring and typing. With such vocational education, Palanca
children can master a kind of skill so that they can live by
themselves after they step into the society.
</P>
<P>
Following the guidance of their teachers, children are working
attentively in their practices. Despite the muggy weather,
children are fully devoted to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
One important issue is how to find jobs for the orphans after
they grow up. In 1997 alone, almost 100 orphans found places in
the Angolan armed forces, the national police and other
government sectors, having reliable financial resources. In such
a war-torn country as Angola where unemployment rate is very
high, it can be regarded as a miracle for the orphans to secure
jobs.
</P>
<P>
When Palanca Home first opened, 600 orphans were invited to
live there. But these children who were born and grew in wars
had been used to their free life. Many left, unable to bear the
strict disciplines and schedule at the Home.
</P>
<P>
In order to make these children live here, teachers in Palanca
have drained their brains. They first managed to improve the
diet for the children despite all difficulties. And they also
bought table tennis, footballs and basketballs and organized
sports games. Children in Palanca gradually got accustomed to
the disciplines and timetables they previously could not stand.
</P>
<P>
At first when the Orphans' Home was established, teachers in
Palanca had no pay. They began to receive some subsidies only
after 1996. However, Julho said, they chose to do so in order to
reduce the pains the orphans are suffering and help the country
overcome difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Many orphans are hurt psychologically. Some of them had been
child soldiers themselves and some had seen their parents killed
before their eyes. Wars had broken their hearts.
</P>
<P>
Palanca sent teachers to study psychology at the seminars
lectured by foreign experts. They have greatly relieved the
mental burdens of these war orphans.
</P>
<P>
One child named Antonio with passion told the reporter that he
and his pals love their home in Palanca. While well fed and well
clothed, they can also obtain knowledge there, said Antonio.

<HEADLINE> Profile: New Nepali Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Girija Prasad Koirala,
president and parliamentary leader of the Nepali Congress, was
appointed Sunday by King Birendra as new prime minister of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
For the 73-year-old Koirala, the premiership is nothing new. He
took office in May 1991 as the Himalayan kingdom's first popularly
elected prime minister in 30 years. And his brothers Matrika
Prasad Koirala and Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala were also prime
ministers of Nepal in the 1950s and early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
G.P. Koirala began his political career while working at a jute
mill in Biratnagar of eastern Nepal. He participated in the first
industrial strike held in the mill in 1947.
</P>
<P>
He led the labor movement in Biratnagar after the dissolution
of multi-party system in Nepal in 1960, and in the same year he
was arrested and jailed under the State Offense Act for seven
years. He went on a hunger strike in jail for about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Three years after he was released from jail, G.P. Koirala was
arrested again under the Security Act. Later he exiled himself to
India until 1979.
</P>
<P>
G.P. Koirala held the post of youth leader of the NC for many
years. In 1976, he was elected the party's general secretary at a
party conference held in India.
</P>
<P>
His active involvement in the armed struggle against the
partyless Panchayat system which was in place for three decades
culminated in the people's movement in February 1990 launched by
his party and the communists.
</P>
<P>
The movement forced King Birendra to abolish the Panchayat
system and introduce a multi-party democratic system in the
country.
</P>
<P>
During the first free elections in May 1991, G.P. Koirala was
elected a member of the House of Representatives, and his party
won a clear majority. He assumed the post of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In March 1994, he resigned and recommended mid-term polls after
losing a key vote in parliament. The polls in November 1994
resulted in a hung parliament where no single party held a
majority, which led to the emergence of coalition politics in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
But G.P. Koirala was reelected a member of the lower house of
parliament in the November 1994 elections. And in May 1996, he was
elected president of the NC at the 9th general convention of the
party.
</P>
<P>
The rangy, bespectacled new prime minister believes in "nation,
nationalism and democratic socialism advocated by NC," and
"dedication to duty, firmness in devotion and commitment to
stabilize democracy."
</P>
<P>
He remains single after his wife died many years ago. He has
one daughter.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain, U.S. Urge Iraqi Adherence to Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Emir Sheikh Isa Bin
Sulman al-Khalifa on Sunday discussed with visiting U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson the latest
situations in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
According to Bahrain's official Gulf News Agency (GNA), during
the talks they called on Iraq to continue abiding by the U.N.
resolutions on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the importance of Iraq's compliance with the
agreement it signed in February with the U.N., under which it
agreed to open eight presidential sites, previously "off-limits,"
to a special U.N. team comprising arms experts and senior
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The deal averted an imminent military attack by the U.S. and
Britain in a bid to force Iraqi compliance with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's meeting, Richardson conveyed a letter to the
Bahraini emir from U.S. President Bill Clinton, GNA said. Details
of the letter were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
However, informed sources in Manama said the letter is relevant
to the extension of deployment of 36 U.S. warplanes in the tiny
Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain agreed to a U.S. demand last month to extend the
stationing of the warplanes on its soil for a further 60 days. The
planes have been deployed of Washington's military buildup in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Richardson is on a tour in the region to seek cooperation from
Arab allies in ensuring America's vital strategic interests and in
dealing with Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Bishop Urge Tanzanian Christians to Maintain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Christians in Tanzania
have been urged to maintain the existing harmony and peace, and
avoid unnecessary religious confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during Easter celebrations, Bishop Basil Sambano of
Anglican church, said Christians should stick to their faiths and
ignore provocative preachings by extremists of other religions.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Sambano, who was speaking Sunday in a Easter mass at
Saint Alban Anglican Church in Dar es Salaam, said the negative
preachings against Christianity were being made by a few
individuals who seemed to have got fed with the existing peace
tranquility in the country.
</P>
<P>
The bishop's remarks came at a time when the government has
urged Moslem extremists to give up blasphemous preachings against
other religions and stop causing new. The police have arrested
hundreds of people in three riots since Mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Christians and other peace-loving people in the community
should strive to protect and maintain the harmonious environment
for the betterment of the mankind and the socio-economic
development of the nation, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Maintenance of peace is an easy job which everyone in the
country has a role to play, but restoration of a disrupted peace
is a very difficult task, he added.
</P>
<P>
He further cautioned the Tanzania community to follow
religious preachings and do away with vices such as banditry,
violence of any kind, rape, sodomy and others which are opposed
by all religions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of city residents thronged into various
churches Sunday, participating in a wide range of activities,
such as choir festivals, baptism ceremonies, holy communion, and
marriage blessings.
</P>
<P>
Despite heavy rains, prayers which ended at dawn hours, were
conducted in peace and calm.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Muslim Solidarity to Contain Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday called on Islamic
countries to denounce, in one voice, any military cooperation with
Israel in order to contain the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi made the call on the second
anniversary of Israeli air raid on a south Lebanon refugee camp in
which many civilians were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the "terrible" crime committed by Israel against
the defenseless civilians under the protection of the United
Nations indicated that Israel does not have the slightest regards
for humanitarian and international norms.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for bomb attacks by Islamic resistance forces,
Israeli warplanes and helicopters bombed a U.N. refugee camp in
south Lebanon on April 18, 1996, killing 106 people and wounding
over 120 others.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the Islamic states should try to contain
the Israeli regime through denouncing any military cooperation
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iran regards Israel as the major threat in the Middle East,
particularly to the Islamic countries, and frequently calls for
joint efforts against the Jewish state and urges the international
community to check Israel's nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
Israel, on the other hand, accuses Iran of seeking weapons of
mass destruction and sponsoring terrorism. Recent Israeli reports
claimed that Iran has acquired four nuclear warheads.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Turkey-Israel Military Axis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Greece Sunday criticized Turkey
and Israel for the creation of a military-economic axis, saying
this would not contribute to the security in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki
Sunday, Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos warned that it
would be wise for one who looks at the economic interests alone to
keep in mind that a collaboration between two countries through
which the ability was provided for one to develop technologically
advanced military armament, such as Turkey was attempting through
its cooperation with Israel, would create problems with the other
peoples.
</P>
<P>
When the bilateral commercial transactions evolved into
relations of military significance, everyone must comprehend that
the rationale of axis in today's strategies lead to the
counter-rallying of all the others, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos said that the security of Turkey or Israel could
not be strengthened except only in the context of the collective
security of the entire region.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Sentence Turkish Ship Captain, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian State Security Court
Sunday sentenced both the owner and captain of a Turkish ship to
15 years in prison for kidnaping and piracy, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Naci Usakli, captain of the Turkish cargo vessel Obo Engin and
Helmi Adelair, its owner, were tried in absentia. It is now known
if and how the sentence will be enforced.
</P>
<P>
On October 23, 1997, the ship defied an Egyptian court order in
connection with its default of 375,000 U.S. dollars in transit
tolls to the Suez Canal Authority.
</P>
<P>
The captain had refused orders to hand over the ship and took
hostage the Egyptian officials who embarked it to make good on a
court order for its seizure. The ship was carrying 40,000 tonnes
of coal from Singapore.
</P>
<P>
According to the eight Egyptians - a court official, two port
police, two lawyers, two shipping agents and a canal official,
they were confined to four cabins when the ship fled back to
Istanbul, the largest port city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
They were threatened to be thrown overboard if they caused
troubles.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling described both the piracy and abduction as
"acts unprecedented" in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expected to Visit Ireland, N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. congressman said Sunday
he believed President Bill Clinton would visit Ireland and
Northern Ireland when he attends the G-7 summit in May to generate
support for the Northern Ireland peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Peter King, a New York Republican member of the House of
Representatives, told the Fox News Sunday television program that
he thought Clinton intended to go.
</P>
<P>
"I think he should definitely go to Belfast and Dublin. I think
he will; that's my understanding from people I've spoken to that
right now his current intention is to go," King said.
</P>
<P>
However, a White House spokesman said no decision had been made
on the visit.
</P>
<P>
Ireland and the British-rule Northern Ireland were to hold
separate referendum on May 22 to decide the fate of the peace deal
announced Friday. A "no" vote in either plebiscite would doom the
delicate compromise proposals.
</P>
<P>
The agreement seeks to end three decades of sectarian strife in
Northern Ireland by altering constitutional arrangements for the
province.
</P>
<P>
George Mitchell, the U.S. mediator for the Northern Ireland
talks, said he hoped the president would visit, but he added that
Clinton was waiting to see what British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern thought best.
</P>
<P>
On May 15, Clinton is visiting Britain to attend the three-day
Birmingham meeting of the Group of Eight, namely the world's seven
major industrialized countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
British media reports said that Clinton might offer millions of
dollars investment in Northern Ireland and provide an economic
incentive for voters to endorse the deal.

<HEADLINE> Protestant Marches in Belfast Ended Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Thousands Protestants held their
traditional parade peacefully in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The march, organized and participated by the Apprentice Boys,
was held to mark their past victories over Roman Catholics and
show their loyalty to the British government.
</P>
<P>
The streets resounded to the sound of drums, pipes and singing
from an array of colorful bands on the first day of the "marching
season", a focus for violence in the past.
</P>
<P>
The march stopped shot of the mainly Catholic Lower Ormeau Road
in south Belfast after a new parades commission had banned the
marchers from proceeding down the street to avoid rioting.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the same parade -- the first contentious event
of the marching season -- led to serious rioting and several dead.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman in Northern Ireland hailed the peaceful
completion of the parade, saying the Protestants has shown "a high
degree of integrity."
</P>
<P>
The march was held three days after the political parties
involved in the Northern Ireland conflict reached a historic peace
agreement which many say would usher in a new era for the divided
province.

<HEADLINE> China Emphasizes Management of Underground Water Resources (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China, one of 13 countries facing
serious water shortages, will formulate a plan later this year
to scientifically develop underground water resources, according
to the Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
Detailed management measures will be adopted in the interim,
according to a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only 290 billion out of China's 870
billion cu.m. underground water resources are available for
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
China has over 3.45 million wells where some 90 billion cubic
meters of underground water reserves are exploited annually, the
third largest underground water user following the United States
and India.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, underground water were exploited in a few large
cities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin. However, the
situation changed dramatically along with rapid economic
development in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The overuse of underground water has created a series of
problems such as lowering of water table and expediting
environmental deterioration, according to Liu Yingqiu, an expert
from the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
She also pointed to equally serious problems such as shortages
and contamination of underground water.
</P>
<P>
Overuse in coastal cities such as Dalian, Qinhuangdao and Yantai
have resulted salt water leeching into underground water tables
and further problems resulting from the increasing salinization of
cultivatable land.

<HEADLINE> Fires Destroy 224,000 Hectares of Forest in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Fires raging out of control in
East Kalimantan province, Indonesia, have destroyed more than
224,000 hectares of forests since the beginning of this year, a
local official said.
</P>
<P>
At least 224,384 hectares of forests in the drought-stricken
province have been destroyed by the fires, local newspapers Monday
quoted Awang Faruk Ishak, head of East Kalimantan's Environmental
Impact Control Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 198,000-hectare Kutai National Park, the province's largest
natural forest park, is one of the hardest hit, with close to 36
percent of cover destroyed as of April 8, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Fires have also swept through 55,463 hectares of forest
concessions, 66,839 hectares of timber estate and close to 3,000
hectares of plantations, Ishak said.
</P>
<P>
He put losses at more than 4.817 trillion rupiah (595 million
U.S. dollars), not counting the cost of environmental and health
damage.
</P>
<P>
Ishak said thousands of fires continued to burn in the province
despite efforts to curb their advance.
</P>
<P>
The lack of rain since the middle of last year has left forest
and ground cover extremely susceptible to fires, he added.
</P>
<P>
Water bombing, artificial rain-making and military support to
local fire-fighters have failed to put out the fires, Ishak said.
</P>
<P>
Fears of a repeat of the haze in Southeast Asia last year, when
smoke from Indonesian fires blanketed much of the region and
caused widespread health problems and transport disruption, were
eased by strong winds helping to dissipate the haze.
</P>
<P>
But the smoke has made thousands ill in East Kalimantan and led
to shortages of food and water in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 300,000 hectares of forests were destroyed
by fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan islands in Indonesia, causing
at least 3 billion dollars of losses to the country.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Asia Financial Turmoil Abates, Global Slowdown Mild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The financial turmoil in Asia
which erupted in mid-1997 has abated since January and the
projected global economic slowdown is mild, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Confidence is gradually recovering during this year and a
moderate growth should be expected next year in the crisis-struck
Asian countries, said IMF in a report called World Economic
Outlook.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the threat to global growth from the crisis in
Asia appears to be limited, the report projected world output
growth in 1998 at just over 3.1 percent and 3.7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
It said that the affected countries have implemented corrective
measures while the international community led by the IMF has
provided financial support for policy programs in Indonesia, Korea
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
While uncertainties have persisted in Indonesia, it is clear
that elsewhere commitments to implement the necessary reforms and
adjustment measures have strengthened substantially, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Markets have partially recovered from their troughs, it
affirmed.
</P>
<P>
"As the needed policies are implemented and external positions
improve, confidence should recover gradually during 1998, paving
the way for a moderate rebound in growth in 1999 and solid
recovery by 2000," it said.
</P>
<P>
The particular severity and importance of financial sector and
other structural weaknesses in the Asian crisis mean that the
necessary corrective measures may take longer to implement than in
crises that can be resolved mainly by macroeconomic adjustment, it
added.
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time the deep declines that have occurred in
currency and financial markets suggest scope for relatively sharp
rebounds as confidence recovers," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that currency and asset values in the countries
struck by the crisis have been left far below levels before the
crisis, the report said considerable uncertainty remains about the
resolution of the crisis and its global repercussions.
</P>
<P>
It is already apparent that the crisis and its likely effects
are more severe than they initially appeared, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It indicated, however, the global outcome will be a slowdown in
economic growth that will be much less pronounced than the
slowdowns of 1974-75, 1980-83, and 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
In the medium term, global economic growth is still projected
to exceed the average rate seen since 1970, reflecting a continued
strengthening of growth in the countries in transition and
maintenance of the relatively strong performance of the developing
world in the early and mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
The economy of the developing countries is expected to grow 4.1
percent this year and 5.3 percent in 1999 while the figures for
the advanced economies will be 2.4 percent and 2.5 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Citing the fact that private foreign financing dries up
together with the large currency depreciations and declines in
asset prices, the report have lowered near-term growth prospects
for Malaysia, the Philippines, and other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the advanced economies, the near-term outlook for Japan
has deteriorated further. The world's second largest economy
expects zero growth this year and is projected at about 1.3
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The IMF urges Japan to take further urgent measures in
structural reforms to bring about an early resumption of growth.
</P>
<P>
In North America and western Europe, economic has been well
sustained and appears likely to remain so in the period ahead,
noted the report.

SINGAPORE, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined in thin
trading on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) fell by 7.14 points to close at 1,586.91
points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the stocks gave up their early gains as buying
fizzled out in directionless trading.
</P>
<P>
There is little impetus to do anything. The only supportive
factor is that interest rates may come down, one dealer with a
foreign brokerage firm said.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 143.65 million units, valued
at 230.81 million Singapore dollars (144.26 million U.S. dollars).
Declines overwhelmed advances by 223 to 98, while 271 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Malaya Resources was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 8.83 million units. It was followed by
UniCorp which had 7.03 million shares traded. Renong was next with
6.16 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 led the gainers of the day as it rose by 40 cents
to finish at 37 Singapore dollars. Bukit Sembawang and OCBC
(Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation) Foreign increased by 30
cents each to end at 13 and 9.1 Singapore dollars respectively.
DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) FR100 was up by 19 cents to
close at 3.1 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, NBT was the biggest loser as it declined by 34
cents to end at 3.04 Singapore dollars. HongFok fell by 21 cents
to close at 1.11 Singapore dollars, while Star Cruise was 19 cents
lower to finish at 1.99 U.S. dollars.

<P>
Xi'an city in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, has recorded
various degrees of subsidence over a 162-sq.km. area, with related
problems directly related to the falling underground.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 percent of China's water supply comes from underground
reserves, with the problems caused by the overuse of underground
water attracting great attention from governments at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that one of the most effective ways to solve the
problems is to strengthen the management of water resources,
especially underground water resources in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
They suggest recycling water for industrial usage, improving
the quality of surface water and building sewage treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
The development of water-saving industries and agriculture
should be encouraged, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has taken the lead in this respect, said Liu, adding
that the municipality has limited its annual exploitation volume of
underground water to 140 million cu.m., or some 25 percent of
the total available capacity.

founding of diplomatic relations 40 years ago. He added that the
two countries have also witnessed the comprehensive development of
friendly and cooperative ties in the fields of politics, the
economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
Li voiced appreciation of Sri Lanka's just stance and support
for China on the issues related to human rights, Taiwan and
Tibet. He said the CPC values its ties with Sri Lankan United
National Party
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the CPC is willing to join efforts with the
United National Party to further develop and enhance friendship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that after the birth of new China, two particular
periods of 20 years are particularly worthy of
summarization. China witnessed a road of many twists and turns
during the first period lasting from 1957 to 1976, with the nation
passing through the disastrous "Cultural Revolution" which brought
the national economy to the verge of collapse, he said, adding
that the second period, from 1978 to the present, has been
characterized by a great improvement of China's comprehensive
national strength, accompanied by significant improvements in
living standards of the Chinese people and profound changes
throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
Li explained that serious mistakes in the CPC's guiding
principles during the first twenty years accounted for disasters
during the period, while success during the second period has
resulted from the Party's adherence to and implementation of a set
of realistic lines, principles and policies suited to national
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe noted that Sri Lanka and China are friendly
countries which have enjoyed friendly exchanges for centuries. He
said Sri Lanka will never forget the aid and support China has
provided.
</P>
<P>
China is a vast country with enormous potential for development
and plays an important role in ensuring peace and stability in
Asia and the world at large, said Wickremesinghe.
</P>
<P>
To develop friendly and cooperative ties with China is the
common principle pursued by all Sri Lankan political parties,
Wickremesinghe said, adding that the United National Party
attaches great importance to exchanges with the CPC and it is
willing to promote the constant development of the relations
between the two countries and their peoples through exchanges and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan delegation arrived in Beijing on Saturday at the
invitation of the CPC
</P>
<P>
The delegation is scheduled to visit Xi'an, Shanghai and
Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ruling Party's Presidential Bet Gets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A major Muslim group in the
southern Philippines has decided to support Speaker of the House
of Representatives Jose de Venecia, the presidential candidate of
the ruling Lakas-NUCD party, in the May 11 general elections.
</P>
<P>
In a manifesto published Monday, the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) said that it endorsed the candidacy of De Venecia
because of his commitment and continuing efforts in bringing peace
to the southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"In the realization of lasting peace and prosperity, we pledge
to support the speaker for his unselfish effort in the
government-MNLF peace agreement," the MNLF said in the manifesto.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto has been submitted to President Fidel Ramos, who
is also chairman of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF and the government signed a permanent peace agreement
in September 1996, ending decades of bloody war between government
troops and MNLF separatists.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao
was established in 1996 and the MNLF has begun to disarm and
disband its more than 10,000-strong armed force.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF said in the manifesto that the peace treaty is not a
guarantee to lasting peace in Mindanao unless the next president
is committed to pursuing the fulfillment of the deal.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia was trailing far behind opposition candidate Vice
President Joseph Estrada in the presidential race, according to a
March public opinion survey conducted by the Social Weather
Stations, a leading independent pollster in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the poll, Estrada garnered a 28 percent approval rate
against 14 percent for De Venecia, who came in second place in a
tie with former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim of the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
Election analysts said De Venecia's supporting rate could
continue to go up given the ruling party's powerful political
machinery and sufficient campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 official presidential candidates will run in the
May 11 general elections during which voters will also elect the
vice president, half of the 24-seat Senate members and all the 217
representatives of the lower house.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is now publishing the
China Containerized Freight Index.
</P>
<P>
According to municipal sources, the freight index will be
highly important for standardizing China's container shipping
market and building the city into an international shipping center.
</P>
<P>
The shipping freight index, widely used on the global shipping
market, reflects fluctuations, supply and demand trends in the
global shipping market and related markets.
</P>
<P>
Xu Lirong, president of the Shanghai Shipping Exchange, said
that the announcement of the China Containerized Freight Index
will provide reliable data for government departments to conduct
macro-controls and for businessmen to make correct decisions.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Port, the largest in China's interior area, has
witnessed unprecedent growth in its container shipping market, and
has maintained an annual growth rate of 25 percent for several
years running.
</P>
<P>
A municipal official noted that the formulation and
announcement of freight index will help boost China's container
shipping market which has been hampered by the lack of of
information and the nonstandard operations.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rupiah strengthened
by 200 points in Monday's trading in a positive response to the
just-signed Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies worked out by Indonesia and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The rupiah closed at 7,650/8,300 to the U.S. dollar in the
inter-bank market, some 200 points up from last Saturday's close
and also against the 8,300/8,700 in last Thursday's trading.
</P>
<P>
"It means that in four days the rupiah has strengthened by
about 1,000 points," a dealer here said.
</P>
<P>
However, several traders said, the rupiah exchange rate against
the dollar is still fluctuating, thus many dollar owners are
waiting for the right time to sell their U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On April 8, Indonesia and the IMF reached an agreement on
economic reforms in the country. Indonesian officials promised to
seriously implement the new accord in exchange for an IMF-led
43-billion-U.S. dollar bailout package.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, most Asian currencies led by the Indonesian
rupiah strengthened on Monday on the back of a firm Japanese yen
and Indonesia's new deal with the IMF, dealers and analysts said.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Monday insisted his nomination of Sergei Kiriyenko for prime
minister would stand despite last week's defeat in the State Duma
(lower house of the parliament).
</P>
<P>
"I will insist on the nomination to the end and I am going to
work constructively (with deputies) given their constructive
work. I don't want political instability in Russia," said the
president before a meeting with Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said that there was no mention of dissolving the
Duma.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, if the Duma rejects president's
nominee three times, it is dissolved and new elections are held.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed hope that Kiriyenko will win the second
round vote in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
He said he was satisfied with the fact that Our Home is Russia
faction led by Alexander Shokhin voted favorably in the first
round, saying there may be more votes from other factions.
</P>
<P>
"I will not have to ponder on further steps," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Duma failed to approve Kiriyenko as prime minister in the
first round vote last Friday and soon after Yeltsin nominated him
again for the second round vote, the date of which has not been
fixed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's largest steel and iron
company today melted 10,000 spindles, symbolizing the large-scale
endeavor to reform its crumbling textile businesses.
</P>
<P>
The melted 10,000 spindles, with the weight of 108 tons, came
from the 25 dismantled spinning machines in Beijing No. 3 Cotton
Mill, a move for Beijing to quickly respond to the call by Premier
Zhu Rongji for a breakthrough in state enterprise reform through
streamlining the country's textile businesses, a section of
industry backbone for decades.
</P>
<P>
"We tried hard to avoid redundant construction at a low level
by strictly limiting the total number of spindles," said Liu
Bingdi, a senior engineer from Beijing Textile Holding Group.
</P>
<P>
A leading textile producer, Beijing has redundant production
capacity in recent years. Many state-owned textile businesses are
in a management and financial abyss against the backdrop of the
market economy.
</P>
<P>
China is determined to greatly reduce current spindles this
year, with 700,000 ones being melted till now. Beijing will reduce
100,000 spindles this year, sources said.

<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build the Grand
National Theater, the nation's largest cross-century cultural
project, in downtown Beijing, the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The state-level theater, covering 120,000 sq.m., will be
constructed at an estimated cost of 3.54 billion yuan (420 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The theater, located on the west side of the Great Hall of the
People, will include four major buildings -- the opera theater,
concert hall, drama theater and a performance center. The theater
will have a capacity of 6,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
The opera theater, with 2,500 seats, will host major
performances by world-famous opera, theater and ballet troupes.

The theater complex will also include a number of cultural and
service facilities, including an art gallery, performance research
institute, art shops, and a fast-food restaurant and cafeteria, as
well as underground parking lots.
</P>
<P>
China formulated the plan to build the national Grand Theater
some 39 years ago, with the project tabled for many years due to a
shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
Construction will begin soon after bids for architectural and
design work are approved. Over 40 companies from China's inland
areas, the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Britain,
Italy, Hong Kong and Taiwan will submit their bids within three
months.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the theater will be completed in four years.

ratification by the State Duma (lower house of the parliament),
the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, which was signed in New York on September 26,

JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian police released
Islamic Jihad leader Abdallah Shami on Monday, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Shami was set freed after he conceded that his remarks about
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) during a sermon were not
appropriate, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
He was detained last Friday after blaming the PNA during a
sermon in a Gaza mosque for the death of Hamas Muhei Eddine
Sharif, chief bomb maker of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas).
</P>
<P>
Sharif was found dead on March 29 in an explosive-rigged car
detonated by a remote control in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has announced results of its investigation that Sharif
was killed by his fellow colleagues in a Hamas internal power
struggle.
</P>
<P>
But Hamas and other radical Islamic groups accused Israel of
assassinating him and the PNA of collaborating with the Jewish
state in the murder.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials, however, have made it clear that the PNA
would not tolerate any doubt about its findings of the incident.

ADDIS ABABA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Roads
Authority said on Monday that 40 percent of roads in the country
need to be rehabilitated, reported the Ethiopian News Agency
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 23,810-kilometer-long roads in the country, only
20 percent is in good condition with 40 percent damaged due to
lack of renovations, the report quoted Zaid Wolde-Gebriel,
Manager of Planning and Program Department of the authority as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Wolde-Gebriel said that the main problems facing the road
sector in Ethiopia are the shortage of highways and the
deteriorating conditions of the existing ones.
</P>
<P>
According to the manager, only 3,656 kilometers of the
highways across the country are asphalt roads, of which more than
half are in bad shape.
</P>
<P>
Less than 50 percent of the 12,113 kilometers of the gravel
roads in the country are said to be in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
Wolde-Gebriel said the the deteriorating quality of the roads
is partly the result of the scanty budget which was allotted by
the previous regime.
</P>
<P>
The recently established road fund has given due attention to
renovating the existing roads along with the construction of new
ones, he added.

FUZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An two-day art auction which ended
today in Xiamen city, in east China's Fujian Province, has
auctioned off 43 percent of the 500 works of art and other items,
at a total price of 1.76 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The percentages of traditional Chinese paintings, porcelain
pieces, and jade items auctioned off stands at 48 percent, 31
percent and 50 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jing, deputy general manager of the Beijing-based Kangrong
Auction Ltd. said that the auction result is not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
He said that although many people have discriminating taste in
the art works on display, they prefer to clinch the deal privately
instead of by competitive means.
</P>
<P>
Wang attributes the phenomenon to the fact that Xiamen is a
medium-sized city and its residents are not willing to show off
their wealth, which is in sharp contrast to Beijingners.
</P>
<P>
The auction, jointly sponsored by the Hengsheng Auction Company
in Xiamen and the Kangrong Auction Ltd. in Beijing, offers such
works of art as traditional Chinese paintings, porcelain pieces,
jade, diamond jewelry and rare French wines.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive item auctioned off is a copper stove, which
is as big as a fist and made in the early period of the Qing
Dynasty(1644-1911). It was bought by a Hong Kong businessman at a
price of 18,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Brunei Continue to Fight Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said Monday that the armed forces of Malaysia
and Brunei would continue combined operations to fight forest
fires in Sarawak, east Malaysia, which have caused lingering haze
over Brunei.
</P>
<P>
"Brunei has despatched two air force helicopters to help the
authorities in Sarawak put out the forest fires," he said after
meeting Royal Brunei Armed Forces Chief Major General Pengiran
Pahlawan Haji Abidin Pengiran Ahmad here.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the Royal Malaysian Air Force have in turn
deployed two C-130 Hercules aircraft for cloud-seeding sorties as
one way to douse the fires.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires in Lambir near Miri in the state have reportedly
engulfed a two-kilometer stretch of peat soil area along the
Miri-Bintulu road, causing thick smoke screens over Miri and the
neighboring oil-rich sultanate.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said that besides collaboration in
operations, the two armed forces also cooperated in training and
intelligence sharing.
</P>
<P>
He said Brunei has sought to share Malaysia's expertise and
experience in handling frigates as the sultanate's navy would take
delivery of such vessels soon.
</P>
<P>
Pahlawan Haji Abidin, who arrived here earlier in the day, also
called on his Malaysian counterpart General Ismail Omar.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will continue its efforts
to develop defense cooperation with the United States, the most
important ally of Turkey, a Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press conference here, Sermet Atacanli
said that it is Ankara's hope that the upcoming visit of
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen to Turkey could push
forward the friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"As every body knows, there has been a close relationship
between Turkey and the U.S., especially in the area of defense
cooperation," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey is ready to take more positive steps to
consolidate such a relationship, which is in the interests of
Turkey and the region as well.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule, Cohen will arrive in Turkey on
Friday and is expected to meet leading Turkish government and
military officials.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said earlier that U.S. delivery of three
frigates to Turkey and the joint production of 145 attack
helicopters might be taken up during the talks.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the U.S. secretary of defense will also head
for the Incirlik air base near the southern Turkish city of Adana
to inspect U.S. troops stationed there.
</P>
<P>
The Incirlik air base had been used for military strikes
against Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991. Warplanes of the U.S.,
Britain and Turkey deployed there are now carrying out the

<HEADLINE> Large Whale Found Dead on Somalia's Merca Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 13 (Xinhua)- - A very large whale has come
ashore Saturday night on the beach of southern Somali coastal
town of Merca, according to information received here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses in Merca, 100 kilometers south of Mogadishu,
said that the dead whale was longer than 19 meters and weighed
more than 10 tons.
</P>
<P>
It was said that hundreds of people from the town had rushed
to the beach to see the largest sea mammal creature that had ever
come ashore at their seashore.
</P>
<P>
Security militiamen in the town had fired several shots to
keep people away from the whale which they first thought alive.
</P>
<P>
A few seamen and experienced fishermen were allowed to get
close to the animal, which they announced was already dead.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people then started to butcher the animal for fats
and other parts inside the animal, which they believe are
valuable.
</P>
<P>
The reason why the whale had moored is not known yet.
</P>
<P>
However, an experienced fisherman said that it was probably
injured or got sick seriously and it had come to the seashore to
evade sharks or other attacking fish.
</P>
<P>
Other sources suspected that foreign vessels had buried toxic
nuclear wastes in the sea which is killing sea creatures
steadily.
</P>
<P>
Last year, another large whale died similarly at the seashore
of Merca town. But it was not as large as this one.
</P>
<P>
The whales are not fished in Somalia. Unlike sharks, the
whale appearances are not common in the country which has the
largest seashore in Africa.
</P>
<P>
With the slaughtering of the whale still going on in Merca
Monday morning, so far, more than 10 barrels of fats have been
extracted for the use on the wooden fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
The whale fats are helpful for fishermen to stop the leaks on
their boats while fishing. But the whale meat is being distributed
to those who want to eat. Many of the ordinary Somali families do
not appreciate sea foods.
</P>
<P>
One of the eyewitnesses said that the slaughtering may take
one or two days to complete, just for its magnitude.
</P>
<P>
Many of the men butchering the whale believe that amber will
also be found in the animal's stomach.
</P>
<P>
According to the seamen, amber is something black, brown or
white in color which smells even better than the most expensive
perfumes.
</P>
<P>
"Only the lucky ones get amber once in their life time, " they
said. Amber is exported in kilograms to the Gulf countries with
very high prices.

</P>
<P>
The center is situated in the Nanshan Culture Tourism Zone
which is 40 km to the west of Sanya City.
</P>
<P>
Being a key tourism project in Hainan, the zone is expected to
cover 35 sq km on land and scores of sq km of water surface,
featuring Chinese folk culture, tropical sights, ecological
protection and Buddhist and Taoist cultures.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to need a total investment of six
billion yuan (about 723 million US dollars) and will be completed
in eight years.
</P>
<P>
As the first stage of the entire project, the Buddhist culture
center began construction in November, 1995, and 210 million yuan
has been spent, with major buildings highlighting the style of
prosperous Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
Inside the center, a grand religious fair was held yesterday
morning in front of the newly-built Precious Hall of the Great
Hero in Nanshan Temple. More than 1,000 people, including central

<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Monday insisted his nomination of Sergei Kiriyenko for prime
minister and would stand despite last week's defeat in the State
Duma (lower house of the parliament).
</P>
<P>
"I will insist on the nomination to the end and I am going to
work constructively (with deputies) given their constructive
work. I don't want political instability in Russia," said the
president before a meeting with Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said that there was no mention of dissolving the
Duma.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, if the Duma rejects president's
nominee three times, it is dissolved and new elections are held.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed hope that Kiriyenko will win the second
round vote in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
He said he was satisfied with the fact that Our Home is Russia
faction led by Alexander Shokhin voted favorably in the first
round, saying there may be more votes from other factions.
</P>
<P>
"I will not have to ponder on further steps," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Duma failed to approve Kiriyenko as prime minister in the
first round vote last Friday and soon after Yeltsin nominated him
again for the second round vote, the date of which has not been
fixed.

<HEADLINE> Purchase of Stocks Down, Bond Investment Up in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in South Korean
firms plunged by 74 percent in March to 561.9 billion won (401
million U.S. dollars) as against 2.2 trillion won (1.5 billion
dollars) in February, said the Financial Supervisory Commission on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign purchase of bonds surged by 114 percent to
one trillion won (714 million dollars) in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The securities authorities attributed the change to the recent
appreciation of won against dollar.
</P>
<P>
The won's value against the dollar has hovered at 1,300-1,400
for more than three weeks, prompting more overseas investors to
dump their shareholdings for profitable bonds.
</P>
<P>
The rate had slumped to the 1,600-level at the end of last year
when the country began to suffer a serious financial crisis
triggered by corporate collapses and bad loans by financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Leading investors in the South Korean stock market are
foreigners such as Americans and Europeans.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
decided to provide free gratis aid of 100,000 tons of grain and
20,000 tons of chemical fertilizer to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo notified DPRK ambassador to
China Chu Chang Jun of the decision while attending afternoon
ceremonies he hosted to mark the 86 birth anniversary of late DPRK
President Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ambassador to DPRK Wan Yongxiang also notified
Pyongyang of the decision of the Chinese government today.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK side said Chinese assistance will serve as a great
encouragement to the Korean people who are struggling to overcome
temporary difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The aid also symbolizes the will of the Communist Party of
China and Chinese government to enhance and develop the
traditional Sino-DPRK friendship, it added.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK side emphasized that its party and government have
consistently advanced the Sino-DPRK friendship and will continue
to do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has suffered from severe natural disasters in recent
years which has resulted in poor harvests and shortages of food.
</P>
<P>
China has provided various levels of economic aid over the past
several years, including grain aid.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that the current move of the Chinese
government fully demonstrates its consistent stand to value,
consolidate and develop the traditional Sino-DPRK friendship.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hopes to Solve POWs Issue with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday expressed hope to
solve the issue of prisoners of war (POWs) with Iraq on the 10th
anniversary of the end of Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
According to Tehran radio, head of Iran's commission on the
POWs affairs Abdollah Najafi said at a press conference that if
Iran and Iraq continue to swap POWs, the issue left over from the
Iran-Iraq war can be solved during the current Iranian year
(starting on March 21).
</P>
<P>
He said that officials from the two countries would hold
discussion on the border in the near future and a final talk
would be held in Baghdad to release all POWs.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Baghdad started a new round of release of POWs on
April 4. Najafi said that under the agreements reached between
Iran and Iraq following the eighth Islamic summit held in Tehran
last December, 5,584 Iraqi POWs were swapped for 319 Iranians
during the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said that seven Iraqi POWs announced their willingness to
stay in Iran while another died of heart attack when he was handed
over to the officials of the International Red Cross Society.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that more than 39,000 Iranian POWs
were exchanged with 54,000 Iraqis since the two countries began
the exchange of POWs in 1990. But he noted that although the
majority of the registered POWs have been released, there were
documents indicating that a number of Iranian POWs are still kept
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the problem of those missing in
action (MIA) would also be solved through cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Following the visit by Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf to Tehran in January, the two countries reached an
agreement to form a joint committee to follow up the POWs issue in
order to remove the obstacles for normalization of bilateral
relations.

CHONGQING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, China's fourth and
newest municipality, will open a flight to Taipei and Kaohsiung in
Taiwan in May to mark its first anniversary of establishment and
the forthcoming return of Macao to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yunda, deputy general manager of Air Macao, told Xinhua

bridge to further promote cross-Straits tourism, trade and
economic cooperation, as well as cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The three and a half hour 2,800 -km flight between Chongqing
and Taipei will be offered on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.
</P>

temporary capital during the War Against Japanese Aggression
(1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
Some 80,000 Chongqing citizens journeyed to Taiwan in
1949. Today, however, the city is home to some 250,000 former

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Pressures Conglomerates into Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
Monday pressed his financially troubled nation's top five business
groups to speed up self-reforms.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he was not satisfied with the "pace and intensity" of
the five top conglomerates' restructuring programs.
</P>
<P>
"They have to further hasten and strengthen their restructuring
efforts," Kim was quoted as saying by Kang Bong-kyun, his top
policy advisor.
</P>
<P>
Kim's pressure on the five conglomerates comes at a time when
the nation's labor groups threatened to unilaterally abolish an
agreement with employers and the government on sharing the burden
of economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The labor groups accused the conglomerates of failing to honor
their previous pledge of reviving the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
A five-point reform agreement, reached between Kim and the
country's top 30 conglomerates in February, calls for
transparency in business management, an end to the
cross-subsidiary loan payments, the establishment of a healthy
financial structure, support for small firms, and making majority
shareholders and managers take greater responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the top 30 should take serious self-reform
measures, including the appointment of external board members, the
sell-off of real estate and marginal subsidiaries. However, they
have made little progress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the top 30 conglomerates were blamed for devouring
banks loans and shirking responsibility for fostering the
financial woes with their high debt build-up and over-expansion.
</P>
<P>
"The president believes that the conglomerates should push for
more intense reform programs if we are to win the people's
cooperation for overcoming the economic crisis," Kang said.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerates should sell what they have to sell and merge
what they have to merge, added the president's advisor.

LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Road accidents have claimed 232,300
lives and injured 730,260 persons in Nigeria since 1955, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the Federal Road Safety Commission show that
the west African country recorded no less than 964,390 road accidents
from 1955 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
The high frequency of road accidents is despite the fact that
Nigeria has one of the best highway networks in Africa, most of which
were built by the Germans during the oil boom years in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian sources attributed to the situation to poor traffic
management and the lack of proper enlightenment of the public.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Growth Depends on GDP: ILO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) has called on African countries to increase
their national domestic product (GDP) to avoid continued
marginalization from the global economy.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest ILO report, sub-Saharan Africa, long
beset by economic adversity and civil disorder, is showing the
first signs of economic resurgence, This Day newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
It disclosed that while recovery prospects can be further
boosted by domestic reforms and increased international
investment, acclerated job and income growth are now critical to
sustaining the upturn and maintaining political stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The report, an outcome of ILO and United Nations Development
Program for Africa tagged "Jobs for Africa", also indicated that
while economic performance of most sub-Saharan African countries
has been far from satisfactory for the last two decades, the
outcome has not been uniformly bad.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, five of the stronger performers in
the region, including Equatorial Guinea, Lesotho and Uganda,
enjoyed average GDP growth rates of seven percent or more during
1992-95 period.
</P>
<P>
During the four-year period, five other countries grew by an
average of 4-5 percent with eight others growing by roughtly 3-4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicated that eight sub-Saharan African
countries, including Cameroon, Angola, Sierra Leone, Rwanda and
Zambia, experienced real declines during the perod.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for the envisaged turnaround in countries
which showed an average growth is the increase in domestic
investment which the report showed an average increase of over 10
percent in eight countries.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is the rising level of foreign investment,
which "while tiny by international comparisons, nonetheless grew
by more than 100 percent in 10 countries".
</P>
<P>
Other reasons are stronger prices for raw materials and
agriculture products, icnreased European demand for African
manufactured goods, expanding African enterpreurship, rising
labor productivity and heightened international commitment to
African development.
</P>
<P>
However, the report stressed that the main emphasis of policy
makers today "should be encouraging new, private sector
enterprises, particularly those which are small in scale and
labor intensive, and on enabling small enterprises to expand,
innovate and penetrate new markets, including export markets."
</P>
<P>
The ILO report also calls for a reduction of the external debt
of the 29 severely indebted low income countries in Africa as
"currently, debt service accounts for about four percent of GDP
in the region".
</P>
<P>
The debt figure should be cut by half to free up resources for
future productive investment, ILO suggested.

<HEADLINE> China To Raise price of Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The price of water for industry
and hydro-electric power stations will go up considerably this
year and slightly for agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission says that waterworks
need to increase water fees in 1998 to reduce losses and improve
profit, and that China will set the rates for urban areas.
</P>
<P>
To improve efficiency, the country is encouraging people to
save water resources. Any companies that waste water will be
fined, and urban residents and companies will pay higher prices
for going beyond their quotas.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the price of 1,000 tons of Yellow River water was
equal to that of a bottle of mineral water. Farmers are being
encouraged to use modern irrigation technology.
</P>
<P>
China should treat water as a kind of commodity and set a
reasonable price, according to Jiang Chunyun, vice-Chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Niu Maosheng, Minister of Water Resources, said that China will
develop favorable policies encouraging people to save water and
new projects that do not take water-saving into consideration will
not be approved.

<HEADLINE> Two Forest Fires Getting Stronger in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Two newly-detected forest fires in
the Philippines were getting stronger, a senior government
official said Monday in a report to the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Fortunato Dejoras, an executive officer of the National
Disaster Coordinating Council, said in the report that the fire in
Bokod, Benguet province, the northern Philippines, has damaged
some 25,00 hectares of forest areas.
</P>
<P>
He said fire fighters and civilian volunteers were constructing
firebreaks to contain the fire and the Armed Forces of the
Philippines has been asked to use water bombs to extinguish the
fire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the forest fire starting on April 9 in two villages
near Iligan city, the southern Philippines, has forced five
families to evacuate to safer places and burned down eight houses,
he added.
</P>
<P>
One platoon of the Philippine Army's 60th Infantry Battalion
has been dispatched to the said villages to assist in
fire-fighting operations while 40 personnel from different
government departments were working hard to contain the fire,
Dejoras said.
</P>
<P>
The two fires were the latest found in the country. Since March
this year a number of forest fires have gripped the southern part
of the country, killing at least three people and damaging
thousands of hectares of forest land.

The Philippine government announced earlier that the forest
fires in the south had been under control.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Calls for Long Millennium Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England has said that a
three-day Millennium Holiday, at the end of next year, will help
overcome problems posed by the millennium computer bug.
</P>
<P>
With fears growing about the consequences of year 2000
computer crashes, it is understood that people who think they will
be celebrating the new millennium on holiday will, in fact, be
working flat out, trying to deal with the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Don Cruickshand, chairman of the Action 2000 campaign, told a
British paper, the Independent, that the consequences of
chain-link "crashes" between computers are completely unknown.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the risks involved was underlined by a report
released recently saying that foreign exchange settlement failures
could quadruple in the first week of January 2000, costing the
markets as much as 10 billion U.S. dollars in one week.
</P>
<P>
The impending crisis is threatened by the fact that many
computers have not been programmed to distinguish between 2000 and
1900 when their two-digit dates change to 00 from the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, warned: "We face
a day of judgement on that first day of the year 2000. The IT
systems on which the entire business community now depends are not
capable of recognizing or responding predictably to dates beyond
the end of this century."
</P>
<P>
The bank said the continuation of orderly markets might not be
possible "if a large enough proportion of the participants are
unable to trade or settle - and particularly if those still
operating try to make a profit out of the situation."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the exchanges will be planning how to manage such a
crisis, including procedures for closing the market altogether,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
At the request of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the G8
nations are reported to discuss the global implications of the
millennium bug at the next summit to be held in Birmingham next
month.

<P>
The French delegation is scheduled to discuss with MIDA
joint-venture possibilities in telecommunications and multimedia.

European Union after Germany, the United Kingdom and the
Netherlands. Two French projects worth 4.2 million ringgit (1.166
million U.S. dollars) have been approved for this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Rafidah, MIDA approved 33 French projects with
capital investments of 4.3 billion ringgit (1.194 million U.S.
dollars) between 1990 and 1997 mainly in the production of rubber
products, non-metallic mineral products, textiles, electronics,
plastics, petroleum and coal, and food manufacturing.

<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's new assembly
could collapse in acrimony within 18 months, talks chairman George
Mitchell warned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can rule out the possibility that 18 months from now,
they can't get the assembly to work, that the whole process simply
stops," the former U.S. senator told the Times newspaper in London
before flying to New York.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, the broker who helped clinch Friday's historic peace
accord, hoped that the parties concerned would begin to develop a
"sense of accomplishment and mutual endeavor" by cooperating in
the assembly.
</P>
<P>
"It will take a real effort to make this work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said his biggest concern was that there remained a
complete lack of trust between the feuding Unionists and
Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
 He also warned that extremists on both sides of the sectarian
divide could step up attacks in the weeks leading up to May 22
referendums being held on Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
The major political parties in Northern Ireland reached a
peace agreement last Friday, formally ending the three-decade
bloody conflict in the divided province during which more than
3,000 people were killed.

<P>
Mbeki said that South Africa regards China as an important

<HEADLINE> S.Korea, U.S. to Negotiate on Auto Market Dispute in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea said on Monday it will
negotiate with the United States over a wider opening of the South
Korean auto market to U.S. cars on May 13.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation will be held in Seoul for a few days, said Park
Won-wha, spokesman of the Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation was originally scheduled for the end of this
month, but the United States required a postponement citing it
changed its negotiation representative.
</P>
<P>
The United States has repeatedly urged South Korea to lower its
tariffs over imported U.S. cars and revise its current tariff
system on engine capacity.
</P>
<P>
It said that South Korea's imposition of heavy duty on large
engine limousines apparently discriminate against foreign
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korea, whose cars are equipped with small
engines, has insisted that its tariff of eight percent on engine
capacity is even lower than those of the European countries and
its tariff system was set up in accordance with its road
conditions, traffic safety, environment and tax revenue.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Discuss Military Accord With Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will pay a visit to Poland next week, during which he
will discuss the implementation of a deal on bilateral military
cooperation, local daily Haaretz reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deal, under which Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) will
upgrade Hussar helicopters for the Polish Army, is the largest of
its kind entered into by Poland since the collapse of the Soviet
bloc and is worth 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some of the upgraded helicopters are earmarked for the Polish
army and the rest for export.
</P>
<P>
The report said that during the visit, Netanyahu will discuss
this issue with Polish leaders to urge Poland to implement the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli government sources noted that this is the major
item on the agenda of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum of understanding was initiated on September 6,
1997, and the agreement was signed about a month later in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was signed shortly before the elections in
Poland, which led to the formation of the new government headed by
the Solidarity Party. But the party's leadership objects to the
project.
</P>
<P>
Polish Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz has attributed the
delay in implementing the agreement to a new law passed by the
Polish parliament, which forbids the government to sign contracts
with corporations without exhausting certain procedures.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Poland, Netanyahu will take part in the
"March of the Living," the annual ceremony to mark the
Holocaust.

<P>
PARIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While 70 percent of the voters in Northern Ireland have
expressed support to the compromise reached last Friday in Belfast
between Catholics and Protestants, scepticism and distrust always
remain high between the two sides. British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern are saving no efforts to
``sell'' the peace agreement prior to the referendum to be held on
May 22.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After the signing of the peace agreement in Northern Ireland,
the two conflicting sides agreed that all remain to be done to
implement the agreement. The principal architect of the agreement
American George Mitchell said that the road is still long and a
possibility of failure persists.
</P>
<P>
The obstacle course began last Saturday when David Trimble, the
chief of the principal unionist party UUP which controls two thirds
of the votes in Northern Ireland, expressed his support to the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
-- One week prior to the beginning of parliamentary debate on the
European single currency euro, the leftwing majority and rightwing
opposition of France have seen their division lines over euro
reappear within their own camps. The draft law on the reform of the
statute of the Bank of France marked the resurgence of the
divisions, as the deputies of the centrist Union for French
Democracy and Socialist Party voted for the law, while the
Communists and one fourth of the deputies of the Rally for the
Republic voted against.

<HEADLINE> Leprosy Cases Fall in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A multi-drug therapy treatment
and an aggressive public awareness campaign have resulted in the
fall of leprosy cases in Kenya from 10,000-plus a decade ago to
about 700 last year, the East African newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Between 350-400 active cases of the debilitating disease are
being picked up annually, the head of the National Tuberculosis
and Leprosy Project (NTLP), Daniel Kibuga, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Health education is a prerequisite. People will know that if
detected early, leprosy is simple to treat and curable," said
Kibuga.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO), which introduced the
multi-drug therapy, says the world is well on the way to
eliminate leprosy as a public health problem before the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy is caused by a bacterium, called Mycobacterium leprae,
which produced very slowly and mainly affects skin, nerves
and mucous membrane. If untreated, there can be progressive and
permanent damage to skin, limbs and eyes.
</P>
<P>
"But visible symptoms may not show themselves for six, or even
10 years," says John Mansoer, a technical advisor to NTLP.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy has been dreaded through the centuries and was for
long universally considered incurable. In 1940, the first drug to
be developed, dapsone, cured the disease, but only if the patient
regularly took the correct dose over many years.
</P>
<P>
The leprosy bacterium later developed resistance to dapsone,
leading to the adoption of cocktail of three drugs -- dapsone,
rifamici and clofazimine -- by WHO in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Strategy has been adopted by all endemic countries during
the past fiver years, and the resulting progress in the control
of leprosy has been remarkable.
</P>
<P>
The number of registered leprosy cases fell significantly for
the first time in the 1980s, from 5.4 million in 1985 to 3.7
million in 1990, representing a decrease of 31.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though a person may be completely cured, Kibuga said, severe
damage to limbs usually can not always be put right leading to a
long time problem of rehabilitation or treatment for people
disabled by the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to NTLP, up to 40 percent of cases are in advanced
stages of the disease because patients don't seek treatment
early enough, or doctors take inordinately long to identify the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Human beings seem to be the only natural host of the leprosy
bacterium, which medics experts suspect, is transmitted mainly
from the nasal discharge of infected people, but might also be
passed on by skin contact.
</P>
<P>
A total of 79 countries are technically endemic for leprosy
today. Of these, only 25 are rated as the "most endemic"
countries as they contribute to 93 percent of all cases.
</P>
<P>
Among the 25 nations are Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Chad,
Columbia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Iran,
Madagascar, Mali, Mexico, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria,
Philippines, Sudan, Thailand and Democratic Republic of Congo.

<HEADLINE> AL Urges PNA, Hamas to End Verbal Warfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) has urged the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) to halt their war of words, saying it only
benefits Israel, the Egyptian Gazette reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is the primary beneficiary of this verbal war between
the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas," AL Assistant
Secretary General for Palestine Affairs Said Kamal told reporters
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League is asking the two Palestinian parties to show
restraint and use the language of patriotic unity," he was quoted
by the English daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kamal also urged both sides to suspend their differences and
concentrate on the main points of disagreement between the
Palestinian people, led by the Palestine Liberation Organization,
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The PNA and Hamas have blamed each other for the murder of
chief Hamas bomb maker Muhi Sharif, whose charred body was found
on March 29 in a car blown up in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Palestinian version, the explosion
was staged to cover up the murder by rival Hamas members.
</P>
<P>
But Hamas, which opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords,
has denied a hand in the murder and accused Israel and the PNA of
collaborating in killing Sharif.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Palestinian chief delegate to the Arab League
Mohammad Sobeih warned against the consequences of the absence of
direct contact between Hamas and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
"There are many parties who would like to make use of this
situation...Direct contact is necessary to deny any chance to
misuse the assassination," he told Egypt's Middle East News
Agency.

<HEADLINE> Official: Turkey Needs Aircraft Carriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey would soon become one of
the few countries that possess aircraft carriers to safeguard its
interests as a regional power, naval officials said.
</P>
<P>
Local English newspaper Daily News Monday quoted officials from
the Naval Forces Command as saying that "The notion of Turkish
aircraft carriers crisscrossing the waters of the western
Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Black Sea in the 2000s is not a
fantasy but a necessity."
</P>
<P>
The officials stressed that Turkey's national might, geography
and historical factors "are forcing Turkey to become a regional
power whose interests are not limited to its neighbors only,"
adding that this can only be achieved with the formation of a
powerful flotilla, including aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
They said the navy's operational capabilities should be
extended beyond the Turkish shores to all areas within Turkey's
interests.
</P>
<P>
"The significant participation of the Turkish troops in the
United Nations peace-keeping operations in Somalia, Bosnia and
Albania shows the world that Turkey has become a regional force
whose interests are not limited to its neighbors," the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain, France, Russia, India, Italy,
Spain and Thailand are the countries comprising the so-called
"aircraft-carrier-countries club."
</P>
<P>
The United States has 12 aircraft carriers, Britain three,
France, Russia and India two each, while Italy, Spain and Thailand
one each.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Opposition Calls for Inter-Party Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's National Lima Party has
called for resumption of inter-party dialogue which was suspended
last December, Times of Zambia reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted president of the party, Ben Kapita, as
saying at the weekend that the dialogue should be held urgently
and political parties that are not ready to participate should be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party dialogue was suspended after former President
Kenneth Kaunda was arrested last December in alleged involvement
in the October 28 coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
Ben Kapita said that with the state of emergency imposed after
the foiled coup lifted last month, political parties should hold
a meeting to resolve their differences and concentrate on
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that politicians will lose their relevance to the
public if they continue to procrastinate on dialogue because
people are more concerned with issues which affect their daily
lives.
</P>
<P>
"We, as politicians, must meet and resolve whatever
differences we have," said Kapita, "People expect us to resolve
our political differences and start dealing with economic issues,
otherwise, we are going to lose the confidence of the Zambian
people."
</P>
<P>
Kapita said that he has consulted 10 parties including the
United National Independence Party (UNIP) led by Kaunda and
Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC), and all of them have indicated
their willingness to take part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Kapita accused the ruling party of not being serious
in dialogue and said that efforts made to hold dialogue have been
frustrated by it.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary inter-party talks held in early December last year
decided to hold a inter-party summit early January this year.
However, the summit failed to materialize because many parties
quitted the dialog in protest against the arrest of Kaunda.

<HEADLINE> Huge Investment Needed for Nigeria's Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Electric Power
Authority (NEPA) has called on the government to provide fund totaling
5.5 billion U.S. Dollars to effect repairs
of its four thermal power plants.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of comprehensive overhaul of the aged plants make them
susceptible to frequent breakdowns which constitute severe constraints
to effect generation, scheduling," NEPA said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned corporation is said to be generating electricity at
68 percent below its capacity of 5,958 mw, with an output of 1,925 mw,
compared with the national peak demand of 2,446 mw.
</P>
<P>
According to NEPA, four major plants with a combined generating
capacity of 3,440 mw, need urgent repairs.
</P>
<P>
Under this year's budget, the government earmarked three billion
naira (about 37 million dollars) to rehabilitate power plants.
</P>
<P>
However, in its first official reaction to the 1998 budgetary
provision, NEPA management described the amout as only "a tip of the
iceberg".
</P>
<P>
But Finance Minister Chief Anthony Ani said the government could
not provide such funds demanded by NEPA, saying "when private
investment come in, they will put things right."
</P>
<P>
According to a government program, preparations will be made
this year to offer the state-monopolized electricity sector for
privatization, which the government wishes to boost capacity and
provide adequate power supply in the country.

<HEADLINE> Korean Talks Reconvene in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The vice-ministerial-level talks
between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the
Republic of Korea (ROK) reopened in Beijing this afternoon, after
a morning session was cancelled.
</P>
<P>
This closed-door working level session, instead of a plenum,
started at 15:00 pm, with the head delegates and one delegate from
each side attending.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which started in Beijing Saturday afternoon, are the
first government contact between the two in nearly four years. The
issues to be discussed include food supplies and fertilizer from
the South, the reunion of families separated since the 1950s,
special envoy exchanges, and the North-South Basic Agreement.
</P>
<P>
After talks on Saturday and Sunday, both negotiators have
expressed guarded optimism over the ongoing talks.
</P>
<P>
However, an official from the ROK embassy said he did not know
what progress negotiators made, nor how long the talks would
last. "A statement might be signed as a result of the talks," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK embassy in Beijing did not respond to telephone queries
for comment.
</P>
<P>
Chun Kum Chul, a member of the Administration Council, is
heading a five-member DPRK delegation, and Jeong Se Hyun,
vice-minister of the National Unification, is leading an equal
number on the ROK side.
</P>
<P>
The first-round plenum on Saturday afternoon was said to have
been conducted "in an open and friendly way", and the second
round, on Sunday morning, "in a good atmosphere", following a
working level session in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This landmark Beijing talks follow an inconclusive second round
of Four-Party Korean peace talks, which ended in Geneva on March
21 after six days.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of journalists from the ROK, Japan and other nations are
closely watching the development of the talks at a five-star hotel
in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK proposed that Beijing be the venue for the
talks. China is the only country that has formal diplomatic ties
with all three political powers involved in the Korean Peninsula:
the DPRK, the ROK, and the U.S.

ANKARA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is all out to boost
tourism, the country's major foreign exchange earner, expecting a
large increase in income for this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to take Measures to Prevent Hajj </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia is considering
ways to prevent future repetition of last week's stampede and
other tragedies that have marked the annual pilgrimage in recent
years, reports reaching here from Saudi Arabia said Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people died when a stampede took place Thursday
on an 80 meter-wide bridge on Mina plain, 10 kilometers from Saudi
holy city of Mecca, during the last day performance of this year's
Hajj season. The official Saudi Press Agency put the death toll at
118.
</P>
<P>
A senior Saudi official, whose name was not given, was quoted
as saying that Saudi authorities have set up a committee to study
ways of easing congestion on certain pilgrimage sites.
</P>
<P>
He said that some of the proposals the Saudi government is
looking into are to widen the bridge and allow people on it
only every 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was the scene of a similar stampede in 1994 that
killed some 270 pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the burial of the stampede victims this year, reports
said burial in Mecca is the preferred option of the families of
the deceased. Some of the burials have already taken place and
some will take place over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pilgrims from other countries have started leaving
Saudi Arabia for home and the process is expected to last for a
month to complete.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia receives more than 2 million Muslim pilgrims
every year from various parts of the world and many departments
of the Saudi government make intricate preparations throughout
the year for the world's biggest gathering of the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
So far Saudi Arabia has spent billions of U.S. dollars in
improving serving and other facilities for the annual gathering.

<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Education and
the U.S.'s Procter &AMP; Gamble (P&AMP;G) began a ten-year program today
to help teenage schoolgirls in China deal with puberty.
</P>
<P>
P&AMP;G will donate 7 million yuan (about 850,000 US dollars) to
the National School Health Education Development Fund for the
program. Its CEO John Pepper gave the Education Ministry an
initial one million yuan at a ceremony here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Song Jinxian, the ministry's physical, health, and art
education director, said at the ceremony that education about
puberty is a part of Chinese general education, and because it
concerns their health, it should be addressed by schools, parents,
and society as a whole, and that foreign experience can be used
for better results.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that cooperation between education
departments and social organizations is an effective way to
develop education.
</P>
<P>
P&AMP;G conducted trial programs in cities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Chengdu in the latter half of last year,
which were judged a success.
</P>
<P>
Jing Yidan, a news anchorwoman at China Central Television,
said that, as the mother of a teenage girl, she feels the program
is significant because it is long-term and nationwide, meaning
that even girls living in remote areas can eventually benefit from
it.
</P>
<P>
P&AMP;G, one of the world's largest consumer goods producers, has
11 joint ventures in China. It first came to China in 1988, and
its investment in China exceeds 300 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Decides to Cut Govt Expenditure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
decided to cut its expenditure by 20 percent to ease the
diteriorating fiscal situation facing the country, the East
African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures announced last week are the retrenchment of
civil servants, a proposed pay freeze and a 20 percent cut in the
government's wage.
</P>
<P>
Facing the deteriorating fiscal situation, the Kenyan
government has decided to cut its expenditure as a major step
towards mending relations with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) which halted its aid package to the country in the mid of
last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The east African state expects to raise some 12.6 billion
Shillings (210 million U.S. Dollars) through the cut in the
government wage bill and 7.4 billion Shillings (126.6 million
Dollars) from other savings in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The total sum of the money saved, which will be used to redeem
the domestic debt, will achieve a budget surplus of three percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP) per year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae said that the measures,
which will be tabled in parliament as part of the new budget in
June, were a prerequisite for initiating discussions with the IMF
under the existing Enhanced Structural Adjustment Fund (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The report said the proposed retrenchment in the public
service, which is expected to be controversial, has received the
backing of Britain, among other bilateral and multilateral
donors.
</P>
<P>
A member of the donor community suggested that Kenya could
follow the practice adopted by other countries where those
retrenched have either worked continuously for 30 years, or have
attained 50 or 55 years of age or both.
</P>
<P>
Kenya fell out with the IMF in July over issues of good
governance and what the Fund saw as the government's reluctance
to crackdown on corruption. Following the standoff, Kenya lost
205 million U.S. Dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's debt has increased from 110 billion Shillings (1.8
billion U.S. Dollars) in 1996 to some 140 billion Shillings (2.3
billion U.S. Dollars) in January 1998, and is expected to rise to
150 billion Shillings (2.5 billion U.S. Dollars) in the next
three months.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji, in an
hour-long meeting with South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
here this morning, said that the Chinese government will encourage
Chinese firms in mutually beneficial cooperation with South
African counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Sino-South African economic and trade
ties will be helped by the joint efforts of both governments and
that there is enormous potential in bilateral collaboration
because the two countries complement each other economically.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has become China's largest trade partner in Africa
in recent years, Zhu said, and China is ready to reinforce the
cooperation to make bilateral economic links and trade grow in an
active, healthy and orderly way.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said that ties between South Africa and China are based
on "mutual trust" and that bilateral relations have developed
smoothly since diplomatic relations were established.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade ties play an important role in bilateral
relations, he said, because it is hard to maintain long-term
political stability without economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki told Zhu that South Africa is willing to continue
consulting with China on bilateral economic and trade
collaboration and that the further development of economic and
trade ties will benefit the two countries and economic recovery in
Africa as a whole.

Many provinces in Mindanao are reeling from the El Nino-induced
drought. Agricultural crops have been wiped out, resulting in
shortage of food supply. The severe lack of food drove tribal folk
 to eat a type of yam which is toxic when not prepared properly.

Singson's reaction came after reports that the Central Bank has
approved a 150 percent reduction in the amount of dollars one
person can take out of the country to 10,000 dollars from the
current limit of 25,000.00 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The restriction on dollar outflow was allegedly imposed by the
government as a result of the prevailing currency crisis that hurt
most of the economies in the region, including the Philippines, so
that capital flights can be minimized.
</P>
<P>
While the country needs dollars to sustain its import
requirements, the private sector is urging the government to take
monetary measures to regulate the outflow of dollars from the
country.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Uganda Seeking to Enter World Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan and Ugandan delegates
will meet members of the U.S. Treasury and Wall Street traders in
Washington next week as a first step toward enabling the two countries
to enter the international bond market.
</P>
<P>
Jimnah Mbaru, Chairman of the Nairobi Stock Exchange, and
Deputy Governor of Kenya's Central Bank Nzioki Kibua, are among
the African officials to attend the U.S.-African conference over
credit ratings for the sub-Saharan countries, the weekly East
African reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Richard Rubin and Wall Street traders
will meet the African officials between April 20 and 21 to discuss how
the sub-Sahara African countries can obtain credit ratings from key
assessment firms such as Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Cote d'Ivoire are in a top tier of
African states that should be able to enter global bond markets
in two years, predicts Walter Kansteiner, an investment
advisor and Africa commodities trader.
</P>
<P>
Their ability to obtain the necessary credit ratings will
hinge, however, on the degree of political and financial
stability they demonstrate, said Kansteiner, who will be speaking
at the Washington conference.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the only sub-Saharan country to have received
an "investment-grade" rating from the leading evaluators of
nations' credit-worthiness. Other African states are effectively
shut out of the international bond market.
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of potential buyers of African sovereign
debt, "but to be able to play in this game, you first have to get
credentials as a player," said Kansteiner, noting that a risk
rating is an essential precondition for investors interested in a
country's sovereign debt.
</P>
<P>
Nations such as Kenya and Uganda that may eventually obtain
credit ratings can expect their sovereign debt to be initially
placed in the junk-bond category, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Set to Tackle Liquidity Crunch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Democrat Party has
agreed to issue four executive decrees to tackle the liquidity
crunch in a bid to bring down the current high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a meeting of ministers in
charge of economic affairs from the Democrat Party on Saturday, a
government source said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But coalition partners have yet to be consulted on the issue,
the source said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Government officials had proposed that the cabinet issue an
executive decree to authorize the Financial Institutions
Development Fund (FIDF) to issue long-term bonds to help limit the
FIDF's borrowing from the short-term financial market.
</P>
<P>
The FIDF has been blamed for mismanagement that was one of the
causes of the economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said last week that the
government was considering the possibility of pushing for four
financial bills, including the one related to the FIDF, when
parliament convenes a special meeting in may.
</P>
<P>
The four decrees, once approved by coalition partners, would
enable the government to issue more bonds in overseas markets and
subsequently prompt capital inflows. They would also allow the
government to act faster to tackle the liquidity crunch, the
source said without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
He said the four decrees would be submitted to the cabinet for
re-deliberation and were expected to be issued on April 28.
</P>
<P>
He said the decrees would be ratified by the house during an
extra-parliamentary session in may.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Refutes Iraqi Allegations on Jail Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has refuted Iraqi
allegations that Kuwait had rejected an Iraqi proposal inviting
the International Committee for Red Cross (ICRC) to search for
Kuwait's POWs in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Majed Al-Shaheen, deputy chairman of the Kuwait
National Committee for Missing and POWs Affairs, said in a
statement through Kuwait News Agency that Kuwait had welcomed ICRC
efforts to be acquainted with the conditions of prisoners and
detainees in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were in response to press reports that Chairman of
Iraqi National Council Saadoun Hamadi indicated during the ongoing
meeting of the International Parliamentary Union in the Namibian
capital of Windhoek that the allied countries including Kuwait
rejected the Iraqi proposal.
</P>
<P>
"During the meeting in February 1997 of the tripartite
committee, Iraq invited the ICRC to visit the jails in a general
form to get acquainted with the prisoners' state," Al-Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
"At the time, ICRC noted that this matter was a bilateral
issue between Iraq and the ICRC, and it was procedural and was not
related to the tripartite committee or any of its members,"
Al-Shaheen added.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite committee, set up after the Gulf War in 1991,
groups Iraq, the ICRC, and the allied countries that ousted Iraqi
forces from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled that since February 1997, the ICRC has not
been able to reach any agreement with the Iraqi regime over the
mechanism and conditions of visits to Iraqi prisons.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has been the most emotional one hindering
improvement of relations between Kuwait and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait said that Baghdad still detains 625 Kuwaiti POWs in
Iraqi jails and has frequently urged Iraq to release them, but
Baghdad said those POWs were missing during turmoils in southern
Iraq following the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has insisted that the return of the Kuwaiti POWs is the
top condition for improving its ties with Iraq, saying this is the
most important issue for every individual in Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> 56 Bodies Recovered, 21 Saved in Tanzania Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 56 bodies have
been recovered from a tanzanite mine in north Tanzania's Arusha
Region which buried at least 90 miners after a landslide, the
state-owned Daily News said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government announced that rescue team has saved
21 people trapped in the mine, which collapsed after a downpour
last Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanite is a semi-precious stone unique to Tanzania and is
mined using traditional methods, often few safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Tanzaian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye cut short
his Easter holiday and flew to Arusha. He was accompanied by the
Minister for Energy and Minerals, Abdallah Kigoda, and Arusha
Regional Commissioner, Daniel Njoolay.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye has ordered the mine owners to stop all mining
activities until all bodies were recovered. He also showed
dissatisfaction with the owners who do not even have a list of
their workers, which makes it difficult to identify those who
were missing in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has appealed for pumps to suck out water in
mines and earth moving equipment such as caterpillars.
</P>
<P>
Most of the rescue work have been done by miners who escaped
the disaster and engineers from the Fire Brigade and regional
water department.
</P>
<P>
Rescue has been slowed down because of Easter holidays, making
rescue workers unable to get in touch with companies which have
appropriate equipment.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that stench from rotten bodies at the mine forced
a poorly equipped rescue team reluctant to go ahead with their
task.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people from Arusha and neighboring regions have
come to the mining area in Mererani, 40 km away from the Arusha
town, anxious to know the fate of their relatives, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economist Suggests China Encourage Consumers' Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A professor at Hunan Finance and
Economics College, Zeng Linghua, has suggested that China
encourage consumers' spending to help maintain its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Zeng says in an article carried by today's Economic Daily that
household spending of the Chinese is 20 to 28 percentage points
lower than those in countries with similar per capita income and
that this low rate is from a lack of demand.
</P>
<P>
He points to two ways to bring the rate up, by increasing the
proportion of resident's income to the country's GDP and by
encouraging consumers' spending in relation to per capita income.
</P>
<P>
As the resident's income in China is about 68 percent of the
country's GDP, or nearly the same as in the developed countries,
it is improper to make it higher, Zeng says.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he adds, China should stimulate consumers' spending
so as to boost its economic growth. The consumers spending to
income rate dropped to 71 percent in 1996 from 1978's 97.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said, to stimulte consumers' spending, priority should be
given to the development of agriculture, animal husbandry and
fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The development of the energy industry could also promote the
use of more household electric appliances, especially in rural
areas, the prefessor says.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications and housing should also be given priority,
he says, adding along with this, price reforms and a proper pricing
system are needed.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector should also use interest rates and loans
to stimulate consumers spending, Zeng says.

WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Mark O'Meara rolled in a
20-foot (6.10-meter) birdie putt on the final hole Sunday to claim
the US Masters title that his close friend Tiger Woods overwhelmed
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The birdie on No.18 gave O'Meara a closing round 67 and a
72-hole total of 279 -- nine strokes higher than the winning score
by Woods last year.
</P>
<P>
The victory marked the first major championship title for the
41-year-old American and also meant that the last 14 major
championships have been won by 14 different people.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Woods, the 22-year-old wonder who shot a
record 18-under par last year and won by a record 12 strokes, only
finished eighth with a 70 and a 285 total.
</P>
<P>
The American duo David Duval and Fred Couples shared the second
place at 280. Jim Furyk was fourth at 281, with Paul Azinger at

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting with South Africa's Vice-president Thabo Mbeki this
morning, said that the establishing of diplomatic relations
between China and South Africa was a milestone in the history of
relations between the two.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa are developing countries without
fundamental conflict of interests and with many common interests,
Jiang said, and China has consistently supported the struggle of
the African people for national independence, especially of the
South African people in their fight against racial segregation.
</P>
<P>
It is very important for developing countries to increase
solidarity, he said, and China is willing to develop relations
with South Africa with mutual trust, sincere friendship, and
all-round cooperation and is willing to increase exchanges and
cooperation to promote the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that South Africa is a very important country in Africa
and has a very good foundation for economic development.
</P>
<P>

<P>
FUZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Quanzhou-Xiamen expressway in
east China's Fujian province is operating successfully since it
was put into service last December.
</P>
<P>
The 81.4-km-long expressway, the first in the province, was
built with 2.78 billion yuan, including 140 million U.S. dollars
in World Bank loans. The idea to build the road was proposed in
1982, but the project was not launched until 1994.
</P>
<P>
Internationally accepted measures were introduced in the
construction of the expressway.
</P>
<P>
During the construction, the designers and builders paid
special attention to environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's expressways will be extended to 430 kilometers by the
end of this century to link Fuzhou, Putian, Quanzhou, Xiamen and
Zhangzhou, the five largest industrial cities in the province.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Doctors Recommend Children to Wear Eye Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 12 (Xinhua) -- American doctors strongly
recommend school children to wear eye protection for school and
community sports.
</P>
<P>
The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), declaring April to
be "Sports Eye Safety Month," said Sunday that it believes eye
protection made of thick, tough polycarbonate plastic should be
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
Doctors link the need for eye protection to the need for helmets
for bicyclists and others engaged in sports that keep them on the
move.
</P>
<P>
The American Academy of Pediatrics also said the plastic guard
should be required particularly for those with eye injuries or with
only one functional eye.
</P>
<P>
Sports-related eye injuries have more than doubled over the past
three years, to 100,000 cases a year, AAO pointed out. Of those
injuries, 90 percent could have been prevented with proper eyewear, it
said, calling for 3-millimeter-thick polycarbonate goggles fitted by a
professional, such as an optician.
</P>
<P>
A serious eye injury can cost 12,000 U.S. dollar in the United
States, said John Jeffers, Chairman of AAO's Committee on Eye
Safety and Sports, adding that goggles fitted by a skilled
optician can cost 50 to 100 dollar each.

its output.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan boasts both favorable climate and geological conditions
for growing coffee, with a growing history of 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The province now has established 20 coffee production bases and

<HEADLINE> Profile: New Nepali PM Girija Prasad Koirala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Girija Prasad Koirala,
president and parliamentary leader of the Nepali Congress, was
appointed Sunday by King Birendra as new prime minister of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
For 73-year-old Koirala, the premiership is nothing new. He
took office in May 1991 as the Kingdom's first popularly elected
prime minister in 30 years. And his brothers Matrika Prasad
Koirala and Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala were also prime ministers
of Nepal in the 1950s and the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
G.P. Koirala began his political career while working at a jute
mill in Biratnagar of eastern Nepal. He participated in the first
industrial strike held in the mill in 1947.
</P>
<P>
He led the labor movement in Biratnagar after the dissolution
of the multi-party system in Nepal in 1960. That year he was
arrested and imprisoned under the State Offense Act for seven
years. He went on a hunger strike in jail for about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Three years after he was released from jail, G.P. Koirala was
arrested again under the Security Act. Later he exiled himself to
India until 1979.
</P>
<P>
Koirala held the post of youth leader of the NC for many years.
In 1976, he was elected the party's general secretary at a party
conference held in India.
</P>
<P>
His active involvement in armed struggle against the partyless
Panchayat system in place for three decades culminated in the
people's movement in February 1990.
</P>
<P>
The movement forced King Birendra to abolish the Panchayat
system and restore the multi-party democratic system in the
country.
</P>
<P>
During the first free elections in May 1991, Koirala was
elected member of the House of Representatives and his party won a
clear majority. He assumed the post of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In March 1994, he resigned and recommended mid-term polls after
losing a key vote in parliament. The polls in November 1994
resulted in a hung parliament where no single party holds a
majority, which in turn leads to the emergence of coalition
politics in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
But Koirala was reelected member of the House of
Representatives in the elections. And in May 1996, he was elected
president of the NC at the 9th general convention of the party.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister believes in "nation, nationalism and
democratic socialism advocated by the NC," and "dedication to
duty, firmness in devotion and commitment to stabilize democracy."
</P>
<P>
He remains single after his wife died many years ago. He has
one daughter.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Growing Vegetables at South Pole Without Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are raising
their own vegetables at a research station at the South Pole
without using soil as a means of solving the vegetable problem
there.
</P>
<P>
Xia Limin, a secretary of the Antarctic Investigation Office
who recently returned from the station, says that before going
there in 1996 he was trained is soilless cultivation technology at
the Chinese Academy of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
What this generally means is the use of hydroponics, although
other methods are being studied, and through his experiments, Xia
managed to sprout radishes and peas from seeds in four big basins
where a nutrient solution was used. The source of light was
fluorescent lamps.
</P>
<P>
The seeds sprouted after several days and Xia says that he
could get five kilograms of vegetables in ten days. In the past
two years, he has grown 250 kilograms of vegetables, and has had a
sprouting rate of more than 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
He also says that the vegetables are fresh tasting and have no
pollution. By now, all personnel at the station have acquired the
appropriate technology for this.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has decided to allow
foreigners to have total ownership of Thai mutual fund companies
in a bid to clear up stakes held by defunct finance firms.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Financial Restructuring Authority has been seeking
ways to dispose equity in mutual funds held by the 56 firms closed
down last December, said Chalee Chantanayingyong, director of
Thailand's department of the Investment management supervision.
</P>
<P>
Among funds said to be of interest to foreigners is Gs Asset
Management, in which the largest stake is held by General Finance,
one of the closed firms, Monday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
M. L. Pakakaew Boonliang, chief executive of Gs Asset
Management, said although foreigners were interested in local
mutual funds, she felt more comfortable with Thai rather than
foreign investors because marketing focused on the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
But funds with major foreign equity could have the advantage of
access to comprehensive information and analyses from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Changes in the company's rules on equity sales required
approval from shareholders and the restructuring authority.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic Not to Surrender Himself: Serb Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Radovan Karadzic, Bosnia's
most-wanted war crime suspect, is not to surrender himself to a
U.N. tribunal, according to a Serb leader close to Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb member of Bosnia's tripartite
presidency, told reporters on Saturday in Pale, outside Sarajevo,
that Western media reports of Karadzic's imminent surrender were
simply rubbish.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, 52, who has not been seen in public since mid-1996, is
wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia in The Hague (ICTY), together with his army commander,
Gen Ratko Mladic, for crimes of war, against humanity and
genocide.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade-based newspaper Vecernje Novosti Sunday quoted
Krajisnik as saying "All claims that Karadzic will surrender
himself have no foundation."
</P>
<P>
"They are simply speculation," Krajisnik said, following a
meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Bosnia-Hercegovina, Richard
Kavzlarich, who hoped Karadzic would give himself up for trial
before the ICTY.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know where he is and I have no contact with him,"
said Krajisnik.
</P>
<P>
However, Krajisnik admitted that he had contacts with
Karadzic's wife Ljiljana Zelen.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported Karadzic received a lot of letters every
day from the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska, Yugoslavia and
other parts of the world. People asked Karadzic in their letters
not to surrender and hundreds of supporters volunteered to come to
Karadzic's hideaway to protect him, former president of Republika
Srpska.

promising and Prince Ranariddh has at least taken part in the
general election process.
</P>
<P>
In this context, ASEAN Troika would hold a meeting in Bangkok

<P>
YANTAI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Building underground reservoirs
has become an effective way for Longkou City, east China's
Shandong Province, to fight drought.
</P>
<P>
The city, located in a coastal hilly area on the Jiaodong
Peninsula, has an annual water shortage of 47 million cubic
meters. On the other hand, floods during the rainy season have
rushed through the Huangshui River, the only water source for the
city, into the sea without being used.
</P>
<P>
To make better use of the water sources, Longkou city invested
over 60 million yuan (7.22 million US dollars) in building a
series of water-control projects.
</P>
<P>
These projects include a 160,000 square meter underground
reservoir which is six kilometers long and 26.7 meters deep, with
a storage capacity of over 50 million cubic meters; over 2,500
pump wells, 488 ditches, 733 water storage basins along both sides
of the upper reaches of the Huangshui River and four dykes at the
middle reaches of the river.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Symphony Orchestra
plans to employ foreign musicians to improve its overall
performing level, according to the orchestra's chief conductor.
</P>
<P>
Tan Lihua said that his orchestra is weak in wind instruments,
which is a common problem for most Chinese symphony orchestras.
</P>
<P>
"Especially with the French horn," Tan said, "Chinese people
play such musical instruments just like foreigners playing Chinese
Dizi (bamboo flute)."
</P>
<P>
To date, the orchestra has found several musicians in east
European countries and they are expected to come in the second
half of the year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for a Chinese music group to employ
foreign musicians though for many years, some Chinese music groups
have invited foreign musicians as guest players in particular
performances.
</P>
<P>
Monthly pay for each foreign musician is 1,000 US dollars in
addition to free housing and other welfare services.
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I hope that the world's best musicians will come to join
us," Tan said.

SEOUL, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's LG-Caltex Oil
Corp. will import 500,000 barrels of crude oil from Iraq in May,
the company said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The crude oil, which is due to reach South Korea on May 15,
will be at a price of 10.50 U.S. dollars per barrel, some 0.3
dollars cheaper than those in other Gulf countries.

<P>
This will be the first time for South Korea to import crude oil

imposed an economic sanction on the Arab country. Since then,
South Korea has banned imports of Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's forthcoming import of Iraqi oil follows a United

ZHENGZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the development of
CD-ROM technology, electronic publications have been thriving in
China.
</P>
<P>
Before 1994 only 12 kinds of CD-ROMs were produced, but 7.53

100,000 personal computers, 2,700 ATMs, and 20,000 POS.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the province opened inter-bank ATM services, and now

<HEADLINE> Profile: New Nepali PM Girija Prasad Koirala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Girija Prasad Koirala,
president and parliamentary leader of the Nepali Congress, was
appointed Sunday by King Birendra as new prime minister of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
For 73-year-old Koirala, the premiership is nothing new. He
took office in May 1991 as the Kingdom's first popularly elected
prime minister in 30 years. And his brothers Matrika Prasad
Koirala and Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala were also prime ministers
of Nepal in the 1950s and the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
G.P. Koirala began his political career while working at a jute
mill in Biratnagar of eastern Nepal. He participated in the first
industrial strike held in the mill in 1947.
</P>
<P>
He led the labor movement in Biratnagar after the dissolution
of the multi-party system in Nepal in 1960. That year he was
arrested and imprisoned under the State Offense Act for seven
years. He went on a hunger strike in jail for about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Three years after he was released from jail, G.P. Koirala was
arrested again under the Security Act. Later he exiled himself to
India until 1979.
</P>
<P>
Koirala held the post of youth leader of the NC for many years.
In 1976, he was elected the party's general secretary at a party
conference held in India.
</P>
<P>
His active involvement in armed struggle against the partyless
Panchayat system in place for three decades culminated in the
people's movement in February 1990.
</P>
<P>
The movement forced King Birendra to abolish the Panchayat
system and restore the multi-party democratic system in the
country.
</P>
<P>
During the first free elections in May 1991, Koirala was
elected member of the House of Representatives and his party won a
clear majority. He assumed the post of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In March 1994, he resigned and recommended mid-term polls after
losing a key vote in parliament. The polls in November 1994
resulted in a hung parliament where no single party holds a
majority, which in turn leads to the emergence of coalition
politics in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
But Koirala was reelected member of the House of
Representatives in the elections. And in May 1996, he was elected
president of the NC at the 9th general convention of the party.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister believes in "nation, nationalism and
democratic socialism advocated by the NC," and "dedication to
duty, firmness in devotion and commitment to stabilize democracy."
</P>
<P>
He remains single after his wife died many years ago. He has
one daughter.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 types of vegetables
grown in Beijing are now doing well on the international market,
according to today's Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, 93,000 tons of
vegetables like Chinese cabbage, radishes, and lettuce

</P>
<P>
A number of the vegetable producers have set up vegetable sales
representatives in Hong Kong and Taiwan and offices in Japan and
the ROK.
</P>
<P>
The growers have also brought in species and technology from
abroad to produce better tomatoes and green peppers, and the
village of Xiaofengying has a 1,000-ton cold storage warehouse for
vegetable exports.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Against Interference in Its Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia is opposed to
interference in its internal affairs by some big powers, a senior
official said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Countries which like to interfere, out of their own interests,
in the internal affairs of small nations should know that the
people of the small are strongly against it, said Dragan Tomic,
chairman of the National Assembly of the Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
Tomic made the remarks on Radio Pozarevac before the referendum
in Serbia scheduled for April 23, which was initiated by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
In the address, Tomic said that some big powers do not take the
interests of small countries into account when setting up a
so-called new world order aimed at dominating the destiny of the
small ones.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav people do not like them doing so, Tomic stressed.
</P>
<P>
The coming referendum in the Serb Republic is the right
occasion for the people of Yugoslavia to maintain the country's
sovereignty and independence, the chairman added.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in the Serb Republic, who had
refused to hold talks with the Serb government since the breakout
of conflicts with the Serb police in February, now agreed to sit
at the table with the government on March 27 on the precondition
that international coordinators participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, the authorities of both Yugoslavia and the Serb
Repubic are opposed to the internationalization of the Kosovo
issue, which they consider an internal affair of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly of Serbia is set to hold the referendum
on April 23 to decide whether to accept international mediation in
the Kosovo issue.

<HEADLINE> Funeral Reform Deepening in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's funeral reform has
entered a new stage since the State Council issued a set of
regulations strenthening funeral management in 1997.
</P>
<P>
China has all along stressed cremation in reform, which now has
been popularized from the urban areas to the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years, Chinese people have used to burying of
the deceased remains underground, and this has occupied much
land. However, China now has to feed 22 percent of the world's
population with only 7 percent of the world's arable land.
</P>
<P>
In view of the problem, many senior Chinese leaders signed to
be cremated after death in April 1956, promoting cremation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
To date, Shandong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Beijing,
Tianjin and Shanghai have become the first group of provinces and
municipalities in the country to push cremation among all
residents. In 1997, the cremation rate in the country reached 36.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the 1989-1997 period show that cremation had
saved 120,000 hectares of land, 10 million cubic meters of timber
and one billion yuan (120 million US dollars) of funeral fees.
</P>
<P>
Many ways have been used to bury the ashes of the dead, such as
building ash walls, corridors, halls, tombs and scattering the
ashes of the dead into the sea.
</P>
<P>
Many local governments have extended great efforts in
mobilizing people to change their traditional burying habbits,
with over 100,000 cemeteries having been established in the
country's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 420,000 grassroots organizations in charge of funeral
activities are playing a key role in promoting the implementation
of cremation and good customs of funerals throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> China's Oldest Hydropower Plant Still Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's oldest hydropower plant,
which has a history of 88 years, generated 7.8 million kwh of
electricity last year, and is now still doing well.
</P>
<P>
"The Shilongba Hydropower Plant is nothing in history, and
particularly so in terms of its power generating
capacity. However, it represents China's self-reliant efforts,"
said Zhang Junfeng, director of the plant, which is located in
Yunnan province, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the century, the French colonialists wanted
to build a hydropower plant near Dianchi Lake, the largest in
Yunnan. But the demand met with strong opposition from the local
people.
</P>
<P>
In 1910, the local people pooled money and began to build the
plant on their own. It took more than 400 workers three months to
transport equipment imported from Germany to the lake side, only
a four-kilometer distance.
</P>
<P>
Two years later, two generating units went into operation,
providing electricity for 3,000 light bulbs. Local residents
crowded to have a look at the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
During the anti-Japanese war (1937-1945), the plant served as
the power source for armament production and air defence warning,
and survived four raids by Japanese fighters.
</P>
<P>
The early 480-kw capacity of the plant has been expanded to the
current 7,040 kw. In 1957, it became the country's first to use
Chinese-made water turbogenerators.
</P>
<P>
Now the plant has been listed as one of the province's
protected historical sites, and more than 50,000 people from
at home and abroad have visited it.

unmarketable but abundant wild apricots, and selling them
elsewhere. She made a fortune out of it. Later, she turned to
cereals transaction.
</P>
<P>
The city's women federation is attributable to the progress. In
the past few years, it held more than 34,000 training classes on
practical techniques, involving 163,000 women, 111,000 of whom
have learned to use one or two such techniques, and another 1,096
have become farmer technicians.
</P>
<P>
The federation also sponsored 23 training classes on high and
new technologies, and sent 22 women to university. In addition,
1,399 others are attending lessons by an agricultural
correspondence college.
</P>
<P>
The fact that better-educated women do a better work
is inspiring illiterate ones. And the federation's effort in this
regard has helped 25,000 women become literate.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic Not to Surrender Himself: Serb Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Radovan Karadzic, Bosnia's
most-wanted war crime suspect, is not to surrender himself to a
U.N. tribunal, according to a Serb leader close to Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb member of Bosnia's tripartite
presidency, told reporters on Saturday in Pale, outside Sarajevo,
that Western media reports of Karadzic's imminent surrender were
simply rubbish.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, 52, who has not been seen in public since mid-1996, is
wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia in The Hague (ICTY), together with his army commander,
Gen Ratko Mladic, for crimes of war, against humanity and
genocide.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade-based newspaper Vecernje Novosti Sunday quoted
Krajisnik as saying "All claims that Karadzic will surrender
himself have no foundation."
</P>
<P>
"They are simply speculation," Krajisnik said, following a
meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Bosnia-Hercegovina, Richard
Kavzlarich, who hoped Karadzic would give himself up for trial
before the ICTY.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know where he is and I have no contact with him,"
said Krajisnik.
</P>
<P>
However, Krajisnik admitted that he had contacts with
Karadzic's wife Ljiljana Zelen.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported Karadzic received a lot of letters every
day from the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska, Yugoslavia and
other parts of the world. People asked Karadzic in their letters
not to surrender and hundreds of supporters volunteered to come to
Karadzic's hideaway to protect him, president of former Republika
Srpska.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Investment In Infrastructures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to increase
investment in infrastructures as a way to promote domestic demand
and ensure the planned eight-percent economic growth rate this
year, "Economic Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
It says that 10.1 billion yuan will be added to large and
medium-sized railway projects this year and 245 billion yuan over
the next five years, instead of the 100 billion yuan as was
previously planned.
</P>
<P>
In highway construction, 500 billion yuan will be spent for the
next three years. This year's amount will be 160 billion yuan,
instead of the original 120 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China planned to build at least 1,000 km of expressways over
the next three years, but now plans to spend enough for building
at least 4,000 km of expressways.
</P>
<P>
Investment in postal and telecommunications projects for the
same period will also be up, to 150 billion yuan from the
previously-planned 130 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The state has decided to add 120 billion yuan for the period to
sewage and garbage treatment in cities and 110 billion yuan for
water projects to solve the water problems of 100 cities.
</P>
<P>
The increased infrastructure funds will come from domestic bank
loans, limited use of long-term bond issues, public listing of
some highway and bridge projects, an increase of certain water
fees and railway transport fees, and from more overseas and
special coal, power, transportation, and telecommunications
funds.

<HEADLINE> Death Tolls in Hunger Rise in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 36 people have died of
hunger while the drought brought about by the El Nino phenomenon
persisted in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star reported on Monday that health officials in
southern Mindanao have warned of more deaths among people who were
forced to eat poisonous tubers due to the food crisis.
</P>
<P>
Health official Tahir Salaik was quoted as saying that "many
deaths among indigenous communities even remain unreported."
</P>
<P>
Many children in rural areas in the region are very weak and
are experiencing malnutrition, the report added.
</P>
<P>
"There are many children who are very weak. I don't think they
can recover without due attention soon," said Mahilinde
Zambarrano, another health official working in the region.
</P>
<P>
Many provinces in Mindanao are reeling from the El Nino-induced
drought. Agricultural crops have been wiped out, resulting in
shortage of food supply. The severe lack of food drove tribal folk
to eat a type of yam which is toxic when not prepared properly.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos has ordered the release of 23 million
pesos (some 605,263 U.S. dollars). However, food aid has only been
trickling to the hunger-stricken region, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Three more state-owned saw mills
will be added to the privatization scheme in Myanmar, The New
Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The saw mills of the Forestry Ministry are in the country's
Sagaing division where more than two dozen similar saw mills have
been handed over to private entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
In early January, some 42 state-run factories under the
Ministries of Industry, Livestock Breeding and Fishery, and
Commerce, and other two livestock breeding farms as well as 76
cinemas of the Information Ministry were also designated to be
privatized, according to an earlier official report.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar announced privatization of 51 state-owned
economic enterprises (SEEs) in the first phase in January 1995,
the privatization process has been underway in various forms
including auctioning and leasing out the SEEs or establishing
joint ventures with local and foreign entrepreneurs or operating
either under buy-back or counter-trade system.

<HEADLINE> South China's Guangzhou City Plans Public Land Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, will auction off the use rights for
two plots of land next June, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Heralding it as an experimental move, local officials said that
they would strive to conduct the auction professionally and with
great caution.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the two parcels of land, each with
an area of about 53,000 sq m, are designed for developing
open-market residential buildings and have been taken over by the
Guangzhou Land Development Center.
</P>
<P>
One parcel is located south of Industrial Road in southern
Guangzhou and the other is west of the Airport Road in
northwestern Guangzhou. Demolishing existing buildings, removing
debris and leveling the ground have been completed on the two
pieces of land thus far, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The sale will give owners use right of the land for a term of
70 years.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Huasui Auction Co., auctioneer in this move, said
it would operate the whole procedure according to the country's
Auction Law and standard international practice.
</P>
<P>
"Opening bids for the lands are still being evaluated," the
newspaper quoted a local land official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official disclosed that organizers expect to earn at least
200 million yuan from the sale of the parcel in the northwestern
part of the city. This patch will be divided into four to six
parts and be auctioned separately in a bid to get immediate
payment.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the auction was made after a full
investigation into the market, banks and real estate developers.
</P>
<P>
Replacing free land distribution that marked the nation's
planned economy, Guangzhou started to sell its land use right
first in 1979, in cooperation with a Hong Kong real estate
developers. Cost of the land was counted as part of the
investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province plans to cut the
number of spindles by 120,000 and lay off 14,000 workers in the
textile sector this year to reduce losses.
</P>
<P>
The first 20,000 spindles were destroyed recently in Chengdu, the
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the effort is to avoid 60 million yuan in losses
this year, according to a provincial textile official.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has long been a textile center in southwest
China. It will focus its reduction efforts mainly on Chengdu,
Mianyang, Neijiang, Leshan and Zigong, its five most important
textile producers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the campaign to avoid overproduction will have to
give equal attention to finding employment for the laidoff workers,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The textile sector has been one of China's biggest money
losers. In recent months, spindle-reduction has become a
nationwide campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Largely by opening to the outside,
Hainan Province in south China has accumulated strength over the
past decade for economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
China's largest special economic zone (SEZ), the island
province has been making efforts to invite capital, professionals,
and technologies from overseas in developing its economy.
</P>
<P>
During the period, it used 7.5 billion US dollars and 50
billion yuan of overseas and domestic investment, accounting for
70 percent of the total fixed asset investment, government sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The province now has over 10,000 joint ventures, which in
some places contribute 70 percent to local industrial and
commercial taxes.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has been directing investment into its priority
development areas. As a result, 75 percent of coming capital in
the past four years went to newly emerging industries,
high-efficient tropical agriculture, tourism, and other
infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The youngest province, which has been formed in 1988, has
established economic and trade relations with more than 60
countries and regions, and imported large amount of advanced
technologies and management expertise.
</P>
<P>
Some multinational corporations, such as DuPond and Daewoo,
have also opened businesses on the island.
</P>
<P>
The province also serves as a pilot area for China to try new
policies. The 30-square-kilometer Yangpu Economic Development
Zone, for example, initiated the practice of foreign investors
building infrastructure by signing land-use contracts with the
province.
</P>
<P>
A SEZ compensation regulation on investment in infrastructure
has greatly encouraged investors to go into the power, highways
and airports sectors.

U.S. dollars one person can take out of the country, Philippine

It added that "necessary documentation" would be needed for

The comprehensive military drills represents another milestone
in the PLA's modernization drive, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese army initiated the first of its comprehensive
drills in the 1950s after the PLA won the war of liberation. The
intensive training helped lift the then largely guerrilla PLA to
the standards of a modern army.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the army received basic training in
combat using atomic and chemical weapons. However, the principles
as well as training courses followed those of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
The second large-scale drill was conducted in the 1960s. By
then China had designed its own training programs. The drill was
culminated in a series of competition involving combat skills at
various levels which produced thousands of outstanding officers
and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, the PLA exercises focused on developing skills to
fight wars involving tanks, warplanes and airborne forces, in
addition to wars using atomic, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The last massive military exercises which were carried out in
the 1980s stressed PLA services and the ability to coordinate
efforts as well as the command skills of PLA officers.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Ends McLaren Dominance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Double world champion
Michael Schumacher ended McLaren's dominance of two previous
Formula One races on Sunday as he achieved the 28th victory of his
career in the Argentine Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The German's first triumph of the season boosted him up to
the second in the drivers' standings after Finn Mika Hakkinen of
McLaren.
</P>
<P>
For McLaren, the result ended a run of three successive one-two
finishes -- the final race of 1997 and the two opening grands prix
this year in Australia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher finished in a time of one hour 48 minutes 36.175
seconds, 22.9 seconds clear of second-placed Hakkinen in the
leading McLaren. His Ferrari team mate Eddie Irvine was third, a
further 34 seconds adrift.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Wurz of Austria finished fourth in a Benetton, Jean
Alesi fifth for Sauber and David Coulthard sixth in the second
McLaren.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine race was an incident-filled one marred with
several collisions. Even Schumacher was among the spinners as he
collided with Briton Coulthard, but he survived the incident and
brought his car home triumphantly.

LISBON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Third seed Alberto Berasategui
outplayed former world number one Thomas Muster 3-6, 6-1, 6-3 in
the Estoril Open final here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard appeared to be in trouble early on as he had a
bandage adjusted on his left leg at 4-3 in the first set. But he
defied his injury and played the second and third sets far more
aggressively, with accurate service returns and some vicious aces.
</P>
<P>
It was Berasategui's first success in four matches against
Muster. Barbara Schwartz of Austria defeated Spaniard Raluca
Sandu 6-2, 6-3 in the women's final.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Fourth-seeded Mary Pierce of
France beat sixth-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain to win the
Bausch &AMP; Lomb Championships held at Amelia Island, Florida, on
Sunday
</P>
<P>
Pierce dominated the final two sets to claim the title with a
6-7 (8-10), 6-0, 6-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
The two-time runner-up in the last two years said, "it feels
good to win it after three times in the final."
</P>
<P>
Pierce, who beat top seed Lindsay Davenport in the semi-finals,
rebounded from the first set loss when she abandoned trying to
trade groundstrokes with Martinez from the baseline and began to
vigorously attack net.
</P>
<P>
The French player, who is 13-2 for the year and won the Paris
Indoors title in February, earned 79,000 U.S. dollars for the
victory that will move her world ranking to the fifth on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ninth-ranked Martinez, who reached the Australian Open
final in January, has 28 career titles, including Wimbledon in
1994, but she hasn't won a tournament since Moscow in November of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Martinez, the 1995 champion, won 31,500 dollars as runner-up in
the the two hour, one minute match.
</P>
<P>
Pierce had 44 winners to just 11 for Martinez, but she gave
away her big advantage with a whopping 51 unforced errors compared
to 25 by the Spaniard.

<HEADLINE> Paula Jones to Decide Whether to Appeal This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Paula Jones, whose harassment
lawsuit against U.S. President Bill Clinton was dismissed by a
federal judge on April 1, is planning to announce whether she will
appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Jones will likely reveal her decision Thursday,
spokeswoman Susan Carpenter McMillan said Sunday, according to
reports.
</P>
<P>
McMillan declined to say whether she would appeal. Mrs. Jones
was expected to announce the decision herself.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Jones, 31, claimed that Clinton propositioned her in an
Arkansas hotel room in 1991 when she was a state worker. Clinton
said he doesn't recall ever meeting her and has firmly denied
anything improper happened.
</P>
<P>
If Mrs. Jones does appeal, her case would go before 8th Circuit
Court of Appeals in St. Louis, the same court that overruled Judge
Susan Webber Wright in 1996 by saying the sexual harassment case
could go to trial while Clinton is president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton's private attorney has urged Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr to refer his investigation into Whitewater
figure David Hale to the Justice Department because of an alleged
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
Presidential attorney David Kendall, in a five-page letter to
Starr, cited links between the independent counsel and
conservative groups that may have financially supported Hale.
Kendall also accused Starr of not being impartial because he
relied heavily on Hale's testimony to convict Clinton's former
business partners, Susan and the late James McDougal.
</P>
<P>
Kendall stressed that handing the matter over to Justice would
not affect Starr's integrity or independence and would in fact
"increase public confidence in the outcome of the investigation,
whatever it is."

<HEADLINE> Blair, Mitchell Warn N.Irish Violence to Come </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and Northern Ireland peace talks chairman George Mitchell Sunday
expressed concern that there might be some violence in the
province over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement reached Friday must be approved by separate
referendums in Northern Ireland and Ireland on May 22. Although
the Ulster Unionist Party, the main pro-British Protestant group,
approved the peace deal Saturday, some breakaway republican groups
have denounced the agreement while Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the Irish Republican Army, is still studying the deal.
</P>
<P>
"There will be people who don't want to make the changes
necessary, who are going to try to do everything they can to try
to stop this agreement, and we've got to have the people of vision
triumph over that," Blair was reported as telling reporters in
Spain, where he is on a short holiday.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. senator Mitchell also warned that extremists may
try to scupper the deal in the run-up to the referendum next
month.
</P>
<P>
"There are people on both sides who want to disrupt this
process who are committed to the way of violence and I expect they
will step up their activities between now and the date of the
referendum and thereafter," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But it's been going on a long time and people recognize it for
what it is, so my hope is that it won't destabilize the process,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
It is now crucial for the British and Irish governments to
ensure a "yes" vote in the two referendums on May 22, for a "no"
vote in either one would doom the deal reached after 22 months of
hard talks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Policies Obstruct Mideast Peace: Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- An Arab member of the Israeli
Knesset (Parliament) said here on Sunday that the policies of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are the hurdles to
peace-making in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"No peace can be achieved within the Likud-led government's
policies ... Time is now ripe for unveiling the Israeli premier's
maneuvers," Saleh Tarif told reporters after a meeting with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Tarif, who heads the Internal Affairs Committee of the Israeli
Knesset, described as "a political ploy" Israel's recent offer to
withdraw from south Lebanon with security guarantees from Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Israel agreed on April 1 to accept the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 425, which calls for unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon. But in the meantime, it demanded security
arrangements be worked out with Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which agree to coordinate their stances on
all key issues, have rejected the offer, insisting that the Jewish
state pull out of Lebanon unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Tarif said that Netanyahu is trying to use the proposal to
divert attention from the real crisis facing the peace talks with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He warned of the deteriorating economic conditions in the
Palestinian self-rule territories, noting that efforts should be
made to push forward the peace process to avert an explosion of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks came to a standstill March
1997 when Israel broke ground for the construction of a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as
capital of their future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sends Medicines to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- A 40-truck Egyptian convoy carrying
medicines and medical equipment worth 14 million pounds (4.12
million U.S. dollars) left here Sunday for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The supplies are sent to Iraq under the second stage of the
U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food agreement, which allows Iraq to sell 2.1
billion dollars worth of oil every six months to purchase food,
medicines and other basic necessities. The convoy was expected to
arrive in Baghdad in five days.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian delegation has recently visited Baghdad and held
talks with Iraqi officials on further medical supplies to the
country under the current third stage of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Egyptian Pharmaceuticals Holding Company Galal
Ghourab said the company has so far received orders to send to
Iraq medical supplies worth 14 million pounds (4.12 million
dollars) under the third stage of the deal.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ease the worsening economic situation in the
country caused by crippling U.N. sanctions, the U.N. Security
Council voted unanimously in February to allow Baghdad to increase
the amount of oil it can sell from 2.1 billion dollars to 5.2
billion dollars over six months.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed against Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990
can not be lifted until Iraq has complied with the U.N.
resolutions demanding it to destroy all weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expected to Visit Ireland, N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Northern Ireland peace
mediator George Mitchell and a congressman said Sunday that they
expected President Bill Clinton to visit Ireland and Northern
Ireland to generate support for the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Peter King, a New York Republican member of the House of
Representatives, told the Fox News Sunday television program that
he thought Clinton intended to go.
</P>
<P>
"I think he should definitely go to Belfast and Dublin. I think
he will; that's my understanding from people I've spoken to that
right now his current intention is to go," King said.
</P>
<P>
However, a White House spokesman said no decision had been made
on the visit, but the president was considering the trip.
</P>
<P>
Ireland and the British-rule Northern Ireland were to hold
separate referendum on May 22 to decide the fate of the peace deal
announced on Friday. A "no" vote in either plebiscite would doom
the delicate compromise proposals.
</P>
<P>
The agreement seeks to end three decades of sectarian strife in
Northern Ireland by altering constitutional arrangements for the
province.
</P>
<P>
George Mitchell, the U.S. mediator for the Northern Ireland
talks, said he hoped the president would visit, but he added that
Clinton was waiting to see what British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern thought best.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the TV program "this week" of the American
Broadcasting Company (ABC), Mitchell heralded Clinton's role in
brokering the peace pact for Northern Ireland last week and
stressed that all sides must now ensure ultimate success of the
deal to end three decades of sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement really doesn't finalize peace. It creates the
opportunity for peace and reconciliation," Mitchell said. "It's a
good first step, but there's still a long way to go."
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said he believed a return Clinton visit to Northern
Ireland in the coming months would bolster support for the peace
pact before a voter referendum on May 22.
</P>
<P>
Clinton traveled to both Northern Ireland's capital, Belfast,
and Dublin, capital of the Republic of Ireland, in 1995. He is
"the only American president ever to have visited Northern Ireland
while in office," said Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
On May 15, Clinton is visiting Britain to attend the three-day
Birmingham meeting of the Group of Eight, namely the world's seven
major industrialized countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
British media reports said that Clinton might offer millions of
dollars investment in Northern Ireland and provide an economic
incentive for voters to endorse the deal.

<HEADLINE> Gangs, Violent Crime Rise in U.S. Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Street gangs in schools nearly
doubled and violent crime increased by 25 percent in the United
States in six years from 1989 to 1995, said a government report
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Surveys found that street gangs were spotted in schools by 28.4
percent of students questioned in 1995 compared with 15.3 percent
in 1989, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the
National Center for Education Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, violent crime at school -- physical attacks or a
robbery by force, weapon or threat -- was reported by 4.2 percent
of students in 1995, up 23.5 percent from 3.4 percent in 1989, the
Justice and Education departments said.
</P>
<P>
Learning the facts, U.S. President Bill Clinton called the
findings "unacceptable" and urged Congress to approve initiatives
he offered a year ago to fight against gangs and youth violence.
</P>
<P>
"Gangs -- and the guns, drugs and violence that go with them --
must be stopped from ever reaching the schoolhouse door," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Pascal D. Forgione, Jr., U.S. Commissioner of Education
Statistics, noted that the 0.8 percentage points represented an
increase of about 270,000 students and the gang increase came in
every type of community.
</P>
<P>
In central cities, students reporting street gangs rose from
24.8 percent to 40.7 percent; in suburbs, from 14.0 percent to
26.3 percent; and in non-metropolitan areas, from 7.8 percent to
19.9 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that violent crime by juveniles peaked in
1994 and has declined for two years since then. Arrests of
teenagers for violent crimes dropped 2.9 percent in 1995 and 9.2
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Gangs in schools also have decreased in the last couple of
years. In 1993, a study found 35 percent of students saying
"fighting" gangs were present in their schools.
</P>
<P>
On other aspects, the survey found in 1995 that 65.3 percent of
students reported that marijuana, cocaine, crack, uppers or
downers were available at school compared with 63.2 percent in
1989.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 survey also found that about one in 20 students said
they saw another students with a gun at school.
