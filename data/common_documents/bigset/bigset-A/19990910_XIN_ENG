<HEADLINE> U.S. Suspends Military Ties with Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday suspended all military ties with Indonesia because it
said the Indonesian government had failed to contain the crisis in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"We are officially suspending our military-to-military
relationship," with Indonesia, said Navy Rea Admiral Craig Quigley,
a Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Quigley said the decision was made jointly by Defense
Secretary William Cohen and Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The decision was conveyed overnight
to Gen. Wiranto, chief of Indonesia's military forces, by Navy
Adm. Dennis Blair, commander of U.S. Pacific Command.
</P>
<P>
Suspending relations with the Indonesian military means an
indefinite end to planning for any future joint military
exercises and no further exchanges of liaison officers, Quigley
said. He said it was not immediately clear whether the decision
would result in the expulsion of any Indonesian military
officers who might be attending military academies in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In addition to freezing all military exercises and exchanges
of officers for training and other programs, the Pentagon also
suspended an invitation to Wiranto to attend a meeting of
Asia-Pacific defense chiefs in Hawaii next month, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Shelton told the Senate Armed Services
Committee that the crisis in East Timor presents no threat to
U.S. national interests that would justify placing American
troops on the ground there.
</P>
<P>
He said the Clinton administration had not yet ruled out
taking an active role in helping resolve the crisis, but he said
he saw no need to commit U.S. forces. He cited the possibility
of contributing U.S. military communications, logistics or
transport aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at East Timor by itself, I cannot see any
national interest there that would be overwhelming, that would
call for us to deploy or place U.S. forces on the ground in that
area," Shelton said.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Cooperation for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday said that reform tools, strengthening
leadership, maximizing resources and improving impact are very
important for the cooperation between the United Nations and its
partners for development.
</P>
<P>
In his annual report to the upcoming 54th session of the
General Assembly, which is to open on September 14, Annan said,
"In an increasingly interdependent world, the challenges of
development can be met only through well-planned, coordinated and
adequately funded international action."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations and its partners have extraordinary
capacities in the development field," he said. "The challenge is
to use them more effectively and synergistically."
</P>
<P>
Reform tools includes common country assessment and United
Nations development assistance, he said. "Through the common
country assessment and the United Nations Development Assistance
Framework (9NDAF), the United Nations has for the first time the
tools needed to provide strategic and coordinated support for the
development goals of national Governments."
</P>
<P>
Strengthening leadership is included in the resident
coordinator system, he said. "These have included new selection
procedures for resident coordinators to broaden the basis for
recruitment and improve the gender balance, performance appraisals
of resident coordinators and country teams."
</P>
<P>
Maximizing resources mean harmonization and United Nations
houses, he said. "In response to a call by the General Assembly
for greater harmonization and simplification of the policies and
procedures used by the United Nations bodies, 100 country teams
have now planned to have their individual programming cycles begin
at the same time, and all country programs will have harmonized
cycles by 2004."
</P>
<P>
Improving impact stands for inter-agency support, Annan said."
The United Nations Development Group has set up a number of
inter-agency groups to provide support to country teams."
</P>
<P>
Working together and strengthening the link between relief
and development are also important, he said.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Businesses Urged to Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa has a major
problem of competitiveness and businessmen have to change their
way of management, said a leader of the Institute of Directors
(IoD) in Southern Africa Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Manning, chairman of the IoD, made the statement at
the opening of the Joint Convention between the IoD Zimbabwe and
IoD in Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the two-day convention is: "At the crossroads? --
Doing business in Southern Africa".
</P>
<P>
Manning said: "We have a major competitiveness problem in the
region and the question is how quickly to change the way we manage
our organizations".
</P>
<P>
It is dangerous for business people to assume that they have
found the formula for success because things are constantly
changing, he said. He noted that the world of the year 2000
will be quite different from that of 1995 and is going to change
at an accelerated pace with the life cycles of industries being
shortened.
</P>
<P>
Every business, he said, faces the danger of probable decline
and companies are in a race to make a difference to their
customers in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
He urged managers to adapt themselves to the Changing world so
as to solve the problem of competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> EU Still Concerned Over U.S. Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
in its newly published report that the European Union (EU) is
still concerned seriously over trade barriers preventing European
businesses from operating in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive released the annual report on U.S. barriers to
trade and investment, saying the extra-territoriality "is a
long-standing and growing feature of the U.S. legal system
manifesting itself in - among others - the fields of environment,
banking, tax and export control".
</P>
<P>
"While the EU may share some of the objections underlying such
laws, it is opposed, as a matter of law and principle, to the
extraterritorial application of domestic legislation insofar as it
purports to force persons present in - and companies incorporated
in - the EU to follow U.S. laws or policies outside the U.S. and
to the extent that it serves only to protect U.S. trade or
political interests," the report said.
</P>
<P>
For the moment, at least, the two most insidious U.S. laws as
far as the EU is seriously concerned over appear to have been
suspended, the Commission said, referring to the Helms Burton
Libertad Act of 1996 targeting foreign trade with Cuba and the
1996 Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA).
</P>
<P>
However, "variations of the same problem can be found in, inter
alia, various environmentally-driven embargoes, export control
legislation, as well as, at the sub-federal level, selective
purchasing laws," the report points out.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive noted "an unwelcome development" with the
introduction of several sub-federal selective purchasing laws in
public procurement, citing an example that the Massachusetts Burma
law is restricting the ability of EU and other companies doing
business with specific countries to bid for contracts in various
states and cities. The law acted because of human rights concerns
in Burma, the report added.
</P>
<P>
These concern investment restrictions, lengthy proceedings,
conditionality of market access and reciprocity-based procedures.
"This situation is not in line with the open market access policy
advocated by the U.S.," the European Union executive added.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Continue to Resolve Coalition Crisis in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Israel's
Finance Ministry and Education Ministry continued their efforts
Thursday to find a way out of a coalition crisis over the
governmental funding of religious schools.
</P>
<P>
The powerful ultra-Orthodox religious party Shas has threatened
to quit the coalition of Prime Minister Ehud Barak if the
government does not transfer 12 million shekels (about 2.85
million U.S. dollars) to its educational networks before the
beginning of the Jewish New Year, which falls on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of teachers in the party's schools have not received
their salaries for the last three month.
</P>
<P>
Finance and education officials have insisted that Shas has to
formulate a reform plan before the transfer of money can be made,
citing reports that millions of shekels have been wasted due to
mismanagement and alleged corruption.
</P>
<P>
The religious institutes enjoyed preferential treatment in the
three years of rule of the former right-wing prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, raising resentment among the secular public.
</P>
<P>
In the campaign leading to his election victory in May, Barak
pledged to change the national priorities and stop the overflow of
money to the religious schools and institutes.
</P>
<P>
But Barak has apparently backed down from his domestic reform
plan since he included the Shas, the third largest party in the
parliament, in his coalition in order to garner wide support for
his goal to move forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
If the 17 Shas legislators walked away, Barak's coalition
would be reduced to a 51-seat minority as another ultra-religious
party, the United Torah Judaism, which controls five seats,
announced a few days ago to quit the cabinet to protest Barak's
consent to transporting heavy power equipment on Shabath, the
Jewish weekend when driving is banned by religious laws.
</P>
<P>
To protest over the funding crisis, Shas boycotted a
parliamentary voting Wednesday night on the latest peace accord
Barak signed with Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Due to the Shas boycott, the agreement was approved only by a
narrow majority of 52-23 and with the help of 10 Arab legislators,
who sit outside the government.
</P>
<P>
But the possibility of Shas quitting the coalition is
relatively low since the party, which represents low-income Middle
East Jews, has to depend on the government to fund its generous
educational and welfare networks, which have contributed to its
election success.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Wednesday that the salaries of the teachers in
Shas' schools should be paid before a comprehensive review of the
educational system of the party can be made.

<HEADLINE> 11 Iraqi Civilians Injured in Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Eleven Iraqi civilians were
injured on Thursday in U.S.-British warplanes' attacks on
civilian targets in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 9:15 (0515 GMT) and 12:05 (0805
GMT), a total of 36 formations of U.S. and British warplanes
coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi
airspace over Basrah, Thi-Qar, Muthana, Najaf and Qadisiyah
provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy warplanes bombed some civilian and service
facilities in the region and injured 11 civilians, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the enemy planes
and forced them to flee to their bases, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ten formations of U.S. and British warplanes coming from
Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over Neineva,
Erbil and Dohuk provinces at 10:00 (0600 GMT) in the day,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made 12,283 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq, and have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian
facilities and military sites, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led
western allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed
aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Deliver Redeployment Map to Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua)-- Israel has decided to
deliver Thursday evening a map of troop redeployments in the
West Bank to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and explain to him
from which area Israel will pull out its troops, Israel Radio
said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials met behind the closed doors
Thursday and discussed in details about the troop redeployment map
prepared by Israel in order to carry out the newly signed Sharm
El-Sheikh agreement, the Radio quoted government and military
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
So far, no details about the redeployment map have been
disclosed, but Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak told the
Radio Thursday that the new map prepared by the Israeli military
is similar to the old one prepared by the previous government.
</P>
<P>
No significant changes were made to the old map, but the
Israeli military will hand over more territories of northern
West Bank to the Palestinians in the future redeployment, Shahak
added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El-Sheikh agreement, the Israeli military is
first to redeploy from 7 percent of the West Bank, transferring
it from Israeli-controlled Area C to Palestinian
civilians-controlled Area B.
</P>
<P>
On November 15, a 2 percent transfer will be made from Area C
to full Palestinian controlled Area A and 3 percent from Area C
to Area B. In January next year, a 1 percent transfer will take
place from Area C to Area and 5.1 percent from Area C to Area A.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Israeli cabinet approved the redeployment
map and the first 7 percent troop redeployment while the
Knesset (parliament) ratified the Sharm El-Sheikh peace accord,
paving the way for future troop redeployment from the West
Bank and Thursday's release of 200 Palestinian prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Police Officials to Be Interrogated for </HEADLINE>

<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Interior Minister Habib
el-Adli referred three top police officials in Port Said to a
disciplinary council on Thursday for interrogation for failure to
perform their duty during a visit there by President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Monday, Mubarak was attacked and slightly injured by a
knife-wielding man described as an Islamic fanatic when the
president was riding to a meeting in the Mediterranean port, 180
kilometers northeast of Cairo, at the northern end of the Suez
Canal.
</P>
<P>
The three officers are Port Said Security Director Maj. Gen.
Hassan Abdel Motteleb Othman Jebril, Director of State Security
Investigation Maj. Gen. Abdullah Nasr and Criminal Investigation
Director Brig. Mohammad Sallem Shalan, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
If convicted by the disciplinary council, they will face
dismissal and revocation of pension and benefits, an Interior
Ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The three officials were transferred to other posts outside the
Port Said Directorate as of Tuesday, the news agency said without
mentioning their new posts.
</P>
<P>
El-Adli on Wednesday appointed Maj. Gen. Mohammad Farid
Hassanein, Maj. Gen. Nazih Gad and former Deputy Security Director
of Giza Governorate Brig. Azmi Badawi to replace the three
officials in question, it said.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, the interior minister dismissed Mohamed Hani
al-Ezaby as the intelligence chief and gave him the post of the
border security chief, the news agency said. Al-Ezaby was replaced
by his deputy, Salah Eddin Mustafa Salama, it added.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Arabic-language daily Al-Ahram
published on Thursday, Mubarak blamed the attack on lax security.
He singled out the three Port Said security heads, and said he
will order security reviews in all areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's total
mining output for the three months to July 1999 decreased by 1.1
percent after seasonal adjustment compared with the previous three
months, Statistics South Africa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The slip was mainly due to a reduction in gold output, besides
the exceptional decline in June's output, which was 4.3 percent
lower than May, the state statistical bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The yield of non-gold minerals reflected a slight increase of
0.3 percent after seasonal adjustment during this period, mainly
due to increases in the production of copper, platinum and
manganese.
</P>
<P>
The value of mineral sales maintains a declining trend, the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Both gold (-7.0 percent) and non-gold (-3.5 percent) sales
contributed to the decrease of 4.8 percent in the total seasonally
adjusted mineral sales during the three months to June 1999
compared with the previous three months.

UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has rejected
U.N. proposed military intervention in East Timor, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"(Indonesian) President B.J. Habibie today told the members of
the Security Council mission visiting Jakarta that he will welcome
any form of international assistance to deal with East Timor
except military, rejecting the Council mission's offer of a
multi-national force to restore law and order to the territory,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The President repeated the assurances that the Indonesian
authorities would get the situation under control," he added.
</P>
<P>
Entering the U.N. headquarters here, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan also said Indonesia indicated that the martial law is
just taking force in East Timor and that with a bit of time the
Indonesians will be able to bring the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
U.N. personnel in East Timor reported that the situation around
the compound of the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was "the
quietest" Wednesday since Monday and things "had marginally
improved".
</P>
<P>
However attempts to reach UNAMET's warehouse in the port area
of Dili, the capital, again were halted by anti-independence
militia Thursday as they fired over the head U.N. staff despite
the presence of Indonesian military escort, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's U.N. Ambassador Makarim Wibisono said Thursday
violence in East Timor was subsiding with no more arson or burning
or looting reported.
</P>
<P>
The five-member Security Council mission is scheduled to meet
the Indonesian military chief on Friday and to visit East Timor on
Saturday.
</P>

Annan said the U.N. is waiting for the return of the mission to
get the first-hand knowledge about the situation in East Timor.

<HEADLINE> IMF May Help Romania Avoid Financial Crisis: Moody's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Inferior ratings granted for
the loan risk of Romania reflects economic confusion and political
dissension which place the country in front of a major financial
crisis, commented the local Nine O'clock daily on Thursday citing
a recent report on Romania made by the international rating agency
Moody's.
</P>
<P>
The rating for Romania - B3 for the debt in foreign currency,
Caa1 for banking deposits in foreign currency and Caa1 for the
debt in home currency, are accompanied by a perspective of steady
rating, because they already express "a very big probability of an
incapacity of payment," Moody's said.
</P>
<P>
If the new accord with International Monetary Fund (IMF) signed
in August is implemented successfully, Romania could avoid the
financial crisis. However, Moody's recalled that "four previous
programs with IMF ended prematurely because Romania failed to meet
its obligations."
</P>
<P>
"Compliance with the program assumed with IMF will also open
the way for other financing from other external official sources,
such as the World Bank. Under such conditions, the foreign
currency resources of Romania will become enough to cover the
payment obligations of external debt on the short term," Moody's
explained.
</P>
<P>
Romania has an external debt estimated at 9.6 billion U.S.
dollars representing roughly 26 percent of its GDP, the Moody's
report said.

<P>
The commentary asked the U.S. official to be clear about who
should be responsible for the current tension.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, cross-straits relations have made progress
under the principle of "One China," but Lee's remarks have denied
this long-time principle of the two sides, the commentary said,
noting that Lee has attempted to separate Taiwan from China's
territory and thoroughly destroyed the basis for cross-straits
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
History and reality have repeatedly proved that Lee Teng-hui is
the main block to the development of cross-straits relations, the
number one troublemaker for Sino-U.S. relations, and a cause of
instability in the Asia-Pacific Region, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary further asked, Who should take the blame, if not
Lee?
</P>
<P>
There are always some people in the world who do not want to
see a reunified, prosperous and strong China and have attempted to
create blocks to the peaceful reunification of China, the
commentary said, adding that these people should learn from
history.
</P>
<P>
The commentary went on to stress that there is only one China
in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the sacred
Chinese territory. The Taiwan issue is the internal affair of
China, and an issue between Chinese on the two sides of the
straits, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has emphasized time and again its desire
for a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan Question, but has not
promised to abandon the use of force, the commentary said. It is
necessary for the Chinese people to defend their state sovereignty
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people love peace, but people should remember that
in modern times China has never been afraid of the threat of force,
" the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of stable Sino-U.S. relations is in the
common interest of both countries and their people, and conducive
to the peace, stability and prosperity of the world, the
commentary noted, and it urged the U.S. Government to abide by the
three communiques between the two governments.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Humanitarian Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday said that "understanding causes is the first
step to successful prevention" of the humanitarian challenges.
namely the natural disasters and armed conflicts in the world at
large.
</P>
<P>
The statement was contained in Annan's annual report on the
work of the United Nations, which, released here Thursday, is to
be submitted to the upcoming 54th General Assembly session,
scheduled for September 14.
</P>
<P>
On natural disasters, Annan said, "The world has experienced
three times as many great natural disasters in the 1990s as in the
1960s -- while emergency aid funds have declined by 40 percent in
the past five years alone, according to the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
</P>
<P>
"Today's disasters are sometimes man-made, and human action
--or inaction-- exacerbates virtually all of them," he said,
"Poverty and population pressures increase the costs of natural
hazards because more and more people have been forced to live in
harms' way -- on flood plains, earthquake-prone zones and unstable
hillsides."
</P>
<P>
"Unsustainable development practices also contribute to the
rising impact of natural hazards," he said.
flooding."
</P>
<P>
On Conflicts, he said, "the most worrying development in 1998
was a significant increase in the number of wars."
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, poor countries have been far more likely to
be embroiled in armed conflicts than rich ones," he said.
"Economic decline is also strongly associated with violent
conflict, not least because the politics of a shrinking economy
are inherently more conflictual than those of economic growth."
</P>
<P>
"But in other cases, armed conflict has less to do with ethnic,
national or other enmities than the struggle to control economic
resources," he said. "The pursuit of diamonds, drugs, timber
concessions and other valuable commodities drives a number of
today's internal wars," which are the main characteristics of
today's armed conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Unfair Media Attention Contributes to Humanitarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday blamed the unfair media attention for part
of the causes for a lack of consistent response by the
international community to humanitarian emergencies, such as the
conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement in his annual report on the work of
the Organization, which is issued here Thursday. The report will
be considered by the upcoming 54th session of the General
Assembly, which is to open on September 14.
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian challenge is heightened by the fact that the
international community does not respond in a consistent way to
humanitarian emergencies," he said. "Media attention is part of
the problem."
</P>
<P>
"The crisis in Kosovo, for example, received saturation
coverage," he said. "The more protracted and deadly war between
Eritrea and Ethiopia, and the resumption of Angola's savage
civil war received very little."
</P>
<P>
"Other wars went almost entirely unreported," he said. "Partly
for that reason, responses to appeals for humanitarian and
security assistance have been similarly skewed."
</P>
<P>
"It is my strong view that such assistance should not be
allocated on the basis of media coverage, politics or geography,"
he said. "Its sole criterion should be human need."
</P>
<P>
"I am particularly alarmed by the international community's
poor response to the needs of victims of war and natural
disasters in Africa," he said.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Lessons from Kosovo crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Thursday three lessons can be learned from the
diplomatic failure in preventing recent crises, including the
crisis in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks in his annual work report to the
upcoming 54th session of the General Assembly, which is to open on
September 14. The report was issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On the lessons drawn from the recent failure in conflict
prevention, Annan said, "First, that if the primacy of the
Security Council with respect to the maintenance of international
peace and security is rejected, the very foundations of
international law as represented by the Charter will be brought
into question."
</P>
<P>
"No other universally accepted legal basis for constraining
wanton acts of violence exists," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Second, the conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacemaking
must not become an area of competition between the United Nations
and regional organizations," he said. "Work together best when we
respect each other's prerogatives and sensitivities."
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the Security Council has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of the world peace and
international security. However, the U.S.-led NATO, a military and
regional bloc, launched 79-day air strikes on Yugoslavia, a
sovereign country, without the authorization of the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
"Third, that prevention can only succeed with strong
political commitment from Member States and if the provision of
resources is adequate," he said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Palestinians Exhilarated Over Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- When a bus full of
Palestinian political prisoners pulled in at the compound of the
Palestinian Presidential Office, cheers broke out among scores of
their relatives and friends, and a teenager girl was seen climbing
into the window to meet her father before the bus fully stopped.
</P>
<P>
The 52 Palestinians in the bus were among the 199 Palestinian
political prisoners released by Israel Thursday as part of the
implementation of a new Israeli-Palestinian peace deal signed in
the Egyptian Red Sea Resort of Sharm El-Sheikh last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The other released prisoners returned to the Gaza Strip and
another West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Beaming with smiles or wiping joyful tears, the prisoners,
their parents, their children and friends exchange hugs and
cried out grateful prayers.
</P>
<P>
A military band struck up a tune and an old man danced to the
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
"I feel good and happy," said Ahmamoud Nasir, 36, one of the
prisoners. Propped by his friends, he looked pale and infirm after
spending over 14 years in Israeli jails on conviction of wounding
two Israelis in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We are not against peace, but we need peace which will
guarantee the rights of the Palestinian people," he said,
referring to the current peacemaking between the Palestinians and
the new government of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The release of Palestinian political prisoners was the first
concrete step the Israeli side took to implement the revised Wye
accord Prime Minister Ehud Barak signed with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the release of 350 Palestinian
political prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israeli activity before
the signing of the Oslo accords in September 1993. The second
batch will be released in October.
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, Israel will also carry out the first stage
of three troop withdrawals, transferring 7 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also launch the permanent peace talks,
which deal with thorny issues like Palestinian statehood and
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"It is a nice step toward the right direction," Deputy PNA
Planning Minister Anees Barghoti told Xinhua before the bus
arrived. "We hope to see more steps by Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barghoti expressed "cautious optimism" over the prospect of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that Mr. Barak is serious about the process. He
showed courage in the Knesset yesterday when he said the
Palestinians should be given equal rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the remarks Barak made in a Knesset
(Israeli parliament) debate Wednesday night before the latest
agreement was approved by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
"We as a responsible government...we must take difficult,
sometimes painful decisions to peacefully separate from the
Palestinians, not to continue to rule over them," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
The release of Palestinian prisoners is an emotional issue for
the Palestinians as almost every family had a member or relative
jailed by Israel at a certain point in the last three decades
since Israel seized Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
It had also been one of the thorny issues in
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Weeks of bloody conflicts erupted late last year when former
hard-line Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu included 150
criminals, instead of political prisoners as expected by the
Palestinians, in the first group of 250 prisoners released.
</P>
<P>
In the latest negotiations, the two sides had been also at odds
over the number and terms of the prisoners to be released.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians had initially demanded that Israel release
650 political prisoners, but Israel insisted that it would
release not more than 500 and would have the rights to include
common criminals.
</P>
<P>
They finally concurred on the release of 350 political
prisoners with an Israeli promise to release more in the future.
</P>
<P>
Among the 199 prisoners released Thursday, 150 were jailed for
killing Palestinians who had cooperated with Israeli security
services, and 15 were involved in the wounding of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that it would not release those who
murdered Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Tears welled up in the eyes of Salam Abudullah Bargouti, 75,
after all the prisoners got off the bus but his son, Nayel, did
not show up. Nayel, 44, has spent 23 years in jail after being
convicted of killing an Israeli Jew.
</P>
<P>
"We call for the release of more prisoners and more important
prisoners," said Palestinian Legislative Council member Marwan
Barghoti, who is also head of the Fatah Movement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said those who had killed Israelis before the signing of the
Oslo accords should also be released. "There were wars between the
two sides at that time. Everyone was proud of what they did in the
wars. Of course, the situation has been different after 1993," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the upcoming transfer of land, Barghoti said the
size of the land is small, so nothing significant will
change. "But it will give the people some hope," he said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Satisfied With Measles Elimination in Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) said on Thursday it is satisfied with the elimination of
measles strategies it recommended for southern Africa which are
now as effective as those being applied in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The strategies include high routine vaccination coverage where
every child under one year is vaccinated to prevent them from
contracting such diseases as measles and polio.
</P>
<P>
WHO southern African expanded program on immunization advisor
Robin Biellik said since the countries in the region initiated
these strategies, the results had been very encouraging.
</P>
<P>
"From what we can tell, measles have actually been stopped in
Zimbabwe and Botswana," he told the delegates who are attending a
WHO workshop in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said in Namibia and South Africa it was confirmed there were
still a few cases of measles transmission with 20 and 40 cases
reported this year.
</P>
<P>
"When we compare that with thousands of cases they had before,
this is a massive improvement which shows that the measles
elimination strategies recommended by WHO for use all over the
world appear to be working very well in southern Africa," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Military to Phase Out Support Squadron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian military will
phase out a support squadron based at Greenwood in the western
province of Nova Scotia, Local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 434 Squadron is deemed non-combat related and will be
phased out over two years. The work at the Greenwood base will
then be privatized, the report quoted military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The squadron is composed of Challenger aircraft and T-33 jets,
which provide support for electronic warfare training, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
The move, which will eliminate 225 military jobs, is part of
cuts to be taken by the Canadian air force, which plans to remove
more than 50 support aircraft from the flight lines.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien was quoted Thursday as
ruling out the grounding of the country's Snowbirds aerobatics
team consisting of 14 ageing Tutor aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the military put it impractical to keep
Tutors just for the sake of Snowbirds, which perform at Canada Day
celebrations every year.
</P>
<P>
The military wants to concentrate its work on the upgrading of
its frontline CF-18 fighter fleet and Aurora patrol planes,
reports said.

<HEADLINE> International Police Cooperation Should Strengthen States: France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-
Pierre Chevenement said on Thursday that international cooperation
between police forces of different nations should be aimed at
strengthening individual states.
</P>
<P>
He said that Western countries have a "group responsibility" in
fighting international organized criminal groups.
</P>
<P>
"The bilateral cooperation should be carried out with the same
democratic norms, which are those of rule of law, and respect for
individual freedom and public freedom," said Chevenement in a
speech addressed to the French attaches in charge of security
issues posted in embassies and consulates around the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the world security situation is experiencing an
unprecedented development and French security officials should
regard safeguarding the interior security of France as their
priorities.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the integration of central and eastern
European countries into the European Union is providing a good
chance to experiment with international police cooperation in
fighting organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
About 100 French security attaches posted in 56 countries are
meeting here this week to discuss "the challenges of the 21st
century" in the field of security.
</P>
<P>
These security officials, who belong to the organization of
Service of International Technical Cooperation of Police, carried
out 823 cooperative actions with their foreign counterparts in
1998, mostly in Africa, Europe, America and the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> China's First Legislative Hearing Held in Guangzhou (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The People's Congress of
Guangdong Province in south China today hosted the country's first
legislative hearings as they listened to the opinions of twenty
local people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
"As a Chinese citizen, I'm honored to attend this hearing,"
said Duan Lixing, a local official with the provincial water
conservancy bureau.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is designed to hear opinions on the recension of a
draft for an administrative regulation on construction-project
bidding.
</P>
<P>
Before the hearing, Duan spent a week studying the draft and
worked out detailed suggestions for amendments. "It's delightful
to have an opportunity to provide legislative advice for the
congress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Presided over by members of the construction environment and
resources protection committee of the congress, the hearing is
open freely to citizens, but the number of people participating is
limited to 20.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Senlin, director of the standing committee of the congress,
said that as China's first legislative hearing, it will play a
significant role in promoting the country's legislative
democratization.
</P>
<P>
"Through hearing, we can collect opinions from related
departments as well as individuals," Zhu said, and they will
provide valuable analyses and argumentation on regulations and
laws.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is also a way of making the legislation concrete,
practical and transparent, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Li Boqiao, a law professor at Jinan University, noted that the
hearing is a landmark in China's local legislative democratization.
</P>
<P>
The legislative hearing is based on the Constitution of People'
s Republic of China, which prescribes that all power in China
belongs to the people. The organs through which the people
exercise state power are the National People's Congress and the
local people's congresses at different levels, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Preparation for Smooth Transfer of Power of Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China and Portugal are working
hard to create a favorable environment and making necessary
preparations for the smooth transfer of power of Macao, a Chinese
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a group of journalists from China's state media
organizations, Han Zhaokang, leader of the Chinese members of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, said since its establishment
in January 1988, the liaison group has held 36 plenary meetings
and innumerable meetings of specialized working groups and experts.
During these meetings, in-depth consultations were held between
the Chinese and Portuguese sides, within the framework of the Sino-
Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao, on various
issues concerning the stable transition and smooth transfer of
power of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Han listed, in particular, three questions which the Chinese
side is most concerned about, namely, the localization of public
servants, the localization of laws and the official status of the
Chinese languages in Macao. He said big headway has been made in
these issues. A large number of Chinese public servants have taken
leading positions in Macao, and Sino-Portuguese consultations on
the civil procedural law, the last of the five leading laws, have
been close to completion. The four others, the criminal law, the
criminal procedural law, the civil law and the commercial law,
have realized the localization.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the status and the use of the Chinese
language in the administrative, legislative and judicial areas
have been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Han said that under the Sino-Portuguese joint declaration, the
future Macao Special Administrative Region can maintain and
develop ties with various countries, regions, and international
and regional organizations in certain fields under the name "China
Macao." To implement this regulation, he said, the liaison group
has reached consensus on Macao's continued participation in 46
international or regional organizations and continued application
of 124 international conventions to Macao after 1999.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the long-term interests of the Sino-
Portuguese relations, the Chinese side has also taken a flexible
and practical attitude toward certain questions, including the
nationalities of Macao residents and the schools of the Portuguese
language.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the two sides of the liaison group have intensified
discussion on the ceremony for transfer of power of Macao, Han
said. China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of stationing troops in Macao, Han said the
Chinese side hopes the Portuguese side will take into
consideration the long-term friendship and cooperation between the
two countries and strengthen cooperation on the Macao issue.
</P>
<P>
Han said he is confident of the smooth transfer of power of
Macao.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Jobless Claims Fall Unexpectedly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Thursday that the number of new claims for unemployment benefits
dropped unexpectedly last week.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that 286,000 people filed new claims
for jobless benefits for the week ending September 4, down by 4,000
from the previous week. That was the lowest level since August 21,
when claims were at 285,000.
</P>
<P>
However, the four-week moving average for claims was up
slightly to 287,500 last week. That was the highest level since
August 8, when claims were at 288,250.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said last week's decrease in new claims was not
expected. they had been forecasting that new claims would actually
rise a little to 290,000. They said that's good news for workers
but is potentially worrisome. They worry that employers scrambling
for workers may woo them with higher wages and benefits, costs
that may drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government said the nation's unemployment rate
ticked down to 4.2 percent in August, returning to a 29-year low.
In July, the rate was 4.3 percent. The unemployment report also
said that businesses added only 124,000 jobs to their payrolls and
that hourly earnings rose slightly.
</P>
<P>
Even though that report buoyed financial markets, investors,
more recently, have worried about the prospects of the Federal
Reserve raising interest rates again this year.
</P>
<P>
The Department's report said that for the week ending August 28,
33 states and territories reported decreases in new jobless claim
applications, while 20 reported increases. The state data lag a
week behind the national figures.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest decrease was California, down 1,990
while the state with the biggest increase was New York, up 1,216.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Turkey began their
second round of talks here Thursday in order to create a healthy
climate for the improvement of their strained bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day talks, senior Foreign Ministry officials
from both sides will discuss possibilities for cooperation in
economy, trade, tourism, environment and prevention of natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted diplomatic
sources as saying that a draft accord based on the results of the
first round of talks could be considered if officials continued to
work on what they had achieved before.
</P>
<P>
The next round of talks between the two countries is to be
held in the Turkish capital of Ankara on September 14-15, which
will focus on cooperation in fighting organized crime, illegal
immigration and terrorism, as well as in cultural and regional
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Greek diplomatic sources also said that Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou will meet his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem,
on September 23 on the sidelines of the U.N. general assembly in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey, which are both NATO
members, have been strained for decades over territorial disputes,
in particular the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
To ease their tense relations, senior Greek and Turkish
diplomats opened talks in late July in Ankara and Athens,
respectively. Both countries voiced their satisfaction with the
talks, which were described as being held in "a good climate".

<HEADLINE> British Government Accepts N.Irish Police Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam said on Thursday the British government
accepted in principle former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten's
proposals for a radical overhaul of Northern Ireland's police
force.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam told a news conference in Northern Ireland capital
Belfast that she had extended to the end of November the period
for debating the proposals, which aim to make the
Protestant-dominated Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) more
acceptable to the Roman Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
The Patten Commission on the future of policing in Northern
Ireland, which was set up a year ago under the Good Friday
agreement, has recommended 175 changes to the RUC, including
reducing the size of the RUC from 13,000 to about 8,000 and
renaming the RUC as the Northern Ireland Police Service,
</P>
<P>
The changes also include a new badge, flag, oath of allegiance,
uniform and drive to recruit Catholics into the force.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam encouraged the parties to look closely at the document
and said she had decided to extend the consultation period from
two to three months because of those complaints.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party Thursday responded angrily to plans
to transform the RUC.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said the proposals to
change the name of the RUC and take away its flag and badge were
"a gratuitous insult" and predicted the public would reject the
whole report.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness said his party
would scrutinize the report to see if it adhered to its
requirements under the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair described the Patten
report on the future of the RUC as the "way forward" for policing
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the difficulties both unionist and nationalist
communities would have in accepting some of the proposals.
</P>
<P>
But he urged everyone to take time to digest the detail of the
report.
</P>
<P>
The Patten report was welcomed by the Irish Government as
"thorough and comprehensive".
</P>
<P>
The Irish Government said the recommendations would strengthen
the effectiveness of the police throughout the island of Ireland
by enhancing relations between the police forces on both sides of
the border.

LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Education Ministry
held a ceremony at the Yaba College of Technology in Lagos on
Thursday to mark the successful completion of the Chinese-aid
computer program.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Tunde Adeniran said in a written speech that
the formal conclusion of the program marked "another milestone"
in the history of the Sino-Nigerian cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The minister paid high tribute to the Chinese personnel working
in Nigeria under the program, saying that they had made
"tremendous" contribution to the network of the Computer Services

Adeniran noted that during the dark era of Nigeria's isolation
by the international community, China remained "a true and
dependable partner and a faithful friend in need".
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement on technical cooperation in the field of
higher education signed in December 1996, China donated 45 units
of personal computers and various soft wares and teaching
equipment to Nigeria, which were shared between Yaba College of
Technology and Edo State University.
</P>

economic growth and development, sustained increases in living
standards and investment.
</P>
<P>
However, only a handful of African countries have approached
these goals.
</P>
<P>
The 43 heads of state and government who participated the
summit are also expected to recommend that specific dates be set
for the establishment of a pan-African parliament, a federal
court, a monetary fund and other institutions. A commission would
present the dates to the OAU's next summit in Togo in June.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Names New German Transport Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to win party
left-wingers' support to Berlin cabinet, German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder on Thursday named Reinhard Klimmt, the outgoing premier
of Saarland State, as his new Minister of Transport and
Construction.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing minister Franz Muentefering will become the SPD's
general secretary to beef up the party's fortunes, Schroeder said
in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Klimmt, 57, was ousted from power in the state election on
Sunday after ruling Saarland for hardly 1 year as successor to
former Finance Minister Oscar Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
And just like Lafontaine, Klimmt is regarded as the spokesman
of the traditional wing in Germany's ruling Social democratic
Party (SPD). He has been bluntly criticizing Schroeder's
pro-business "new middle line" and the strict fiscal reform plan
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
However, as analysts have pointed out, Schroeder wants to keep
the unity of his party following two defeats in Sunday's
elections. The SPD lost sole control of Saarland and Brandenburg
governments with poor scores in polling.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his choice at a press conference Thursday afternoon,
Schroeder said he would "bundle up all power of the SPD to secure
the program for future."
</P>
<P>
He has picked up Klimmt as Transport Minister because of the
latter's experience in Saarland government, said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
"It is his experience that will help him tackle the challenges
ahead of us in transport and construction," he said, praising
Klimmt as a "fully qualified politician" and "good team player."
</P>
<P>
And Klimmt's critics on the fiscal reform plan "will not belong
to his future stand as Transport Minister," stressed Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Klimmt also expressed his readiness to compromise with the
party boss Schroeder, saying: "As Transport Minister, I am not
responsible for the fiscal reform."
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor has known his political position well, Klimmt
told the press. He assured Schroeder that he would accept the
decision of majority in the party.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Parliament Adopts Resolution on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican parliament Thursday
urged the international community to take measures to end "the
genocidal bloodbath" in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
A resolution passed unanimously by the Assembly of the Republic
noted that the East Timorese people "voted massively for their
national independence" in the referendum held on August 31.
</P>
<P>
But, it said this historic result "unleashed criminal
activities by the enemies of freedom, independence and equality
amongst peoples".
</P>
<P>
The deputies expressed "unconditional solidarity with the
brother people of East Timor, who are the targets of violence,
ethnic cleansing and extermination".
</P>
<P>
They urged the international community and the United Nations
(U.N.) in particular to act immediately to stop the ongoing
genocidal bloodbath, and to guarantee the implementation of the
right to independence that the East Timorese people have so
massively reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly agreed to forward copies of the resolution to U.N.
 Secretary-General Kofi Annan, to the embassies of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council in Maputo, and to
the Honorary Consul of Indonesia in Mozambique.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen will visit Russia next week for talks with Russian
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on nuclear arms cuts, missile
defense and improving military ties, the Pentagon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first meeting between the defense chiefs since
June when they met in Helsinki to negotiate participation by
Russian troops in a Kosovo peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Sergeyev will discuss improving bilateral
military-to-military ties, which soured this year over NATO's
barbarous bombing in Yugoslavia and concerns in Moscow over U.S.
plans to build an anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
The two military chiefs will also discuss U.S. plans to build
the anti-missile defense system, which Russia says would violate
the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
Because of U.S. recent military actions around the world, the
wary Russian parliament has not yet approved the START-2 strategic
reduction treaty.
</P>
<P>
And Cohen and Sergeyev are also likely to discuss how to make
deep cuts in nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rejects Military Intervention in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has rejected
U.N. proposed military intervention in East Timor, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"President B.J. Habibie today told the members of the Security
Council mission visiting Jakarta that he will welcome any form of
international assistance to deal with East Timor except military,
rejecting the Council mission's offer of a multi-national force to
restore law and order to the territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The President repeated the assurances that the Indonesian
authorities would get the situation under control," he added.
</P>
<P>
Entering the U.N. headquarters here, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan also said Indonesia indicated that the martial law is
just taking force in East Timor and that with a bit of time the
Indonesians will be able to bring the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
U.N. personnel in East Timor reported that the situation around
the compound of the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was "the
quietest" Wednesday since Monday and things "had marginally
improved".
</P>
<P>
However attempts to reach UNAMET's warehouse in the port area
of Dili, the capital, again was halted by anti-independence
militia Thursday as they fired over the head U.N. staff despite
the presence of Indonesian military escort, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's U.N. Ambassador Makarim Wibisono said Thursday
violence in East Timor was subsiding with no more arson or burning
or looting reported and "the conflicting parties have agreed to
stop their action".
</P>
<P>
The five-member Security Council mission is scheduled to meet
the Indonesian military chief on Friday and to visit East Timor on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the U.N. is waiting for the return of the mission to
get the first-hand knowledge about the situation in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In the Security Council, a closed-door meeting has just ended
and a presidential statement said Council members expressed their
"gravest concern" at the continuing very serious security
situation in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The Council again called on the Indonesian authorities to take
urgent and effective steps to guarantee UNAMET's safety and
security.
</P>
<P>
The statement repeated the Council's stand that if the security
situation does not improve within a very short period of time,
Council members will consider "further action" to help Indonesia
achieve this objective, without specifying the nature of the
action.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Member Sentenced 26 Life-Imprisonments for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli military court
Thursday sentenced a member of the Islamic militant group Hamas to
26 consecutive life-imprisonment sentences on conviction of
planning and ordering two serious suicide bombings in downtown
Jerusalem in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The number of life imprisonments given to 24-year-old Ammar
al-Zibben was corresponding to the number of Israelis killed in
the two attacks.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one Israelis and five Hamas suicide bombers were killed
at the explosions at a main open market and a popular pedestrian
mall in the city.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zibben, from the West Bank town of Nablus, was arrested in
January 1998. The indictment said he had served in the Palestinian
National Authority police force while being a member of an
underground Hamas cell.
</P>
<P>
He was also found guilty by the court late last month of other
operations, including producing explosives and shooting at
settlers, Israeli radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sentencing for these convictions will be handed down later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace making, has
killed scores of Israelis in a series of attacks it staged in
Israel since the signing of the historic Oslo peace accords in
1993.

<HEADLINE> New GA Session to Begin on September 14 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The 54th session of the
General Assembly (GA) is expected to kick off on September 14,
with Theo-Ben Gurirab, Namibian foreign minister, as the incoming
president, a senior U.N. official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yongjian, under-secretary-general for General Assembly
affairs and conference services, told a press conference that the
new GA session, also the last one in this century, is scheduled to
open at 3:00 p.m. EST next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the GA session, three new members, namely
Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga, will be admitted, thus bringing the
total U.N. Member States to 188, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three countries have been already recommitted by the
Security Council for the new U.N. membership.
</P>
<P>
The general debate will begin on September 20 and last about
two weeks. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will introduce his
annual report on the work of the Organization before the beginning
of the general debate, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For the general debate of the 54th session, so far 183
delegations have inscribed on the list," he said. In other words,
all Member States, except Yugoslavia and Somalia, have inscribed.
</P>
<P>
"Up to this moment, we expect 40 heads of state and 26 heads of
government, one crown prince to participate in the general
debate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan is expected to take the
floor at the general debate on September 22.
</P>
<P>
"This is a large number of heads of state and heads of
government for a regular session," he said. "This also reflects
the importance Member States attach to the general debate and the
U.N. as a whole."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will also convene a special session on the
development of small island states on September 27-28, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, 102 delegations have inscribed for the special session,
he said. "We expect four heads of state and six heads of
government to debate during these two days."
</P>
<P>
For the 54th session, "so far we have 166 items on the
provisional agenda, plus five on the supplementary list," he said.
The General Committee will meet on September 15 to consider all
these items and allocate them to various committees if included in
the official agenda.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly is the main deliberative organ. It is
composed of representatives of all Member States, each of which
has one vote. The GA's regular session usually begins each year in
September.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- About 4,000

<P>
The general said that this year has been pretty good for the
government forces in their fight against guerrillas, in spite of

<HEADLINE> SADC Should Embrace Global Competition: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Further success of Southern
African Development Community (SADC) countries should depend on
commitment to global competitiveness of individual countries,
Chairman of British Airways said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lord Marshall was delivering a keynote address at the opening
of a two- day Institute of Directors (IoD) convention in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said the continent has to strengthen itself through forming
trading and economic groups.
</P>
<P>
To attract more investors, a country has to realize that it is
in an increasingly competitive global marketplace, he said.
</P>
<P>
He argued that weaker countries must come together as an area
and improve their competitive effectiveness to avoid being swept
away by globalization.
</P>
<P>
SADC countries must be highly competitive, liberalized and
deregulated to ensure a high level of investment and to face the
challenge of the new millenium, Southern African IoD economist
Graeme Leach added.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the countries must ensure low volatility in
macro-economy, low inflation and low interest rates so that direct
savings go to the private sector. Foreign exchange stability is
also crucial. The people must be given the right incentives and
trusted".
</P>
<P>
The IoD convention is co-sponsored by the IoD Zimbabwe and the
IoD in Southern Africa, with the participants coming from
companies, parastatals and non-governmental organizations,
government departments and professional organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
opened Thursday evening an exhibition of the great 18th century
French realist painter Jean-Baptiste Simeon Chardin (1699-1779) at
the Grand Palais Museum in Paris.
</P>
<P>
About 100 works of Chardin are displayed and they will move on
to Dusseldorf, Germany, after November 22. They will also be
displayed in London and New York next year.
</P>
<P>
The head of the French luxury industrial group LVMH, Bernard
Arnault, has financially sponsored the exhibition and the
president of the Louvre Museum Pierre Rosenberg serves as the
commissioner of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Among the displayed works of Chardin is "The Little Girl Who
Plays by Jumping" depicting a lovely doll, which was painted in
1737 soon after the death of Chardin's own daughter.
</P>
<P>
The painting, which once belonged to Russian Empress Catherine
the Great, was later bought by the Rothschild family.
</P>
<P>
Little known in the 19th century, Chardin was admired in the
20th century by both conservative painters and those of socialist
realism.

NAIROBI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government
Thursday hailed the United States' aid to the country amounting to
five million U.S. dollars as contribution to Rwanda's Debt Trust
Fund, the Rwandan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"(This) is yet another concretization of the support of the
U.S. to the reconstruction of our country," Rwandan Minister of
Finance and Economic Planning Donald Kaberuka highlighted during
the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said that Rwanda's unsustainable foreign debt burden,
estimated at over 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, or the equivalent of
60 percent of the country's GDP, is a serious brake on the
development effort.
</P>
<P>
"Each year, Rwanda has to pay 30 million U.S. dollars which is
three times higher than the current health expenditure and half
the education budget," Kaberuka said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. aid will help in servicing multilateral
debt, which accounts for 80 percent of Rwanda's total debt.

<HEADLINE> Romania Appeals to EU, NATO to Resume Traffic on Danube </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government
Thursday appealed to the European Union (EU) and NATO member
countries for the deblocking the Danubean navigable channel, the
official Rompres news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport Traian Basescu stressed it was the EU and
NATO countries' responsibility to resume traffic on the Danube,
which has been stopped due to the bombing of the bridges during
the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a paradoxical situation now, viz., the EU
imposed an embargo against Yugoslavia, which we are backing up,
but it practically turned, by its effects, into an embargo on the
Romanian fleet to sail on the Danube," complained the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The EU must ponder it well that Romania is not
subject to the embargo and that it is the fate of a state against
which an embargo was imposed."
</P>
<P>
Basescu said that the ministry he leads approved a three-way
meeting among the Ukrainian, Bulgarian and Romanian shipowners to
be held in Romania, to approach the issue of traffic on the Danube
and that of clearing the navigable channel.
</P>
<P>
Romanian shipowners and port operators have blocked the traffic
on the Danube for three days starting Monday, in a protest against
the EU refusal to free the navigable channel in the area of the
three bridges destroyed in Serbian Novi Sad during the war.
</P>
<P>
Blocking the Danube by shipowners is a consequence of the fact
that Romania has not felt any positive effects of the
international oil embargo on Yugoslavia, Prime Minister Radu
Vasile said.
</P>
<P>
"Romania and the Romanian government fulfilled their
obligations 100 percent" in terms of the oil embargo as well as
other factors established by the EU and NATO, Vasile added.
</P>
<P>
"Despite this fact, Romania has not experienced any positive
effects of such a firm and precise attitude, underlined by all EU
and NATO official representatives," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Romanian companies of river navigation have sustained losses of
almost 1.3 million U.S. dollars a month, as a result of the
conflict in Yugoslavia and of the delay in unblocking the traffic
on the Danube.

<HEADLINE> Panama Not to Negotiate Any Accord with US: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Panama's government is not
to negotiate any treaty with United States to let its military men
carry out exercises here and later invade Colombia, Foreign
Minister Jose Miguel Aleman said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that Colombia's conflict is its internal
affair and we must give them time to find peace, just as El
Salvador and Guatemala did.
</P>
<P>
Panama's oppostion deputy from the Democratic Revolutionary
Party (PRD), Miguel Bush, denounced Tuesdday that the United
States is taking steps with Mireya Moscoso's government to perform
military exercises inside Panama to invade Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister said that "what Panama really is going to
do is to strengthen Neigborhood Commissions", established in 1993
by the then Presidents of Panama and Colombia, Guillermo Endara
and Cesar Gaviria, respectively, to solve bilateral problems.

</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt closed 36 points higher at 5,436.86,

ZHUHAI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Festivities including art
performances, an official banquet and a forum were all going on in
Zhuhai today to mark the 100-day countdown to the December 20
return to China of its neighbor, Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, a vice chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), spoke
at the banquet and said he was confident of the smooth return of
Macao after the example of Hong Kong, which returned to the
motherland on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" concept, which has proved
successful for resolving the Hong Kong and Macao issues, will play
an exemplary role for the resolution of the Taiwan issue to
finally realize the complete reunification of the motherland, Wang
noted.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the banquet and a get-together included Edmund
Ho, Chief Executive Designate of the Macao Special Administrative
Region, and Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, and Qian Weichang,

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Concerned Over Incidents on Border With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Friday summoned
India's acting High Commissioner Hamid Ali Rao to the Foreign
Ministry to hear Dhaka's grave concern over a series of incidents
which took place in the past few months along the border with
India.
</P>
<P>
The Indian envoy was told that those border incidents
contributed to an undesirable build-up of tension in the border
areas, a senior Foreign Ministry official told the media.
</P>
<P>
The incidents involve areas termed as adverse possessions,
which have been in existence since 1947, the official said, adding
that a special dispensation was made with regard to these areas in
the 1947 border agreement with a provision for maintaining the
status quo until their eventual transfer in accordance with the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The official said that during the past few months, a group of
Indian nationals supported by the Indian Border Security Forces
(BSF) have sought to plow a stretch of land under such adverse
possessions of Bangladesh. On the other hand, when Bangladeshi
nationals were engaged in plowing the same land, the BSF warned
them of serious consequences unless they leave the place.
</P>
<P>
The official said the trend was quite evident that there was a
discernible effort on the part of the Indian field officials to
change the status quo in clear violation of the 1975 Border
Guidelines. At least it could be concluded that the BSF field
officials were inclined not to recognize the status of adverse
possessions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an undesirable development," he added.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the important strides made in our bilateral
relations during the past few years, it is felt that greater
efforts must be made to maintain peace and tranquillity in the
border areas so that such border incidents are not allowed to
detract from the close relations between the two countries," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Medical tests on George
Kulcsar have confirmed that the Queens Park Rangers midfielder is
suffering from the viral strain of meningitis.
</P>
<P>
It is the less deadly form of the disease and most people who
have it make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
The announcement that it is not the meningococcal variety -- a
potentially fatal strain of bacterial meningitis -- will be a
major boost for both player and club.
</P>
<P>
QPR owner Chris Wright had earlier revealed that three other
players -- Gavin Peacock, Karl Ready and Matthew Rose -- were
under observation in hospital after displaying similar symptoms to
32-year-old Australian Kulcsar.
</P>
<P>
However, tests have now showed that former Chelsea and
Newcastle star Peacock has not been suffering from meningitis.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China's New Policies Expected to Draw More Overseas Funds (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China has just issued a series
of important preferential policies to further encourage overseas
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts say these policies, many of which are much bolder than
previous ones, will lay a sound foundation for China's better
utilization of overseas capital in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The new policies, announced this week by a senior Chinese
official at the ongoing Third China Fair for International
Investment and Trade, include encouraging overseas investors to
engage in technology development and innovation by offering tax
cuts or exemptions, allowing qualified overseas-funded businesses
to issue both A-shares, which are available only to domestic
investors, and B-shares reserved for overseas investors, and
easing restrictions on overseas investors in joint ventures in the
central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that these policies have been released amid the
first downward trend in both the country's contractual overseas
investment and its actual use of overseas funds during the first
half this year.
</P>
<P>
They said these new policies are intended not only to check the
current downturn in overseas investment, but also to foster an
open economy to achieve a sustained and rapid economic growth in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said that attracting overseas
investment in technology development and innovation promotion will
be conducive to upgrading domestic industries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ma said, advanced technology and management expertise
brought by overseas investors will help China to improve the
quality of its economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"Directing overseas investment to the central and western areas
is expected to bring about a balanced development of the national
economy," Ma added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China's New Policies Expected to Draw More Overseas Funds (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1978, when the reform and opening up policies were
introduced, China has maintained a sustained and rapid economic
growth, in which overseas investment has played a role.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that China has ranked second in the world
in utilizing of overseas funds for six years, second only to the
United States. There are now 334,000 overseas-funded businesses
in China, with combined overseas capital actually used standing at
290 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises employ 18 million people, and last year
contributed 44 percent to China's total exports, and 14.4 percent
to the country's tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
This year, however, the number of newly approved overseas-
funded enterprises, and the volume of committed and actually used
overseas funds, have all decreased, with actual overseas
investment reaching only 21.5 billion U.S. dollars during the
January-July period, down 10 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute this downturn to the negative impact of the
Asian financial crisis and the change of mode in international
investment from direct investment to acquisitions and mergers.
</P>
<P>
Sun Guangxiang, MOFTEC's vice minister, said that China must
take active measures to attract more overseas investment in order
to maintain a sustained, rapid and healthy economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"As a developing country, China is still suffering from a
severe shortage of funds," Sun added.
</P>
<P>
To draw an appropriate amount of overseas funds, experts note,
it is sensible to make some adjustments to related policies.
</P>
<P>
A multinational CEO attending the fair said that China is now
creating a more favorable business environment and will surely
attract an increasing number of overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United in Silvestre Rush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Manchester United are trying to push through Mickael
Silvestre's transfer from Inter Milan to enable him to play
against Liverpool on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The French Under-21 defender signed for the club on Friday
after he agreed terms and passed his medical test.
</P>
<P>
The Treble winners are now waiting for his international
clearance from the Italian FA to rubber stamp the deal, which is
reportedly worth 4 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
United chairman Martin Edwards said Friday: "He signed for us
at lunchtime today. He has agreed personal terms, he's passed his
medical and we've completed all the forms.
</P>
<P>
"We have not had international clearance yet, but we hope to
get that from the Italian FA today so that he might be available
for tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
United are anxious to rush through the transfer because they
are desperately short of defensive cover for the Anfield showdown.
</P>
<P>
Gary Neville injured his groin playing for England against
Poland on Wednesday to join Denis Irwin and long-term casualties
Wes Brown, David May and Ronny Johnsen on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
It would be ironic if Silvestre did make his United debut
against Liverpool after Reds boss Gerard Houllier tried so hard to
sign him.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- At least three persons were
killed and 12 others injured in a fresh outbreak of communal clash
in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, on Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, security forces aimed
their guns at rioters after firing a series of warning shots. The
mob ignored the warning shots and even tried to break through the
security cordon by throwing two hand-made bombs at the security
troops.
</P>
<P>
The security forces eventually frustrated the mob's attempt to
enter the Maluku gubernatorial offices compound.
</P>
<P>
The security troops also had to fire warning shots to disperse
the rioters in the Batumerah and Batugantung areas in the city,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and several other islands in Maluku province have been
the scene of violent clashes between Muslims and Christian groups
since mid-January this year.
</P>
<P>
Local religious figures, along with the military, had tried to

<HEADLINE> Vialli: Keegan Part-time Role to Blame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli reckons a "messy" handover
from Glenn Hoddle to Kevin Keegan is to blame for the struggle to
qualify for Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
England need Sweden to beat Poland if they are to make the play-
offs in the wake of Wednesday's goalless draw with the Poles in
Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea boss Vialli believes the uncertainty created when
Keegan initially agreed to succeed Hoddle for just three games did
not help prospects of qualification.
</P>
<P>
Keegan committed himself to three years in charge of England
after his first two matches -- a 3-1 Euro 2000 victory over Poland
and a 1-1 draw with Hungary.
</P>
<P>
But Vialli believes the damage had been done. He said: "The
problem was that it was a bit of a mess when the manager was
changed."
</P>
<P>
"Kevin Keegan took over but nobody knew whether he was going to
stay for one match or two or until the end of the season or for
longer."
</P>
<P>
"It was at that stage that England lost their qualification,
because of all the confusion," Vialli told the Daily Mail.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: Visit to Australia Attains Desired Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRNS, Australia, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here Friday that his five-day visit to Australia
has attained the desired goal.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that during the visit, he met Australian Governor-
General William Patrick Deane and exchanged views with Prime
Minister John Howard on bilateral relations, as well as
international and regional issues of common interest, which
produced positive and constructive results.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in his toast at an informal barbecue
dinner hosted in his honor by Nick Minchin, Australian Minister
for Industry, Science and Resources.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that in his talks with Howard, both of them
expressed satisfaction over and highly evaluated the progress made
in the development of China-Australia relations since the
establishment of the diplomatic ties between the two countries 27
years ago.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to foster a 21st-century-oriented relationship of
long-term stability, healthy development and all-round cooperation
between China and Australia. And to this end, top leaders and
foreign ministers from both sides will meet once each year
regularly, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, China and Australia will make best use of
the complementarity between their economies and further tap the
potential in their economic and trade cooperation. They will also
enhance collaboration in consular affairs, mining, law enforcement,
science and technology, as well as education, while continuing to
open up new areas of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that differences between China and Australia
in political system, history, culture and tradition are by no
means obstacles to the development of the friendly relations and
cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
No clash of fundamental interest exists between China and
Australia, Jiang noted, adding that both of them, being important
countries in the Asia-Pacific region, have extensive common
interests and shoulder common responsibilities in safeguarding
world peace and stability and in promoting regional economic
prosperity and development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Howard and he expressed their readiness to step up
consultation and cooperation within international and regional
organizations and on major international and regional issues. They
also agreed to make efforts to promote the establishment of a fair
and equitable international economic and financial order.
</P>
<P>
Minchin, in his speech, said the people of Australia feel
honored to welcome a Chinese head of state to Australia for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese President is leaving for Auckland of New Zealand
Saturday to attend the 7th Informal Meeting of leaders of Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation, he wished Jiang's trip a full
success.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in Cairns earlier Friday. Cairns is the last leg
of his state visit to Australia.

An NNI spokesman said he didn't know what were the reasons for
the arrests.
</P>
<P>
Various journalist groups have condemned the arrest of
Pakistani correspondents and demanded their immediate release,

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese Foreign
Ministry's spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh Friday refuted U.S. remarks
about its religious situation, arguing that religious believers in
Vietnam enjoy equality and are free to practice their religions.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about Vietnam's reaction to U.S.
Department of State remarks on the religious situation in Vietnam,
Thanh said the allegation that the United States reserves the
right to judge other countries' religious situation runs counter
to the fundamental principles of international law.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam is a country of different religions and beliefs,"
Thanh said, affirming that Vietnam has been always respecting
religious freedom and non-religious freedom and has never
prevented any religious activities.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally," she added, "any religion belongs to a certain
community and a certain nation. So, the religious believers must
observe the laws of their nation while practicing religions."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Dip Temporary: Economic Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
assured the public Friday that the slight dip of the peso against
the greenback is a temporary effect of the political crisis in
East Timor, saying the "fundamental strength" of the peso is under
control.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu pointed out that the country
continues to enjoy an export boom which accounts for most of the
country's dollar inflow, backed by the what he called the
ever-reliable remittances from Filipino migrant workers,
Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Observers said developments in Thailand and Indonesia continued
to provide a reason for the bashing of the peso, which reached as
low as 40.32 against the U.S. dollar Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I think that our people should not be alarmed by the slight
dip in the peso because the currency's fundamental strength is
under our control," Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
"Our reserve is sufficient. Our export is also rising, which
comprises the bulk of our dollar inflows. The remittance of our
countrymen abroad also continues to flow in," he added.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu noted the threat of the International Monetary Fund to
withdraw support for Indonesia should it fail to address the
problem in East Timor has dealt a blow to the stability of some
currencies in the region.
</P>
<P>
He added that the East Timor crisis has also affected the Thai
baht whose decline he said was sharper than the peso.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu urged traders and other quarters engaged in dollar
trading not to take advantage of the situation, noting that the
central bank is keeping a close watch over their activities.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Supports Initiatives for Arab Unity: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf said on Friday his country supports any ideas and
initiatives aimed at closing Arab ranks at the upcoming meeting of
Arab foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
"Any efforts aimed at achieving Arab unity should be well
studied and well probed in a bid to reach a balanced and
reasonable formula for reconciliation," Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
said upon arrival in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"We must study the ideas on the basis of sincere and honest
participation," al-Sahhaf told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official will chair the two-day 112th session of the
Arab League Foreign Ministers Council, scheduled on Sunday and
Monday, under the rotational system.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said he has planned to meet with a number of his
counterparts on the sidelines of the meetings to seek ways of
improving bilateral ties and Arab reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He is to meet with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on
Saturday to discuss the agenda of the upcoming foreign ministers'
meeting, which includes the Iraqi issue, and bilateral relations,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf's remarks followed calls by Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid that Iraq use its chairmanship of the
meeting as a means to resolve its differences with other Arab
countries, and to cooperate with an Arab committee set up during
the last meeting of Arab foreign ministers in January to help get
U.N. sanctions on Iraq lifted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has refused to recognize the committee or cooperate with
it unless it becomes a member.
</P>
<P>
But al-Sahhaf's comments Friday suggested that Iraq may now
take a more flexible stand than it did at the last league
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will deal "positively" with any initiatives aimed at
ironing out the differences between it and other Arab countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf walked out of January's final meeting after the
foreign ministers failed to strongly condemn the sanctions and the
U.S.-British airstrikes on his country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed the economic
sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four days of airstrikes in
December against Iraq for what the western allies denounced as
Baghdad's failure to comply with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Slams MILF's Independence Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senate President
Blas Ople Friday slammed the attempts of the separatist Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Mindanao to model their
independence bid to that of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"There is no parallel between East Timor and the MILF
movement," Ople said in a press statement, stressing that the MILF
cannot use the East Timor experience as a model for their
independence bid.
</P>
<P>
The statement was in reaction to MILF pronouncements that the
East Timor referendum serves as a good precedent for Muslims
seeking independence to gain sovereignty the peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the East Timorese voted for independence from
Indonesia in their August 30 direct ballot sponsored by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The ballot gave the East Timorese an opportunity to choose
between autonomy within Indonesia or independence. East Timor was
a former colony of Portugal annexed by Indonesia in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao and parts of it claimed by the MILF, Ople pointed out,
"are part and parcel of Philippine territory and their status will
never be negotiable."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the referendum provided in the Philippine
Constitution applies only to "application for limited autonomy and
not for total independence."

<HEADLINE> Manila Urged to Repatriate Filipinos in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senate President
Blas Ople on Friday called on the government to immediately
repatriate the remaining Filipinos, particularly priests and nuns,
in the violence-torn East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Ople said the Philippine
Armed Forces should immediately send a plane to East Timor for the
possible evacuation of the priests and nuns, one of whom has
reportedly been killed by military men.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the violent strike that is tearing that territory
apart, we should evacuate these Filipino priests and nuns," he
said, adding that their lives and safety may be further imperiled
due to the military takeover in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
But Ople said the evacuation of the Filipinos still needs prior
clearance from the Indonesian government and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Press reports quoted an unidentified Philippine embassy staff
in Jakarta, Indonesia, as saying Filipino missionaries have
already been informed of their planned evacuation, but had showed
reluctance to leave the territory.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that while Filipino missionaries doing
humanitarian work in the territory are not the "targets" of
militia groups, they may be subjected to "incidental dangers" such
as explosions and street violence.

Against Mandela
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela was vindicated on Friday by the country's
top court when it reversed an earlier defeat for the government in
a controversial case over rugby.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court overturned the High Court victory of
the South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu), which had
maintained that Mandela did not give due consideration when he
appointed a commission to investigate the white-dominated sport,
according to a report by the South African Press Association
(SAPA).
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court found Pretoria High Court Judge
William de Villiers had erred in finding Mandela at fault in March
last year.
</P>
<P>
De Villiers, who allowed Sarfu to haul Mandela into court, had
said the former president's "performance on the witness stand was
less than satisfactory".
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court said that Mandela had not abdicated
his responsibilities when approving the appointment of the
commission of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
"The court finds that evidence does not support the conclusion
that such an abdication took place," SAPA quoted the ruling as
saying.

WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton, citing "gross abuses" in East Timor,moved
Thursday to isolate Indonesia by cutting off U.S. military ties,
and the International Monetary Fund effectively suspended its
multibillion-dollar lending program to the Southeast Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Federal employees, including about 250,000 civil
servants iln the Washington area, would receive a 4.8 percent pay
increase this January under an agreement reached Thursday by House
and Senate negotiators. It would amount to the largest salary
boost since 1981.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton demanded that Indonesia invite an
international peacekeeping force into East Timor if the Indonesian
military is unable to end the viaolence that has swept the
province since it voted for independence. He also ordered the

</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:

<HEADLINE> Army Paper Tells Why Mainland Never Pledged Not to Use Force (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Army Daily,
the newspaper run by the armed forces of China, will carry a
commentary tomorrow titled "Why We Have Never Promised to Abandon
the Use of Force."
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui, despite strong accusations from at home and
abroad, has insisted on including his "two-states" statement in a
Kuomintang resolution, and also wants to conform it in other legal
forms, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Facts indicate that "this stubborn element who has lost
national conscience" has gone farther on the road towards
splitting the motherland, it says.
</P>
<P>
Peace or war is the only solution for the Taiwan issue, the
paper says, recalling that as an inalienable part of Chinese
territory, Taiwan has experienced warfare and chaos and was
occupied by foreign invaders several times.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have showed the utmost fortitude in
struggles to defend the territorial integrity of the motherland,
the paper says, pointing out that in the history China had adopted
the use of force several times in efforts to recover Taiwan from
the hands of foreigners, including the Dutch and Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China, the Communist Party of China (
CPC) has also faced these two solutions, peace and war, the paper
says. It comments that since the 1950s, and especially since 1979,
the CPC has tried to deal with the Taiwan issue by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The commentary goes on to say that Deng Xiaoping was the
advocate of the principal guideline of "peaceful reunification and
one country, two systems." Deng had even pledged to grant a more
favorable policy to Taiwan, namely to copy the policy toward Hong
Kong and, moreover, allow the island keep its own army after
reunification.
</P>
<P>
On the day of the Spring Festival in 1995, President Jiang
Zemin put forwards his "eight proposals" and reiterated that "
everything can be negotiated, under the premise of one China."
This stance was warmly supported by Chinese at home and abroad ,
according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Army Paper Tells Why Mainland Never Pledged Not to Use Force (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"How could we promise to abandon the use of force while facing
such an evil attempt?" the paper asks.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the policy of making no promise to
abandon the use of force is a result of strategic consideration,
acting as a reliable guarantee for the implementation of the great
cause of reunification.
</P>
<P>
If such a promise were made, peaceful reunification will become
more difficult, it says, stressing that the reunification of the
motherland is in the supreme interest of the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
It asks: "Who will take the responsibility for losing the
integrated territory of the motherland which has been passed down
from generation to generation?"
</P>
<P>
The paper stresses that on the issue of safeguarding state
sovereignty and territorial integrity, China counts no cost and
abandons no solution, including the use of force, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
China's refusal to abandon the possible use of force is not
aimed at the Taiwan compatriots, but rather at a handful of
separatist forces who are engaged in plotting "Taiwan independence
", the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
If people like Lee Teng-hui are in power in Taiwan, it is not
right to have only one solution, peace, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It also stresses that China does not make the promise, because
there is interference by foreign forces, and that the Taiwan issue
is purely an internal issue of China, and will not be resolved by
foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that China retains the possible use of force in
order to make the utmost effort for peaceful reunification, and
avoid the use of force.
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army of China firmly supports the
stance of the Chinese government which hopes to resolve the Taiwan
issue by peaceful means. But "we have no choice," if Lee Teng-hui
persists in attempts to separate Taiwan from China, and adds that
Lee Teng-hui must be responsible for all consequences resulting
from his stance.

established.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Hainan became the fifth special economic zone, with
more profitable and open policies, and began to carry out many
projects in building, real estate, tropical cash crops, and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the 30-sq-km development zone of Yangpu was set up in
Hainan by a Hongkong-based company, and that same year Hainan's
per capita GDP reached 2,113 yuan, surpassing the national average.
</P>

<P>
In 1996, Hainan opened the country's first cooperation
investment project in the field of ocean petroleum and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 11 years, the province's infrastructure
construction has attracted a total of 8.65 billion US dollars, and

<P>
HAIKOU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province,
the country's largest special economic zone (SEZ), has now enjoyed
twenty years of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"I never thought Hainan could become so modern and developed,"
said Xing Ming, who was born and grew up in Haikou, capital of
this southernmost island province.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, my dream was to leave the city -- my poor
hometown -- and work in the metropolis of Guangzhou in Guangdong
Province," Xing said. "Compared with Guangzhou, Haikou was just
like a rural area, the highest building in the city was only six
storeys and there were almost no road construction sites or
telecommunication facilities."
</P>
<P>
"But now, hundreds of thousands of people across the country
would like to live and work on the island, and it has also become
appealing to both domestic and overseas investors," said Xing, who
runs an Internet company in Haikou.
</P>
<P>
With booming economic growth, Hainan has opened airports in
Haikou and the port city of Sanya, and an expressway between the
two cities. Moreover, the province has initiated a series of
transportation construction projects, including the Yuehai railway
connecting Hainan and the mainland.

Recently, the State Council has approved the establishment of
an agricultural high-tech zone in Hainan, and more than 200 Taiwan-
based investors have put in a total of 175 million US dollars to
tropical agricultural technological and industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the province has ranked first in terms of
economic growth speed among the five special economic zones in
China.
</P>
<P>
Yalong Bay in Sanya, known as "the first bay under the sun."
has been turned into a popular tourist destination handling
millions of visitors every year, said an official of the Hainan
Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Hainan has welcomed more than
four million tourists, and seen a 4.6 percent growth for overseas
tourists, said the official.
</P>
<P>
A local official attributed these achievements to the country's
reform and opening policies and joint efforts among government
departments.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening, 2.02 million people, one-third of Hainan's
population, were poverty-stricken. Now, 1.79 million formerly poor
people in the province have got rid of poverty thanks to the
development of local economy and the Hainan's large amount of
poverty-relief fund.
</P>
<P>
The island has three cities and 16 counties, and is the second
largest in China after Taiwan. Before becoming a province, the
island was under the jurisdiction of Guangdong Province.

<HEADLINE> Paper Comments on 100-Day Countdown to Return of Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, the
leading newspaper in China, carries a commentary entitled "Looking
Forward to a Historical Moment" on Saturday to mark the countdown
of 100 days before China resumes sovereignty over Macao on
December 20.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the upcoming return of Macao marks a
complete end to foreign colonial rule in China, an important step
toward the country's reunification, and another successful
implementation of the great concept of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao to the motherland is of profound importance
and will strongly push forward the great cause of the peaceful
reunification of the motherland as well as peace and development
in China and the Asia-Pacific Region, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The paper goes on to remind readers of Deng Xiaoping, whose
great concept of "one country, two systems" has paved the way for
a solution to the Macao issue and the complete reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" concept has not only provided a
successful example for the peaceful settlement of disputes left
over from history, it is also a creative way of thinking for the
resolution of complicated international disputes, the paper says,
adding that it is also a practical way to solve the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully confident of realizing the complete reunification
of the motherland under the concept of 'one country, two systems,'
" the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Practice shows that the Chinese people are capable of resuming
sovereignty over Macao, and have every confidence in their ability
to maintain long-term stability and development in Macao, the
commentary concludes.

<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th anniversary of the People'
s Republic of China. Xinhua News Agency is releasing 50 stories on
Chinese men and women, young and old, to illustrate the changes
that have taken place in China over the past half century. These
people will describe their lives and how they fit into the changes
in the motherland. This is the 21st story in the series.
</P>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- After exploring the
applications of herbal medicines for several decades, Chinese folk
doctor Lai Chunrong was able to advance theory in the field and
has become known as the "King of Herbal Medicine."
</P>
<P>
Born in 1951 in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province, Lai Chunrong was a diligent student at school and his
lifelong ambition was to become a writer.
</P>
<P>
But recurrent illnesses in Lai's family radically changed his
life. Lai's grandmother contracted skin cancer and his father then
died from tuberculosis. In deep grief, Lai vowed to go into
medicine to find cures for diseases.
</P>
<P>
Lai traveled widely in Zhejiang, and then went to east China's
Fujian Province and southwest China's Sichuan Province to learn
from renowned doctors of Chinese traditional medicine. He
eventually became knowledgeable enough to curing illnesses such as
leukemia and kidney diseases.
</P>
<P>
Lai practiced Chinese traditional medicine at home and abroad
while gaining increased popularity in the mainland of China, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
While practicing traditional medicine, Lai also devoted himself
to researching the applications of herbal medicines, and came up
with many original theories.
</P>
<P>
Lai said a competent doctor of Chinese traditional should be
able to discern the nature and function of different herbs by
paying attention to the environment for the growth of herbs, and
to apply them wisely in accordance with the nature of that
environment.
</P>
<P>
Lai also put forward the theory that differences may also exist
in herbs of the exact same kind due to differing environments, and
that these herbs have their own life cycles and should be
collected in their prime for the best results.

Preparations for the establishment of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) are being made in an active and

the "one country, two systems" principle is scientific and correct
and is also the only way to solve the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui's claim of statehood for Taiwan goes against the
historical trend and any separatist activities are doomed to
failure, he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Mourn Victims of Blasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin on Friday declared next Monday a day of mourning
for the victims killed in the blasts in Moscow and Buinaksk of
Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
As Putin addressed on television, rescue efforts were
continuing at the site of a powerful blast that ripped apart a
nine-story apartment building Wednesday night in southeast Moscow
where 75 bodies have been pulled out from under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The victims included of 32 women, five little girls, 34 men and
three little boys. The death toll is expected to continue rising
as rescuers excavate more bodies from the debris.
</P>
<P>
"Death of people is always a tragedy, whatever its cause,"
Putin said, adding that authorities are looking "whether it was
negligence, criminal carelessness in handling explosive substances
or a terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said it was almost certain
the blast was caused by an explosive device.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the blast, at 23:39:58 Wednesday night, also
suggested that it was an act of terror, the Itar-Tass news agency
quoted Luzhkov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, Putin approved a plan to prevent acts of
terrorism in Russia and Moscow proposed by the Federal Security
Service (FSB) and the Interior Ministry, FSB Director Nikolai
Patrushev said.
</P>
<P>
According to Patrushev, new information about the causes of the
Moscow explosion appeared at 23:00 Thursday -- traces of hexogen
and TNT were discovered at the site which proves that the
explosion was not accidental.
</P>
<P>
However, he said this scenario should not become predominant
and all other possibilities should also be checked, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in public support and people have actively
responded. The survivors are receiving energetic help and
assistance is being given to investigators," Patrushev said.
</P>
<P>
He said law enforcement bodies are getting numerous calls form
people willing to report information related to the explosion.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller with a Caucasus accent told Interfax
Thursday that the apartment explosion and a Saturday night bomb
blast in Buinaksk, Daghestan, were in response to Russia's
military campaign against Islamic rebels in the southern territory
of the republic bordering the breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The explosion in Buinaksk, Daghestan, believed to be staged by
Islamic militants, killed more than 60 people when a five-story
residential building was demolished by a car bomb.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's value of re-
export in July this year increased by 5.5 percent over a year
earlier while that of domestic export declined by 10.9 percent,
according to figures released by the Census and Statistics
Department Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department said the value of re-export in the month was 106.
4 billion HK dollars (13.64 billion U.S. dollars) and that of
domestic export 16.2 billion HK dollars (2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that Hong Kong's value of imports also
rose by 3.7 percent to 127.7 billion HK dollars (16.37 billion U.S.
dollars) compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
A substantial increase of 102 percent was recorded in the value
of re-exports to the Republic of Korea in July, compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Increases were also registered in the value of re-exports to
Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan,
the Netherlands, Germany and China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the first seven months of 1999 with the same period

machines and automatic data processing machines.
</P>
<P>
However, over the same period, decreases in the value of re-

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Denies Intention to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Friday denied that he intends to resign and delegate his
administrative tasks to a number of ministers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to ulemas from Jakarta and its environs here, Habibie
said he was surprised when an ambassador from a friendly country
asked him if he intends to quit.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said he knew nothing about the rumor.
</P>
<P>
He added that everything is under control and that he also pays
attention to the economic development in East Timor and other
Indonesian provinces.
</P>
<P>
Speculation was fueled by Habibie's sudden cancellation on
Wednesday of all out-of-town trips, including one to New Zealand
to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) informal
leaders' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Habibie told the ulemas that the government will not sacrifice
the 210 million people of Indonesia only for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, when opening a forum on the eradication of HIV/AIDS
here Friday, Habibie said the East Timor issue should not be
politically exploited at the expense of the people and integration
fighters in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that East Timor is different from Indonesia's
other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Despite East Timor's 24-year integration with Indonesia, he
said, the integration process has never been acknowledged by the
international community and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The government's commitment is obvious -- that it will
cooperate with the United Nations to cope with all problems (in
East Timor) during the transition (period)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said he was going to submit a report on the East Timor
issue to the upcoming general session of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will hand the East Timor issue to the United Nations
after the general session of the MPR in November, Habibie said,
adding that the country, in stages, will withdraw its security and
government personnel from the strife-torn territory.
</P>
<P>
In the August 30 direct autonomy ballot, 78.5 percent of East
Timorese voters favored independence, instead of wide-ranging
autonomy proposed by the Indonesian government in January this
year.
</P>
<P>
But, clashes between pro-integration and pro-independence
groups have taken place in East Timor since the announcement of
the ballot results on September 4, resulting in more than 100
deaths.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government on Tuesday placed East Timor under
martial law in face of escalating violence.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said the government was compelled to impose a state of
military emergency in East Timor as the situation went beyond
control after the announcement of the ballot result.
</P>
<P>
He said he would keep in touch with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to inform him and the international community about the
measures being taken in East Timor by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations.

MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) on Friday said here that it continues to monitor the
situation in East Timor extremely closely.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement released here, ADB said it joins the

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministers Call for Strengthening Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ministers attending the 11th
Ministerial Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum have strongly underlined the importance of working
together to strengthen markets in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement adopted at the end of the two-day ministerial
meeting Friday said the ministers agreed to a "road map" that sets
out future work of APEC to strengthen markets in the region.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening markets is one of the three themes of the 7th
informal meeting of APEC leaders following the ministerial
meeting, with the other two themes being "expanding opportunities
for business around the region" and "broadening support for APEC."
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Friday, Lockwood Smith, chairman of
the APEC ministerial meeting and New Zealand minister for
international trade, said APEC ministers agreed that a durable
recovery and a return to sustained economic growth will require
ongoing commitment to broader economic reform for strengthening
markets, in addition to trade and investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers also recognize that there is a need now to bring
together APEC's work across key areas such as trade and
investment, competition and regulatory reform, economic and
corporate governance, trade facilitation and efforts to reduce
administrative compliance costs on business," he said.
</P>
<P>
The market-strengthening initiative provides such an approach,
according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
The two-day ministerial meeting was in preparation for the 7th
informal meeting of APEC leaders scheduled for September 12 and 13
in Auckland, the largest city of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
APEC was established in 1989 in response to the growing
interdependence among Asia-Pacific economies. It is a grouping of
21 regional economies set up to improve the stability, security
and prosperity of its peoples.
</P>
<P>
It now groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, China's
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> China Strives to Become  Major Economic Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- In the past five decades,
China's drive to become a major economic power has succeeded to
the extent that the country is now the seventh largest economy in
the world.
</P>
<P>
According to forecasts by international groups such as the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
China will grow into one of the world's top economic powers in the
first 25 years of the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
In the first three decades after New China was founded in 1949,
the nation had an average annual economic growth rate of 6.1
percent a year, far lower than that of Asia's "four dragon"
economies -- Singapore, Korea, Thailand and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Since China began reform and opening up to the outside world in
1979, the economic growth rate has jumped to 9.8 percent a year on
average, 7.3 percentage points higher than that of the developed
countries, and 4.8 percent higher than that of the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
As China became one of the largest producer of major industrial
and agricultural products in the world, its scientific,
educational and public health levels have reached the world's
upper-middle standard. The people of China now are advancing from
a sufficient life to a comfortable life, as the country plays an
increasingly important role in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, China relied on soft loans from the former Soviet
Union as the major source of foreign investment. During the period
from the 1960s to the end of the 1970s, China had acquired only a
limited amount of foreign fund by attracting bank deposits from
Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
By 1978, China's foreign exchange reserve was only 170 million
US dollars. After two decades of reform and opening up, this
amount increased to the second largest in the world, while income
from international tourism grew to the seventh largest.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, China has been the second largest destination of
international investment, following the United States.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, China's exports accounted for only 0.75 percent and
imports for only 0.81 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China became the ninth largest exporting nation, with
export value accounting for 3.4 percent and import value accounted
for 2.5 percent of the world's total.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Vice-Chairman Confident of Macao's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ma Man Kei, vice-chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Friday expressed his confidence
in a brighter future of Macao after its return to China on
December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua just before the 100-day countdown
of Macao's return to China, Ma said Macao's return is of great
significance to the Chinese nation and the international community.
</P>
<P>
It will signify the end of foreign occupation of Chinese
territory, and will also set an example for the ultimate
reunification of the country with its implementation of the "one
country, two systems" principle, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who has lived in Macao for over half a century, said Macao
people are quite delighted with the return, which demonstrates
that China has become stronger and more prosperous after the
founding of the People's Republic of China, especially since the
reform and opening-up policy was launched 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
has won common recognition in the community, Ma said. He expressed
the belief that the law will surely be carried out smoothly in
Macao after its return.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to the future, Ma stressed that Macao people
must continue to promote their patriotic tradition and that the
Macao SAR government will firmly observe the one-China principle
on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Under the "one country, two systems" principle, Macao will
actively continue its exchanges with the outside world and work
hard to serve as a bridge between the mainland and Taiwan, Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Concerned Over India's Arms Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday expressed
its deep concern over India's plans for "large-scale acquisition,
operationalization and deployment of land-, air- and sea-based
nuclear weapons and massive build-up of sophisticated conventional
weaponry."
</P>
<P>
The country's Defense Committee of Cabinet, which met here
under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, deliberated
on security-related matters and reviewed the situation in the
region and the "serious implications of India's nuclear doctrine."
</P>
<P>
India's offensive military capability will be "a threat not
only to the security of Pakistan but also to the peace and
stability of the entire Indian Ocean region and beyond," the
committee said in a statement issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
India last month released its nuclear doctrine draft which
envisages the acquisition of hundreds of nuclear warheads and
various delivering systems plus a large quantity of advanced
conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
The committee reiterated Pakistan's policy of restraint and
called on the international community to formulate a "coherent and
determined" response to arrest India's "dangerous plans for
nuclear and conventional arms escalation."
</P>
<P>
Senior cabinet members and military leaders attended the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Toronto International Film Festival Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Toronto International Film
Festival opened late Thursday, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
During the 10-day event, which ends on September 18, more than
300 films from 52 countries will be projected.
</P>
<P>
Dominating the 24th annual film festival are 171 international
feature films, including 14 Canadian films, of which one by
Canadian director Atom Egoyan was screened at the opening day.
</P>
<P>
The event has been described as "the world's second most
important after Cannes" by American film critic Roger Ebert, local
media said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Although Cannes is still larger, Toronto is more useful and
more important certainly to North America," Ebert was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of film stars are expected in Canada's most populous
city, including Ralph Fiennes, Robin Williams and Susan Sarandon.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Cannes, Venice and Montreal, Toronto is market
oriented without jury to vote on awards for specific international
films.
</P>
<P>
The box office reported a record income of 1.9 million Canadian
dollars (about 1.3 million U.S. dollars) last year, with the city
services netting another 48 million (about 3.3 million dollars)
during the festival.

<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Air Force has gone
to the internet to attract bids for its retired combat and
transport aircraft in order to get the best bargain in the world
second-hand military aviation market.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government Friday
launched a special program for assisting the families living in
poverty, providing women with mini-credits.
</P>
<P>
Angolan First Lady Paula Ana dos Santos inaugurated the
mini-credit program and handed the loans to the people in need
from the the province of Luanda.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, some 100 women living in poverty accepted the
loans, 100 U.S. dollars for each, delivered by the Angolan
Ministry of Family and Promotion of Women, with an aim to help
them do small business and hence find their means of subsistence.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, those women will have to make a
symbolic restitution of the loans with interests in 20 weeks, as
an essential step for future support.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has learned experience in the mini-credit program
from the non-government organizations which promoted a similar
program two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Those women who used the loans to sell bread, fish, ice cream
and other things could get more loans after making restitution of
the money with interests.

<HEADLINE> UWCC Promotes TDMA Technology in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official from
the US-based Universal Wireless Communications Consortium (UWCC)
said today the UWCC hopes to cooperate with China in the future to
help China develop its "third generation" wireless
telecommunication technology.
</P>
<P>
Sheila Mickool, President of the UWCC, said at today's news
conference that the UWCC aims to offer the best solutions for the
needs of China's growing telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
The UWCC, set up in 1996, is a non-profit industry organization
of over 100 telecommunication carriers and vendors supporting TDMA
(Time Division Multiple Access) and WIN (Wireless Intelligent
Network) technology standards. The purpose of this cooperative is
to promote TDMA/WIN as an integrated global wireless
communications technology in the "third generation"
telecommunication era.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 20 million cellular phone subscribers.
The cell phone network predominately utilizes GSM standard,
considered second generation standard technology.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the switch to a third generation level,
available in the next few years, China has agreed to open the
market up to multiple standards.
</P>
<P>
One of the advantages of TDMA lies in its future inter-
operability with GSM, which is the chief telecommunication
standard employed in China, said Mickool.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the UWCC has been in China this week and has
held talks with officials and firms from the industry.

current visit will make new contributions to this friendship.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that major Western European Union (WEU)
countries are members of the European Union (EU), and said that
with the efforts of both sides, relations between China and the EU
and its member countries have maintained sound development in
recent years.

levels have been active, and fruits have been reaped in
cooperation in all fields. Li voiced special appreciation for the
series of measures taken by the EU last year to improve relations
with China.

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministers Support Realization of E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ministers attending the 11th
Ministerial Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum have approved measures for moving more rapidly toward
paperless trading throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement adopted at the end of the two-day ministerial
meeting Friday said the ministers accorded high priority to a
number of targets for achieving paperless trading, where possible,
by 2005 for developed APEC member economies and 2010 for
developing ones.
</P>
<P>
"Electronic commerce has the potential to provide an
extraordinary stimulus to regional growth and trade," the
statement said. It added that the private sector has the key role
in driving change and innovation and the primary role of the
public sector is to ensure a favorable regulatory environment for
electronic commerce to flourish.
</P>
<P>
APEC member economies should pay particular attention to the
needs of consumers and small businesses, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the participating ministers encouraged APEC
member economies to take advantage of the self-assessment tool for
electronic commerce readiness to be developed by officials and the
private sector and tasked officials to further refine the
assessment tool and report back next year.
</P>
<P>
They directed officials to develop effective data and
indicators of electronic commerce uptake in APEC member economies
and encouraged APEC member economies to consider the model law of
the U.N. Commission for International Trade Law in developing
their regulatory frameworks.
</P>
<P>
They also instructed officials to initiate work on consumer
protection, focusing on information sharing, benchmarking and best
practices and to develop an APEC-wide plan to support the use of
electronic commerce by small- and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the joint statement, the participating ministers
welcomed proposals from Japan to host an APEC electronic commerce
convention and an electronic commerce leaders seminar and by
Brunei and Japan to co-host a workshop on electronic commerce in
June next year.
</P>
<P>
The two-day ministerial meeting was in preparation for the 7th
informal meeting of APEC leaders scheduled for September 12 and 13
in Auckland, the largest city of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
APEC was established in 1989 in response to the growing
interdependence among Asia-Pacific economies. It is a grouping of
21 regional economies set up to improve the stability, security
and prosperity of its peoples.
</P>
<P>
It now groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, China's
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian exchanged views on international and regional security and
defense issues here today with visiting President of Assembly of
Western European Union Luis Maria de Puig.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
a state councilor, said that China highly valued its relations
with the European Union. China hopes to continue friendly
cooperation in various spheres with EU member countries so as to
establish Sino-EU constructive partnership of long-term stability.
</P>
<P>
On the international situation, Chi said that China stands for
the forming of a multi-polarized world and opposes hegemonism and
power politics. The NATO bombing of the sovereign state of
Yugoslavia under the pretext of protecting human rights, actually
worsened the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chi also stressed that the Taiwan issue is entirely China's
internal affair, which China has the ability to settle on its own,
and in which China strongly opposes any outside interference.
</P>
<P>
Puig said that the current visit by the delegation aims to
enhance understanding of China and exchange views with China on
international and regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The Western European Union approves of a multi-polarized world
and favors the guiding role of the United Nations in world affairs,
he said, adding that the union hopes to strengthen dialogue and
cooperation with China in the defense field.

<HEADLINE> ITF Suggests Two Priorities for Chinese Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- It is a real problem that
China, such a densely populated country, is yet to put itself on
the map of world tennis.
</P>
<P>
International Tennis Federation(ITF) has made the prescription
for the development of Chinese tennis and suggested two main
priorities including coaches training and junior development.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Frank Couraud, the ITF development project
administrator, laid his fingers on the weakness of the Chinese
coaches, saying that they have fell short of tennis theories.
</P>
<P>
"They have to receive tennis education which did not exist here
before. They did study something about the sports science but not
specific to tennis," said the official who came here to help
organise a clinic for coaches from across the country.
</P>
<P>
Frank, who has learned Chinese at the Paris University, added
in Chinese that "China has no tennis lessons."
</P>
<P>
The ITF has decided to make the Chinese coaches more conscious
of tennis as they set off giving Level One discourse in four
different cities of China this year and deliver Level Two
discourse next year.
</P>
<P>
After giving lessons at the first clinic based in Tianjin,
north of China, and produced a group of qualified tutors, Frank
shifted his teaching role to supervision here as he stood beside
the tutors, inserting his ideas from time to time to make sure his
teachings get across to the coaches.
</P>
<P>
Frank also laid bare other shortcomings of the local coaches,
saying that they need to do more to increase their "exposure" and
"knowledge".
</P>
<P>
"They need more exposure, they need to travel a lot, go outside
with the team to attend international competitions.
</P>
<P>
"And my general impression is that not everyone like to learn
knowledge," he said. "To be a good coach, you need to have
knowledge, good playing skill as well as experience outside."
</P>
<P>
Frank listed the junior development as the other priority for
Chinese tennis.
</P>
<P>
Under the sponsorship of the world tennis ruling body, China
has staged two under-14 junior tournaments in Tianjin early this
year and following that the ITF selected the best eight from the
competitors to send them to Europe this July.
</P>
<P>
"We selected four boys and four girls who are the best of them
for the European serial competitions. They spent five weeks there
and it ran quite well with one girl winning one of the four legs."
said Frank.
</P>
<P>
As for the Chinese players Frank said that they are excellent
in groundstrokes but their volley and net game remain to be
improved.
</P>
<P>
"They are strong baseliners, they have no problems in physique
at all, but their coaches need to focus not only on just how to
play forehand and backhand, they need to know how to teach net
game and have a vision of modern game that is big serve and net
game."
</P>
<P>
Asked if China will produce star players just like Peter
Sampras and Steffi Graf, Frank said that "you have to believe in
yourself, believe your potential".

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A five-day international
symposium on the protection of the crested ibis closed today in
Yangxian County, in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, with
adoption of a draft declaration to protect the rare species.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 ibis experts and government officials from Japan,
the U.S., China and the International Nature Protection Union
attended the symposium.
</P>
<P>
The origin of the endangered species has been traced back 60
million years, with large flocks formerly existing in most part of
China, Japan and Germany. Today, the species is found only in
China.
</P>
<P>
The crested ibis population has grown from merely seven in 1981,
when it was first found in China, to the present 200-plus as a
result of environmental protection measures adopted by the Chinese
government, including a ban on fertilizer and lumbering in areas
close to the species' natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that this rare species has not escaped
threat of extinction, though the number of ibis in the wild or
raised by men has increased.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Faction Strife Kills Eight in Lagos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Inter-union violence among
Nigerian dock workers in in the busy Apapa wharf and Tin Can
Island in Nigeria's commercial hub Lagos has killed eight people
on Thursday and severely disrupted business activities there.
</P>
<P>
Men wielding dangerous implements seized control of the ports
Thursday before anti-riot Police Mobile Force squadrons of the
Lagos Police Command raided the offices of the Nigeria Ports
Authority and other agencies to flush out the protesters.
</P>
<P>
Lagos State Police Commissioner, Michael Okiro, confirmed the
casualties, saying that scores of people including policemen were
wounded in the clash.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Friday quoted the commissioner as saying
that the trouble started when former executives of the dock
workers union, who were recently voted out of office, refused to
hand over to their successors.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they hired members of the union from nearby Ajegunle
to seize offices at the ports and unleash Mayhem, Okiro said.
</P>
<P>
The two sea ports are calm again and workers there are going
about their usual business, said the Lagos police chief.
</P>
<P>
About 10 persons were arrested as policemen fought the
rampaging protesters away from the sea ports and pushed them back
into the densely populated suburb of Ajegunle.
</P>
<P>
The police and the protesters exchanged gun shots until
Thursday noon. The police cordoned off the routes leading to the
riot scene and this led to chaotic traffic situation on major
highways adjoining Apapa.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Income Taxation for Domestic, Foreign-Funded Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China has been studying a plan
to incorporate income tax into domestic and overseas-financed
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhiyong, head of international department of the State
Taxation Administration, said the plan incorporates two principles:
gradually granting national treatment to overseas investors; and
highlighting China's interest in industrial development by
offering preferential policies for taxation.
</P>
<P>
In an address to a recent symposium at the ongoing 3rd China
Investment and Trade Fair held in Xiamen City, Fujian Province,
Zhang explained that national treatment to overseas investors in
China requires that the foreign-financed ventures share the same
tax burdens as businesses funded solely by Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Also, overseas investors will be allowed to enter more areas
including finance, insurance, prospecting and development of
mineral resources. he said.
</P>
<P>
The plan should be conducive to diverting overseas investment
into projects capable of improving China's industrialization
standard, and into sectors of agriculture, energy, transport,
major raw materials, Zhang stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that it would take time to finish the plan, so the
present preferential treatment in income taxation now enjoyed by
overseas-backed businesses will not be changed in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The current standards of income taxes for overseas-backed
businesses were drafted in the early years of China's opening-up
drive, including a range of favorable articles to attract overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
The preferential sway has proved effective in attracting
overseas investors, but has created a policy gap between domestic
businesses and overseas-invested ventures. It has also led to less
diversion of overseas funds to remote and poverty-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, taxes from foreigners, which mainly came from
overseas-financed businesses, made up 14.4 percent of China's
total industrial and commercial taxes.

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministers Support Launch of New WTO Round Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Trade ministers
attending the 11th Ministerial Meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum Friday took a significant step
toward the launch of a new round of multilateral trade
negotiations at the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement adopted at the end of the two-day
ministerial meeting preceding the 7th informal meeting of APEC
leaders, the trade ministers participating in the meeting formally
expressed their support for the launch of a new round of WTO
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
They also encouraged the acceleration of accession negotiations
for APEC's non-WTO members in accordance with WTO rules, based on
commercially viable market access commitments and a balance of
rights and obligations. They agreed that these economies should be
able to participate in some capacity in the forthcoming WTO round.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement said the participating ministers
"reaffirmed their commitment to open regionalism and to the
multilateral trading system, underlining the critical importance
of the forthcoming WTO negotiations in liberalizing trade and
investment within the region and in encouraging growth in the
global economy."
</P>
<P>
"They agreed in addition that the agenda for the negotiations
be balanced and sufficiently broad-based to respond to the
interests of all economies, and confirmed the negotiations should
conclude within three years," it said.
</P>
<P>
The participating ministers also agreed that support for and
consultation among APEC economies about ongoing WTO negotiations
should remain a key area of APEC's work throughout the course of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two-day ministerial meeting was in preparation for the 7th
informal meeting of APEC leaders scheduled for September 12-13 in
Auckland, the largest city of New Zealand. APEC was established in
1989 in response to the growing interdependence among Asia-Pacific
economies. It is a grouping of 21 regional economies set up to
improve the stability, security and prosperity of its peoples.
</P>
<P>
It now groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, China's
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Securities Company
Limited has been approved by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) to increase its registered capital from 400

today.
</P>
<P>
The company will change its name to Huatai Securities Company

shareholders.
</P>

According to the Securities Law that took effect on July 1,
only those companies with more that 500 million registered capital

including Xiangcai, Zhongxin, Guangfa, Xingye and Great Wall to
increase their registered capital.

CAIRO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Seven more people have been
killed and five others injured in the latest of an unprecedented
surge of road accidents.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place Thursday on a road near the tourist
resort of Luxor, 550 kilometers south of Cairo, when a truck
crashed into a mini-bus, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
security sources said the truck ran into the bus when its
driver, identified as Sami Latif Ayyad, 30, was trying to overtake
a tractor.
</P>
<P>
The report neither mentioned the fate of the truck driver nor
gave the number of passengers on the bus.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt due to high speed and
drivers' failure to abide by rules and regulations. Official
estimation has put the annual death toll at nearly 6,000, with
30,000 more injuries.
</P>
<P>
A government committee is looking into the rising number of
traffic accidents on Egyptian roads, especially in rural areas,
which the local media have dubbed "roads of death."

PARIS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Since the legalization of donation of human sperm in 1973,
about 35,000 children have been born in France with donated sperm
and 6,000 of them have grown up. Jean-Loup Clement, a psychologist
working at the Center of Study and Conservation of Human Eggs and
Sperm based in Lyon, is making an inquiry about how the children
born of biological unknown fathers are living their difference
with others.
</P>
<P>
-- In a report entitled "A New Beginning," former British
governor in Hong Kong Chris Patten proposed that the Royal Ulster
Constabulary (RUC), the Northern Ireland police force, be reformed
to represent all the inhabitants of the British province. Invited
by British Prime Minister Tony Blair to propose the reform of the
RUC, Patten aims to depoliticize the 13,000-strong police force,
92 percent of which are made up with Protestants in a territory
with 42 percent of its population Catholic.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The market has applauded the primary results of the early
half year from big enterprises. The Paris CAC 40 stock index
attained a new record high with 4,717.42 points, which is 20
percent higher than the beginning of January. The French
automobile tire group Michelin saw its stock value rise by 12.6
percent after announcing a better performance than predicted in
the early half this year.
</P>
<P>
-- The World Health Organization has criticized the disorder in
donating medical materials to refugees. It said that more than
half of the medicines collected for the victims of conflicts and
natural disasters are not adapted to international norms.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- Born from a Big Bang 15 billion years ago, the Universe
continues to expand. Recent analysis of the star light, the
supernova, shows that far from slowing down or stabilizing, this
expansion is accelerating. Two teams of astronomers reported that
the galaxies are moving further and further away from each other
in an infinite expansion, as the Universe is afraid of vacuum and
is in a hurry to fill it.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia is speeding up

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Implement Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian side expected
the Israeli government to fully and timely implement the newly
signed peace accord to move the Mideast peace process forward,
said a senior Palestinian official here Friday.
</P>
<P>
After Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's approval of the
redeployment maps delivered to him by the Israeli side, his
political advisor Nabil Abu rdeineh told reporters that Arafat
approved the maps after studying them carefully with his military
advisors.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and his advisors expressed their hope that the Israeli
side will carry out in time the troop redeployment from the West
Bank as showed by the maps.
</P>
<P>
The maps outlined the 7 percent of the West Bank land Israel
will transfer to the Palestinian civilian administration. This is
the first-stage transfer of the West Bank land under the latest
Palestinian-Israeli peace deal signed last weekend in Egyptian Red
Sea Resort Sharm el Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel should pull out from another 11 percent
of the West Bank in three stages, with the remaining two taking
place on November 15 and January 20.
</P>
<P>
Abu rdeineh said Israeli side will begin the transfer within 24
hours after Arafat's approval.
</P>
<P>
The first handover does not require an Israeli troops
redeployment. The land in question has no Israeli military bases
and is sparsely populated. But the other two involve troops
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the new peace deal after a year of
deadlock, events were unfolding rapidly, with the first batch of
200 Palestinian political prisoners released Thursday morning, a
day ahead of time. The remaining 150 will get freedom on October 8.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli side released 200 Palestinian prisoners on
Thursday and today it delivered the maps to us, this showed
Israel wants to implement the peace accord and we hope Israel to
implement the accord totally and carry out other troop
redeployment from the West Bank," Abu rdeineh added.
</P>
<P>
According to the new deal, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
and Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas will enter the long-overdue
final status talks, which will deal with the thorny issues such as
Palestinian statehood, final borders, the status of Jerusalem, the
future of the settlements and the fate of millions of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the a permanent peace agreement is September
20, 1999.

<HEADLINE> 700 Nigerian Youths Infected by AIDS Daily: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- About 700 young Nigerians aged
between 10 and 24 are getting infected with the AIDS virus
everyday, a Nigerian scientist has said.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Tony Elujoba, Dean of the Faculty of Pharmacy of Obafemi
Awolowo University, painted this frightening picture in Akure of
Nigeria's southwest Ondo State Thursday when delivering a lecture
on "The Scourge of AIDS" to mark this year's Pharmacy Week
organized by the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that it was almost certain that in the next
three years, a larger percentage of the populace would test HIV
positive, the Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Elujoba also said that "unless something is done in Nigeria
and other countries to check the menace of AIDS, the next
millennium will herald the era of the world's destruction through
mass dying of the people."
</P>
<P>
Quoting figures from an HIV/AIDS study conducted by his
university, Elujoba said that the scourge of AIDS is gradually
becoming more menacing with the number of the HIV carriers
worldwide expected to rise from 10 million in 1990 to an expected
30 million next year.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the lecture open, Ondo State Commissioner for Health
Rahman Mimiko urged the governments in Africa to make concerted
efforts to curtail the spread of HIV/AIDS on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He said that all levels of government must, as a matter of
urgency, embark on massive enlightenment campaign to educate the
citizens on the menace of the deadly scourge.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that while the AIDS scourge is on the decrease in
developed countries, it is actually increasing in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 1. 7 million young people in Africa
get the deadly virus yearly.

KAMPALA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has pardoned more than 200 prisoners, the Monitor daily

</P>
<P>
Museveni's dispensation of mercy was contained in a letter to

The report said that 90 of the pardoned prisoners are soldiers
jailed for non-capital offences. They also include the terminally
sick, the elderly, juveniles and pregnant/breast-feeding mothers.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, all prisoners who serve life sentences
(20 years), but are left with six to 12 months to go and those
aged 60 and above would be freed.

the prison department of some congestion, adding that the
juveniles are waiting for the justice minister's release order.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opium Output Rises to Record Level: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's total
production of raw opium for 1999 was estimated to be a record
4,600 metric tons, more than doubling the production of 2,100 tons
in 1998, according to a U.N. survey released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The annual opium survey conducted by the United Nations
International Drug Control Program (UNDCP) indicates that the area
under poppy cultivation increased by 43 percent from 64,000
hectares in 1998 to some 91,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
"The record output in Afghanistan is a cause for great
concern," stated a U.N. official when releasing the survey here.
</P>
<P>
"UNDCP has been very successful in working together with a
number of countries towards reducing production of illicit drugs.
Unfortunately this has not been the case in Afghanistan and the
results are there for all to see," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is imperative to strengthen the drug control
capabilities of the countries which border Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Cheetah Cub Rescued in Kenyan Game Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A cheetah cub wandering in
the game reserve and likely to fall prey to hyenas or jackals has
been rescued in south Kenya, the East African Standard reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The week-old baby cheetah was rescued by a driver-guide named
Francis Uvyu Monday when he stopped the van so that his guests
could get close-ups, obviously anticipating to see the mother
cheetah around.
</P>
<P>
To their surprise, there was no mother cheetah in the vicinity.
Uvyu knew that without the protection of a mother, the baby
cheetah would be probably killed by scavengers roaming in the
national park.
</P>
<P>
Having made sure there were no dangerous animals around, Uvyu
got out of the vehicle and returned holding the week-old cub.
</P>
<P>
After his contacts with the Kenya Wildlife Service, the cheetah
was flown to Kenya's capital Nairobi where it is being looked
after at the Animal Orphanage.

PHNOM PENH, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's civil authority

In order to avoid unexpected accidents, the Civil Aviation
authority has issued an announcement to the public, especially to
the people living near airports to keep the kites away from the

<HEADLINE> Israel Pulls out From 7 percent of West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian and Israeli
officials Friday signed the maps outlining the handover of 7
percent more of the West Bank land to the Palestinian civilian
control.
</P>
<P>
Three days ahead of schedule, Israel will transfer as of Friday
400 square kilometers of the West Bank to the Palestinians,
another step to implement the latest Palestinian-Israeli peace
accord of the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum signed last weekend in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Those areas will be transferred from Area C to Area B, in which
Israel has security control while the Palestinians exercise
civilian administration.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat approved the redeployment maps
delivered to him by the Israeli side after a early morning
close-door meeting between the Palestinian and Israeli
officials. The handover took effect immediately after the
signature of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's political advisor Nabil Abu Rdeineh told reporters
after Arafat's approval that Israel will carry out redeployment
within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, Israel should transfer another 11
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in three stages, with
the last two taking place in November 15 and January 20 next year.
</P>
<P>
The Sharm el-Sheikh accord resulting from weeks of agonizing
negotiations also provides for the release of 350 political
Palestinian prisoners and the start of final status talks on
September 13 to deal with the thorny issues such as the borders
and nature of the Palestinian entity, and the future of the Jewish
settlements and status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks should be concluded on September 13 next
year.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of 200 Palestinian political prisoners got
freedom on Thursday morning, the first step to carry out the new
accord, and the remaining 150 will be freed on October 8.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese cities reported
deteriorating air quality this week, according to a report
released today by the China Environment Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
China's northernmost areas, affected by a subtropical high
pressure system, reported clear weather, but suffered from
pollution caused by suspended particles in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
From September 3-9, most of China received little precipitation
and reported higher temperature than that in past years. Seven
cities -- Hohhot, Yinchuan, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Taiyuan,
and Chongqing -- recorded a pollution index exceeding 100.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six cities, including Beijing, Xining, Shanghai, Tianjin,
Jinan, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen enjoyed good air quality. Thirteen
cities, including Guilin, Kunming, Hefei, and Haikou, chalked up
excellent air quality.
</P>
<P>
Hohhot, Yinchuan, Taiyuan, and Lanzhou suffered from moderate
pollution from suspended particles. The major atmospheric problem
in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Shenzhen was nitrogen oxide,
while in Chongqing it was sulfur dioxide.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Blast Toll Reaches 69, Rescue Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers have pulled out 69
bodies from the rubble of an apartment building ripped apart by a
powerful explosion early Thursday in southeastern Moscow, Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rescue efforts are continuing as over 50 people are still
believed to be under the debris, but not a single survivor had
been spotted for over 20 hours, the Itar-Tass news agency said.
Pockets of fire in the basements, smoke and steaming have hampered
the rescuers.
</P>
<P>
The total injured number in the blast in the nine-story
building in 19 Gurianov Street was put at 252, with 22 of them
children. A total of 46 people remain hospitalized, including two
in serious condition, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Investigators were still trying to determine the cause of the
blast, which was said to be equal to up to 400 kilograms of TNT.
</P>
<P>
A natural-gas explosion was initially blamed, but later a bomb
was said to be more likely.
</P>
<P>
"The nature of damage and the number of casualties" suggested
an explosive device was placed inside the building, the Federal
Security Service, the main successor to the Soviet KGB, said in a
statement, adding that no one had claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov, who has a degree in chemistry, said late Thursday that
a military explosive called hexagon was the most probable cause of
the blast, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Hexagon, also called RDX, was used by most of the warring
powers in the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
All nine stories in the center section of the block-long
building collapses in the explosion that occurred shortly after
midnight, but apartments on either side were left intact.
</P>
<P>
The blast shattered windows in buildings hundreds of meters
away from the scene and turned over cars in surrounding streets.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov said 15 buildings were damaged, mainly with windows
shattered, and a nearby school and kindergarten lost windows,
doors and doorframes. About 800 apartments would have to be
repaired, while the people registered in 286 apartments would have
to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller with a Caucasus accent told Interfax on
Thursday that the apartment explosion and a Saturday night bomb
blast in Buinaksk, Daghestan, were in response to Russia's
military campaign against Islamic rebels in the southern territory
of the republic bordering the breakaway Chechnya.

<P>
The ministers in the statement strongly emphasized the
importance of working together to strengthen markets in the region

investment, competition and regulatory reform and capacity
building, with a view to generating sustained growth in APEC
economies," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the participating ministers also emphasized the
importance of improving conditions for business through such
measures as trade facilitation.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the ministers called for efforts
for assisting developing members of APEC.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers agreed that the concerns of developing economies
should be addressed through enhanced attention to the effective
implementation of special and differential treatment and ongoing
support for capacity building and technical assistance, so as to
facilitate their ability to participate fully in the WTO," it
said.
</P>
<P>
On electronic commerce, the statement emphasized that
"Electronic commerce has the potential to provide an extraordinary
stimulus to regional growth and trade." The participating
ministers encouraged APEC members to adopt measures to promote the
development of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
The two-day ministerial meeting was in preparation for the 7th
informal meeting of APEC leaders scheduled for September 12-13 in
Auckland, the largest city of New Zealand.
</P>

strengthening the functioning of markets, and broadening support
for APEC.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Amends Guidelines for External Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has introduced amendments
to the guidelines for marriage between Egyptian women and
foreigners in an effort to safeguard the rights of the Egyptian
women.
</P>
<P>
Under the new guidelines endorsed by the Justice Ministry on
Thursday, the foreign husbands are obliged to finish the wedding
procedures and sign the marriage contracts in person, the Arabic
Al-Akhbar daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The notary public houses must make sure that the bride attends
the wedding ceremony and approves the marriage.
</P>
<P>
The original guidelines allowed foreigners to be deputized when
they complete the necessary legal procedures under the proxy
system.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations also stipulated that the official
registrars should make sure that the age difference between the
would-be spouses does not exceed 14.
</P>
<P>
A foreigner must deposit in the name of his bride-to-be
before marriage 25,000 pounds (7,350 U.S. dollars) in an Egyptian
bank and the money can only be withdrawn by the Egyptian woman.
</P>
<P>
A bridegroom should produce a certificate, documented by the
embassy of his country, on his health, and financial and social
status. Legal action may be taken against the embassy in case the
information is incorrect.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Farouk Seif el-Nasr said on Thursday that
the new guidelines are aimed at securing the rights of the
Egyptians who marry foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Both Stocks, Dollar Up in Tokyo on Dollar-Supportive Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed moderately
higher in Tokyo on Friday, helped by the U.S. dollar's upturn
against the yen following the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) dollar-
supportive market intervention.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 33.46 points, or 0.19
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 17,711.02.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 7.24 points or 0.48 percent to 1,514.
86.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index opened lower after the dollar had plunged to a
three-year low of 107.55 yen at one stage in New York on Thursday,
but turned upward soon after as the dollar rebounded following the
BOJ's market intervention.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, the key market gauge lost upward momentum,
partly because the dollar weakened slightly, dampening market
sentiment again, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section ballooned to 1,172.08 million
shares from 474.00 million shares Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers exceeded
gainers 658 to 565 despite the overall gain in the Nikkei index,
with 120 issues closing unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar rose sharply
against the yen on the BOJ's market intervention.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m., the U.S. currency was quoted at 108.90-93 yen, up
from 107.71-74 yen at 9 a.m., and from 108.00-10 yen in New York
overnight. The dollar was traded at 108.82-85 yen in Tokyo late
Thursday.

Mahathir Mohamad said Friday that the government will continue to
maintain a balance in the economic status of the various races to
ensure continuous harmony in the country.
</P>
<P>
The recent economic crisis has destroyed 30 years of the
government's efforts to achieve a balance in the economic status
of the various races and now a more concerted effort has to be
made to ensure that a balanced status is achieved, he said when
opening the Fourth Bumiputera (aboriginals) Economic Congress
here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his government would strive to achieve the
objective of 30 percent distribution of the country's wealth to
Bumiputeras who comprise 60 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir called upon Bumiputera entrepreneurs to examine their
shortcomings especially in managing their businesses to continue
to achieve progress, saying such weaknesses had greatly
contributed to the failure of the government's efforts to assist
them.
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of progress in the country, the government also has
to face the challenges of ideas on globalization, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the two-day congress had a dialogue with
Mahathir, wanting the government to continue to assist Bumiputera
entrepreneurs in facing the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The congress is aimed at assessing the performance and
achievement of Bumiputeras since the New Economic Policy was
introduced in the early 1970's and charting a direction and
drawing up a long-term and short-term action plan for the
development of Bumiputeras.

<HEADLINE> U.S. National Semiconductor Corp. Reports Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The National Semiconductor
Corp., a leading U.S. maker of semiconductors for cell phones and
wireless devices, on Thursday reported unexpected profits in its
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 2.6 percent to 481.8 million U.S. dollars for the
fiscal first quarter ended August 29, from 469.6 million dollars
in the same period of last year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clara, California-based company had a profit of 47.1
million dollars for the quarter, compared to a loss of 104.8
million dollars a year earlier, said National Semiconductor
spokesman Bill Callahan.
</P>
<P>
"They've certainly eliminated those parts of the business that
were hemorrhaging the worst and what's left happens to be enjoying
a huge boom," said analyst Drew Peck at SG Cowen. "National Semi
is now in a much better place."
</P>
<P>
Last week, National Semiconductor completed its exit from its
Cyrix microprocessor business after an attempt to compete with
chip giant Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
The company said it was ahead of schedule in returning to
profitability and that orders during the normally slow summer
quarter were stronger than expected.
</P>
<P>
Orders for its analog chips, its core business, rose 57 percent
from a year ago, led by wireless circuits and other power-
management devices used in cell phones, among other equipment.
</P>
<P>
"The analog market is strong and the industry, overall, is
moving into the sweet spot of a (recovery) cycle," said analyst
Mark Edelstone at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Rules out Further Maize Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
ruled out further importation of maize in a bid to protect the
interest of the local maize farmers.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Agriculture Minister Chris Obure said Thursday that as
long as Kenya has the capacity to produce them, maize must not be
imported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said that maize harvesting has started
in parts of the east African country and initial fears over maize
shortage have been allayed after a two million bags (180,000 tons)
of imports.
</P>
<P>
In late July this year, the Kenyan government lowered import
duty on maize from 32.5 percent to 25 percent after poor rains
which augured a shortfall in food.
</P>
<P>
Kenya will not allow importation of agricultural products which
Kenya can produce, the Daily Nation newspaper Friday quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cheap imports of eggs, onions and sugar are flooding
Kenya's domestic market, Obure noted, citing that it would hurt
the economy badly.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, agriculture accounts for about 80
percent of the country's employment and is the backbone of the
economy.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Form Medical Services Inspection Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
planned to establish an inspection and audit unit as a measure to
ensure efficient delivery of medical services to Kenyans and to
eradicate corruption in the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The plan was announced here Thursday by Minister for Medical
Service Amukowa Anangwe, who is one of the two ministers of the
Health Ministry appointed by President Daniel arap Moi Monday.
</P>
<P>
The unit will conduct random checks and inspections in
government health institutions to ensure that drugs and other
medical supplies reach their intended destinations, the Kenya
Times newspaper Friday quoted Anangwe as saying
</P>
<P>
"This will completely eradicate the rampant theft of drugs and
other medical supplies in government hospitals," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Anangwe vowed that "my main aim in the ministry is to put in
place adequate reform to improve the provision of health services
and make the facilities accessible to all citizens, in line with
the government policy to provide health services to all."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that he would streamline the contentious
tendering system in the ministry which has over years raised
concern with revelations of briefcase agents jamming in the
ministry building to manipulate the tendering.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his government will reduce the percentage of
inpatient and outpatient services in the government health
institutions to enable the private sector to play a big role in
the delivery of such services.
</P>
<P>
However, he emphasized that his ministry will remain in charge
of regulations of medical services in the east African country.

<HEADLINE> BOC to Unveil Asset Management Corporation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Bank of
China (BOC) revealed today that the bank will soon unveil its
asset management corporation.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of the BOC Zhao Ange told Xinhua today that the
BOC has formed a leading group for organizing the financial asset
management corporation and another for converting credit rights to
equity.
</P>
<P>
China's four state-owned commercial banks have been approved by
the central government to establish asset management corporations
to handle their non-performing loans. The Cinda Asset Management
Corporation of China Construction Bank was set up in the first
half of this year, while the other three will be established soon.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that for China's financial industry to enjoy healthy
development, it is vital that the issue of non-performing loans be
solved, and that people's confidence in the country's financial
system be protected.
</P>
<P>
The formation of asset management corporations is the best way
to reach this goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
Specializing in international and foreign exchange businesses,
the BOC has for the 10th straight year been included in Fortune's
top 500 enterprises worldwide, and has been selected by Euromoney
as the best bank in China for four times in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that this indicates that the BOC's good management
results and solid strength have been fully acknowledged by
international grading institutions. It also demonstrates that the
BOC has become one of the world's largest enterprises and plays an
increasingly important role in China's and even global financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the BOC's total asset reached 2.8 trillion
yuan (360 billion U.S. dollars), with profits hitting 106 billion
yuan (13.6 billion U.S. dollars). The bank's major business
indices continued to grow since the beginning of this year, Zhao
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 9 (Xinhua) -- American consumers'
complaints against all carriers hit an 11-year high in July,
according to the latest figures released by the U.S. Department of
Transportation on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 2,485 overall complaints nearly doubled the June's record
of 1,332 and marked the highest number since March 1988, said the
department, adding that nearly half dealt with flight problems,
including delays, missed connections and canceled flights.
</P>
<P>
Consumers filed 2,111 complaints against U.S. carriers and the
rest against foreign carriers, tour operators, travel agents and
others.
</P>
<P>
American Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrier, led all
major U.S. airlines in passenger complaints, while Southwest
Airlines had the fewest complaints and the best on-time
performance, the department added.
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled," said Melanie Jones, a spokeswoman for
Southwest. "It's gratifying to see our emphasis on service
reflected in the numbers."
</P>
<P>
American Airline spokesman Tim Smith explained that his company
was the hardest hit by Federal Aviation Administration computer
upgrades that slowed air-traffic control operations in Dallas-Fort
Worth, Chicago and Cleveland. He said the airline has taken steps,
such as more-timely boarding, to improve on-time performance.

LOS ANGELES, September 9 (Xinhua) -- About one in four U.S.
children are going to alternative and private schools as choices
other than neighborhood public schools are increasing, a new study
found.
</P>
<P>
The percentage attending private schools has remained at 10
percent for years, according to the study released Thursday by the
Policy Analysis for California Education (PACE).
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. newspapers spent 21.6
billion U.S. dollars on advertising in the first half of 1999, up
5.1 percent from the same period last year, according to a report
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Newspaper Association of America (NAA) said that the
statistics showed retail up 3 percent to 9.7 billion dollars,
classified up 3.9 percent to 8.5 billion and national advertising
increasing 15.1 percent to 3.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
"Advertisers continue to increase their investment in
newspapers as the economy expands," John F. Sturm, the NAA
president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter of 1999, the report said, classified grew
4 percent to 4.4 billion dollars, national was up 17.4 percent to

billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
As for the many liabilities, backward technology, inefficient
management, redundant workers, and unreasonable product mix in the
province's state sector, Wen said that a promising future means
nothing if these problems are not tackled.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Liaoning is changing from a planned economy
to a market economy and its industry, from the traditional
industry to a technology-based one.
</P>
<P>
China said in 1997 that it would get most of its debt-ridden
state-owned enterprises out of difficulties in three years, and
Liaoning is being given priority in this.
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to solve all the problems of the past in the
short term, Wen said. It will take time and be a painful process.
But, to shorten that process, Liaoning is focusing on three major
campaigns at present: transforming state-owned enterprises into
stock companies that are modern enterprises, freeing state-owned
enterprises from the heavy employee burden, and streamlining the
workforce and improving efficiency.
</P>
<P>
There is no shortcut in this, Wen emphasized. Even in the West,
it takes 15 to 20 years to complete the task, how much more so in
Liaoning, whose industry is a relic of the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has had some results in its enterprise reforms, said
Wen, who expressed confidence in giving Liaoning a new image and
taking a developed, prosperous, and civilized Liaoning into the
next century.

<HEADLINE> China's Old Industrial Base Seeking to Recover Past Glory (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning, a former center of
China's heavy industry in the northeast, is making an effort to
recover its past glory and rebuild its economy.
</P>
<P>
"Liaoning's glorious chapter is already some in the past and we
are restructuring the state sector to put the province in the
market economy," provincial governor Wen Shizhen told Xinhua
recently.
</P>
<P>
Wen, a former engineer and leading official in charge of the
industrial sector, is a witness to Liaoning's industrialization
over the past 50 years. He said the province's industry was built
upon the rubble of the war after the New China was established and
its key enterprises became the backbone of the nation's industry.
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, Liaoning was the country's first in terms
of fixed assets and heavy industrial output and was a leading
producer of steel, cement, machine tool, mining equipment and
other major machinery products. It contributed a lot to New China'
s industrialization and formation of the national economic
structure, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
By providing various products to other parts of the country and
providing thousands of technicians and managers for the industrial
sector, the province was extremely importance to the entire nation
at that time, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning then became a forerunner in the reform and opening-up
drive that started two decades ago and shared much of the burden
of those economic reforms. It has contributed about 200 billion
yuan to state coffers since 1980, several times the state's
spending on the province.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, one shouldn't keep talking about the glorious
past because there is still a promising future that needs an all-
out effort by all of the province.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Declare Year 2000 as Ecotourism Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has decided to
declare year 2000 as "Year of Ecotourism" in a bid to tap the
potential of the fast growing segment in the tourism sector, the
Ministry of Tourism said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman said the government is formulating a
National Ecotourism Policy Plan to promote Sri Lanka as an unique
ecotourism destination.
</P>
<P>
The decision follows representations by the Ecotourism Society
of Sri Lanka, he said, adding that Sri Lanka will capitalize on
the United Nations' move to declare year 2002 as the "Year of
Ecotourism" worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka could be successfully marketed to lure those who
prefer to divert from the sun, sea and beach vacations, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ecotourism Society, ecotourism is responsible
travel to natural areas which conserves the environment and
improves the welfare of the local people.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, is blessed with
resource base for ecotourism, ranging from the highest level of
bio-diversity per square kilometer of surface in Asia to historic
and cultural sites including a number of world heritage sites.

<HEADLINE> Hainan's Yangpu Ready for Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Yangpu Economic Development
Zone in south China's Hainan Province is now ready to receive
overseas investment, Deputy Governor Li Dongsheng said Thursday
during a press conference on investment environment and policies
of the state-level zone.
</P>
<P>
Set up with the approval of the State Council, Yangpu Economic
Development Zone has an area of 31 sq km. A total of 5.3 billion
yuan was spent to build infrastructure systems, including
transportation, power supply to telecommunications facilities.
</P>
<P>
The zone is now home to a power plant with a generating
capacity of 315,500 kw, one 10,000-dwt (dead weight tonnages) fuel
dock and three berths each with an annual handling capacity of one
million tons, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Construction is underway on a 35,000-dwt multi-purpose berth,
two 35,000-dwt universal berths, a new road project connecting the
nearby highway, as well as a water diversion project.
</P>
<P>
Li said the zone will be turned into an export-oriented
industrial area dominated by technologically advanced industries,
supplemented by the service trade.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said that Yangpu is the only a development zone where
bonded policies are applied extensively. She believed that it is a
suitable site for starting up new industrial projects and
developing export processing trade.
</P>
<P>
China now has 32 state-level economic development zones where
preferential policies are offered. By the end of 1998, a total of
25.22 billion U.S. dollars of overseas investment was put into the
development zones, accounting for about 10 percent of the country'
s total. These zones also exported 11.3 billion U.S. dollars worth
of commodities, making up 6.15 percent of the country's total
exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily published
an editorial today which said that although the nationwide
campaign against Falun Gong, an outlawed cult, has been successful,
governments at all levels should be alert to some Falun Gong
followers who refuse to abandon illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
"We should not expect a rainstorm to wash away all withered
leaves," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
It cited a recent case from the Beijing Public Security Bureau,
in which 19 Falun Gong practitioners were apprehended by police
for gathering illegally.
</P>
<P>
The editorial called for vigilance against those die-hard Falun
Gong members, saying that they still constitute a threat to social
stability and people's thinking if not properly handled.
</P>
<P>
"Stability is the supreme interest of both the state and the
people, especially before the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic and the return of Macao," it says. "Any
attempt to create chaos or disrupt stability goes against the will
of the people and is doomed to fail."

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Serf Now Living Happier Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Although he's shy and not very
talkative, Nyima Cering can become very animated when he recalls
how 300 serfs and slaves belonging to Surkang escaped his rule
during the democratic reforms in Tibet in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The democratic reforms helped slaves and serfs become masters,
Nyima Cering says. His village, Kesong, was the first in the Tibet
Autonomous Region to set up a People's Congress and they now elect
their leaders directly, he says proudly.
</P>
<P>
Under the feudal serf system that existed in Tibet for
centuries, slaves and serfs were treated like talking animals, he
says, and didn't have enough to eat or any kind of personal
freedom.
</P>
<P>
The owners could punish them in any way or torture or kill them,
he says, and can still recall Surkang's words about them being his
property and how he could treat them any way he liked.
</P>
<P>
Nyima Cering was a serf since the age of 8. The annual harvest
at Surkang's large manor produced 210,000 kg. of grain, 168,000 kg.
of that going to Surkang and the rest to the more than 300 serfs.
Some serfs had to go out and beg for food.
</P>
<P>
The village of 1,000 people now has more than 100 threshing,
sowing, and reaping machines and has had good harvests for 11
consecutive years. In 1998, total grain output was 835,000 kg., a
per ha. output of 8,250 kg., 10.7 times the amount in 1959. The
average annual per capita incomes was 1,587 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Nyima Cering built a 200-sq.m. house several years ago and is
now quite satisfied with his life. The serf owner's manor in the
past was just so-so when compared with his new house, he says
proudly.

CANBERRA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia has appealed to

Ice Skating Australia (ISA) President Don McKnight said in a

<P>
"Skaters, volunteers, local officials and, most importantly,
the skating enthusiasts who have already made their plans to visit
Australia for this event are supporting us in this action," he
added.
</P>

McKnight said Australia had also lodged a claim for damages. He
said Brisbane faced losses in excess of 20 million Australian
dollars if the championships were lost.
</P>
<P>
The ISU said last month that it decided to move the
championships from Brisbane because of "irreconcilable differences
" over television rights.

<HEADLINE> Over 5,500 Africans Die of AIDS Daily: UNAIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 5,500 people die of AIDS
in Africa everyday, the United Nations AIDS (UNAIDS) has said.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNAIDS report available here Friday, AIDS was
responsible for an estimated two million African deaths in the
course of 1998, or 5,500 deaths a day.
</P>
<P>
"The sheer number of Africans affected by the epidemic is
overwhelming. Since HIV began spreading, an estimated 34 million
people living in sub- Saharan Africa have been infected with the
virus. Some 11.5 million of those people have already died, a
quarter of them children," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS report points out that despite the scale of death
there were more Africans living with HIV than ever before --
21.5million adults and a further one million children.
</P>
<P>
"While no country in Africa has escaped the virus, some are far
more severely affected than others. The bulk of new infections

<HEADLINE> Classified Management on Processing Trade Remains Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China's plan to change its
controls on the processing business by introducing a different
form of management October 1 remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Gao Hucheng, the assistant minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, told a press conference here Thursday that
the new management system is designed to make operations fairer.
He explains that the present management methods have proven too
costly and difficult and leave room for loopholes and illegal
activities like smuggling, fraud, and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Gao says that China will continue its policies that encourage
the processing trade and will not change certain principles. The
performance of processing companies will be the main basis for
classification, which will be dynamic.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, earlier
decided to change the day of implementing the management scheme
from July 1 to October 1.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Assess Industrial Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is going to conduct
the first industrial survey since 1994 to assess the strength of
local industries.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister Nasser Saidi said the survey would cover
3,000 major industrial plants.
</P>
<P>
The survey, whose date has not been fixed yet, will involve
detailed forms to be filled out by industrialists as well as
interviews and workshops, the Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-page form will include information on the number of the
company's workers, its products, capital, financial statements,
location and size of factories, salary scales and plans for future
investment.
</P>
<P>
The results will later be used in discussions on the viability
of trade agreements and appropriate levels for Customs duties.
</P>
<P>
It will help the government assess the prospect of industrial
investment and find new channels to help industrialists market
their goods.
</P>
<P>
Saidi urged local industrialists to provide accurate
information about their businesses, adding that "accurate
information will lead to realistic solutions."
</P>
<P>
"The survey will help us draft a new policy for industry and
identify companies that have the ability to compete," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has 22,107 large, medium and small industrial
enterprises that employ 145,000 workers, according to a
unofficial survey in 1996. Nearly 70 percent of those companies
hire less than five people each.

South and East China Sea Coasts, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The
People's Liberation Army's (PLA) naval, air, and ground forces
held large joint landing exercises earlier this month in coastal
parts of Zhejiang Province and the southern part of Guangdong
Provcince.
</P>
<P>
The troops participating were from the Nanjing and Guangzhou
Military Area Commands, the Second Artillery Corps, and reserves.
</P>
<P>
The successful exercise showed how the PLA has improved its
joint military combat capacity and the success of its
modernization drive and how it is ready to defend the country's
sovereignty, territorial integrity, and to crack down on any
separatist acts.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
was present at the exercises and conveyed the greetings of
President Jiang Zemin and the Central Military Commission to the
PLA and militia members participating in the exercises.
</P>
<P>
The PLA did a landing exercise armed with high-tech weapons on
the East China Sea, where the Opium War took place in the last
century. Officers and enlisted personnel moved heavy weapons and

The military exercise provided a spectacular sight of a straits-
crossing and landing operation by Chinese forces armed with high-
tech weapons.
</P>
<P>
The new equipment doubled the might of land, naval and air
forces, military analysts said, and advanced naval vessels,
aircraft, and electronic warfare technology gave the PLA total of
the sea and air and electronic communications mastery.
</P>
<P>
Landing ships, hovercraft, helicopters, and other modern forms
of transportation gave the attack invincibility and a computerized
artillery system gave more flexibility, they said. An automated
command system connecting troops and headquarters greatly
increased the efficiency when combined with pilotless scouts and a
comprehensive intelligence system in the war zone, they said.
</P>
<P>
Both Tao Bojun, the chief of staff, and Liu Shutian, the
political commissar, of the Guangzhou Military Zone, told Xinhua
that the land, naval, and air forces have increased research,
training reforms, technology, and proficiency of officers and

Political and ideological work, tough military training, and

all the tasks assigned by the Party and the people, they said.
</P>
<P>
Party committees, governments at all levels, and the general
public in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces took an active part in
the exercises by providing materials and demonstrating their
determination to work with the military to safeguard national
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting the soldiers afterwards, Zhang Wannian said
that Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui has broken away from the "one China"
principle and has been preaching his "two-state theory", which has
completely exposed his malicious attempt to separate Taiwan from
China and destroy the possibility of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui has been seriously defiant and has provoked the
Chinese people, he said, adding that the exercises displayed the
Chinese military's strong determination to safeguard national
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and its strength to
maintain national unity.
</P>
<P>
Zhang warned Lee Teng-hui that he who plays with fire will get
burnt. The reunification of the motherland is a historical trend
and the goal of all Chinese, he said.

Zhang said that the divisive forces are going against this
historical trend. They are overrating themselves and courting
their own destruction. "Our policy on the Taiwan issue remains one
of `peaceful reunification and the one country, two systems' and
we will never commit ourselves to abandoning the use of force," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The PLA will take the will of the nation as its supreme will,
take the interests of the nation as its supreme interests, and
have the determination, confidence, ability, and resources to
safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
It will never tolerate any attempts to divide the country and
will never sit idly by to watch even an inch of territory being
taken from the motherland, he said, and warned that the PLA is
keeping a close eye on developments in cross-Straits relations and
is ready to crush any evil attempts to separate the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He asked China's armed forces to unite around the Central
Committee of the Communist Party and the Central Military
Commission with Jiang Zemin at the core and to do more rigorous
training and prepare for action to contribute to the reunification
and rejuvenation of China.
</P>
<P>
Li Changchun, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, and Cao Gangchuan, a member of
the Central Military Commission, were present for the military
exercises.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Water Species Drastically Diminishing: WWF Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Over 51 percent of all
fresh water species of fish throughout the world are drastically
diminishing, a report issued by World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the
international environment network, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is a matter of great urgency and a call to action to do all
that is possible to prevent the loss of these species when the
world is about to enter the 21st century, said Claude Martin,
general secretary of the WWF.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the reduction seen in fresh water species is
particularly worrisome as an indicator of the degree of
deterioration in the quality of rivers, lakes and wet lands."
</P>
<P>
Among the fresh water species, the amphibians have been
seriously devastated, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In Australia, Panama and the United States, about 20 species of
frogs have perished due to an unknown fungus caused by pollution,
the report says.

<HEADLINE> University Conflict Affects Mexican Educational System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The stopping of
activities in Mexico's Autonomous National University (UNAM) --
the largest on the continent -- has affected practically the
country's whole system of higher education.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the National Association of Universities
and Institutions of Superior Education (ANNUISE), Julio Rubio,
said on Thursday that cooperation and exchanges among different
universities and institutions have been suspended for 140 days.
</P>
<P>
The stopping of activities was caused by a strike that broke
out last April on campus as students opposed the increase of
schooling fees by the university authorities.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, UNAM's authorities put conditions for
negotiation to settle the conflict, which however distanced the
possibility of a solution.
</P>
<P>
Besides the undergraduate students body, there are also
hundreds of students and teachers from across the country taking
postgraduate courses at UNAM who have been unable to get ahead in
their work.
</P>
<P>
But when the stoppage is over, there is hope to find new
mechanisms to make up what is lost, Rubio said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Athlete Cleared of Doping Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian pencak silat
martial law athlete Ni Made Wahyudi, who tested positive following
doping allegations, has been cleared of doping violations and can
now keep the gold medal she won at the recent Southeast Asian (SEA)
Games.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at the SEA Games Executive Committee
meeting in Brunei on Wednesday. Indonesia was represented by Cahyo
Adi, a member of the legal commission of the National Sports
Council (KONI).
</P>
<P>
Adi said the committee members decided Indonesian pencak silat
team manager Puji Handoko and his officials should take
responsibility for failing to inform their athletes of the doping
regulation.
</P>
<P>
"The executive committee will send a letter to KONI urging the
body to reprimand the pencak silat team manager and officials and
make sure they are informed of all relevant regulations," he was
quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Warouw, the general secretary of KONI said the meeting
ruled out the possibility of a heavy sentence for Ni Made, and
decided instead to issue a warning.
</P>
<P>
The athlete should have declared use of the spray to tournament
attendants. Her failure to notify them then precipitated
allegations that she had taken an enhancing substance before the
event
</P>
<P>
Wahyuni, a five-times SEA Games gold medalist, failed the
doping test conducted by the organizers after defeating Nguyen
Minh Le of Vietnam in the women's class E (65-70 kilograms) final.
</P>
<P>
The mother of one claimed she had been using the sprayed
medication since 1996, after delivering her first child.

<HEADLINE> Better Life for Ethnic Group Living in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China's rapid development has
brought about tremendous changes to the daily life of members of
the Monba ethnic group in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
The Monba ethnic group, with a population of about 7,400, is
one of the 56 ethnic groups in China. The Monbas have their own
spoken language, but no written form. Their close contacts with
Tibetans over the centuries have helped most of them learn Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
They live in an area with adequate rainfall, fertile soil, and
rich produce, but these advantages didn't help them much until
1959, the year of the Democratic Reform in Tibet. Today, their
ancient methods of keeping records by carving signs on wood and
making calculations with knots on a rope are becoming distant
memories.
</P>
<P>
One eyewitness to the history is Ngawang Yuzhen who is about 87
although he is not certain because there are no accurate records.
Ngawang Yuzhen lives an easy life in Cona County like many other
elderly people, watching TV and drinking buttered tea and barley
wine.
</P>
<P>
Ngawang Yuzhen says that the new life of the Monbas started
with the Democratic Reform and in 1964 they were recognized by the
State Council as an ethnic minority. They say that recalling their
terrible life before 1959 is unbearable because most of them were
forced to live in remote, mountainous areas by the local Tibetan
government, the monasteries, and the nobility.
</P>
<P>
At that time, they lived a "barbaric" life and had no choice
but to live in thatched-roof cottage, eating wild herbs, and
drinking a substance made from the bark of trees. Most of them
went around barefoot and did hard labor for the landlords.
</P>
<P>
After 1959, the central and local government have spent large
sums of money on primary and middle schools in Monba areas and
some of them have trucks and have opened shops or put up new
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The Monbas now study Tibetan and Chinese and an increasing
number of them receive a higher education and have found jobs in
big cities. Some have even been selected as deputies to the
National People's Congress, the country's highest legislature.

<HEADLINE> Pioline Advances to Semifinals at U.S. Open (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Veteran Cedric Pioline of
France continued his astounding success in tiebreakers this year,
defeating fifth seed Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil to earn a berth in
the semifinals of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
Piloine improved to 26-9 in tiebreakers this season and
advanced to his fourth career Grand Slam semifinal with a 4-6, 7-6
(8-6), 7-6 (16-14), 7-6 (10-8) win over Kuerton.
</P>
<P>
Piloine, a runner-up here in 1993, will take on the winner of
tonight's match between No. 7 Todd Martin of the United States and
unseeded Czech Slava Dosedel on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to be aggressive in the tiebreak," said Pioline,
who is unbeaten in three meetings with Kuerten. "If you stay back,
you're going to give opportunities to your opponent. Since the
beginning of the year, I have a good tiebreak record so I feel
very good when it's coming."
</P>
<P>
Pioline, whose five matches have averaged around three hours,
is into his first Grand Slam semifinal since the 1998 French Open.
He had lost in the first round of four of his previous five Grand
Slam tournaments before this week.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten, the 1997 French Open champion, was looking to become
the first Brazilian in the Open era to reach the semifinals of the
U.S. Open. He hit 19 aces and won 87 percent of his first-service
points but took advantage of just 2-of-8 break-point chances.

MEXICO CITY, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Interior
Secretary Diodoro Carrasco promised Thursday not to use force to
solve the conflict in the southern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
Carrasco said the government rejects any force to solve the

</P>
<P>
He said the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) in
Chiapas should sit down at the dialogue table to go ahead with the
peaceful process that had been stagnated since talks between the
government and the guerrillas broke down three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He announced a new plan a few days ago to resume negotiations
which he said was very concrete, but the military withdrawal would
not be discussed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Situation in East Timor Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The situation in
violence-torn East Timor was improving, according to reports
reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Security Restoration Operation Command in East
Timor Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri said, "the situation has not been
fully restored, but it is now much better."
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Military Commander Gen. Wiranto said in Jakarta that
there were no further signs of unrest or the sound of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has greatly improved in East Timor, particularly
in Dili (capital of East Timor). I believe the condition will
return to normal in the near future," Wiranto said following a
call on President B.J. Habibie on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government on Tuesday placed East Timor under
martial law following escalating violence after the United Nations
announcement on September 4 that 78.5 percent of voters in the
August 30 direct ballot rejected autonomy under Indonesia, paving
the way for independence.
</P>
<P>
More than a hundred deaths have been reportedly followed the
announcement of the ballot result.
</P>
<P>
In Dili, Chief of the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) Ian
Martin said that the security situation has improved but was still
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
"The state of the city is a disgrace, with significant numbers
of (pro-integration) militia members still roaming the streets
with impunity. Dili is a ghost town with not very much left to
loot," Martin was quoted by The Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said about 40 to 50 U.N. staff, including police
and military liaison officers, will stay behind when another 150
U.N. international workers and 167 local staff members are
evacuated from Dili on Thursday by an Australian air force C-130
transport plane.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, telecommunications,
electricity and water networks in Dili, which were paralyzed in
the past few days following the announcement of the ballot result,
have started functioning again after military personnel repaired
the facilities.
</P>
<P>
The military personnel were busy clearing the debris of
buildings which had been leveled to the ground and repairing
electricity network which had been out of commission since
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Streets and houses in Dili are deserted and economic
activities have yet to resume, with banks and shops being closed.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia early this year announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject Indonesia's
offer of a wide-ranging autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Aims to Lure More Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will seek to lure
more airlines into the country to make it a hub of international
air traffic under a five-year development program, officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
They said under the program for the period of 1999 to 2004, the
government is seeking to attract foreign carriers from countries
such as Australia, Austria, China, Italy and Japan, which have air
service agreements with Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
At present only 21 airlines operate to Sri Lanka although 53
countries have reached bilateral air service agreements and have
right of access, said a document released by the Tourism and Civil
Aviation Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Most airlines had stopped operating to Colombo due to
inadequate load factors.
</P>
<P>
The country's own airline, now known as Sri Lankan Airlines,
had sustained and nurtured the tourist inflow when many scheduled
and nonscheduled carriers withdrew from Sri Lanka, said the
document.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Airlines carries more than 50 percent of the tourist
traffic to the country.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Sri Lanka will benefit from a great
increase of volume of air traffic in the Asia and Pacific region,
said the document.

WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said he hoped to resume "constructive conversations" with China
when he meets Chinese President Jiang Zemin this weekend in New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving here for the informal meeting of leaders from
the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries, Clinton
told the press that he was eager to restart talks on China's bid
to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"We have done our best to do what I think is the honorable and
decent thing in the wake of the terrible accident involving the
embassy in Belgrade," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has have made it clear in recent
tensions across the Taiwan Straits "we still support the 'one
China 'policy," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May
seriously hurt relations between China and the United States and
brought WTO negotiations to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he hoped to "resume constructive conversations
with the Chinese, beginning with my meeting with President Jiang
and I would very much like to resume the WTO negotiations."

<HEADLINE> Middle East Peace Talks to Complete in One Year: Shaath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Talks of the Middle East
peace process will end in one year, as the newly adopted deal has
expected, a Palestinian minister said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation, who negotiated the September 3
agreement with Israel following the Wye River peace accord, said
that one year is sufficient to end the talks if both sides come
with good intention and good planning.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after his one-day visit to Finland, present
holder of the rotating Presidency of European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
During his visit, he said, he informed Tarja Halonen, Finnish
foreign minister, of the general situation of the Middle East
peace process and details of the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed economic relations between EU
and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement on revisions to the Wye River land-for-
security accord gives Palestine and Israel one year to strike a
final peace, settling contentious issues of Palestinian statehood
and border, the future of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements, water
and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Palestine eagerly wishes the presence of the EU in the peace
process, especially in the negotiations, said Shaath.
</P>
<P>
A prompt and word-to-word implementation of the new agreement
is very important, he added, for it will enhance the Palestinians'
support to the agreement and the confidence between Yasser Arafat
and Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Tarja Halonen agreed that a strict implementation
of the agreement is important, stressing that the EU will keep
supporting the programs it has promised to attend.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish FM told the press that David Levy, the Israel
foreign minister, has already been invited to visit her country.

<HEADLINE> China's Private Economy Developing Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The private sector has become
an important part of China's economy, according to the deputy
secretary-general of the China Association of Individual Laborers.
</P>
<P>
The private economy has been growing fast since China began
opening to the outside world in 1978 and, by late 1998, there were
1.2 million private enterprises employing 17 million people. They
had 1.02 trillion yuan in registered capital, 585.3 billion yuan
in output value, and did 532.3 billion yuan worth of business.
</P>
<P>
There were also 31.2 million small businesses by 1998 with 312
billion yuan in registered capital and 61.1 million employees.
They had 596 billion yuan worth of output value and 1.75 trillion
yuan worth of business.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, private enterprises and companies had earnings of 18.
76 billion yuan from exports while small businesses earned 2.27
billion yuan from exports.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, private enterprises paid well over 70 billion
yuan in taxes, or 8.5 percent of total industrial and commercial
taxes in China.
</P>
<P>
The development of the private economy has provided jobs for
workers in urban areas, unemployed people, and surplus labor from
rural areas. In the past year the private sector provided 3.1
million new jobs for people who had been laid off.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges NATO to Investigate Ustica Air Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema confirmed here Thursday evening that his government plans to
send extracts from a magistrate's investigation to NATO that claim
an Italian civilian airliner was downed in a "war scenario" 19
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The DC-9, which was flown by the now defunct domestic airline,
Itavia, crashed into the sea leaving all 81 on board dead off the
island of Ustica, north of Sicily on the evening of June 27, 1980.
The reason for the tragedy is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is for NATO and our allies to help us throw
light on the tragedy," said D'Alema at a joint press conference
with NATO's outgoing Secretary-General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send NATO and individual allies, especially the
United States and France, extracts from the 5,400-page indictment
and report, which was drawn up by the Roman investigating
magistrate Rosario Priore, was discussed when Priore submitted the
results of his nine-year investigation last week.
</P>
<P>
Solana, on a visit to Rome before becoming the European Union's
spokesman for foreign and security affairs, said NATO will
continue to provide cooperation on clarifying responsibilities in
the disaster.
</P>
<P>
"As NATO's secretary-general, it has been my responsibility to
work for the greatest possible disclosure," he told the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The report of Priore indicated that the DC-9 airplane may have
been hit by crossfire in a battle between four American and two
French warplanes, and Libyan MiG fighters. But the U.S. and France
have denied any involvement in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Libyan leader Mouammer al Gaddafi has claimed
the DC-9 was downed in an attack aimed at assassinating him as he
flew across the Mediterranean to visit Poland.
</P>
<P>
Priore's report says one or perhaps more Libyan planes may have
been involved in the "war scenario."
</P>
<P>
Claiming himself as a witness to the disaster, Gaddafi said
that from his plane, he saw the U.S. Navy exercises near Ustica.
The U.S. Navy tried to hit his plane, but hit the DC-9 instead,
the Libyan leader claimed.

<HEADLINE> China's "Twice-Born Paddies" Fading Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ratooning paddy growing
methods that were once encouraged by the government are gradually
fading away as China manages to produce sufficient food for its
more than 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have developed farming methods on ratooning paddies
for over 1,700 years, agronomists say. After farmers harvested the
grain, they would leave the straw in the field and fertilize it,
and from it there would grow a second crop in 70 days, thus it was
widely known as "twice-born paddy".
</P>
<P>
But, the centuries-old method did not really take off until the
late 1980s, when China suffered successive setbacks in grain
output for many years. From 1990 to 1995, the "twice-born paddy"
method was used on more than two million hectares of farmland to
produce 6.2 billion kg of grain.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, however, steady grain production has left surpluses
in grain storehouses across the country as a result of the
government's agricultural policies and a number of new farming
technologies, and the Chinese no longer worry about food supplies.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that grain output has increased to the
present 500 billion kg from 113 billion kg in 1949, when the
People's Republic of China was founded.
</P>
<P>
Last year, grain production entered a new era as the government
announced that more importance would be placed on quality instead
of quantity in order to meet the demand of consumers for better
products. "Twice-born paddy", which once contributed greatly to
the people's bowls, has become increasingly something in the past
due to its poor quality.

<HEADLINE> German Economy Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew by a mere 0.8 percent in the first six months
of this year in real terms, slower than the 1.9 percent GDP growth
rate for the same period last year, Germany's statistics office
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The economy effectively stagnated in the second quarter of this
year as a result of shrinking exports, the office said. But it
added that growing internal demand, particularly increasing
investment in equipment and private consumption, helped the
economy avoid negative growth.
</P>
<P>
The German Finance Ministry attributed the economic slowdown to
slumping exports due to a worldwide economic depression. The
government estimated that due to weak exports, the economic growth
rate for 1999 will be lower than last year, when the country
registered a 2.2 percent GDP growth rate, the highest since its
reunification years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic circle and the government have expressed
optimism about the overall economic situation next year. German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder predicted a 2.5 percent economic
growth rate for 2000, while the Bundesbank forecast a 3 percent
rate.
</P>
<P>
These optimists explained that Germany's exports would boom
again in 2000 when the global economy is expected to turn for the
better, with the Asian economies starting to recover and the U.S.
economy sustaining growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many major German banks said that increasing
domestic demand will continue to stimulate the economic growth
next year.

<HEADLINE> Banks: World Cup Bid "Still on Course" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former sports minister, now in charge of the World Cup bid,
admitted it had been a "very disappointing night" but stressed the
team could still qualify for Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
"France didn't qualify for the World Cup in 1990 or 1994 and
yet still was chosen to host the World Cup in 1998, so there's no
correlation," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted: "Clearly it would be good for the image of the
game if England not only qualified, but did exceedingly well."
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed claims that the national team was so poor
because there were increasingly fewer English players to select
from domestic teams, particularly in the Premier League.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been achieving particularly well at the
international level in football for over 25 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I mean we only qualified in four of the last seven World Cups -
we didn't qualify in '74 and '78. There were hardly any foreign
overseas players in our teams at that time."
</P>
<P>
Banks claimed that the presence of top overseas players in the
English game was in fact nurturing better English players.
</P>
<P>
"The English talent coming through is going to be that much
better than previous generations simply because the competition
now is going to be that much harder," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to have a large number of very ordinary
players -- we're going to have a smaller number of exceptionally
talented players."
</P>
<P>
He added that the creation of the football academies throughout
the Premier League and Division One would enable the national team
to perform at the level that everyone wanted.

LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- English soccer premier league
club Leeds United could reach the UEFA Cup second round without
kicking a ball in the competition.
</P>
<P>
The first leg of the tie next Tuesday is due to be played in
the Netherlands but the Yugoslav champions Partizan Belgrade are
struggling to obtain visas.
</P>
<P>
UEFA decided the game be played on the neutral venue because
commercial flights are not allowed into the country.
</P>
<P>
Partizan and Leeds have both criticised UEFA for their decision
which came just six days before the match.
</P>
<P>
"We would have been better off playing both legs in Leeds,"
pointed out one Partizan official.

<HEADLINE> Batty Feels No Regret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Leeds star became the fourth England player to receive a
red card in the last 14 months, following a reckless challenge on
Radoslaw Michalski with seven minutes left in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
But he was in no mood to say sorry, despite seeing the national
team's qualification hopes suffer a potentially fatal blow.
</P>
<P>
"I've got nothing to be ashamed for," Batty said after the
England squad arrived back at Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
"I just play my game and whatever happens, happens.
</P>
<P>
"I've no regrets, whatever I do on the football park. I just go
and enjoy tackles and getting into people.
</P>
<P>
"If I'm late, I'm late -- it doesn't bother me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Batty is confident Sweden will not let England down when they
play Poland next month.
</P>
<P>
The Poles only need a draw in Stockholm to pip England to the
runners-up spot in Group Five after holding Kevin Keegan's men to
a goalless draw on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Batty, who would be suspended for the play-offs if England do
get there, is convinced the Swedes will not take it easy in their
last group game even though they have already qualified for the
European Championships next summer.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to when Sweden play Poland next month,"
said Batty.
</P>
<P>
"If you're professionals you want to win and I've no doubt that
Sweden will approach it the same way we would."
</P>
<P>
England manager Keegan also believes the Swedes will not allow
Poland an easy ride.
</P>
<P>
"I still believe there is a lifeline there for us, which is
Sweden. They are an excellent side as we found out playing them at
home and I know from the Swedish players in England that they are
very professional.
</P>
<P>
"So we have good things going for us. It's not the way we would
have liked it but that's the way it is," added the boss.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Will Shoulder Blame for Euro Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager
Kevin Keegan will shoulder the blame if England fail to qualify
for the Euro 2000 play-offs -- but remains as determined as ever
to carry on leading his country.
</P>
<P>
Given the woeful qualifying position in which Keegan found
himself after taking over from Glenn Hoddle, following defeat in
Sweden and a goalless draw at home to Bulgaria, it would perhaps
be easy to point the finger at his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
But then again, even though the draw at Wembley against
Bulgaria was the worst result of the whole campaign, Keegan has
had five competitive games in which to turn the situation around --
and has so far failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
"I have to take responsibility as that's my job. When the FA
offered it to me, I took responsibility for everything that has
happened since I joined that first England squad for the game
against Poland at home," he conceded.
</P>
<P>
"It's not that what happened before doesn't interest me. It may
affect me but there's nothing I could do about it.
</P>
<P>
"I had the chance in the five games to get England through and
I haven't done it yet and now I'm relying on someone else.
</P>
<P>
"But I've always looked at the job and said that I've got three
years until the next World Cup, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Keegan remains confident that Sweden will do England a favour
on October 9 by denying Poland the point they need to clinch a
play-off place at his team's expense.
</P>
<P>
But he struggled to positively answer the direct question of
whether England realistically deserved to make it through what
should admittedly hardly have been the most imposing qualifying
group ever.
</P>
<P>
The stark truth is that England do not deserve a second chance
given the consistent paucity of their displays and although they -
and all English fans - fervently hope that Sweden can do them a
favour, it still hardly bodes well for the finals if they get
there.

LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Queens Park Rangers have been
forced to postpone Saturday's game against Sheffield United after
a first team player was diagnosed as suffering from meningitis.
</P>
<P>
A number of other Loftus Road players are also under
observation after displaying the similar symptoms to those of the
confirmed case.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the Football League read: "The decision
to postpone this fixture has been taken on the advice of medical

playing squad, staff and fans and also those of Sheffield United."
</P>
<P>
QPR chief executive Simon Crane said: "We will not have the

player and the others who are undergoing tests, we won't be naming
names.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday insisted that the Indonesian government allow
international peacekeepers in East Timor to restore order there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn shortly before
leaving for Auckland, New Zealand, to attend an Asia-Pacific
summit, Clinton said Indonesia would face "dire economic
consequences if it failed to settle the violence in East Timor."
</P>
<P>
"If Indonesia does not end the violence, it must invite -- it
must invite -- the international community to assist in restoring
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton predicted "very dire" economic consequences for
Indonesia becauser of the East Timor crisis, saying his
willingness to support future assistance "will depend very
strongly" on the outcome of that crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a pity if the Indonesian recovery were crashed by
this," he said. "But one way or the other it will be crashed by
this if they don't fix it because there'll be overwhelming public
sentiment to stop the international economic cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is going to want to continue to invest there if they're
allowing this sort of travesty to go on. I think one way or the
other the economic consequences to them are going to be very
dire," he added.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Culture Feels at Home in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- When asked why the French people
are interested in the ancient bronzes of China, Professor Ma
Chengyuan, dean of the Shanghai Museum, said that the French are
one of the few in the West who really can appreciate Chinese
culture.
</P>
<P>
He said that the French nation loves civilizations and has a
high level appreciation for arts.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Paris is a city with the highest number of arts
exhibitions in the world proves that the comment of Professor Ma
is true.
</P>
<P>
One week after the China Culture Week opened, two major
cultural events -- the exhibition of the works of 18th century
painter Jean-Baptiste Simeon Chardin and a film on Dutch painter
Rembrandt are inaugurated this week.
</P>
<P>
But what makes Paris special is that it can make an ancient
foreign culture such as that of China feel at home because many
French have shown a close and dear sentiment toward it, and regard
it as their own.
</P>
<P>
During a lecture on Beijing Opera in the China Culture Week, a
retired professor of the prestigious Sorbonne University proposed
to Madame Wang Yuzheng, president of the Beijing Opera Theater,
that Beijing Opera no longer bear the name "opera" because it is
totally different from Western opera.
</P>
<P>
He said that because the French people are already familiar
with such Chinese words as "Qi Gong," China can directly
introduce the word "Jing Xi" into the French language to replace
"Beijing Opera."
</P>
<P>
In terms of sentiment and feeling, the French people are close
with the Chinese because both of them have a long agricultural
tradition and were not good at sea faring.
</P>
<P>
The city of Paris itself has many similarities with Beijing as
both of them have many gates or "porte" on their peripheries,
imperial gardens and palaces.
</P>
<P>
It is not hard to find the striking comparability between the
Arch of Triumph and Qian Men, the Summer Palace and Versaille, the
Forbidden City and Louvre Palace, and Champs-Elysee and Chang An
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
Like the Chinese people, the French people have a brilliant
culture in making furniture and ceramics. But ancient Chinese
furniture and ceramics remain one of the most expensive among
their peers in French auction shops.
</P>
<P>
Victor Hugo, the famous 19th century French writer, had many
Chinese furniture, ceramics and paintings in his house at the
Place des Vosges near the Bastille.
</P>
<P>
As a nation which has been through a long agricultural history,
the French can understand the deep meaning and implications of the
artistic designs and fabrics of ancient China, another great
agricultural civilization.
</P>
<P>
Another thing Chinese and French can share with each other is
humor.
</P>
<P>
One French visitor wrote on the notebook after seeing the
ceramics exhibition of China Culture Week: "I know for the first
time that ceramics can also be humorous. Yes, it is true, how
marvelous!"
</P>
<P>
Many French visitors have become the real appreciators of
Beijing Opera for its subtle movement, actions and gestures, not
to mention the painted masks which deliver all kinds of feelings
ranging from sneer to fury.
</P>
<P>
The difference between French and U.S. movies is that the
former relies more on facial expressions and subtle gestures,
while the latter relies more on actions.
</P>
<P>
The similar point between Chinese and French culture is that
both of them attach great importance to subtlety.

NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks were

The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 43.06 at 11,079.40.

</P>
<P>
Technology companies were the driving force in the market. IBM
pushed the Dow higher while Yahoo helped the Nasdaq to rise.
</P>
<P>
For much of the trading, the market languished as the dollar
fell from 110.76 yen to 107.67 yen after Japan released a
stronger-than-expected report on its economic growth in the second
quarter. But a later rally lifted the market.

<P>
ROME, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A vast majority of Italians favor
plans to keep most traffic out of the centers of their cities, a
survey published here Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
In what seemed to be a slap in the face for the city council in
the biggest Italian city of Milan that allow cars into historic
city centers, a survey on traffic and pollution carried out by the
Demoskopea polling institute said a full 88 percent of Italians
want no traffic in the heart of their cities.
</P>
<P>
Seven out of 10 Italians would also like to see
pollution-causing two-stroke scooters and mopeds from city
centers, while eight out of 10 would like centers closed off to
cars without a catalytic converter, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
According to Legambiente, the Italian league of environment,
the relaxation of measures to keep cars out of downtown Milan and
Bologna has already led to rising pollution levels.

<HEADLINE> Special OAU Summit Calls for Africa's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIRTE, Libya, September 9 (Xinhua) -- An extraordinary summit
of the Organization of African Unity concluded here on Thursday
with a declaration calling for stronger economic integration, the
establishment of a pan-African parliament and some form of African
union.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the pan-African parliament should be set
up by next year and the union act be adopted in 2001 at another
summit in Sirte.
</P>
<P>
It stated that the African union should be consistent with
the objectives of OAU charter and the 1991 Abuja Treaty, which
sought to set up an African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
However, in the declaration, the participants at the summit did
not commit themselves to the establishment of a United States of
Africa as Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi had expected.
</P>
<P>
Still, they commended Gadhafi upon his ``vision for a strong
and united Africa.''
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the 53 OAU members have voiced their
willingness to speed up the implementation of the Abuja Treaty,
which also laid down a series of pan-Africanist measures over
30 years.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of all institutions provided for in the Abuja
Treaty, such as the African Central Bank, the African Monetary
Union, the African Court of Justice and the pan-African
parliament, should be accelerated, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The Abuja agreement is aimed at higher rates of economic growth
and development, improved standards of living, and higher and
sustained rates of investment in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Gadhafi called for the just-concluded special OAU summit in
July.
