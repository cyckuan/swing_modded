	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Bulldozing Puerto Rico, Hurricane
Georges served up a powerful reminder of what nature can do: make
rivers overflow, cast trees like matchsticks across highways, and
leave 4 million people without power.
	   With transportation impossible in many areas, officials have yet
to gauge the full extent of one of the most powerful storms to hit
this U.S. territory in decades.
	   At least four Puerto Ricans were killed _ along with at least 17
others who died as a result of the storm elsewhere in the Caribbean
_ and authorities feared the casualty figures would rise. Officials
originally had said five people were killed in Puerto Rico. Damage
was expected to reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
	   The storm also lashed the U.S. Virgin Islands, causing extensive
damage to homes and businesses in St. Croix and other neighboring
islands, disrupting phone service in and out of the territory.
Details were sketchy because of the communication problems.
	   Although accustomed to hurricanes every couple of years, Puerto
Ricans were stunned by the widespread impact of Georges. Its
110-mph (175-kph) winds spared not a bit of the island as it swept
westward after hitting ground late Monday.
	   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' said Gov. Pedro Rossello.
	   President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands disaster areas even as Georges was still passing over
Puerto Rico en route to the Dominican Republic, where at least 12
people were killed in the storm.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Hurricane Georges
unleashed violence in the Dominican Republic as police arrested
hundreds for looting and President Leonel Fernandez ordered an
overnight curfew.
	   The death toll in the Dominican Republic rose to 12 _ and 21
overall _ as the storm continued churning across the island of
Hispaniola and entered the impoverished nation of Haiti, where
damages were expected to be severe due to substandard housing and
minimal preparation for the hurricane.
	   Georges had caused extensive damage to several northeast
Caribbean islands. Three were killed on St. Kitts and two on
Antigua, before the storm hit Puerto Rico, where at least four
people were dead.
	   Georges also knocked out communications with the U.S. Virgin
Islands, where damage was reported as extensive early Monday and
which President Bill Clinton declared, along with Puerto Rico, a
disaster area. Efforts to telephone the U.S. Virgin Islands failed
Tuesday.
	   Henry Laskowski, a meteorologist at the U.S. National Weather
Service in San Juan, said they knew of blown-off roofs and trees
felled by winds of more than 100 mph (160 kph) on St. Croix, a U.S.
territory, but there were no reports of fatalities.
	   There were concerns the storm might continue as far as the U.S.
state of Florida.

Howard's tax plan in trouble as his own allies begin defecting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in new 11th graf that Democrats, who hold balance of
power in senate, also oppose tax on food &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's
re-election campaign ran into trouble Wednesday as some of his
rural conservative allies said his main proposal _ a 10 percent
goods and services tax _ would be unfair.
	   Some members of the rural National Party, the junior partner in
Howard's conservative governing coalition, said a 10 percent tax on
food would hurt the poor more than the well-off.
	   They also fear the new tax will boost gasoline, diesel fuel and
telephone costs in the rural outback among their constituents.
	   The campaign is down to its final phase in the lead-up to the
Oct. 3 general election.
	   The National Party leader, Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer,
maintained his full support Wednesday for the 10 percent tax
package, saying he did not regret that it is proving increasingly
unpopular in opinion polls.
	   A poll last Thursday showed voters are turning against the tax,
with disapproval for tax reform up 10 percent in a week, to 52
percent.
	   ``It is a total package which delivers real gains for country
Australia and exporters. It tilts the unlevel playing field in
favor of our exporters,'' Fischer told Channel Nine TV.
	   But there is a rebellion in the ranks of Queensland National
Party members of Parliament, with Bob Katter calling for food to be
exempt and Paul Marek asking Howard to exclude fresh fruit and
vegetables.
	   Katter has warned that the tax plan could cost the conservatives
the election and renewed his attack on it Wednesday:
	   ``There is no more basic necessity of life than food and that is
where my problem comes from, always in this particular area,''
Katter said.
	   Howard's tax plan is in trouble on another front _ from the
Democrats, who hold the balance of power in the Senate. They
announced Monday that while they do not oppose a goods and services
tax in principle, they will not support one that taxes food.
	   In the 1993 election, the conservatives sought a 15 percent
goods and services tax, but in the last weeks of the campaign began
exempting various items as Labor raised fears that the tax would
boost prices. The conservatives soundly lost what had been billed
as an ``unloseable'' election for them.
	   This time, Kim Beazley's Labor Party needs to win an additional
27 seats to win government, a feat no Australian opposition party
has ever achieved.
	   Most polls have shown Labor just slightly ahead of the
conservatives, not a big enough lead to capture government.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

Report: Suspected Lebanese terrorist denied refuge, deported
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A suspected Lebanese terrorist
has been deported from New Zealand after being denied refugee
status, a newspaper reported.
	   Izat Ibrahim Al-Ayubi, a member of Lebanese political groups
that have been involved in terrorist bombings, shootings and
kidnappings, was flown out to Lebanon last Friday.
	   Deported on the grounds he had committed crimes against
humanity, Al Ayubi had been jailed since his arrival on a false
passport on Aug. 22, the Manukau Daily News reported Tuesday.
	   Al-Ayubi's Auckland lawyer, Colin Amery, believes Al-Ayubi will
be executed or imprisoned on his return.
	   Al-Ayubi, 33, was arrested at Auckland airport as he entered the
country, charged with using a false passport and held in custody at
Mount Eden prison until he was deported.
	   An Immigration Service report on the case, quoted by the Daily
News, states that Al-Ayubi is wanted by the Lebanese army and by
the Syrian secret police, and that Lebanese parliamentarians want
him ``out of the way.''
	   It said Al-Ayubi joined political parties with terrorist
ideologies from 1984.
	   The report said Al-Ayubi is now a member of the political party
Tripoli Resistance, and the leader of one of its factions.
	   The Syrian secret police want Al-Ayubi for fighting against
Syrian armed forces.
	   The Lebanese army wants him for desertion and stealing a truck
full of weapons. And Lebanese parliamentarians want Al-Ayubi ``out
of the way'' because in 1993 he distributed pamphlets claiming they
accepted bribes.
	   The Immigration Service decision to decline Al-Ayubi's refugee
status application and deport him was based on his involvement in
the Movement of Islamic Union (Harakat al Tawheed Al-Eslamic).
	   The party followed the ideology of the radical wing of the
Muslim Brotherhood, which is ``internationally recognized as a
terrorist group,'' the report said.
	   Before his deportation, Al-Ayubi was convicted and discharged by
an Otahuhu District Court judge on the false passport charge.

Report: Houses burned and damaged in riot in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A brawl between rival village gangs
ended in a riot in which 39 houses were burned and 691 were
damaged, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   There were no reports of injuries. Police arrested 10 people
after the violence on Saturday and Sunday in Losari, about 280
kilometers (175 miles) east of Jakarta, the newspaper Kompas said.
	   It did not say what triggered the violence.
	   Recently several small towns have been hit by outbreaks of
rioting and looting as Indonesians endure their worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   Millions of people are finding it hard to cope with soaring food
prices and mass unemployment.
	   The military and some government officials fear further violence
could erupt in coming weeks.

Ex-spy agents convicted in smear campaign against President Kim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's former top spy was
sentenced to five years in prison Wednesday for plotting to destroy
President Kim Dae-jung's election campaign last year by depicting
him as a communist.
	   A three-judge court also handed down prison terms of up to two
years to six former intelligence agents and a magazine publisher
for participating in the scheme.
	   Kwon Young-hae, 60, a former head of the Agency for National
Security Planning, was found guilty of violating election laws and
a law calling for his agency's political neutrality.
	   Prosecutors had requested a 12-year sentence for Kwon.
	   Kwon admitted in court that he paid a Korean-American
businessman to hold news conferences in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul
just before the Dec. 18 presidential election, alleging that Kim's
campaign was funded by North Korea.
	   ``Heavy punishment is needed as the defendants committed serious
illegal acts to disrupt a certain candidate's campaign,'' judge
Sohn Ji-yeol said.
	   Kwon, a retired army general, headed the spy agency for three
years until he was sacked by the newly elected president in early
March.
	   Details of Kwon's smear campaign were not widely reported in
local media and Kim Dae-jung, an opposition candidate, eventually
won the election by a narrow margin.
	   All but one of the six former agents were given suspended
sentences of up to two years. The sixth was given a 16-month
sentence for physically detaining for more than a week a colleague
who sought to make the agency's illegal activity public.
	   Sohn Choong-moo, 59, a publisher, was sentenced to two years in
prison for spreading unfounded, hostile rumors about Kim through
his magazine. He was found to have received bribes from the ex-spy
chief.
	   In a separate trial earlier, four people, including the Korean-
American businessman, Yoon Hong-joon, 34, were convicted of similar
charges and sentenced to up to two years in prison.
	   South Korea remains staunchly anti-communist after fighting a
war with North Korea in 1950-53.
	   Under South Korea's past authoritarian governments, the spy
agency often portrayed dissidents or political opponents as
communists to destroy their careers.

Electronic game or phone may have jammed airliner's autopilot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Authorities are investigating whether
the autopilot on a Qantas flight to London jammed because
passengers used electronic games, computers or mobile phones on
board.
	   The 400 passengers on the Sept. 4 flight thought they were going
to crash as the plane lurched heavily on its side and dropped
sharply through the air.
	   Airline experts are looking into whether the problem was caused
by passengers using electronic games, a laptop computer and a
personal CD player during the descent _ despite being told not to.
	   According to an incident report obtained by The Australian
newspaper, intervention by the captain to correct the plane's
altitude was forced by a silent malfunction in the autopilot.
	   The malfunction had pitched the aircraft 700 feet (210 meters)
higher into the sky when it was meant to be in a holding pattern
above London Heathrow airport.
	   Since January 1994, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has
logged about 50 incident reports from airlines in Australia
involving personal electronic devices.
	   A spokesman for the bureau, which is investigating the Heathrow
incident, told the newspaper a conclusive link between the use of
devices which emit electromagnetic energy and the dozens of
reported malfunctions was yet to be made.

Mets and Cubs tie for NL wild-card lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mets dropped back into a tie for the NL
wild-card lead, blowing a three-run lead Tuesday night in a 5-3
loss to the Montreal Expos on Orlando Cabrera's tiebreaking two-run
single.
	   New York is tied again with the Chicago Cubs. Each team has four
games remaining.
	   John Olerud of the Mets walked in the first, tying Barry Bonds'
NL record of reaching base 15 consecutive times, then grounded out
in the third and fell one short of the major league mark Ted
Williams set in 1957.
	   Mike Thurman (4-5) allowed three runs and three hits in 6 1-3
innings. Ugueth Urbina got five outs for his 33rd save.
	   Armando Reynoso (7-2) was the loser.
 &UR; Cubs 5, Brewers 2 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, the Cubs moved into a tie for the NL wild-card
spot, snapping a three-game losing streak.
	   The Cubs' Sammy Sosa failed to close in on Mark McGwire, holding
at 63 home runs and leaving him in an 0-for-21 drought.
	   Terry Mulholland (6-5) pitched eight solid innings. He gave up
one run on six hits, three by Mark Loretta.
	   Jeromy Burnitz hit his 38th home run in the ninth off Cubs
reliever Rod Beck.
	   Bill Pulsipher (3-3) took the loss.
 &UR; Cardinals 4, Astros 0 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire failed to add to his major league
record 65 home runs, but Matt Morris recorded his first major
league shutout as St. Louis won its sixth in a row.
	   Morris (7-5), allowed five hits and struck out 10. He hasn't
allowed a run in 16 innings since Sept. 11.
	   Ron Gant hit a two-run single in the first and a solo homer off
Mike Hampton (11-7) in the fourth. Hampton went five innings and
allowed three runs on four hits for the Astros, who remained one
victory shy of 100.
 &UR; Braves 4, Marlins 1 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Eddie Perez's solo home run gave the Atlanta Braves
208 homers this season, breaking a 32-year-old franchise record.
	   Kevin Millwood (17-8) allowed one run and six hits in five
innings. Kerry Ligtenberg pitched a perfect ninth and became the
first NL rookie to collect 30 saves since St. Louis' Todd Worrell
in 1986.
	   Atlanta manager Bobby Cox moved ahead of Miller Huggins into
18th place in major-league history with 1,414 victories.
	   Medina (2-5) allowed three runs and five hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 8, Rockies 6 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Colorado's Mike Lansing hit three home runs, but
Arizona's Karim Garcia hit two of the Diamondbacks' franchise
record-tying five home runs.
	   Devon White, Kelly Stinnett and Travis Lee added homers for the
Diamondbacks. Arizona had been homerless in its previous five
games.
	   Omar Daal (8-12) went six innings and allowed five runs and six
hits in ending a personal three-game losing streak.
	   Gregg Olson pitched the ninth for his 29th save in 32
opportunities.
	   Jamey Wright (9-14) was the loser.
 &UR; Phillies 10, Reds 8, 11 innings &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, the Reds' Todd Williams walked three batters in
the 11th inning to force in the go-ahead run.
	   With one out, Williams (0-1) walked Bobby Abreu. After Mark
Lewis singled, Bobby Estalella and Desi Relaford walked to give
Philadelphia a 9-8 lead. Pinch-hitter Ruben Amaro followed with a
sacrifice fly off Keith Glauber.
	   Jerry Spradlin (4-4) pitched a scoreless 10th and Ricky
Bottalico got three outs for his fifth save.
	   Cincinnati's Aaron Boone went 3-for-4 with three RBIs.
 &UR; Dodgers 3, Padres 2 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Chan Ho Park scattered six hits in eight
innings, and rookie Adrian Beltre hit a three-run homer to lead the
Dodgers.
	   Park (14-9) walked one and struck out six before being relieved
to start the ninth by Jeff Shaw, who finished up for his 45th save.
	   Joey Hamilton (13-13) suffered the loss. Hamilton, who entered
the game with an 8-1 lifetime record and 2.38 ERA in 94 1-3 innings
against Los Angeles, allowed three runs and six hits in seven
innings. He walked four and struck out five.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mets dropped back into a tie for the NL
wild-card lead, blowing a three-run lead Tuesday night in a 5-3
loss to the Montreal Expos on Orlando Cabrera's tiebreaking two-run
single.
	   New York is tied again with the Chicago Cubs. Each team has four
games remaining.
	   John Olerud of the Mets walked in the first, tying Barry Bonds'
NL record of reaching base 15 consecutive times, then grounded out
in the third and fell one short of the major league mark Ted
Williams set in 1957.
	   Mike Thurman (4-5) allowed three runs and three hits in 6 1-3
innings. Ugueth Urbina got five outs for his 33rd save.
	   Armando Reynoso (7-2) was the loser.
 &UR; Cubs 5, Brewers 2 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, the Cubs moved into a tie for the NL wild-card
spot, snapping a three-game losing streak.
	   The Cubs' Sammy Sosa failed to close in on Mark McGwire, holding
at 63 home runs and leaving him in an 0-for-21 drought.
	   Terry Mulholland (6-5) pitched eight solid innings. He gave up
one run on six hits, three by Mark Loretta.
	   Jeromy Burnitz hit his 38th home run in the ninth off Cubs
reliever Rod Beck.
	   Bill Pulsipher (3-3) took the loss.
 &UR; Cardinals 4, Astros 0 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire failed to add to his major league
record 65 home runs, but Matt Morris recorded his first major
league shutout as St. Louis won its sixth in a row.
	   Morris (7-5), allowed five hits and struck out 10. He hasn't
allowed a run in 16 innings since Sept. 11.
	   Ron Gant hit a two-run single in the first and a solo homer off
Mike Hampton (11-7) in the fourth. Hampton went five innings and
allowed three runs on four hits for the Astros, who remained one
victory shy of 100.
 &UR; Braves 4, Marlins 1 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Eddie Perez's solo home run gave the Atlanta Braves
208 homers this season, breaking a 32-year-old franchise record.
	   Kevin Millwood (17-8) allowed one run and six hits in five
innings. Kerry Ligtenberg pitched a perfect ninth and became the
first NL rookie to collect 30 saves since St. Louis' Todd Worrell
in 1986.
	   Atlanta manager Bobby Cox moved ahead of Miller Huggins into
18th place in major-league history with 1,414 victories.
	   Medina (2-5) allowed three runs and five hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 8, Rockies 6 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Colorado's Mike Lansing hit three home runs, but
Arizona's Karim Garcia hit two of the Diamondbacks' franchise
record-tying five home runs.
	   Devon White, Kelly Stinnett and Travis Lee added homers for the
Diamondbacks. Arizona had been homerless in its previous five
games.
	   Omar Daal (8-12) went six innings and allowed five runs and six
hits in ending a personal three-game losing streak.
	   Gregg Olson pitched the ninth for his 29th save in 32
opportunities.
	   Jamey Wright (9-14) was the loser.
 &UR; Phillies 10, Reds 8, 11 innings &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, the Reds' Todd Williams walked three batters in
the 11th inning to force in the go-ahead run.
	   With one out, Williams (0-1) walked Bobby Abreu. After Mark
Lewis singled, Bobby Estalella and Desi Relaford walked to give
Philadelphia a 9-8 lead. Pinch-hitter Ruben Amaro followed with a
sacrifice fly off Keith Glauber.
	   Jerry Spradlin (4-4) pitched a scoreless 10th and Ricky
Bottalico got three outs for his fifth save.
	   Cincinnati's Aaron Boone went 3-for-4 with three RBIs.
 &UR; Dodgers 3, Padres 2 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Chan Ho Park scattered six hits in eight
innings, and rookie Adrian Beltre hit a three-run homer to lead the
Dodgers.
	   Park (14-9) walked one and struck out six before being relieved
to start the ninth by Jeff Shaw, who finished up for his 45th save.
	   Joey Hamilton (13-13) suffered the loss. Hamilton, who entered
the game with an 8-1 lifetime record and 2.38 ERA in 94 1-3 innings
against Los Angeles, allowed three runs and six hits in seven
innings. He walked four and struck out five.

New doubts arise over proposed Australian telecom sale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ New doubts arose Wednesday that the
government can sell the rest of the nation's biggest
telecommunications carrier, Telstra, after a minor party promised
to block the sale in the Senate.
	   The Democrats, who hope to control the balance of power in the
upper house of Parliament after the national election on Oct.
declared that they would block any such move.
	   ``The Australian Democrats have pledged to block any attempt by
a coalition government to sell any more of Telstra,'' said its
leader, Meg Lees.
	   Lees said the government would lose more by selling off bigger
slices of Telstra than it would gain.
	   She said that's because the loss of Telstra dividends would be
bigger than than the interest gains the government might make by
using most of the proceeds of the planned sale to pay off
government debt, as Prime Minister John Howard plans to do.
	   The government has already sold one third of the previously
wholly publicly owned carrier, and Howard says he wants to sell the
rest.
	   But a Senate revolt, and opposition by some members of the
rural-based National Party, the junior partner in Howard's
coalition government, forced him to retreat at least temporarily
from that ambition.
	   Howard said instead that he would sell only an extra 16 percent
of Telstra, leaving majority ownership with the government for the
time being.
	   But he also said that if his government wins the upcoming
elections, it would appoint an inquiry to decide what should be
done with the rest of Telstra.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello has said he expects to proceed with the
sale of the remaining 51 percent of the carrier after that.

Sacked Malaysian deputy premier to be charged in court by weekend
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Sacked deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim will face a dozen sex-related charges in court by the
weekend, police said.
	   Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Mohd Ghazali called on
Malaysians, confused by the political events of the past three
weeks, to have faith in the judicial system.
	   ``Allow the legal proceedings to commence,'' he told reporters
late Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he personally interviewed
people who said they engaged in illegal sex acts with his ousted
deputy.
	   Mahathir, who sacked Anwar as his deputy and finance minister on
Sept. 2, said the allegations were so vile he decided to question
people himself.
	   Anwar, 51 and the father of six children, has adamantly denied
all the charges against him. He says trouble started when he began
questioning Mahathir's policies and challenged his 17-year-rule.
	   Since his ouster, tens of thousands of supporters have
demonstrated at rallies throughout the country. Many supporters are
from the conservative Islamic party he founded during his student
days and don't believe the government's sexual misconduct
allegations.
	   Tajol Rosli said Anwar would face a dozen sexual misconduct
charges, including sodomy.
	   He said Anwar would have been charged in criminal court Monday,
but thousands of his supporters surrounded the courthouse, forcing
police to postpone the hearing.
	   When Anwar supporters outside the courthouse lunged at the
motorcade of Queen Elizabeth II on Monday, riot police moved in to
disperse the crowd with tear gas and water cannons. It was the
first violent clash between police and demonstrators in this
Southeast Asian country in a decade.
	   ``He will be charged based on the same reasons why the prime
minister sacked him,'' Tajol Rosli said. ``The charges are all
related to sex scandals and not for other reasons.''
	   Late Tuesday, the government disclosed that Anwar, arrested on
Sunday under a colonial security law that allows imprisonment
without trial, was being held at Kuala Lumpur's police
headquarters.
	   Eleven of his associates have also been detained under the
Internal Security Act and more than 100 supporters were detained
during the courthouse rally Monday.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, said she had not seen her husband
since police officers smashed into their house and dragged him away
Sunday night.
	   His lawyers had been told Anwar would be charged with sodomy,
treason and abuse of power, offenses that police said they were
still investigating.
	   ``I interviewed people he sodomized and the women he had sex
with,'' Mahathir told a news conference, describing the alleged
acts in graphic detail.
	   Sodomy is illegal in this Muslim country.
	   Mahathir said Anwar preferred to be detained under the ISA and
not face trial in an open court.
	   ``He wants to be arrested under the ISA so that he can accuse
the government of being oppressive,'' he said.

Negotiators for Taipei, Beijing meet to clear way for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Talks expected to resume at 0700 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Negotiators for the rival governments in Taipei
and Beijing met Wednesday to try to clear the way for resuming
talks that China broke off three years ago.
	   After morning talks between Shi Hwei-yow, secretary-general of
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, and Zhang Jincheng, his
counterpart at China's Association for Relations Across the
Straits, the two sides said they expected to set a schedule later
Wednesday for higher-level talks next month.
	   That meeting between SEF chairman Koo Chen-fu of Taiwan and Wang
Daohan, president of China's ARATS, will be their first since they
met for the first time in Singapore in 1993. Plans call for it to
take place during an Oct. 14-19 trip to the mainland by Koo.
	   Shi and Li Yafei, an ARATS deputy official, told reporters the
two sides still had to determine whether the meeting would take
place in Shanghai or Beijing and hammer out details. They planned
to meet again later Wednesday.
	   China broke off negotiations three years ago over Taiwan
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States. China saw the
trip as evidence Lee was moving toward formal independence.
	   Taiwan wants negotiations to resume where they left off _
dealing with small confidence-building measures and procedural
issues like fishing disputes _ before tackling the more contentious
idea of reunification. But China wants to begin with negotiations
on political ties.
	   Since Mao Tse-tung's Communists forced Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists from the mainland in 1949, China has viewed the island
as a rebel province.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Fugitive Giovanni Farina, wanted in
Italy in connection with a series of violent kidnappings, was
captured in Australia because he wrongly filled out a routine entry
form, police said Wednesday.
	   Farina entered Australia on Aug. 15 using a false identity and
carrying a forged passport, claiming to be on vacation.
	   But his ruse unraveled after Australian customs officials made a
random search of his bags and discovered a large amount of cash
that he had not declared.
	   Under Australian law, it is not illegal to import large amounts
of currency, as long as it is reported to authorities.
	   A police investigation triggered by the false declaration paid
dividends Tuesday when Italian authorities confirmed that the man
was Farina after a fingerprint check.
	   He appeared in Sydney Local Court on Wednesday on charges of
holding a false passport and stolen goods, assaulting two police
officers and attempting to escape.
	   He was remanded in custody until Sept. 30. Italian authorities
have begun extradition proceedings, Australian police said.
	   Farina maintains he is 39-year-old businessman Luigi Valiante,
federal agent Brian Healy said.
	   Farina is wanted in Italy on suspicion of masterminding several
kidnappings of wealthy business people, then chopping off their
ears if the money did not arrive.
	   In one attack, Giuseppe Soffiantini's ears were cut off and sent
to a television station before his family paid U.S. dlrs 3 million
(Australian dollars 5 million), The Sydney Morning Herald reported.
	   Like all visitors to Australia, Farina was asked to fill out a
passenger entry card when he arrived from Zurich. He ticked the
``no'' box when asked if he was carrying cash worth more than
Australian dollars 10,000.
	   In a random check, Customs officers found U.S. dollars 75,000 in
100 dollar bills and 11,500 Swiss francs, with a combined value of
about Australian dollars 140,000.
	   Federal agent Mark Heather said Farina might have entered
Australia without trouble if he had declared the cash on the card.
	   ``If a person declares a large amount of currency that is not an
offense and he would be allowed to depart,'' Customs spokesman
Chris Schofield told The Associated Press.
	   After the cash was found, police also noticed the photograph in
his passport appeared to have been tampered with and began checking
with Italian authorities.
	   With his true identity still unknown, Farina appeared in court
in late August on a charge of failing to declare the currency.
	   Farina made a dash from the courtroom at the end of the hearing,
punching two police officers in the process. But he ran into a
freshly cleaned plate glass door.
	   Interpol in Rome confirmed his identity on Tuesday.

Researcher invites ethical debate on 'gene therapy' for fetuses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A genetics pioneer wants to try gene therapy
on fetuses in hopes of curing them of deadly diseases before
they're ever born. But first he's asking scientists and ethicists
to debate the experiment _ because it could for the first time
alter a person's genes in a way that the changes are passed on to
future generations.
	   ``We're talking about something that is a radical departure from
anything that's ever happened before in medicine,'' said Dr. W.
French Anderson, who performed the first gene therapy in 1990 and
now hopes to try it on fetuses. ``This is something with profound
ethical implications.''
	   A U.S. panel of genetics experts begins reviewing Anderson's
research plans this week. He's still two to three years away from
the first experiment on human fetuses. But Anderson requested the
unusual early review to force a national debate on whether
society's ready.
	   The debate likely will be hot.
	   ``Society needs to face these problems,'' said Abbey Meyers of
the U.S. National Organization for Rare Disorders, who praises
Anderson for tackling the issue. ``No one has talked about it _
what are the long-term implications of changing genes unalterably
for future generations?''
	   Anderson wants to inject a healthy gene directly into fetuses
during the second trimester of pregnancy to try curing two rare
diseases: ADA, which renders the body unable to fight even mild
infections and is best known as the ``bubble-boy disease''; and
alpha thalassemia, a type of anemia that in severe cases kills the
baby inside the womb. Both diseases are caused by flaws in a single
gene.
	   Anderson, now with the University of Southern California, in
1990 used gene therapy on two girls with ADA. It did not cure them
but did improve their condition, and today, with additional drug
therapy, they're healthy.
	   Anderson says gene therapy should work better in fetuses because
the healthy genes can slip into more of the tiny patients' cells
than they can after birth.
	   But there are some risks, Anderson said. The new gene could
accidentally get into the fetus' reproductive cells, the so-called
germline, meaning the genetic alteration would be passed on to that
person's future children. That's never happened with gene therapy
before _ all genetic changes have affected only the person being
operated on.
	   If the experiment works and the new gene prevents disease, then
being passed to future generations would be good for that
particular family, Anderson said. But ``you open up the whole field
of genetic engineering of future generations,'' he said.
	   In addition, if somehow the gene messes up, his patients'
descendants could face even more risk.
	   Or the gene therapy could work only partially, meaning a fetus
with alpha thalassemia that would otherwise have died in the womb
instead could survive a few sickly years before dying, Anderson
said.
	   There are two main ethical camps, said bioethicist Ruth Macklin
of New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who is on the
National Institutes of Health committee that will debate Anderson's
plans Thursday and Friday.
	   Some people are unalterably opposed to germline alterations,
arguing they mess with Mother Nature. ``So is absolutely everything
else that biomedicine does,'' Macklin notes.
	   The most powerful argument is that if the experiment goes wrong,
``is one going to do more harm than good not just to a single
individual but on and on and on into the future?'' she said. ``Even
there, however, one has to sound a note of caution. If it's
possible to do something that has a bad effect, it may very well be
possible to undo that effect.''
	   She stressed that even if Anderson does affect the germline,
it's in an attempt to fight a lethal disease, not to create
``designer children.''
	   ``There is a view within the ethics community that this is a
Rubicon that in principle should be crossed when the circumstances
are right,'' added Georgetown University bioethicist LeRoy Walters.
	   Anderson's animal experiments have shown for five years that the
therapy is possible, but he hesitated to plunge into the
controversy. After all, back in 1990, ``I got death threats'' over
the first gene therapy. ``It'll happen again.''
	   ``This will be a stressful time, but nobody else is going to do
it, it needs to be done, the time is right,'' Anderson concluded.

Pakistan offers free food for North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Pakistan has promised to give
famine-stricken North Korea 30,000 tons of free grain, the
communist state's official media reported Wednesday.
	   The first shipment of 14,000 tons arrived in North Korea on
Tuesday, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.
	   Pakistan and North Korea maintain close military ties. The U.S.
State Department believes North Korea has been selling missile
technology and equipment to Pakistan.
	   Pakistan provided North Korea with 5,000 tons of grain and dlrs
160,000 in other relief goods in 1996 and 2,000 tons of grain in
1997, KCNA said.
	   North Korea is suffering dire food shortages after three years
of disastrous weather that aggravated problems caused by
inefficient cooperative farming techniques.

More than 700 students sickened by food poisoning in east China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two separate cases of food poisoning this month
at a school in eastern Shandong province sickened more than 700
children, although no deaths were reported, the newspaper Beijing
Economic Daily reported Wednesday.
	   In the most recent poisoning, more than 600 students at a
private school in the city of Weifang were treated at a local
hospital on Sept. 15 after complaining of stomach cramps, vomiting
and other symptoms of food poisoning, the report said.
	   On Sept. 7, 103 students were treated for similar complaints
after they drank soybean milk that had not been adequately boiled,
it said.
	   The report said that local health officials had ordered the
kitchen equipment at the school to be sterilized and other
precautions to prevent further trouble.

Anti-India group to discuss Kashmir in New York
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By QAISER MIRZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A Kashmiri leader opposed to Indian rule
in his troubled region was allowed to fly to New York to discuss
the issue with officials from Islamic countries, his aides said
Wednesday.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
nations gained independence from Britain in 1947. Kashmir is
divided between them, two-thirds in India and a third in Pakistan.
	   Umer Farooq left late Tuesday from the airport in Srinagar,
summer capital of Indian-held Kashmir. Last year and the year
before, Indian security had stopped Farooq at the airport when he
tried to make similar trips to attend meetings on the sidelines of
the opening of the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Farooq is a prominent member of a coalition of Kashmiri groups
that advocate either independence or merger with neighboring,
officially Islamic Pakistan for Indian-held Kashmir, the only
Muslim-majority state in predominately Hindu India.
	   Other coalition leaders were scheduled to leave Wednesday to
join Farooq in New York.
	   On the eve of his departure, Farooq told The Associated Press he
planned to talk Sept. 28 with members of a committee on Kashmir
formed by the Muslim world's main group, the Organization of the
Islamic Conference. He also planned to participate in an Oct. 1
meeting of foreign ministers from Islamic countries, and hoped to
meet with world leaders, including Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, in New York for the General Assembly session.
	   ``We'll tell them about what's going on in Kashmir, the killing
of people ... the excesses of the security forces,'' Farooq said.
``The people of Kashmir are being killed and beaten.''
	   Indian security forces have repeatedly been accused of violating
human rights as they try to crush a separatist war that has been
raging in Kashmir since 1989.
	   Farooq's coalition has called for a peaceful solution. Farooq
says Kashmiris should be allowed to vote on whether to join
Pakistan, become independent or stay with India.
	   Kashmir was expected to be the central topic Wednesday at a
lunch meeting of Sharif and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee. The lunch will be the second meeting since their
tit-for-tat nuclear weapons tests in May drew the world's attention
to their long-standing hostility.
	   ``We are not hopeful about the talks between the prime ministers
of India and Pakistan,'' Farooq said. ``They have met like this in
the past, but the talks were meaningless and they were not
fruitful. They have never been fruitful.''
	   Pakistan has called for international mediation to help break
the deadlock over Kashmir. India resists any outside intervention.

Dispute over cafes and religious ceremony breaks out on Bali
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A dispute has broken out among local
Hindu faithful and food vendors along Kuta Beach on the island of
Bali, one of Indonesia's top tourist locations.
	   Traditional villagers want dozens of makeshift cafes and bars
removed next month before they perform an annual ``universe
purification'' ceremony on the beach, the Jakarta Post reported
Wednesday.
	   The ceremony involves thousands of worshippers carrying sacred
pictures and statues along the water's edge.
	   ``Just imagine when the Hindus are praying, the cafes are
serving drinks'' to scantily clad guests, said Made Suwedja, who
heads a local group wanting to clean up the beach.
	   Many of the cafes are tents or shacks that provide money and
jobs for hundreds of vendors during Indonesia's worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   The newspaper said the local government has agreed that the they
must go by October.
	   A generation ago Kuta was a sleepy fishing village. However,
that changed in the 1970s when backpackers from Australia and
elsewhere were attracted to its rolling surf and laid back
lifestyle.
	   Over the years dozens of hotels and resorts have been built and
the area has become jammed with shops, restaurants, night clubs and
traffic.
	   Despite the rapid development, local people have prided
themselves on preserving age-old traditions in Bali, a Hindu island
in predominately Muslim Indonesia.

South African troops meet unexpected resistance in Lesotho

rising to between 30 and 50, reinforcements arriving overnight,

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Sporadic gunfire and artillery echoed
early Wednesday in Maseru where South African peacekeepers have met
unexpected and sometimes fierce resistance to efforts to back up
the tiny kingdom's beleaguered government.
	   A senior military officer said at least 10 South African
soldiers were killed in a day of combat Tuesday. South African news
media reported the total death toll, from soldiers, rebels and
civilians, was between 30 and 50.
	   Reinforcements, mostly from Botswana, arrived overnight to help
South African troops surprised by the ferocity of the resistance on
Tuesday in South Africa's first military intervention since the end
of apartheid.
	   Combined task force spokesman Maj. Ben van Zyl said the South
African force could not achieve its objectives on the first day.
	   Clouds of heavy black smoke hung over the city Wednesday morning
from shops, many owned by South Africans, that were torched by
looters and protesters.
	   Early Wednesday morning sporadic shooting and some artillery
fire still sounded near the Makoanyne barracks northeast of the
city where South African troops and rebel troops from Lesotho
fought fierce duels Tuesday.
	   There was also some small arms fire in the city center from
police and soldiers trying to drive off looters who have cleaned
out nearly every shop in the area.
	   South African media reported that both the Lesotho government
and the opposition said they were ready for talks to try to end the
crisis. However, it was not immediately clear Wednesday if senior
Lesotho government ministers were still in the country.
	   Since white rule ended in 1994, the South African military has
merged former apartheid military forces with the armed wing of the
anti-apartheid movement. The new army had never been in this kind
of combat before, Van Zyl said.
	   Lesotho, an impoverished kingdom with a population of 2 million
people, is surrounded by South African territory and is largely
dependent on South Africa for jobs and income.
	   After a revolt two weeks ago by junior military officers, some
of the ousted military leaders fled the country. The military
appears to be siding with an opposition movement that claims May
elections swept by the ruling Lesotho Congress Party were rigged.
	   At dawn Tuesday, 600 South African troops, along with armored
personnel carriers, attack helicopters and mortar units rumbled
into Lesotho after the government asked neighbors to help it deal
with a growing state of anarchy.
	   A senior South African officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the force lacked enough troops and proper equipment
to handle the stiff resistance. As artillery rounds lit up the
night sky, the officer told The Associated Press that his
government did not expect Lesotho's rebels to be so hostile.
	   In their first military operation since the end of apartheid in
1994, at least 10 South African soldiers died in a firefight
outside Makoanyne barracks northeast of the city, the officer said.
	   For the past month, officials from the Southern African
Development Community have been trying to mediate as opposition
strikes paralyzed the capital of Maseru.
	   Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili asked for the military help.
Botswana also sent 200 troops late Tuesday.
	   During the intervention, angry crowds stoned cars and set
government buildings and shopping centers afire. Shooting and
looting continued into the night in Maseru, with no soldiers or
police in sight, the South African Press Association reported.
	   Military officials in Pretoria reported that five soldiers were
killed in sometimes fierce fighting and sniper fire throughout the
chaotic capital.
	   It was not immediately clear whether some of those casualties
occurred at the barracks.
	   Five Lesotho citizens were also reported killed, although it was
not clear if they were civilians or members of the rebel military
force.
	   Under President Nelson Mandela, South Africa has promoted
nonintervention throughout Africa.
	   The decision to send troops into Lesotho unleashed biting
criticism from South African opposition parties, churches and
civilian groups.
	   But Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who was acting
head of state while President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki were out of the country, said the purpose was to
stabilize the situation.
	   Officials said Buthelezi consulted with Mandela on the decision.

Poll: Over 60 percent of Japanese voters disapprove of Cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Over 60 percent of Japanese voters disapprove of
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's administration, with a majority of
them citing his inability to boost the nation's ailing economy, a
newspaper poll published Wednesday showed.
	   A total of 60.2 percent of respondents said they do not support
Obuchi's 12-week-old Cabinet, according to the nationwide survey
conducted over the weekend by the Yomiuri newspaper, Japan's
largest.
	   The disapproval figure was the highest since the government of
then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in June, 1993, when 78.6
percent of those polled disapproved of his Cabinet, the newspaper
said.
	   At that time, Japan's highly speculative ``bubble'' of the late
1980s had burst and the economy was losing much of its previous
vigor. Miyazawa is now finance minister in the Obuchi Cabinet.
	   In the latest poll covering 1,997 eligible voters picked at
random, a majority of the respondents said they had little hope
Obuchi's policies can revive the weak economy and stabilize the
nation's financial system, the Yomiuri said. No margin of error was
given.
	   The poll was taken Sept. 19-20, just after Obuchi's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party and main opposition parties struck a
compromise to deal with billions of dollars in bad debts hanging
over the country's banking sector.
	   But differences in interpreting the agreement emerged earlier
this week among ruling and opposition officials, thus casting doubt
on whether the plan is workable.
	   After talks with President Bill Clinton in New York on Tuesday,
Obuchi vowed to make his best effort to address the economic
problems Japan faces. Obuchi was in New York to attend the opening
session of the U.N. General Assembly meeting on Monday.
	   The support rate for the Obuchi Cabinet fell to 24.5 percent in
the latest poll from 33.1 percent registered in the previous survey
taken in early August, the newspaper said.
	   Earlier this month, a separate nationwide poll by another major
Japanese newspaper, the Asahi, showed 54 percent disapproved of
Obuchi's Cabinet.

Philippines braces for shutdown of Asia's oldest airline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Staffing
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government struggled
Wednesday to prepare for the scheduled midnight closure of
flag-carrier Philippine Airlines, a threat to the country's already
ailing economy.
	   The expected demise of Asia's oldest airline has saddened many
Filipinos, and some television stations have broadcast poignant
scenes from its 57-year history.
	   President Joseph Estrada's spokesman, Jerry Barican, said the
government has abandoned a last-ditch plan to provide a 1.5 billion
peso (dlrs 33.7 million) loan to the cash-strapped carrier, and is
now focusing on ways to deal with the potentially disastrous
effects of its shutdown.
	   ``It's too late. PAL as PAL will cease at midnight today,''
Barican told The Associated Press. ``What we're attempting to do is
to try to minimize the losses.''
	   Estrada was scheduled to meet PAL chairman Lucio Tan later
Wednesday in a final attempt to halt the closure, a PAL official
said. The president has tried but failed several times to convince
Tan and the airline's unions to settle their differences.
	   Ground workers of the airline voted Tuesday to reject a
management-proposed recovery plan, dashing another government
effort to avoid the company's shutdown.
	   Government labor officials had gone directly to PAL's workers
through a referendum to see if they supported the plan, which union
leaders had earlier rejected.
	   PAL says the plan is a prerequisite for it to recover from a
series of crippling strikes and Asia's currency crisis.
	   The airline announced last week that it will close at midnight
Wednesday as a result of the unions' rejection of the rescue plan.
	   In the plan, Tan offered workers 20 percent of the airline's
stock and three seats on its board in exchange for a 10-year
suspension of their collective bargaining agreement.
	   Tan owns about 70 percent of PAL's stock, while the government
holds an estimated 18 percent. Estrada also offered one of four
government board seats to the workers, but union leaders continued
to reject the rescue plan.
	   PAL vice president Manolo Aquino said creditors, to whom PAL
owes about dlrs 2.1 billion, are insisting on guarantees of labor
harmony before they approve a restructuring plan.
	   Barican said the government plans to tap smaller airlines and
private and air force planes to serve 14 domestic routes critical
to trade and commerce. Officials also were exploring possible ways
for the government to operate some of PAL's planes on those routes.
	   ``If domestic flights are interrupted for a long time, it can
have very serious consequences for the economy,'' Barican said.
	   He said the government was not as worried about international
travel because of the presence of foreign carriers, who are banned
from serving domestic routes.
	   PAL currently has a 50 percent share of domestic passenger
traffic, down from 75 percent before a pilots' strike in June.
	   PAL's closure would leave many areas of the sprawling
archipelago of 7,000 islands without air service. Two smaller
carriers were grounded last week over safety concerns and financial
problems.
	   The only alternative for travel among the country's islands is
slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries. Last Friday, a ferry carrying
454 people sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila.
	   If PAL closes, it would be the largest company to fail in the
Philippines since Asia's currency crisis, which hit just as the
airline was launching a dlrs 4 billion expansion and refleeting
plan.
	   PAL's last flight was scheduled to leave from Manila for San
Francisco and Los Angeles on Wednesday night.

Oil chiefs to meet for world summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with confirmation and comment from summit
organizers, including that oil prices will not be discussed; EDITS
throughout and CHANGES overline to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Heads of some of the world's biggest oil companies
plan to meet in Vienna next week to discuss industry restructuring,
technology and the geopolitics of petroleum, the event's organizers
said Wednesday.
	   The summit of about 20 companies is thought to be the first time
in recent years that oil industry chief executives have assembled
informally for talks on the future of the sector, the Financial
Times reported Wednesday.
	   ``The meeting, conceived over a year ago, is designed to provide
a forum for industry executives to meet and discuss key issues,
including industry restructuring, changing technology, the
geopolitics of petroleum and the industry in society,'' said J.
Robinson West, finance chairman of The Petroleum Finance Company,
the industry advisory company staging the event.
	   The company said there will be no discussion of pricing
arrangements at the meeting, to be held Oct. 3 and Oct. 4, and that
participants will include representatives from a cross section of
sectors, including national, international and independent
companies.
	   Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Lynn Coleman, now a
Washington, D.C.-based energy lawyer, will also attend all
sessions, the company said.
	   Companies expected to participate include some of the biggest
publicly quoted western oil groups, including Royal Dutch/Shell,
BP, Chevron, Elf Aquitaine, Total and Eni, the Financial Times
said.
	   Several of the largest state oil and gas groups, such as Saudi
Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer and exporter, and Statoil
of Norway, also plan to take part, along with the chief executives
of several leading independent oil companies, the newspaper added.
	   Russia will be represented by Gazprom, the country's biggest
company and its largest single source of hard currency, the
newspaper said.
	   The high-level talks follow British Petroleum's announcement
last month that it is to take over U.S. oil giant Amoco Corp in a
30.3 billion pound (dlrs 53.9 billion) deal that is the biggest
industrial merger in U.S. history. The proposed marriage is
currently being scrutinized by the U.S. government for its
implications for competition in the marketplace.
	   The Financial Times quoted an unnamed senior European oil
industry executive as predicting that more big deals could result
from the gathering.
	   ``Everybody is on the prowl,'' the newspaper quoted him as
saying.
	   The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. offered a gloomy assessment
of the oil business last week, predicting depressed oil prices
won't recover any time soon, with the market glutted even as the
ripple effects of the Asian economic crisis.
	   Crude oil prices have plunged this year to levels unseen in a
decade.
	   The collapse started in the winter, when OPEC started pumping
more oil just as the effects of the Asian economic crisis began
choking off demand.
	   OPEC has since said it would cut back production but its various
members have not lived up to their commitments _ leaving all
producers stuck with low prices.

Malaysian police call in Anwar's wife for questioning

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Anwar's wife being called in for questioning,

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police called the wife of sacked
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim to appear at a police station
for questioning Wednesday, one of her aides said.
	   Azizah Ismail was handed the order by plainclothes police
officers from the criminal investigation department, the aide said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, Anwar was expected to be brought to a court to face
charges ranging from disturbing public order to sexual misconduct,
including sodomy, sources at his house said. Sodomy is illegal in
Malaysia.
	   Anwar's wife, who has spent most of her time inside the house
with the couple's six children, was being investigated for
allegedly making seditious statements. She had alleged that police
may be injecting her husband, arrested Sunday, with the HIV virus.
	   On Tuesday, a senior government official said Anwar will face a
dozen sex-related charges in court by the weekend.
	   Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Mohd. Ghazali called on
Malaysians, confused by the political events of the past three
weeks, to have faith in the judicial system.
	   ``Allow the legal proceedings to commence,'' he told reporters
late Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he personally interviewed
people who said they engaged in illegal sex acts with his ousted
deputy. Mahathir, who fired Anwar as his deputy and finance
minister on Sept. 2, said the allegations were so vile he decided
to question people himself.
	   Anwar, 51, has adamantly denied all the charges against him. He
says trouble started when he began questioning Mahathir's policies
and challenged his 17-year-rule.
	   Since his ouster, tens of thousands of supporters have
demonstrated at rallies throughout the country. Many supporters are
from the conservative Islamic party he founded during his student
days and they do not believe the government's sexual misconduct
allegations.
	   Ghazali said Anwar would have been charged in criminal court
Monday, but thousands of his supporters surrounded the courthouse,
forcing police to postpone the hearing.
	   When Anwar supporters outside the courthouse lunged at the
motorcade of Queen Elizabeth II on Monday, riot police moved in to
disperse the crowd with tear gas and water cannons.
	   They had used the same methods to drive marchers away from the
prime minister's residence Sunday night. It was the first violent
clash between police and demonstrators in this Southeast Asian
country in a decade.
	   ``He will be charged based on the same reasons why the prime
minister sacked him,'' Tajol Rosli said. ``The charges are all
related to sex scandals and not for other reasons.''
	   Late Tuesday, the government disclosed that Anwar, arrested
under a colonial security law that allows imprisonment without
trial, was being held at Kuala Lumpur's police headquarters.
	   Eleven of his associates have also been detained under the
Internal Security Act and more than 100 supporters were detained
during the courthouse rally Monday.
	   One of them, Mohamad Ahmad, a former aide, was freed Tuesday by
a city magistrate.

Queen Elizabeth awed by Malaysian development, silent on turmoil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II was winding
down her visit to this former British colony Wednesday, awed by the
pace of development since her last visit in 1989, yet silent about
the political turmoil surrounding her.
	   Ending their four-day visit, the queen and her husband, Prince
Philip, scheduled stops at the National Art Gallery, a
British-Malaysian education institute, and a training center for
the blind.
	   The last public event was to be a tea with old soldiers from
World War II and veterans of the Malaysian Emergency, an
anti-communist jungle war in the 1950s.
	   The queen's four-day state visit comes during some of the
biggest political trouble since the Southeast Asian nation became
independent in 1957.
	   Queen Elizabeth and her husband landed the same day that fired
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was jailed after addressing
35,000 demonstrators in the city's streets.
	   Police shot tear gas and chemical-laced water jets at crowds
outside Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's residence Sunday, and on
Monday to disperse thousands outside a courthouse chanting
``Reform, reform'' as the queen's motorcade sped by.
	   There was no hint of it in her speech at a state banquet Tuesday
night. She mentioned Malaysia's financial difficulties, not its
politics and focused her comments on trade and education.
	   Her only reference to instability was mentioning British and
Malaysian troops cooperating in the United Nations' forces in
Bosnia.
	   ``Prince Philip and I have been deeply impressed by how your
infrastructure has grown since were were last here,'' the queen
said, recalling the heads of the Commonwealth meeting 21 years ago.
``Kuala Lumpur, with its stylish new buildings, is greatly
changed.''
	   She mentioned the new airport, where she was the first guest to
use the VIP section; the Petronas Twin Towers, the tallest building
in the world; and the national sports complex, where she officiated
at the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games, the first in
Asia.
	   Anticipating her visit Wednesday to the British-Malaysia
Institute, the queen said, ``We want to do everything possible to
support Malaysia's ambition to become a regional leader in
education.''
	   The institute, and other joint education programs with Britain,
are part of Malaysia's goal to become a fully industrialized nation
by 2020, Minister of Entrepreneur Development Mustapa Mohamed told
the queen.

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Hurricane Georges
unleashed violence in the Dominican Republic as police arrested
hundreds for looting and President Leonel Fernandez ordered an
overnight curfew.
	   The death toll in the Dominican Republic rose to 12 _ and 21
overall _ as the storm continued churning across the island of
Hispaniola and entered the impoverished nation of Haiti, where
damages were expected to be severe due to substandard housing and
minimal preparation for the hurricane. It also threatens Cuba and
the Bahamas.
	   Georges had caused extensive damage to several northeast
Caribbean islands. Three were killed on St. Kitts and two on
Antigua, before the storm hit Puerto Rico, where at least four
people were dead.
	   Georges also knocked out communications with the U.S. Virgin
Islands, where damage was reported as extensive early Monday and
which President Bill Clinton declared, along with Puerto Rico, a
disaster area. Efforts to telephone the U.S. Virgin Islands failed
Tuesday.
	   Henry Laskowski, a meteorologist at the U.S. National Weather
Service in San Juan, said they knew of blown-off roofs and trees
felled by winds of more than 100 mph (160 kph) on St. Croix, a U.S.
territory, but there were no reports of fatalities.
	   There were concerns the storm might continue as far as the U.S.
state of Florida.
	   In the Dominican Republic, where the minimum wage is 2,040 pesos
(dlrs 140) a month, looters could be seen carrying television sets
and microwave ovens on their heads through waist-deep water.
	   Police Chief Jose Anibal Sanz said police fired on some people
who were trying to loot a shopping center.
	   Ruben Paulino Alvarez, secretary of the armed forces, said the
death toll had risen to 12. He said a family of four died when a
tree fell on their house in a Santo Domingo suburb; a boy died in
Santo Domingo when a wall fell on him; another person died in Santo
Domingo when a roof fell on them, and four people died in the
eastern city of Higuey _ three when a roof fell on them and one
from a falling tree.
	   He did not give details of the other two deaths, and refused to
answer a reporter who asked about reports that police had shot and
killed two alleged looters.
	   President Fernandez declared a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Paulino said he expected Fernandez to send the military into the
streets of the capital to maintain order and said looters would be
dealt with sternly.
	   Forecasters had expected the storm to hit only the northern
coast of the Dominican Republic, but Georges changed course Tuesday
and headed straight for the capital before moving into Haiti.
	   ``The damages here are terrible, terrible,'' said Jose Guillermo
Sued, director of the Santo Domingo airport, who said the terminal
and several hangars were damaged.
	   At 0600 GMT, the poorly defined center of Georges was located
over Haiti, 45 miles north-northwest of Port-au-Prince, the
capital.
	   Winds had decreased to about 75 mph (120 kph) _ as opposed to
110 mph (175 kph) earlier yesterday, and were expected to diminish
further until the storm passes over Hispaniola.
	   The strength of Georges' winds was evident as it ripped the roof
off the cab of a tanker truck passing through the capital, and
flipped it onto the hood. In addition to the winds, Georges flooded
parts of Santo Domingo, reaching one 22-foot (7-meter) highway
overpass.
	   As the storm approached, many sat back and waited.
	   ``I live hanging on to God,'' said tour guide Fausto Lorenzo
Cipion, 38. ``I'm not afraid of this.''
	   President Fernandez addressed the nation on television and
offered similar advice.
	   ``For the moment, the only thing left for us to do is to raise
our prayers to the Almighty,'' said the president.
	   Authorities in Santo Domingo opened shelters Tuesday morning _
hours after strong winds and heavy bursts of rain had reached the
capital. People continued to stream into shelters even as the full
force of Georges hit.
	   Power went out even before the full force of the hurricane hit.
	   Hotels evacuated tourists from their rooms overnight and put
them up in conference or ballrooms.
	   In Haiti, authorities had warned that substandard housing and
deforested land could put many people in jeopardy, but they said
they hoped the storm would lose strength over the Dominican
Republic. In 1994, mudslides unleashed by tropical storm Gordon
killed several thousand in Haiti's southern provinces.

China upbeat about economy despite floods, other woes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite the worst floods in decades, declining
state industries and the impact of the regional financial crisis,
senior officials said Wednesday they are confident China will reach
its 1998 economic growth target of 8 percent.
	   The main cause for optimism appears to be the mammoth 3 trillion
yuan (dlrs 363 billion) the government expects the nation to invest
in infrastructure construction in 1998-2000 and a recent recovery
in retail sales.
	   ``Starting from August, the economy has shown obvious signs of a
recovery,'' Zeng Peiyan, minister of the State Development Planning
Commission, told reporters at a news conference.
	   By pumping money into a myriad of job-creating construction
projects, China intends to overcome the combined negative impacts
of the floods, a slowdown in export growth and foreign investment,
and the financial crisis afflicting its state enterprises and
banks.
	   Zeng pointed to an increase in fixed-asset investment of 17.4
percent in the first eight months of this year from the year-ago
period, and a 26.9 percent surge in August as evidence that the
government is fulfilling its pledge to boost the economy.
	   China's gross domestic product grew only 7 percent in the first
half of this year, compared with annual 8.8 percent growth in 1997.
	   While the economy is robust by the standards of China's
crisis-stricken neighbors, the slowdown raised doubts that the
government's growth target of 8 percent could be reached.
	   Drawing on their legacy of central planning, China's central
leaders have made a determined attempt to ensure their goal is met.
The government has issued 100 billion yuan (dlrs 12.11 billion) in
bonds for infrastructure and flood reconstruction and has urged
state banks to lend another 100 billion yuan for fixed-asset
investment projects.
	   ``If we can complete even one-half of what we have promised,
that will increase GDP by 1 percent,'' Zeng said.
	   Still, Zeng acknowledged that meeting the target will be
difficult.
	   Flooding in northeastern and central China this summer, the
worst since 1954 along the Yangtze River, has caused 166.6 billion
yuan (dlrs 20.17 billion) in damage and killed more than 3,000
people.
	   By some estimates, the floods alone could shave up to 1
percentage point off GDP growth this year, Zeng said. But he noted
that reconstruction could help compensate for those losses by
stimulating more demand for building supplies and construction,
perhaps limiting the decline to only 0.4 percentage point.
	   Similarly, falling investment from other Asian countries was
offset, he reported, by increasing investment from Europe and the
United States.
	   The value of newly signed contracts with foreign investors
climbed 7.3 percent from January to July, compared with a year
earlier, to dlrs 28 billion, although actual foreign direct
investment remained flat at dlrs 29.3 billion.
	   Other dark clouds shadowing the economy have fewer silver
linings, however.
	   Profits of China's struggling state-owned enterprises continue
to decline _ by 41 percent in the first seven months of the year
compared to a year earlier. A slowdown in export growth is pinching
many foreign joint ventures _ once the most dynamic sector of the
economy.

Gadhafi meets representative of British Lockerbie families
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Jim Swire, a representative of British
victims of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet, has met with Moammar
Gadhafi and expressed support for the Libyan leader's position on
how Libyan suspects should be tried.
	   State-run Libyan television said that Swire and other British
families ``stood in the same trench with Libya, supported its
stance, and praised Libyan readiness'' to allow the suspects to
stand trial in the Netherlands, the state-run television said.
	   The broadcast was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London.
	   Swire's daughter Flora was killed in the bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
	   Libyan television said the meeting Tuesday in Tripoli also was
attended by Robert Black, a law professor at Edinburgh University
in Scotland who is involved in preparing the suspects' defense.
	   Libya has agreed in principle to accept a U.S.-British
compromise that the suspects be tried in the Netherlands by
Scottish judges under Scottish law. But Gadhafi has demanded
guarantees for the the legal rights and safety of the men.
	   Britain and the United States _ which initially demanded a trial
on their own soil _ have said the offer is not negotiable. But they
have expressed some willingness to discuss details through U.N.
officials.
	   The broadcast quoted an unnamed spokesman for Black as saying
that the Libyan side emphasized that it was not a party to the
British-Netherlands agreement, which sets out the terms for the
trial, and did not consider it legally binding on Tripoli.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying
``Libya accepts a trial in a third country if that country would be
the last point and not a transit point.''
	   The U.S.-British proposal calls for the Libyan suspects, if
convicted, to serve their prison time in Britain. Libya has said
they should serve any sentence in Libya.
	   The bombing of the Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions in 1992 to try to force
Gadhafi to hand over the suspects for trial. The sanctions ban air
travel to and from Libya, freeze foreign assets and bar the sale of
some oil equipment.
	   The U.N. Security Council has passed a resolution saying that
the sanctions will be lifted when the suspects are turned over for
trial in the Netherlands.

Report: Russian aircraft carrier to become tourist attraction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A Chinese company plans to use a retired
Russian aircraft carrier as a tourist attraction, a newspaper said
Wednesday.
	   The purchase of the 20-year-old Minsk in mid-August from South
Korea had sparked fears that China was trying to add an aircraft
carrier to its arsenal.
	   The Minsk arrived recently in Shatian, a village at the mouth of
the Pearl River near Shenzhen, a city that borders Hong Kong, Wen
Hui Bao reported. It published a photograph of an aircraft carrier
with a Soviet-style star and ``Minsk'' in Cyrillic letters on its
bow.
	   After being ``put in order'' by a local shipyard, the Minsk is
to be used for tourism, the newspaper said. It did not give any
details.
	   The South Korean firm that sold the ship said this month the
Minsk was to be broken up as scrap, and the buyer would have to pay
a penalty if it were used for anything else. The company said
Russia stripped the vessel of weapons, engines and communications
equipment.
	   Russia has sold the Minsk and other vessels from its Pacific
Fleet because it could not afford to maintain them.
	   Military analysts say China wants to develop the ability to use
aircraft carriers, which would let it expand its naval power far
beyond its shores.
	   China could learn from the Minsk by disassembling it, or use the
vessel for training without rebuilding it, analysts say.
	   A company in the neighboring Portuguese colony of Macau bought
an unfinished aircraft carrier from Ukraine earlier this year, and
said it plans to turn it into a floating entertainment center.
	   Hong Kong media say the company has links to the mainland
Chinese government.

Damning book adds to troubles of Turkey's fallen first female
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Once seen as just the modern, educated
person to lead her country forward, the woman who rose to become
Turkey's first female premier has fallen from grace.
	   Hurt first by corruption allegations, then by an unpopular
alliance with an Islamic party, Tansu Ciller's once formidable
popularity is taking further hits from a new book that portrays her
as a politician without scruples.
	   ``Masked Lady,'' by Faruk Bildirici, a journalist with the
anti-Ciller Hurriyet daily, hit Turkey's bestsellers' list as soon
as it was published in July.
	   Based on extensive interviews, the book depicts Ciller as a
scheming, stubborn woman driven by a lust for power. ``People had a
need to know Mrs. Ciller,'' Bildirici said in a television
interview.
	   It claims Mrs. Ciller and her husband, who acknowledge having no
savings in the early days of their marriage, became rich through
shady business deals in a collapsed bank and a housing development
scheme, swindling even their closest friends.
	   According to the book, Mrs. Ciller allegedly helped herself to
money from a government discretionary fund for personal expenses,
including paying thousands of dollars to a New York hotel after her
son allegedly wrecked the presidential suite.
	   The Cillers have not commented publicly on the book; Mrs. Ciller
has denied past allegations of corruption and blamed them on
political opponents trying to end her career.
	   ``When she first started, Tansu left the image of a young,
beautiful, intelligent, pro-secular, modern person with knowledge
of economic issues,'' wrote Turker Alkan, a columnist for daily
Radikal. ``The Tansu image now consists of ... a bad-intentioned
person capable of cooperation with the devil.''
	   A U.S.-educated economist, Mrs. Ciller beat more experienced
politicians to take the helm of Turkey's male-dominated society in
1993. She served until 1996, when she formed an alliance with the
Islamic party despite earlier assurances that she would save Turkey
from radical Islam.
	   The alliance, under which she was deputy premier, marked her
downfall. The coalition was ousted from power under pressure from
the staunchly pro-secular military. Many of her colleagues left the
party in protest.
	   ``She had uttered the harshest words against (the Islamic party)
in her election campaigns,'' Bildirici wrote. In the end, ``she
preferred to forget what she had said.''
	   Mrs. Ciller has survived several corruption probes in Parliament
with the help of her Islamic coalition partners. But opponents have
opened a new investigation into an unaccounted-for increase in her
wealth.
	   In the meantime, prosecutors have turned to her husband, Ozer
Ciller, who is battling accusations of tax evasion and unaccounted
wealth. The couple have millions of dollars in assets in Turkey and
in the United States.
	   The book claims the masking of the real Tansu Ciller started
even at her birth _ Bildirici alleges Ciller's father altered her
birth date to hide her illegitimacy, making her three years younger
than the 52 years she states.
	   But he rejects accusations that the book is all negative. ``The
book says she has an IQ of 160 _ which I think is something to be
proud of,'' he said.

Singapore PM: political uncertainty in Malaysia hurting region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has said
political uncertainty in Malaysia will further erode investor
confidence in the region, even though the turmoil is unlikely to
topple the government of its northern neighbor.
	   Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. during a
10-day visit to the United States, Goh said many investors would
stay away from Southeast Asia because of the recent events in
Malaysia, Singapore's state-run television reported Wednesday.
	   Since Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad ousted his
former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 2, tens of thousands of
supporters have demonstrated at rallies throughout the country.
	   Anwar, who faces charges of treason along with sex-related
allegations, has repeatedly called for Mahathir's resignation. But
the Malaysian leader has said he will not step down and has clamped
down on pro-Anwar demonstrators.
	   Singapore's Goh said investors tend to view Southeast Asia as a
whole when making investment decisions, and that developments in
Malaysia would therefore damage their assessment of the entire
region.
	   But he argued that these blanket evaluations were inaccurate,
saying that there are major differences between the situation in
Malaysia and the circumstances earlier this year in Indonesia,
where widespread unrest eventually toppled former Indonesian
President Suharto.
	   ``Whilst there's this political uncertainty in Malaysia, we do
not foresee Malaysia politically getting into great turmoil,'' Goh
was quoted as saying in the news report. ``They've strong
institutions, the economy is fundamentally sound and Malaysia would
not go the way Indonesia has gone.''

Foreign Ministry official suspected of spying for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A Finnish government official is
suspected of passing classified information about the European
Union to Russia, the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
	   ``It is a serious matter and officials at the Russian Embassy
who were mixed up in the affair are no longer in the country,'' a
ministry statement said.
	   The government is considering taking legal action against the
Foreign Ministry official, the brief statement said.
	   The official was not named, and no other details were
immediately available.
	   The Minister for European Affairs, Ole Norrback, confirmed that
the case is being investigated, but declined to give details.
	   ``We will comment on the matter as soon as we know exactly what
it's about,'' Norrback said.
	   Finland, which joined the EU in 1995, is due to take over the
union presidency in July 1999.

 &UR; Official: Philippine Air shutdown won't seriously affect banking
system

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The expected collapse of Philippine
Airlines does not pose a major risk to the country's banking system
because major lenders have already anticipated its impact, a
Philippine central bank official said Tuesday.
	   ``It will not have a major impact because some banks have
already made 100 percent provisions since last year,'' central bank
Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes said.
	   PAL was scheduled to officially shut down at midnight Tuesday
after the government's failure to broker a last-ditch agreement
between the management and workers.
	   It has failed to service its dlrs 2.1 billion in debts since
June, when it received a moratorium from the Philippine's
Securities and Exchange Commission pending the submission of a
rehabilitation plan.
	   That moratorium was extended by the SEC on Monday until Nov. 20.
	   Of the total liabilities, domestic banks are owed dlrs 233
million in dollar-denominated loans, along with a further 1.2
billion pesos (dlrs 27 million) in peso loans.
	   This represents an estimated 0.7 percent of total loans in the
Philippine banking system.
	   The bulk of airline's debts, however, are owed to European
financial institutions. About dlrs 1.2 billion is owed to a
consortium of European financial institutions in the form of loans
used to finance an ill-timed aircraft modernization program.
	   Another dlrs 400 million is owed to U.S. financial institutions,
led by the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Officials of the U.S.
Export-Import Bank have already visited PAL to ask for a voluntary
turnover of planes purchased with its money, PAL officials said.
	   Most of PAL's debt is secured against aircraft and engines and _
to a far lesser extent _ property, ticket sales and government
guarantees.
	   Reyes estimates that the airline's demise is likely to increase
the ratio of non-performing loans in the local banking system by
less than 0.5 percentage point.
	   According to the most recent official data available, the
non-performing loan ratio of all banks averaged 9.7 percent in
June, down from 10.1 percent in May, while the ratio for commercial
banks was 8.95 percent in June, down from 9.44 percent the previous
month.
	   However, a private credit rating agency, Thomson BankWatch,
estimated Wednesday that PAL's closure could increase the ratio of
non-performing loans by as much as one percentage point.
	   It said total non-performing loans in Philippine banks now
average around 10 percent. That figure will likely peak at between
12 percent and 14 percent later this year, BankWatch said.
	   It said Philippine National Bank, PAL's biggest domestic
creditor, will be hardest hit. BankWatch said PNB has lent at least
dlrs 80 million to the airline.
	   ``The bank's asset quality is already among the country's most
eroded, with non-performing loans reportedly exceeding 10 percent.
Its provisioning levels are also possibly the least adequate to
absorb bad assets,'' it said of PNB.
	   Still, the Philippines' overall bad-loan ratio is far better
than in other countries affected by the Asian currency crisis.
Thailand's is presently 46 percent, South Korea's 25 percent and
Malaysia's 18 percent.

Belgium orders investigation into death of woman facing expulsion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The government ordered an investigation
Wednesday into the death of a Nigerian woman following a struggle
with police who tried to put her on a plane bound for Africa.
	   Police tried to subdue Semira Adamu, who forcefully resisted
expulsion, by putting a pillow on her face as she was being
strapped into a seat on a plane at the Brussels airport.
	   As other passengers looked on, Ms. Adamu, 20, struggled so
fiercely she ended up in a coma and was rushed to a hospital where
she died hours later of a brain hemorrhage.
	   It was the sixth time police tried to put Ms. Adamu on a plane.
	   Her death led to angry protests by sympathizers outside the
house of Interior Minister Louis Tobback in Leuven, 16 kilometers
(10 miles) east of here.
	   In a statement, Tobback said he regretted the incident and
ordered an investigation. He said first reports indicated that
police were not acting illegally as Ms. Adamu had exhausted her
appeals against an expulsion order.
	   Ms. Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed that
her family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already
has three wives. Belgium argued that was no ground for refugee
status and also rejected Ms. Adamu's request to remain in Belgium
on humanitarian grounds.
	   Some 4,000 people whose asylum requests were turned down by the
Belgian authorities were repatriated last year. Some 300 needed
police escorts.

Taiwanese buying up bean said to be able to cure cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese are snatching up a white bean
that one scientist has claimed can kill cancer cells, causing its
price to soar.
	   The craze for the Jack bean, also known as the Gotani bean,
began last week when famous biologist Tung Ta-cheng released a
report that claims the bean can prevent or cure cancer.
	   The report said the bean contains a lectin called Con A that
could contain the growth of tumors. Tung urged people to chew and
swallow a raw bean a day, saying cooking could spoil the precious
element.
	   He said he had tested the bean on 11 patients with breast cancer
and that it had proved effective on them.
	   Prices of the beans soared 20 times to 3,000 Taiwan dollars
(about U.S. dlrs 100) a kilogram, or U.S. dlrs 45 per pound,
newspapers reported.
	   Jan Chi-hsien, head of the Health Department, said Tung's report
is valuable but it needs more clinical testing to prove the bean's
effect on cancer.
	   Agricultural officials said about 80 kinds of indigenous
vegetables and herbs have been reported to be able to contain the
growth of tumors, but their effects have yet to be clinically
proven.

Labor promises to reduce unemployment to five percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The main Labor opposition party
Wednesday promised to slash Australia's unemployment rate to five
percent within six years if it wins government in national
elections Oct. 3.
	   Seeking to shift the focus of the campaign from financial
management to jobs, party leader Kim Beazley unveiled a plan worth
Australian dollars 1.5 billion (U.S. dlrs 870 million) over four
years.
	   Within two terms of a Labor government, the unemployment rate
would be five percent, Beazley pledged at the official launch of
Labor's campaign.
	   ``Labor is committed to achieving full employment,'' he said.
	   ``Labor will meet this challenge with an active strategy,
including the use of appropriate combinations of budgetary and
interest rate policy to stimulate the maximum sustainable growth
rate,'' he said.
	   Unemployment in August was 8.1 percent and has remained
stubbornly above 8 percent for some time. Economic growth in the
fiscal year ended June 30 averaged 4 percent, and the government
forecasts a slowing to 2.75 percent in 1998-99.
	   Labor, which is slightly ahead of Prime Minister John Howard's
conservative government in opinion polls, is seeking to exploit the
persistently high unemployment rate to attract votes.
	   It is also trying to capitalize on voter uncertainty about the
government's plan for tax reform, which includes the introduction
of a goods and services tax.
	   Howard has made economic management and his tax plan the
centerpiece of its election campaign.
	   Labor also promised a review of government work schemes, extra
regional development and tax cuts to encourage people to shift from
welfare into work.
	   Howard ridiculed Labor's unemployment target as unachievable.
	   ``It's almost an insult to the intelligence of the Australian
people to be setting that kind of target without the economic
reforms and mechanisms to achieve such a target,'' Howard said.
	   Labor needs a 4 percent swing toward it in total votes to win
the 27 extra seats it requires for a majority in the 148-member
House of Representatives.

China cuts interest rate on U.S. dollar accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China cut interest rates Wednesday on
bank deposits of U.S. dollars in an attempt to divert private
savings to Chinese-currency accounts, a bank official said.
	   The change lowered the interest rate to 4.25 percent from 4.875
percent, compared with 4.77 percent for Chinese yuan, the official
of the People's Bank of China told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   It was the first interest rate cut for U.S.-dollar accounts
since June 12, and followed a lowering of the rate for German marks
earlier this month.
	   Economists said the rate cut was aimed at raising sagging
growth, but they said the Chinese economy needed more drastic
reform measures. They noted five rate cuts over the past two year
have made little difference.
	   The Chinese economy grew by 7 percent in the first half the
year, below the target for the year of 8 percent. That is believed
to be the minimum necessary to create jobs for millions of workers
laid off in a massive overhaul of state industry.
	   The economy grew 8.8 percent last year.

China upbeat about economy despite floods, other woes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS figure for construction investment in graf 2 to dlrs
1.2 trillion. picks up 3rd graf pvs
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will reach its 1998 economic growth target
of 8 percent despite the worst floods in decades, declining state
industries and the impact of the Asian financial crisis, a senior
Chinese official insisted Tuesday.
	   The main cause for optimism appears to be the dlrs 1.2 trillion
the government expects the nation to invest annually in
infrastructure construction in 1998-2000 and a recent recovery in
retail sales.
	   ``Starting from August, the economy has shown obvious signs of a
recovery,'' Zeng Peiyan of the State Development Planning
Commission told reporters at a news conference.
	   By pumping money into construction projects, China intends to
overcome the negative impacts of the floods, a slowdown in export
growth and foreign investment, and the financial crisis afflicting
its state enterprises and banks.
	   Zeng pointed to an increase in fixed-asset investment of 17.4
percent in the first eight months of this year, and a 26.9 percent
surge in August as evidence that the government is fulfilling its
pledge to boost the economy.
	   China's gross domestic product grew 7 percent in the first half
of this year, compared with annual 8.8 percent growth in 1997.
While the economy is robust by the standards of China's
crisis-stricken neighbors, the slowdown raised doubts that the
government's growth target of 8 percent could be reached.
	   Drawing on a legacy of central planning, China's leaders have
made a determined attempt to ensure their goal is met. The
government has issued dlrs 12 billion in bonds for infrastructure
and flood reconstruction and has urged state banks to lend another
dlrs 12 billion for fixed-asset investment projects.
	   ``If we can complete even one-half of what we have promised,
that will increase GDP by 1 percent,'' Zeng said.
	   Zeng acknowledged that meeting the target will be difficult.
	   Flooding in northeastern and central China this summer, the
worst since 1954 along the Yangtze River, has caused more than dlrs
20 billion in damage and killed more than 3,000 people.
	   By some estimates, the floods alone could shave up to 1
percentage point off GDP growth this year, Zeng said. But he noted
that reconstruction could help compensate for those losses by
stimulating more demand for building supplies and construction.
	   Similarly, falling investment from other Asian countries was
offset, he reported, by increasing investment from Europe and the
United States. The value of newly signed contracts with foreign
investors climbed 7.3 percent from January to July, compared with a
year earlier, to dlrs 28 billion, although actual foreign direct
investment remained flat at dlrs 29.3 billion.
	   However, profits of China's struggling state-owned enterprises
continue to decline _ by 41 percent in the first seven months of
the year. In addition, a slowdown in export growth is pinching many
foreign joint ventures.

	   HUMACAO, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Fredeswinda Rodriguez lost her roof
to Hurricane Hugo nine years ago. This week, she lost her house to
Hurricane Georges.
	   That's life in hurricane alley, on the eastern flank of Puerto
Rico.
	   On Tuesday, Rodriguez began the exhausting business of finding
another home for her extended family of nine _ including five
children, a daughter-in-law and a grandson _ who shared her
four-bedroom house in rural Humacao.
	   Humacao was among the first areas on Puerto Rico to feel
Georges' wrath when it struck with 110 mph (180 kph) winds Monday,
beginning a furious east-west trek that left much of the U.S.
territory a disaster zone.
	   The short-term solution for Rodriguez _like many in this
close-knit society _ was to rely on family and friends.
	   ``We've got an uncle who'll take two. The family over there will
take another two,'' she said, sadly surveying the splintered wood
paneling and soggy plasterboard that lay strewn across the nearby
hillside.
	   Her long-term plans were more vague. Money was needed to fix
homes, rebuild lives. Patience would be needed for the long stay in
the homes of relatives.
	   On Tuesday, people simply tried to come to grips with the
destruction.
	   Near the former Rodriguez home, coconuts, electric cables and
branches the width of drainpipes were scattered across lawns in the
hilltop neighborhood. On other hills, more houses lay in shambles
or gaped, roofless, at the drizzling sky.
	   Across the road, a chainsaw buzzed as neighbors cut up
dangerously leaning trees. The air was saturated with the smell of
hundreds of broken saplings.
	   Rodriguez's sons pulled a case of extended-life milk from the
wreckage. She nodded absentmindedly: ``Good, that'll be good for
the baby'' _ her 1-year-old grandson.
	   ``Hugo was bad, but this was terrible,'' she said. ``It's going
to take a while for this country to get back up again.''
	   About 22,000 people sought safety in hurricane shelters on the
island at the peak of the storm late Monday. The number was rising
in some areas and shrinking slowly in others, as people returned to
survey the damage.
	   As rains subsided, residents began pulling downed trees from
neighbors' cars and offering homes to stranded relatives.
	   Near the town of Las Piedras, a volunteer on a bicycle waved
cars away as Electric Power Authority crews lifted downed cables
from Highway 30. Electric company officials warned it could take
more than a month to restore electricity to all areas.
	   Roads were blocked and some stores were looted, but police said
such break-ins were few. Hundreds of volunteers worked at shelters
set up in schools.
	   In Humacao, Melinda Lanier shared a can of potato chips with
three nephews before taking them home to San Juan. Their parents
were staying behind to salvage furniture from their home, which had
lost part of its roof.
	   ``As soon as we knew it was coming, (relatives) all called
around to touch base,'' said Lanier. ``You lend a hand, because you
know next year it could be you.''

Manila strikes back, threatens to ban Hollywood actress Claire
</HEADLINE>
Danes

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The city of Manila is considering a
ban on all movies featuring Hollywood actress Claire Danes because
of remarks about the city she made to two U.S. magazines, officials
said Wednesday.
	   ``She painted a surreal picture of Manila,'' said Manila
councilor Kim Atienza.
	   The Manila city council is to discuss a resolution sponsored by
Atienza to ban her movies when it meets next Tuesday.
	   Atienza, the son of Manila's mayor, said councilors had
dismissed comments she made in Vogue magazine in April describing
Manila as a ``ghastly and weird city'' as ``mere irresponsible
statements of youth.''
	   But he said the actress went ``overboard'' in a recent interview
with Premiere magazine by saying Manila ``smelled of cockroaches,
with rats all over and that there is no sewerage system and the
people do not have anything _ no arms, no legs, no eyes.''
	   ``Those are irresponsible, bigoted and sweeping statements that
we cannot accept,'' Atienza said in a telephone interview.
	   Danes, who appeared in the movies ``Romeo and Juliet,'' ``Little
Women,'' and ``The Rainmaker,'' was in Manila for several weeks
early this year to shoot scenes for the movie ``Brokedown Palace.''
Most of the sequences shot in Manila were done inside a dilapidated
psychiatric hospital.
	   ``Didn't she know that what she saw there is not representative
of Manila,'' Atienza said. ``Manila is a big city with wonderful
sights.''
	   ``We cannot stop her from coming back because that is a
diplomatic decision,'' he said. ``But we can stop theaters in
Manila from showing her films.''
	   Columnists in several Manila newspapers also lambasted Danes'
remarks.
	   ``Such ugly words against other people and places from such a
beautiful face. They just don't jibe,'' Ricardo Lo wrote in the
Philippine Star.
	   Jun Juban, a producer of the Philippine portion of Brokedown
Palace, was quoted in a newspaper as saying, ``I cannot apologize
for Ms. Danes' acerbic tongue. I can only hope she chokes on it.''

Hanwha fails to sell dlrs 874 million power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hanwha Energy Co. said Wednesday it
has scrapped a plan to sell a thermal power plant to AES Corp. of
the United States for dlrs 874 million.
	   AES agreed in principle in May to take over the 1,500-megawatt
plant in South Korea, but Hanwha said the deal foundered as the two
firms negotiated details of the sale.
	   Hanwha said it would try to find a new buyer.
	   Located in Inchon port just west of Seoul, the power plant
generated dlrs 246 million worth of electricity last year for a net
profit of dlrs 14.6 million. It provides 4 percent of South Korea's
total electricity demands.
	   Hanwha Energy is a subsidiary of the Hanwha group, South Korea's
eighth largest conglomerate. Its 27 affiliates are engaged in
businesses ranging from petrochemical, machinery to trading.
	   Arlington, Va.-based AES is one of the largest independent power
plant operators in the world.

Gadhafi meets representative of British Lockerbie families
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A representative of British families of the
victims of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet, has met with Moammar
Gadhafi and expressed support for the Libyan leader's position on
how Libyan suspects should be tried.
	   State-run Libyan television said that Jim Swire and other
British families ``stood in the same trench with Libya, supported
its stance, and praised Libyan readiness'' to allow the suspects to
stand trial in the Netherlands, the state-run television said.
	   The broadcast was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London.
	   Libya has agreed in principle to accept a U.S.-British
compromise that the suspects be tried in the Netherlands by
Scottish judges under Scottish law. But Gadhafi has demanded
guarantees for the legal rights and safety of the men.
	   Britain and the United States _ which initially demanded a trial
on their own soil _ have said the offer is not negotiable. But they
have expressed some willingness to discuss details through U.N.
officials.
	   Libyan television said the meeting Tuesday in Tripoli also was
attended by Robert Black, a law professor at Edinburgh University
in Scotland who is involved in preparing the suspects' defense.
	   The broadcast quoted an unnamed spokesman for Black as saying
that Libya emphasized that it was not a party to the
British-Netherlands agreement, which sets out the terms for the
trial, and did not consider it legally binding on Tripoli.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying
``Libya accepts a trial in a third country if that country would be
the last point and not a transit point.''
	   The U.S.-British proposal calls for the Libyan suspects, if
convicted, to serve their prison time in Britain. Libya has said
they should serve any sentence in Libya.
	   The bombing of the Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions in 1992 to try to force
Gadhafi to hand over the suspects for trial. The sanctions ban air
travel to and from Libya, freeze foreign assets and bar the sale of
some oil equipment.
	   The U.N. Security Council has passed a resolution saying that
the sanctions will be lifted when the suspects are turned over for
trial in the Netherlands.

Anti-India group to discuss Kashmir in New York
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 11th graf with Vajpayee reportedly saying India and
Pakistan prepared to restart talks. EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By QAISER MIRZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A Kashmiri leader opposed to Indian rule
in his troubled region was allowed to fly to New York to discuss
the issue with officials from Islamic countries, his aides said
Wednesday.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
nations gained independence from Britain in 1947. Kashmir is
divided between them, two-thirds in India and a third in Pakistan.
	   Umer Farooq left late Tuesday from the airport in Srinagar,
summer capital of Indian-held Kashmir. Last year and the year
before, Indian security had stopped Farooq at the airport when he
tried to make similar trips to attend meetings on the sidelines of
the opening of the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Farooq is a prominent member of a coalition of Kashmiri groups
that advocate either independence or merger with neighboring,
officially Islamic Pakistan for Indian-held Kashmir, the only
Muslim-majority state in predominately Hindu India.
	   Other coalition leaders were scheduled to leave Wednesday to
join Farooq in New York.
	   On the eve of his departure, Farooq told The Associated Press he
planned to talk Sept. 28 with members of a committee on Kashmir
formed by the Muslim world's main group, the Organization of the
Islamic Conference. He also planned to participate in an Oct. 1
meeting of foreign ministers from Islamic countries, and hoped to
meet with world leaders, including Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, in New York for the General Assembly session.
	   ``We'll tell them about what's going on in Kashmir, the killing
of people ... the excesses of the security forces,'' Farooq said.
``The people of Kashmir are being killed and beaten.''
	   Indian security forces have repeatedly been accused of violating
human rights as they try to crush a separatist war that has been
raging in Kashmir since 1989.
	   Farooq's coalition has called for a peaceful solution. Farooq
says Kashmiris should be allowed to vote on whether to join
Pakistan, become independent or stay with India.
	   Kashmir was expected to be the central topic Wednesday at a
lunch meeting of Sharif and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee. The lunch will be the second meeting since their
tit-for-tat nuclear weapons tests in May drew the world's attention
to their long-standing hostility.
	   Vajpayee told reporters traveling with him to New York Wednesday
that India and Pakistan were ready to restart peace talks that
broke down last September over Kashmir, Press Trust of India news
service reported.
	   But Farooq was not hopeful.
	   ``They have met like this in the past, but the talks were
meaningless and they were not fruitful,'' Farooq said. ``They have
never been fruitful.''
	   Pakistan has called for international mediation to help break
the deadlock over Kashmir. India resists any outside intervention.

Alarming increase in wild elephant killings in Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan conservationists are
worried about an alarming rise in the number of elephants killed.
	   In the past six weeks, 20 elephants died of gunshot wounds
inflicted by poachers and farmers.
	   ``We only have three vets. It's impossible for us to rush
assistance to the dying elephants since it takes days and weeks to
save one elephant,'' said Nandana Atapattu, Deputy Director of the
Department of Wildlife Conservation, on Wednesday.
	   Most of the elephants were killed in the eastern district of
Polonnaruwa and in wild areas of the central Anuradhapura district
after suffering for several days. They were shot by farmers using
old muzzle loading rifles and shotguns after they strayed into rice
paddy and corn fields in search of food, Atapattu said.
	   There are less than 2,000 elephants left in Sri Lanka.

Japanese minister: Japan determined to restore its economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Japan is determined to restore health to its
economy ``within the next couple of years,'' said Japanese Minister
of International Trade and Industry Kaoru Yosano on Wednesday.
	   Delivering a public lecture in Singapore while on the last leg
of three-nation Southeast Asia tour, Yosano said that rebuilding
the Japanese economy has a ``direct bearing on Asian economic
recovery.''
	   Struggling Asian countries have joined more economically robust
industrialized nations to call on Japan to take urgent action to
reverse its slump and help pull the region out of its economic
malaise.
	   Yosano said the Japanese government ``will restore financial
stability very soon,'' but didn't unveil any new initiatives to
speed the process along.
	   There is some disagreement in Tokyo over how to stimulate the
economy. Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's compromise with
opposition parties last week on ways to deal with the piles of bad
debt at banks appears increasingly fragile.
	   Japanese stocks rebounded Tuesday on hopes that Obuchi might
pledge more aggressive measures to stimulate the Japanese economy
in talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, but no such
announcements emerged from their meeting later that day.
	   Japanese stock markets were closed Wednesday for a national
holiday.
	   Yosano summarized some of the recent measures adopted by the
Japanese government to jumpstart the economy, including tax cuts
and other economic measures.
	   ``This domestic-led economic recovery will help restore the
Asian economies by providing them with the stable market
indispensable for growth,'' he said.
	   Yosano noted that strengthening Japan's financial system through
reform will enable Japanese banks to increase the amount of capital
they can make available to their Asian neighbors. He said Japanese
lending in Asia totals a significant dlrs 274 billion.
	   He added that Japan is now boosting its aid to Southeast Asia,
and will create a ``comprehensive policy package'' to combat the
problems delaying recovery in the region.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Troops blocked buses carrying students
as they neared the Parliament Wednesday to stage an anti-government
protest.
	   A huge traffic jam ensued after a line of soldiers stopped five
buses and other vehicles on a toll road about 100 meters (yards)
from the legislature in central Jakarta.
	   The students sat in the buses or climbed upon their roofs
chanting slogans and waving banners and flags.
	   In the second city Medan as many as 700 students, workers and
farmers staged separate protests Wednesday.
	   Shops in the city, on the island of Sumatra, were shut. However,
rumors that the protests could turn violent proved unfounded.
	   There were no reports of arrest or injuries.
	   Wednesday's demonstrations in both cities are the latest in a
series aimed against the government of President B.J. Habibie,
which is struggling to cope with the worst economic crisis in 30
years.
	   Most of the protests are against soaring prices and mass
unemployment which has brought misery to millions of Indonesians.

Dozens of people poisoned after eating stolen chicken feed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Up to 40 people, including 14 children, have been
hospitalized with poisoning after they seasoned their food with an
additive stolen from a poultry farm, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The highly-concentrated mixture of vegetable oil and vitamins is
used in tiny doses _ several grams (hundredths of ounces) per ton
of chicken feed.
	   Thieves stole 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of the mixture 10 days
ago and sold it to residents in the Siberian city of Omsk as
ordinary vegetable oil. The unsuspecting buyers then used it
liberally on their food.
	   When victims began turning up at hospitals, it took doctors
several days to figure out what caused the poisoning, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Local police have arrested several people suspected of the theft
and confiscated some 60 kilograms (132 pounds) of the substance,
officials said.
	   ``We are very concerned about the future consequences ...
because 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of the mixture are still
missing,'' said Yuri Kiryukhin, a local prosecutor in charge of the
investigation.

New tuberculosis cases in Japan rise for first time since 1960
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The number of new cases of tuberculosis in Japan
has risen for the first time in nearly 40 years in an alarming sign
of the disease's stealthy resurgence, a report said Wednesday.
	   A Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare study found the number
of patients newly diagnosed with the infectious lung disease
totaled 42,715 last year, up 243 from the previous year, the
Yomiuri newspaper reported.
	   Health Ministry officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Japan's per capita tuberculosis infection ratio reached 33.9 per
100,000 people in 1997, up 0.2 from a year earlier and the first
increase since 1954, said the paper, the nation's largest daily.
	   That figure is among the highest for leading industrialized
nations, it said, noting the infection ratio per 100,000 people is
7.9 in the United States, 10.7 in Britain and 16.0 in Germany.
	   Tuberculosis was Japan's No. 1 cause of death as recently as
1950. After peaking at 560,000 in 1951, the number of tuberculosis
cases has gradually declined.

Aga Khan discusses financial aid with Tajikistan government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Aga Khan, spiritual leader of the world's
Ismaili Muslim community, met with Tajikistan's political leaders
Wednesday for talks on financial aid to the impoverished Central
Asian nation.
	   The Aga Khan held discussions with Prime Minister Yakhye Azimov
in the morning and also planned to confer with President Emomali
Rakhmonov.
	   The talks were expected to focus on possible aid for education
and transportation in Tajikistan, a mostly Muslim nation that is
still recovering from a 5-year-civil war that officially ended last
year.
	   Rakhmonov's secular, hard-line government has brought former
rebel fighters into the government. But there are still political
tensions, and sporadic military clashes.

Myanmar troops abduct 27 Thais, release them after negotiation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Twenty-seven Thais, including police
officers and soldiers, were abducted by Myanmar troops but released
after negotiations with Thai officials, a Thai military officer
said Wednesday.
	   The abduction early Tuesday morning was a result of a business
conflict between local people and the Burmese troops, said the army
officer who monitors the Thai-Myanmar border in Kanchanaburi
province, 110 kilometers (68 miles) west of Bangkok.
	   The border between the two nations, which have a long history of
mistrust, is not clearly delineated. Myanmar is also known as
Burma.
	   Among those held were seventeen local residents and ten police
and military personnel. They were forced at gun point to cross over
to the Myanmar side, The Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The newspaper reported that the Sangkha Buri district chief
helped secured their release after half an hour of negotiations
with the Burmese soldiers.
	   Thai military commanders from the Suranee Task Force were
meeting with local Myanmar commanders Wednesday to clear the air
about the incident, said the officer who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

Meciar promises fair elections as Slovak campaign ends
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar
promised that this week's parliamentary elections would be free and
fair, and accused the opposition of trying to alarm voters by
warning of fraud.
	   At a final rally before the campaign officially ended on
Wednesday, Meciar said a victory by his ruling Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) would ensure stability for the central
European country.
	   Speaking in a sports arena in the capital Bratislava on Tuesday
night, he said the opposition ``is merely sowing hatred, mistrust
and insecurity among the people.''
	   He told his 4,000 supporters that HZDS will win the
Friday-Saturday vote. But there is growing evidence that Meciar's
party could be knocked out of power after ruling for virtually the
entire time since Slovakia gained independence in 1993.
	   The hall was only two-thirds filled, and opposition momentum was
evident at a bigger rally across town where Meciar's opponents were
making bold predictions of victory.
	   The Slovak Democratic Coalition, a grouping of five opposition
parties which is running a close second to the ruling party in the
polls, drew 7,000 to 10,000 people to listen to speeches by actors,
athletes and politicians.
	   The opposition's high hopes are based on the fact that while the
HZDS is favored to win the most votes, it is expected to fall well
short of a majority and has limited prospects of putting together a
coalition with more than half the 150 parliamentary deputies.
	   ``Even if we do not win, the opposition altogether will have
more support than Meciar,'' said Eduard Kukan, one of the Slovak
Democratic Coalition's five leaders, predicting a strong 28 percent
showing.
	   The party's leader and potentially Slovakia's next prime
minister, Mikulas Dzurinda, was more definitive.
	   ``We will win,'' he told the rally at National Uprising Square.
	   Former President Michal Kovac joined the opposition leaders on
stage. Meciar has assumed most of his powers since his term ended
March 2, with parliament deadlocked on electing a successor. Kovac
said he would not refuse an opposition offer to seek the post
again.
	   Election campaigning was barred after Wednesday afternoon,
leaving a 48-hour break before polls open at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT)
Friday.
	   More than 200 foreign observers are in Slovakia to determine
whether the balloting is fair.
	   Meciar said the army will help ensure order, as it did in the
last elections in 1994.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen keeps pressure on opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ As Cambodia prepared for the
convening of parliament, strongman Hun Sen on Wednesday kept up the
pressure on his political opponents by warning that junior
opposition leader Sam Rainsy could soon face arrest.
	   Hun Sen told reporters that a prosecutor's investigation against
Sam Rainsy will continue even if the outspoken politician is sworn
in as a member of parliament when the National Assembly opens in
this northwestern town on Thursday.
	   Under Cambodian law, serving members of parliament are usually
immune from criminal prosecution. Hun Sen did not offer a clear
explanation of how or why this could be sidestepped.
	   ``This is a penal case, not a political one,'' he said.
	   The government threatened to arrest Sam Rainsy after a Sept. 7
grenade attack on Hun Sen's Phnom Penh residence, causing the
opposition leader to seek refuge at a United Nations office in the
capital.
	   A foreign travel ban was also imposed on elected opposition
members of parliament after the attack, which occurred while Hun
Sen was outside the capital.
	   The opposition charged that Hun Sen staged the attack as an
excuse to stamp out ongoing anti-government demonstrations.
	   Referring to Sam Rainsy's speeches during the protests _ which
included a rhetorical call for the United States to fire cruise
missiles at Hun Sen's heavily-fortified compound outside the
capital _ Hun Sen said Wednesday he believed Sam Rainsy could still
be charged by the court.
	   Law enforcement in Cambodian is heavily influenced by politics,
and both police and the courts do the government's bidding rather
than act independently.
	   Hun Sen said if Sam Rainsy did not attend Thursday's assembly
opening, he believed the courts would soon take action against him
by serving an arrest warrant or a summons for questioning.
	   Hun Sen's party won a majority of seats in July 26 parliamentary
elections, but not the two-thirds necessary to form a government on
its own.
	   The opposition, protesting alleged election fraud, threatened to
boycott parliament, which would block the formation of a new
government.
	   Opposition protests were backed by street demonstrations in the
capital earlier this month, which were violently suppressed by
police. When protesters kept returning to the streets, the prospect
of a bloodbath caused opposition parties to agree to hold a summit
meeting with Hun Sen and to attend the opening of parliament.
	   At Tuesday's summit meeting hosted by King Norodom Sihanouk, Hun
Sen insisted that all outstanding opposition complaints could be
dealt with only after parliament began its work. He said that
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party must now negotiate with the ruling
party to form a coalition government.
	   ``They have only one choice, which is attending the meeting of
the National Assembly and joining a new government,'' Hun Sen said
Wednesday during a tour of the Angkor temple complex near Siem
Reap. ``If they are not going to accept it, the old government will
continue for five more years.''
	   Opposition leaders vowed Wednesday to take a stronger stand
towards Hun Sen once parliament opened.
	   ``After tomorrow we will be tougher,'' Sam Rainsy said.
``There's no way for him to continue indefinitely. If he does
something wrong, stages a coup, uses blatant threats, whatever he
achieves is completely destroyed. These are high stakes. He has to
be careful,'' Sam Rainsy said.

Military kills seven Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Naval gunboats attacked three Tamil
guerrilla boats near a rebel-controlled town in the northeast,
killing four rebels, military officials said Wednesday. Three other
rebels were killed in other incidents.
	   The rebels escaped with their casualties on their boats after
the incident Tuesday near Mullaittivu, 280 kilometers (175 miles)
northeast of Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital. The government
learned of the rebel deaths by monitoring of a rebel communication,
said Major Kumar Dewage, a military spokesman.
	   In other confrontations Tuesday, government soldiers ambushed
and killed two rebels in the jungles of northern Kilinochchi town,
275 kilometers (170 miles) north of Colombo. Another guerrilla was
killed by the military near the town of Kunchikulam.
	   The spokesman said there were no government casualties Tuesday.
There was no immediate comment by the rebels.
	   The guerrillas have been fighting for a separate homeland for
Tamil minority since 1983. They accuse the majority Sinhalese of
discriminating against them in education and jobs. Sri Lanka's 3.3
million Tamils comprise 18 percent of the island nation's
population.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the civil war.

Afghan diplomat: Saudi downgraded relations over bin Laden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ An Afghan diplomat said Wednesday
that Saudi Arabia apparently decided to downgrade ties with Kabul
because the Taliban militia was harboring Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden.
	   Bin Laden is wanted by American authorities for allegedly
directing attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last
month. The blasts killed 259 people, including 12 Americans, and
wounded thousands.
	   Saudi Arabia announced late Tuesday that it was expelling the
Afghan charge d'affaires and recalling its representative from
Kabul.
	   The official Saudi Press Agency said the Afghan envoy was
ordered to leave ``due to Saudi Arabia's national interests.'' It
did not elaborate.
	   The decision came a day before Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince
Abdullah was due to visit the United States, which has close
relations with this oil-rich Gulf state.
	   The Afghan charge, Mowlai Shihab Dilawar, told The Associated
Press on Wednesday that he has not been notified officially of the
decision but had heard about it from news reports.
	   ``I believe this decision was taken because of the presence in
Afghanistan of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden,'' Dilawar said.
	   Saudi Arabia is one of three countries that has recognized the
Taliban militia as the legitimate government in war-wracked
Afghanistan. The others are Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
	   The Taliban drove government forces from the capital Kabul in
1996 and now control about 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   Dilawar said the Taliban would do their best to restore
relations with Riyadh.
	   ``In spite of this decision, we still consider Saudi Arabia like
a sister country, and we will do all we can to improve relations
and bring them back to normal,'' Dilawar said.
	   He also said that the Taliban should not be held responsible for
bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan because he was there before
they took over.
	   Bin Laden first went to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight
alongside Afghan mujahedeen trying to oust a Soviet occupation
army.
	   Taliban officials have said bin Laden can stay in Afghanistan as
long as he wants, but they have prohibited him from talking to the
media and conducting political activities.
	   The Taliban said bin Laden could remain even if his presence
invited further U.S. missile strikes.
	   The United States fired Tomahawk cruise missiles into
Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the Aug. 7 embassy
bombings. In Afghanistan, the strikes targeted camps set up by bin
Laden.

Officers seize more than 53,000 pirated compact discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Customs officials have seized more than 53,000
pirated compact discs worth 1.2 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 156,000) during raids in a busy suburban shopping mall, the
government reported Wednesday.
	   Officials arrested 15 people, aged between 16 and 51, in raids
Tuesday on 16 shops, a statement said. They were later released on
bail of up to 5,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 650), it said.
	   The confiscated goods included music and video compact discs,
CD-ROMs, and video game cartridges, it said.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure, especially from
the United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. Washington has placed Hong Kong on a watch list of
countries suspected of copyright violations.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated compact discs or
CD-ROMs still thrive in Hong Kong. Copies of local or Hollywood
movies are widely available for under 40 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 5) _ sometimes before they're released in local cinemas.
	   Customs officials claim they have closed down all local
factories producing counterfeit discs after a new law requiring
optic disc factories to obtain a license came into effect last
month.
	   In April, officers of an anti-corruption agency seized 7 million
pirated discs and production equipment worth U.S. dlrs 83 million,
the biggest such seizure in the territory.

Malaysian police call in Anwar's wife for questioning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Anwar not appearing in court, wife going to
police headquarters; ADDS photo numbers

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Authorities ordered the wife of
ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim to appear at police
headquarters for questioning Wednesday.
	   Azizah Ismail was handed the order by plainclothes police
officers from the criminal investigation department, the aide said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   After several days of upheaval, Malaysia was heading into a
period of uncertainty, with Anwar out of sight, many of his allies
in prison and his wife increasingly under fire from police.
	   Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, meanwhile, was winding up her
trip to Kuala Lumpur, without making any public statements about
the political troubles in the former colony.
	   Before answering her summons, Azizah rushed to a Kuala Lumpur
courthouse after hearing unconfirmed reports that her husband was
being brought there. Anwar faces charges ranging from disturbing
public order to sexual misconduct, including the crime of sodomy.
	   But she left dejected.
	   ``The police have told me that my husband won't be charged in
court today,'' she said as she drove off. Hundreds of Anwar's
supporters outside the courthouse shouted ``Allah O' Akbar'' or
``God is Great.''
	   Anwar's defense attorneys waiting inside were incensed by the
stalling tactics of the police. ``We don't see the need for this
cat-and-mouse game. It is common courtesy to tell the lawyers if
they are going to book him,'' said Zainul Zachariah, one of Anwar's
lawyers.
	   Anwar's wife, who has spent most of her time inside the family's
home with the couple's six children, was also being investigated
for allegedly making seditious statements. She alleged that police
may be planning to inject her husband, arrested Sunday, with the
HIV virus.
	   ``We called her to Bukit Aman to clarify certain things, not to
detain her,'' said Yaacob Mohamed Amin, the director of the
criminal investigation department. Bukit Aman, or the ``Hill of
Peace,'' is the name of Malaysia's police headquarters.
	   He said issuing such a summons was the normal procedure.
	   On Tuesday, a senior government official said Anwar will face a
dozen sex-related charges in court by the weekend.
	   Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Mohd. Ghazali called on
Malaysians, confused by the political events of the past three
weeks, to have faith in the judicial system.
	   ``Allow the legal proceedings to commence,'' he told reporters
late Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he personally interviewed
people who said they engaged in illegal sex acts with his ousted
deputy. Mahathir, who fired Anwar as his deputy and finance
minister on Sept. 2, said the allegations were so vile he decided
to question people himself.
	   Anwar, 51, has adamantly denied all the charges against him. He
says trouble started when he began questioning Mahathir's policies
and challenged his 17-year-rule.
	   Since his ouster, tens of thousands of supporters have
demonstrated at rallies throughout the country. Many supporters are
from the conservative Islamic party he founded during his student
days and they do not believe the government's sexual misconduct
allegations.
	   Tajol Rosli said Anwar would have been charged in criminal court
Monday, but thousands of his supporters surrounded the courthouse,
forcing police to postpone the hearing.
	   Police drove marchers away from the prime minister's residence
Sunday night in what was the first violent clash between police and
demonstrators in this Southeast Asian country in a decade.
	   Late Tuesday, the government disclosed that Anwar, arrested
under a colonial security law that allows imprisonment without
trial, was being held at Kuala Lumpur's police headquarters.
	   Eleven of his associates have also been detained under the
Internal Security Act and more than 100 supporters were detained
during the courthouse rally Monday.
	   One of them, Mohamad Ahmad, a former aide, was freed Tuesday by
a city magistrate.

Philippine government braces for shutdown of Asia's oldest airline

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Scores of Philippine Airlines
workers, many dressed in black, held an hour-long prayer vigil at
Manila's airport Wednesday, hoping for a way to avoid the flag
carrier's scheduled midnight closure.
	   The government, meanwhile, struggled to prepare for the
shutdown's impact on the country's already ailing economy.
	   The expected demise of Asia's oldest airline has saddened many
Filipinos. Several television stations broadcast poignant scenes
Wednesday from its 57-year history.
	   The PAL workers lined up during their lunch break in front of
the domestic terminal with signs reading ``Keep PAL flying,'' and
prayed for an hour.
	   Inside the cockpit of a PAL plane about to take off, Capt. John
Gonzaga said he still had hope, but added, ``We're quite
apprehensive about our future.''
	   President Joseph Estrada's spokesman, Jerry Barican, said the
government had abandoned a last-ditch plan to provide a 1.5 billion
peso (dlrs 33.7 million) loan to the cash-strapped carrier, and is
now focusing on ways to deal with the potentially disastrous
effects of its shutdown.
	   ``It's too late. PAL as PAL will cease at midnight today,''
Barican said. ``What we're attempting to do is to try to minimize
the losses.''
	   Estrada was scheduled to meet PAL chairman Lucio Tan later
Wednesday in a final attempt to halt the closure, a PAL official
said. The president has tried but failed several times to convince
Tan and the airline's unions to settle their differences.
	   Ground workers of the airline voted Tuesday to reject a
management-proposed recovery plan, dashing a government effort to
avoid the company's shutdown.
	   Government labor officials had gone directly to PAL's workers
through a referendum to see if they supported the plan, which union
leaders had earlier rejected.
	   PAL says the plan is a prerequisite for it to recover from a
series of crippling strikes and Asia's currency crisis.
	   The airline announced last week that it would close at midnight
Wednesday as a result of the unions' rejection of the rescue plan.
	   In the plan, Tan offered workers 20 percent of the airline's
stock and three seats on its board in exchange for a 10-year
suspension of their collective bargaining agreement.
	   Tan owns about 70 percent of PAL's stock, while the government
holds an estimated 18 percent. Estrada also offered one of four
government board seats to the workers, but union leaders continued
to reject the rescue plan.
	   PAL vice president Manolo Aquino said creditors, to whom PAL
owes about dlrs 2.1 billion, are insisting on guarantees of labor
harmony before they approve a restructuring plan.
	   Barican said the government plans to tap smaller airlines and
private and air force planes to serve 14 domestic routes critical
to trade and commerce. Officials also were exploring possible ways
for the government to operate some of PAL's planes on those routes.
	   ``If domestic flights are interrupted for a long time, it can
have very serious consequences for the economy,'' Barican said.
	   He said the government was not as worried about international
travel because of the presence of foreign carriers, which are
banned from serving domestic routes.
	   PAL currently has a 50 percent share of domestic passenger
traffic, down from 75 percent before a pilots' strike in June.
	   PAL's closure would leave many areas of the sprawling
archipelago of 7,000 islands without air service. Two smaller
carriers were grounded last week over safety concerns and financial
problems.
	   The only alternative for travel among the country's islands is
slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries. Last Friday, a ferry carrying
454 people sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila.
	   If PAL closes, it would be the largest company to fail in the
Philippines since Asia's currency crisis, which hit just as the
airline was launching a dlrs 4 billion expansion and refleeting
plan.
	   Barican said PAL's closure should serve as a lesson on the need
for management and labor to work harmoniously together, something
which has eluded PAL for years.
	   ``It's sad that a national symbol, an institution is going
under. But we have to run these symbols substantially well because
if not, they will not last long,'' he said.

South African troops meet unexpected resistance in Lesotho

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African troops tried to mop up
stubborn resistance near a Lesotho military compound Wednesday
while soldiers from Botswana fanned out in the kingdom's gutted
capital to stop looting.
	   As scattered gunfire echoed through the capital, Botswanan
soldiers shooed looters away from wrecked shops. Many stores were
still smoldering from fires set on Tuesday, the day 600 South
African troops crossed the border to quell a military uprising.
	   At the Makoanyne barracks northeast of Maseru, where 10 South
African soldiers were slain Tuesday during a South African
helicopter and infantry assault, dawn Wednesday was punctuated by
bursts of machine-gun fire from a mountain overlooking the
compound. Lesotho soldiers opposing the intervention have been
holed up on the mountain and have surprised the South Africans with
their fierce resistance.
	   Overnight, mortar rounds crashing into the compound from the
mountain, sending South African soldiers scurrying for protection
in their armored personnel carriers.
	   South African media reported that both the Lesotho government
and the opposition said they were ready to negotiate an end the
crisis. However, it was not immediately clear Wednesday if senior
Lesotho government ministers were still in the country.
	   The intervention came at the request of Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili after a revolt by junior military officers from the
Lesotho Defense Force and amid opposition strikes that paralyzed
Maseru. Some of the ousted military leaders fled the country. The
remaining military appeared to be siding with an opposition
movement that claims elections last May _ swept by the ruling
Lesotho Congress Party _ were rigged.
	   South African troops were distributing fliers telling the people
of this Belgium-sized country that their intervention, on behalf of
the Southern African Development Community, was aimed at preventing
``anarchy'' and to ``create a stable environment for law and
order.''
	   However, the intervention triggered widespread arson and looting
of stores _ many of them South African-owned _ in the capital. With
the South African soldiers busy fighting Lesotho's troops, there
was no one to stop the outbreak of chaos in the streets.
	   Many of Lesotho's 2 million residents see the South Africans as
an invading force.
	   Michael Mohale, a resident of the capital, noted that South
Africa opposed military intervention in the Congo war. As he
watched a convoy of South African armored personnel carriers rumble
through Maseru, he said: ``We're a small country, so they just came
right in and didn't bother to keep a policy on no military
intervention.''
	   As the convoy growled past shattered and gutted stores, several
women jeered and pointed toward the border on the edge of town.
	   ``Go home,'' the women shouted.
	   Under President Nelson Mandela, South Africa has promoted
nonintervention throughout Africa.
	   The decision to send troops into Lesotho unleashed biting
criticism from South African opposition parties, churches and
civilian groups.
	   South Africa's first military intervention since the end of
apartheid in 1994 was quickly proving costly. South African news
media reported the total death toll, from soldiers, rebels and
civilians, was between 30 and 50.
	   A senior South African officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the force lacked troops and proper equipment to
handle the stiff resistance.
	   Combined task force spokesman Maj. Ben van Zyl said the South
African force could not achieve its objectives on the first day.
	   Botswana initially sent 200 of its troops for the intervention.

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hurricane Georges brought its
violent winds and rains to Haiti on Wednesday, prompting residents
to race for shelter ahead of the flash floods and landslides that
were sure to roar down the eroded mountains of this impoverished
Caribbean nation.
	   Huge waves swamped the seaside boulevard in the northern city of
Cap-Haitien, and tin roofs flew off homes.
	   ``We're scared a little, but we have a lot of faith,'' said
Port-au-Prince supermarket clerk Nadine Augustin, 19. Like most
Haitians, her family had done little to prepare for the storm that
was barreling in from the neighboring Dominican Republic.
	   At 2 a.m. (0600 GMT), Hurricane Georges was centered 45 miles
(72 kilometers) north-northwest of Port-au-Prince. It was moving
northwest near 14 mph (223 kph) and was headed for the Windward
Passage separating Haiti from Cuba.
	   Georges' winds dropped from 110 mph (177 kph) Tuesday to near 75
mph (120 kph) Wednesday as the hurricane moved across the island of
Hispaniola, but it was expected to strengthen over open water.
	   The mammoth storm was on a trajectory that could send it
crashing into the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday.
Authorities urged tourists to leave the island chain, and residents
began boarding up windows in anticipation of Georges' fury.
	   Authorities in eastern Cuba, the Turks and Caicos and the
Bahamas also went on alert.
	   In Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, few
people had means to prepare for the impending disaster. The Haitian
government was able to muster only dlrs 130,000 for emergency
assistance, said civil defense spokeswoman Yolaine Surena.
	   Mountain erosion and a lack of maintenance have left drainage
systems in Haitian cities choked with silt and unable to alleviate
flash floods, said meteorologist Renan Jean-Louis.
	   In November 1994, tropical storm Gordon killed at least 1,000 in
Haiti's southern provinces, drowning them in torrential streams or
burying them in mudslides.
	   In the Dominican Republic, east of Haiti, soldiers enforced a
curfew in the capital of Santo Domingo Wednesday after Georges
ravaged the nation. At least 12 people were killed by the storm,
which also unleashed looting and street violence.
	   Looters waded waist-deep in water, balancing televisions and air
conditioners on their heads even as 110-mph (177-kph) winds toppled
trees and crushed houses. Bands of youths with machetes and pistols
roamed the streets, many of them drunk.
	   ``We are occupying Santo Domingo to prevent criminal acts, which
we see practically as acts of terrorism,'' said armed forces chief
Ruben Paulino Alvarez.
	   Of the 12 official deaths in the Dominican Republic _ Hurricane
Georges has killed at least 21 so far in its rampage across the
northern Caribbean _ two apparently were looters shot to death by
police.
	   Hurricane Georges caught Santo Domingo, on the south coast,
almost entirely unprepared Tuesday since forecasters had expected
it to hit the northern Dominican coast.
	   City officials didn't open shelters until hours after strong
winds and heavy bursts of rain had reached the capital. People
continued to stream into shelters even as the full force of Georges
hit.
	   Many residents were left in shock.
	   ``I guess I'm on the street,'' Jesus de Leon yelled over the
howl of the wind and the banging of loose roofing.
	   He braved the whipping rains to survey the twisted metal and
wood that had been his house.
	   Authorities said 80 percent of the roads in Santo Domingo were
impassable because of downed trees and power lines and widespread
flooding. One highway overpass normally 22 feet above ground was at
water level.
	   Some bands of youths used their machetes to hack away fallen
trees or to cut open fallen coconuts, but others threatened
passers-by, pulling open car doors.
	   Much of the Dominican countryside was incommunicado, and
authorities said it might take days before the full scope of the
damage was known.
	   President Bill Clinton has declared Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands a disaster area, releasing emergency aid.
	   Georges knocked out communications with the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Henry Laskowski, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in
San Juan, said roofs were blown off and trees were felled on St.
Croix, which is part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, but there were no
reports of fatalities.

Taiwan's jobless rate hits two-year high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's jobless rate in August rose to
3.05 percent, the highest level since 1996, the government said
Wednesday.
	   The rate was the fourth highest monthly figure in half a
century, it said.
	   But Chiang Pin-kun, head of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, said unemployment may drop because a government
package to stimulate the economy is expected to create 120,000
jobs.
	   The government has pledged to spend nearly 200 billion Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.8 billion) in public works projects over the
next two years to boost the economy that has suffered from falling
exports.
	   The Asian financial turmoil and new graduates seeking jobs
contributed to the rise in unemployment, the report said.
	   In August, the number of jobless totaled 292,000, up 12,000 from
July. Among them, 4,000 people lost their jobs due to company
closures or downsizing, according to the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics.
	   Because of the economic slowdown, many home appliances,
electronics and auto firms have laid off workers or cut wages.
	   Early this week, United Microelectronics Corp., one of Taiwan's
largest computer chip manufacturers, announced it will halt
construction of a U.S. dlrs 14.5 billion chip factory, the latest
of several chip companies to suspend planned investment.

Port authorities intercept 167 illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IRAKLEION, Greece (AP) _ Port police Wednesday apprehended 167
illegal immigrants aboard a Lebanese-flagged wooden boat off the
southeastern coast of Crete, authorities said.
	   The immigrants, including 80 children and 31 women, said the
20-meter (66-foot) vessel set sail from Lebanon five days ago and
was attempting to reach Italy, local media said.
	   The nationalities of the immigrants were not immediately known.
Greece is one of the main routes for Iraqi Kurds and others
attempting to sneak into the European Union.
	   Port authorities apprehended the immigrants shortly before they
attempted to leave the boat, police said.
	   The boat's four-member crew, all Lebanese, were due to be
formally charged later Wednesday.

Assistant U.S. trade representative visits Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Robert
Cassidy met with Taiwanese economics officials Wednesday during a
rare visit here by a U.S. official.
	   Cassidy held consultations with Economics Minister Wang
Chih-kang in the afternoon, the ministry said. A spokesman declined
to comment on what they discussed.
	   Taiwan's application to join the World Trade Organization,
intellectual property rights protection, and the Asia Pacific
region's economic crisis topped Cassidy's agenda, said Susan Stahl,
spokeswoman for the American Institute in Taiwan which handles
relations in the absence of diplomatic ties.
	   She called Cassidy's visit a ``regular consultation.'
	   Cassidy inked an agreement with Wang in August endorsing
Taiwan's entry into the WTO, which has been a primary goal for the
diplomatically isolated island. Taiwan's application is now being
handed over to the organization's secretariat for vetting, but it
faces a potential hurdle due to opposition from China, which
objects to the island joining before it does.
	   As is routine with U.S. officials visiting Taiwan, Cassidy is
keeping a low profile during his trip to avoid riling China, with
whom Washington maintains diplomatic relations.
	   Beijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan, and strongly opposes
exchanges with the island by upper level officials from countries
with whom it has diplomatic ties.

Israel eases closure of West Bank and Gaza Strip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army eased its closure of the
Palestinian areas slightly on Wednesday after sealing them for four
days over the Jewish New Year holiday.
	   A total of 23,000 Palestinian workers and business people were
allowed into Israel on Wednesday morning, Israel army radio
reported.
	   A blanket closure was clamped on the West Bank and Gaza Strip on
Sept. 12 for fear of retaliatory attacks by the Islamic militant
group Hamas after Israel killed two fugitives of the group.
	   The restrictions were then eased briefly, but the blanket
closure was restored on the eve of the Jewish New Year.

Philippine government partially suspends operations of owner of
</HEADLINE>
sunken ferry

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The owner of a ferry that sank last
week, killing at least 43 people, has been ordered to halt its
operation of seven vessels with a similar design, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Maritime officials said they ordered the preventive suspension
of the passenger-cargo ships operated by Sulpicio Lines while they
are inspected to ensure their seaworthiness and the competence of
their crews to prevent a repeat of Friday's accident.
	   Forty-eight people are still missing from the sinking of the
Princess of the Orient, while at least 363 of the 454 people aboard
survived.
	   The ship sank in a tropical storm several hours after leaving
Manila for Cebu in the central Philippines.
	   Survivors said the ship listed toward its left in strong waves
and quickly sank.
	   Investigators say the ship was carrying a heavy cargo which may
have been improperly secured and shifted in the heavy waves,
causing the ship to tilt.
	   Sulpicio Lines has a total of 32 ships. It also owned the Dona
Paz, a ferry which collided with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in
the world's worst peacetime shipping disaster. A year later, 250
people died in the sinking of another ship owned by the company,
the Dona Marilyn.
	   Meanwhile, search teams continued to scour the area of the
accident outside Manila Bay for more survivors or bodies of missing
passengers and crew.
	   Some relatives of the missing gathered at a beach resort in the
town of Naic in Cavite province south of Manila as navy ships and
small fishing boats searched the waters.
	   Four people were rescued on Tuesday from a small island but
there were no further reports of survivors there.

Newcombe hopes for strong performance in World Group qualifying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ Australian captain John Newcombe
said his Davis Cup tennis team will be looking for redemption when
it takes on Uzbekistan this weekend in a World Group qualifying
match.
	   The Australians, led by U.S. Open champion Pat Rafter, will try
to overcome its 3-2 home loss to Zimbabwe in Mildura, Victoria in
April which sent them crashing back to qualifying.
	   A loss to Uzbekistan, whose two singles players are both ranked
in the 200s, would push Australia out of the World Group for just
the second time. In 1995, Australia was beaten 3-2 by Hungary on
clay at Budapest.
	   Newcombe said the Australians had learned a similar lesson out
of both experiences _ that you must bounce back, and quickly.
	   In the two years following the loss to Hungary, Australia fought
its way back to a Davis Cup semifinal against the United States.
	   ``I think it's in the back of everybody's mind,'' Newcombe said
Wednesday of the first-round loss to Zimbabwe.
	   ``We have to redeem ourselves, we have to do the job, there's no
escaping that. The challenge is there and we have to face it head
on.
	   ``After we lost to Hungary, we were bums and everybody thought
we were no good and we bounced back and had probably the two best
years that Australian tennis has seen for ages.
	   ``And now we've lost to Zimbabwe and we're doing pretty damn
good at the moment. Maybe these things get everyone to really put
their heads down and prove themselves.''
	   Part of Australia's comeback plan is to dodge the controversy
over the availability of world No. 14 Mark Philippoussis, who lost
to Rafter in this year's U.S. Open final.
	   Tennis Australia president Geoff Pollard has banned the team
from making any comments on Philippoussis until the end of the
match.
	   When asked if he thought Philippoussis would be coming to
Townsville, Newcombe replied: ``No. If you want to talk about it on
Sunday, we'll talk about it then.''
	   Newcombe is also ensuring Rafter is at his best for the match by
limiting his media appearances to one interview after Thursday's
draw.
	   Rafter and Jason Stoltenberg will play singles, with their
likely opponents to be Oleg Ogorodov, ranked 226, and Vadim
Kutsenko, ranked 245.
	   Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde will play the doubles match,
with their opponents yet to be finalized.
	   Newcombe said Rafter had recovered from his U.S. Open victory
and was ready to take on a team which could not be underestimated.
	   ``The information we have is that Uzbekistan are very solid from
the back of the court,'' said Newcombe. ``They have solid
groundstrokes and they'll be swinging freely, so it will be up to
our boys to establish themselves in the first hour of each match.''
	   The matches are sold out, with almost 5,000 people expected to
pack into the Townsville Entertainment Center to watch Australia
play on the medium-fast hard court beginning Friday. (djp)

Chinese dissidents vow to defy party ban, appeal to Jospin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese democracy campaigners vowed Wednesday to
defy a government crackdown on a planned opposition party and urged
visiting French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to demand the release
of a detained party advocate.
	   Sixteen dissidents in two provinces asked Jospin in an open
letter to discuss freeing Tang Yuanjuan during his meetings with
Chinese leaders Thursday and Friday.
	   ``We hope, Mr. Prime Minister, that whether meeting high-level
leaders or talking trade, when principles of human rights and
economic interests conflict, please don't forget you come from the
birthplace of the Declaration of Human Rights,'' said the letter, a
copy of which was released by a Hong Kong-based human rights group.
	   Tang's arrest last Friday came amid renewed suppression of
supporters of the would-be China Democracy Party and carried
portents Communist Party leaders planned to ban the group outright.
	   Police in the northeastern city of Changchun accused Tang of
having contacts with an illegal organization. The accusations were
the first indication the China Democracy Party had been branded
unlawful since dissidents began trying to register the group in
late June.
	   Democracy campaigners in five provinces plus Beijing and
Shanghai have applied to register the party or held meetings to
organize applications. Police have detained at least 20 of them,
eight of them in the past week.
	   Dissidents preparing to launch the party in those seven areas
said in a statement that they and Tang had done nothing illegal but
were merely availing their constitutional rights.
	   If the authorities outlaw the group, ``dissidents everywhere
will not fear, but one after another will oppose dictatorial
violence and lead China toward an era of respect for human rights
and law,'' said the statement, released by the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China.
	   The current government clampdown has not been restricted to
China Democracy Party supporters. New York-based Human Rights in
China reported Wednesday that veteran democracy campaigner Jiang
Qisheng was taken away by police in Beijing Tuesday afternoon and
his whereabouts remain unknown.
	   Jiang and an elderly couple whose son was killed in the military
crackdown on Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrators in 1989 were
preparing to release a ``Declaration on Freedom and Civil Rights,''
Human Rights in China said.
	   Zhu Rui, a labor rights campaigner detained Saturday and
released Tuesday, was questioned exhaustively about the planned
declaration, the group reported.

IMF head says economic crisis won't hit Latin America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Latin America will not suffer the financial turmoil
that has engulfed Russia and Asia, the head of the International
Monetary Fund said in an interview published Wednesday.
	   ``Latin America won't fall,'' Michel Camdessus told Le Figaro, a
conservative French daily.
	   Camdessus also said although the economic trouble that has
plagued Asia and Russia was not over, he did not think the world
was headed for a recession.
	   ``The crisis is spreading, but I don't think despite the drop in
prices for raw materials and the recession in Japan that we are in
a free-fall scenario leading to worldwide deflation.''
	   Markets all over the world have been panicky in recent weeks,
with sharp swings up and down, in response to a number of factors,
including the Russian crisis and political uncertainty in many
countries.
	   Speaking on France's Europe-1 radio Wednesday, Camdessus
predicted that world growth would be about 2 percent in 1998 and
that next year could be a bit better.
	   ``We are not in 1928,'' Camdessus said, referring to the year
before the spectacular Wall Street crash. ``There will be growth
and not decline.''
	   Camdessus said the United States and Europe bore special
responsibility for helping the rest of the world.
	   He urged European governments not to use the current crisis as
an excuse to relax budgetary controls. He also called for greater
flexibility in European labor markets.
	   Camdessus said the U.S. and Europe should try to coordinate a
lowering of interest rates, something that could help promote
growth.
	   Camdessus told Le Figaro that he had recently met with Latin
American central bankers, who told him they planned to reinforce
the banking systems in their countries.
	   ``This method is the proper one and we will continue to support
it by all means. I therefore am certain that Latin America won't
fall,'' Camdessus said.
	   Concern has been mounting in recent weeks that the economic
downturn that has wreaked havoc with the economies of many Asian
countries and Russia would spread to Latin America.
	   Camdessus indicated a willingness to support Brazil and other
Latin American countries to try to avoid one.
	   ``We're helping them to transform their banking systems. If
needed, and if they ask us, we will bring out financial support,''
Camdessus said.
	   Addressing the Russia crisis, Camdessus called on the Russian
government to restore confidence in the economy, to work to
strengthen the ruble and to continue the fight against inflation.
	   The IMF will help Russia only ``if it brings proof of its will
to help itself.''
	   Turning to Asia, and Japan in particular, Camdessus said that
growth was necessary to turn the crisis around and that social and
banking systems needed to be reinforced.

Thai opposition plans to grill prime minister on tainted minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's main opposition party is
planning to question Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on why he has
retained three politicians accused of election fraud in his
coalition government and Cabinet, a party spokesman said Wednesday.
	   ``We would like to know what the government is going to do about
this,'' said Suraporn Danaitangtrakool, spokesman for the New
Aspiration Party led by former Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh.
	   He said the opposition would raise the issue in Parliament this
week.
	   The three politicians led a defection of 12 lawmakers from
Chavalit's government last November, giving Chuan a slim majority
in Parliament and propelling him to the prime minister's post.
	   Chuan and his Democrat Party have a reputation as being
generally more honest than their opposition counterparts and have
frequently complained about vote buying and other types of fraud
during elections.
	   The three politicians targeted by the NAP are Vatana Asavahame,
a deputy interior minister who has been denied entry to the United
States because of drug trafficking allegations; his son Poonpol,
who has been arrested for shooting a truck driver after a minor
traffic accident; and Sanit Kulcharoen.
	   Earlier this month, the Supreme Court, while ruling on a
complaint from a losing candidate, said that election fraud had
taken place in the three politicians' district in Samut Prakan, a
suburb of Bangkok.
	   The Court said evidence showed that there were 20,000 more
ballots cast during the November 1996 election than there were
eligible voters in the district.
	   The Court refused to remove the three candidates that won,
however, because it said Thailand's constitution did allow a new
election to be called in the district until 2000, and the Court did
not want to leave the people unrepresented.
	   After winning the 1996 election, the three lawmakers, who are
members of the Prachakaorn Thai (Thai Citizens) Party became
members of Chavalit's NAP-led government.
	   The NAP never questioned their honesty or electoral victory
during its tenure in power.

Russian government seeks additional aid from international lenders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's new government
sought foreign assistance in a series of meetings Wednesday with
international lenders, but Russia appeared unlikely to get
additional money anytime soon.
	   Primakov has been calling on foreign lenders to help Russia
through its current economic crisis, and he renewed his request in
discussions with the visiting head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
	   ``We favor expansion of the EBRD's operations in Russia,''
Primakov said at the start of talks with the bank's president Horst
Koehler.
	   Primakov acknowledged the depth of Russia's economic problems,
saying that the ``country is facing serious difficulties.''
	   The EBRD, established in 1991 to help countries in Eastern
Europe move toward market economies, has provided loans to a number
of Russian industries.
	   However, many private investors have fled Russia in recent
months, and foreign banks that bought billions of dollars of
government bonds have complained that they are being discriminated
against while the government tries to bail out Russian banks.
	   Other lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund, are
expected to delay installments on existing loans at least until the
new government details its plans for coping with the crisis. There
has been no serious talk of new loans to Russia by the IMF or
anyone else.
	   Primakov has been in office for 12 days and has yet to outline
his economic program. The new cabinet has not been filled, and the
country has been operating with an interim finance minister for the
past month.
	   Russian officials were also planning to hold separate talks with
a visiting IMF delegation, as well as discussions with Western
banks seeking better terms on debt restructuring deals.
	   Russia's banking system has been virtually paralyzed by the
crisis, which hit just over a month ago. Some banks remain closed,
while others are handling only limited transactions. Most
individual and corporate clients still cannot make routine payments
and transfers.
	   The foreign lenders are seeking assurances that Primakov's
government will continue free-market reforms, maintain control over
the money supply and offer foreign investors equal terms with
Russian companies and banks.
	   In other economic developments, the battered ruble strengthened
slightly on the Moscow currency exchange Wednesday, trading at
between 15 and 16 to the U.S. dollar, in comparison with 16 on
Tuesday. The ruble was trading at around six to the dollar before
the crisis.
	   Also, Russian oil production in August was 24.8 million tons,
1.9 percent lower than in the same month last year. Oil is a
leading Russian export, and sagging world prices have contributed
to the country's economic woes.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will reach its 1998 economic growth target
of 8 percent despite the worst floods in decades, declining state
industries and the impact of the Asian financial crisis, a senior
Chinese official insisted Tuesday.
	   The main cause for optimism appears to be the dlrs 1.2 trillion
the government expects the nation to invest annually in
infrastructure construction in 1998-2000 and a recent recovery in
retail sales.
	   ``Starting from August, the economy has shown obvious signs of a
recovery,'' Zeng Peiyan of the State Development Planning
Commission told reporters at a news conference.
	   By pumping money into construction projects, China intends to
overcome the negative impacts of the floods, a slowdown in export
growth and foreign investment, and the financial crisis afflicting
its state enterprises and banks.
	   Zeng pointed to an increase in fixed-asset investment of 17.4
percent in the first eight months of this year, and a 26.9 percent
surge in August as evidence that the government is fulfilling its
pledge to boost the economy.
	   China's gross domestic product grew 7 percent in the first half
of this year, compared with annual 8.8 percent growth in 1997.
While the economy is robust by the standards of China's
crisis-stricken neighbors, the slowdown has raised doubts the
government's growth target of 8 percent can be reached.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Scores of Philippine Airlines
workers, many dressed in black, held an hour-long prayer vigil at
Manila's airport Wednesday, hoping for a way to avoid the flag
carrier's scheduled midnight closure.
	   The government, meanwhile, struggled to prepare for the
shutdown's impact on the country's already ailing economy.
	   The expected demise of Asia's oldest airline has saddened many
Filipinos. Several television stations broadcast poignant scenes
Wednesday from its 57-year history.
	   The PAL workers lined up during their lunch break in front of
the domestic terminal with signs reading ``Keep PAL flying,'' and
prayed for an hour.
	   President Joseph Estrada's spokesman, Jerry Barican, said the
government had abandoned a last-ditch plan to provide a 1.5 billion
peso (dlrs 33.7 million) loan to the cash-strapped carrier, and is
now focusing on ways to deal with the potentially disastrous
effects of its shutdown.
	   Estrada was scheduled to meet PAL chairman Lucio Tan later
Wednesday in a final attempt to halt the closure, a PAL official
said. The president has tried but failed several times to convince
Tan and the airline's unions to settle their differences.
	   Ground workers of the airline voted Tuesday to reject a
management-proposed recovery plan, dashing a government effort to
avoid the company's shutdown.
	   ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The expected collapse of Philippine
Airlines does not pose a major risk to the country's banking system
because major lenders have already anticipated its impact, a
central bank official said Tuesday.
	   ``It will not have a major impact because some banks have
already made 100 percent provisions since last year,'' central bank
Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes said.
	   PAL was scheduled to close for good at midnight Tuesday after
the government's failure to broker a last-ditch agreement between
the management and workers.
	   It has failed to service its dlrs 2.1 billion in debts since
June, when it received a moratorium from the Securities and
Exchange Commission pending the submission of a rehabilitation
plan.
	   That moratorium was extended by the SEC on Monday until Nov. 20.
	   Of the total liabilities, domestic banks are owed dlrs 233
million in dollar-denominated loans, along with a further 1.2
billion pesos (dlrs 27 million) in peso loans.
	   This represents an estimated 0.7 percent of total loans in the
Philippine banking system.
	   The bulk of airline's debts, however, are owed to European and
American financial institutions.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Japan is determined to restore health to its
economy ``within the next couple of years,'' said Japanese Minister
of International Trade and Industry Kaoru Yosano on Wednesday.
	   Delivering a public lecture in Singapore while on the last leg
of three-nation Southeast Asia tour, Yosano said that rebuilding
the Japanese economy has a ``direct bearing on Asian economic
recovery.''
	   Struggling Asian countries have joined more economically robust
industrialized nations to call on Japan to take urgent action to
reverse its slump and help pull the region out of its economic
malaise.
	   Yosano said the Japanese government ``will restore financial
stability very soon,'' but didn't unveil any new initiatives to
speed the process along.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hanwha Energy Co. said Wednesday it
has scrapped a plan to sell a thermal power plant to AES Corp. of
the United States for dlrs 874 million.
	   AES agreed in principle in May to take over the 1,500-megawatt
plant in South Korea, but Hanwha said the deal foundered as the two
firms negotiated details of the sale.
	   Hanwha said it would try to find a new buyer.
	   Located in Inchon port just west of Seoul, the power plant
generated dlrs 246 million worth of electricity last year for a net
profit of dlrs 14.6 million. It provides 4 percent of South Korea's
total electricity demands.
	   Hanwha Energy is a subsidiary of the Hanwha group, South Korea's
eighth largest conglomerate. Its 27 affiliates are engaged in
businesses ranging from petrochemical, machinery to trading.
	   Arlington, Va.-based AES is one of the largest independent power
plant operators in the world.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Four financial institutions belonging to the
Mitsubishi group will set up a large securities company with
capital worth 200-300 billion yen (dlrs 1.49-2.23 billion) next
year, a major Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The four institutions involved are the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
Ltd., Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp., Meiji Life Insurance Co.
and Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co., the Yomiuri Shimbun
reported.
	   Officials from the four companies are in the final stages of
coordinating the launch of the new brokerage, scheduled for October
of next year, said the daily, Japan's largest.
	   The move is seen as linked to Japan's ``big bang'' financial
reforms, now under way and to be fully implemented early in the
next century, the report said.
	   Mitsubishi officials were not available to comment on the report
Wednesday due to a national holiday.

Afghan diplomat: Saudi downgraded relations over bin Laden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Kabul starting 12th graf, EDITS to
conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ An Afghan diplomat said Wednesday
that Saudi Arabia apparently decided to downgrade ties with Kabul
because the Taliban militia is harboring Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden.
	   Bin Laden is wanted by American authorities for allegedly
directing attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last
month. The blasts killed 259 people, including 12 Americans, and
wounded thousands.
	   Saudi Arabia announced late Tuesday that it was expelling the
Afghan charge d'affaires and recalling its representative from
Kabul.
	   The official Saudi Press Agency said the Afghan envoy was
ordered to leave ``due to Saudi Arabia's national interests.'' It
did not elaborate.
	   The decision came a day before Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince
Abdullah was due to visit the United States, which has close
relations with this oil-rich Gulf state.
	   The Afghan charge, Mowlai Shihab Dilawar, told The Associated
Press on Wednesday that he has not been notified officially of the
decision but had heard about it from news reports.
	   ``I believe this decision was taken because of the presence in
Afghanistan of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden,'' Dilawar said.
	   Saudi Arabia is one of three countries that has recognized the
Taliban militia as the legitimate government in war-wracked
Afghanistan. The others are Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
	   The Taliban drove government forces from the capital Kabul in
1996 and now control about 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   Dilawar said the Taliban would do their best to restore
relations with Riyadh.
	   ``In spite of this decision, we still consider Saudi Arabia like
a sister country, and we will do all we can to improve relations
and bring them back to normal,'' Dilawar said.
	   In Kabul on Wednesday, the Taliban expressed surprise at Saudi
Arabia's action.
	   ``We don't know the reason for its decision to pull out its
diplomat from Kabul,'' the Taliban's foreign secretary, Maulvi
Hafeezullah, told reporters.
	   He noted that bin Laden has given the Taliban assurances that he
won't carry out any political activities while in Afghanistan. The
Taliban also is not prepared to turn him over to any other country,
he said.
	   Hafeezullah suggested it might be best for Saudi Arabia if bin
Laden stays in Afghanistan, saying: ``He may pose problems for
Saudi Arabia if he left for another country.'' He did not
elaborate.
	   Dilawar argued that the Taliban should not be held responsible
for bin Laden's presence because he was in Afghanistan before the
militia took over.
	   Bin Laden first went to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight
alongside Afghan mujahedeen trying to oust a Soviet occupation
army.
	   The Taliban has said bin Laden could remain even if his presence
invited further U.S. missile strikes.
	   The United States fired Tomahawk cruise missiles into
Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the Aug. 7 embassy
bombings. In Afghanistan, the strikes targeted camps set up by bin
Laden.

Festina trainer accuses top French cyclist of doping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The trainer of the disgraced Festina team has
accused Richard Virenque, one of France's top cyclists, of drug
abuse, saying he took the same substances as other members of the
team that was expelled from the Tour de France.
	   ``How dare Richard say to me he doesn't take drugs,'' Voet said
in an interview published Tuesday by the newspaper Le Parisien.
``He takes the same products as the other racers _ no more, no
less.''
	   The Festina team was kicked out of this year's Tour de France
after admitting to the systematic use of the banned substance EPO.
	   But Virenque has consistently denied using the drug and has
urged authorities not to take disciplinary action against him.
	   Voet said only three members of the nine-man Festina team _
Christophe Bassons, Patrice Halgand and Laurent Lefevre _ didn't
take performance-enhancing drugs.
	   He said Festina team doctor Eric Ryckaert instigated the
drug-taking. ``The doctor proposes, and each racer is free to
accept or refuse,'' he said.
	   Voet said he had seen Ryckaert injecting cyclists, and that if
he was not available they would inject themselves. The cyclists
would usually take the drugs in their rooms after a race, he added.
	   Voet is one of three Festina team officials currently under
formal investigation _ one step short of being formally charged _
after the Tour de France drug scandal. The others are team director
Bruno Roussel, and Ryckaert.
	   The French Cycling Federation said Monday that the French
members of the Festina team would not be allowed to participate in
the October world championships, since they have yet to be
disciplined.

Miner dies in mine accident; this year's death toll nears 300
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Falling rocks killed one miner in eastern
Ukraine, bringing to nearly 300 the number of miners killed on the
job this year, officials said Wednesday.
	   The accident occurred at the Peremoha mine in the Luhansk
region, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   A total of 298 miners have died in job accidents in Ukraine
since the beginning of 1998. That's 91 more than in the same period
last year, according to the State Committee for Labor Safety.
	   The number of miners killed on the job has been steadily
increasing in recent years because mines lack the funds needed to
modernize equipment and improve safety conditions.
	   The worst single accident this year occurred in April, when a
methane gas blast killed 63 workers at a mine in the Donetsk
region.

Lenders decide to roll over Indonesian sovereign debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ International lenders ended marathon
talks in Paris Wednesday and agreed to reschedule dlrs 4.2 billion
of Indonesian sovereign debt payments, Indonesia's top economic
minister said.
	   The decision, made before dawn Wednesday, is regarded as crucial
to attempts by the financially crippled country to put its house in
order as it tackles its worst economic crisis in a generation.
	   The meeting _ under the auspices of the so-called Paris Club of
creditor nations _ decided that all sovereign debts due between
Aug. 6, 1998, to March 31, 2000, will be rescheduled over a period
of between 11 and 20 years.
	   Senior Economic Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita welcomed the
breakthrough.
	   He said the rolled-over debts consist of dlrs 1.2 billion of
official development loans, also called soft loans, in which
maturities were rolled over to 20 years with a five-year grace
period.
	   The remaining dlrs 3 billion in debts are export credits, which
were rolled over to 11 years with three-year grace period.
	   In a written report on the results of the meeting to President
B.J. Habibie, Ginandjar said the government's commercial debts,
which include government bonds, will be refinanced by commercial
sources. He didn't, however, mention the amount of the government's
outstanding commercial debts.
	   The Minister said the rescheduling applies only to the repayment
of principal and the government will continue to service interest
payments.
	   ``As a conclusion, regarding the world current economic and
financial conditions, the results of the negotiation were very
good,'' Ginandjar said. ``And according to the chairman of the
Paris Club as well as other participants, the results are one of
the best.''
	   Ginandjar said the meeting, which started Tuesday concluded
early Wednesday, was attended by delegates from the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank, Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, United Nations' Committee for Trade
and Development and the European Union.
	   Meanwhile, Ginandjar said the Japanese government didn't roll
over its loans to Indonesia maturing during the current fiscal
year. Japan instead will provide new loans, which will match the
amount of the maturing loan, he said.

Faldo ends 13-year relationship with Leadbetter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Nick Faldo has ended his 13-year
relationship with coach David Leadbetter, who rebuilt Faldo's swing
and then watched him win six major championships.
	   Leadbetter told GolfWeb that Faldo notified him of the split
with a letter sent to the Leadbetter Golf Academy. He said Faldo
decided to work with Chip Koehlke of the Faldo Golf Institute.
	   ``It's disappointing when you work so hard with a player for so
many years,'' Leadbetter said. ``We had a good relationship, as far
as these things go in this field. Sometimes you need a fresh
outlook, I suppose. Still, it was a bit of a shock.''
	   They comprised one of the most famous teacher-student
relationships in golf. Leadbetter was often at Faldo's side on the
practice range wearing his trademark Panama hat; Faldo often
referred him to simply as ``Lead.''
	   Faldo, a rising English star who had come up short in the
biggest tournaments, turned to Leadbetter in the spring of 1985 and
asked him to revamp his swing from top to bottom. Faldo went two
years without winning, but emerged as the world's dominant player.
	   He made 18 pars in the final round to win the British Open at
Muirfield and went on to win the Open in 1990 and 1992. He also is
the last man to win back-to-back Masters (1989-90), and added his
third green jacket in 1996 with a final-round 67 to come from six
strokes back to beat Greg Norman.
	   When Faldo was inducted into the Hall of Fame in May, he
credited Leadbetter for turning his game around.
	   In his letter, Faldo said he felt he should start with someone
new because of the worse slump of his career. Faldo has dropped to
65th in the world rankings and has not won since the 1997 Nissan
Open in Los Angeles.
	   Leadbetter also said it could be a business-related decision.
	   ``He was asked to promote the Nick Faldo Institute as much as he
could in the last year,'' Leadbetter said. ``That's why you didn't
often hear my name associated with his when he spoke.''
	   Leadbetter conceded he has not spent as much time working with
Faldo recently, in part because the teacher's father died in early
summer and he spent a lot of time traveling to England. Leadbetter
also works with Norman, Ernie Els and rookie sensation Se Ri Pak.
	   But he also suggested that Faldo has not been as focused as he
had been.
	   ``He has been good for me and I was good for him,'' Leadbetter
said. ``There was a time when every player at a major would look
over his shoulder and wonder what Nick was doing. I wish him well
in the future. If he gets his focus back and starts putting well, I
still think he can win.''

Takanohana, Wakanohana share lead at 10-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozunas (grand champions) Takanohana and
Wakanohana both won Wednesday to remain in a two-way tie for the
lead at 10-1, with four days left in the 15-day Autumn Grand Sumo
Tournament.
	   Yokozuna Akebono trailed the co-leaders at 8-3 along with his
fellow Hawaii-born ozeki (champion) Musashimaru and No. 15
maegashira (senior wrestler) Toki.
	   Takanohana, seeking his 20th tournament victory following a
triumph in the last tournament, dodged No. 5 maegashira
Kyokushuzan's initial pushing attack and sent him out. Kyokushuzan,
or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, fell to 4-7.
	   Wakanohana slapped down sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai
after the wrestlers charged at each other with fierce hand thrusts
in the mid-ring. Chiyotaikai is 7-4.
	   In the day's final bout, Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii,
attacked ozeki Takanonami with hand thrusts and pushed him out,
handing Takanonami his fifth defeat against six victories.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, charged No. 4
maegashira Aogiyama with hand thrusts and slapped him down.
Aogiyama is 4-7.
	   Toki thrust out No. 1-ranked Oikari of the juryo, just below the
senior makuuchi division, leaving Oikari at 7-4.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or
Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, slapped down No. 4-ranked
Zenshinyama, leaving both wrestlers at 5-6.
	   No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
was driven out by No. 9-ranked Tomonohana for his fourth defeat
against seven victories. Tomonohana is also 7-4.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 49-ranked Yamato
(4-2), or American George Kalima, defeated No. 47-ranked Takanagai.
	   No. 7-ranked Hoshiandesu (4-2), or Argentine Jose Antonio
Juarez, toppled No. 4-ranked Kaigatake.
	   In sandanme, the second highest junior division, No. 6-ranked
Kyokutenzan (4-2), or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, threw down No.
1-ranked Kotohikari.
	   No. 33-ranked Azumakaze (2-4), or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano
Kotinda, slapped down No. 25-ranked Kototaishu.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Piracy costs Russia, foreign firms dlrs 1 billion a year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government and foreign firms lose an
estimated dlrs 1 billion a year due to the sale of counterfeit
goods in Russia, which range from handicrafts to computer software,
a government official said Wednesday.
	   ``The illegal use of copyrights is inflicting huge damage on
Russia,'' Oleg Sviridov, deputy chairman of the State Customs
Committee, said at a conference devoted to the topic.
	   ``An immense sum of tax revenue is not paid to the (state)
budget,'' Sviridov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   The Russian government is chronically short of cash, but it has
shown little interest in stopping the sale of counterfeit goods
that cost it so much money.
	   In Moscow, a huge market for counterfeit goods openly operates
every weekend in a park, where hundreds of sellers set up stall
offering pirated movies, compact discs and computer software.
	   The compact discs sell for about dlrs three, compared to about
15 to 20 dollars in the United States.
	   Foreign firms have frequently complained about the problem, but
the Russian government has not taken any steps to halt the
practice.
	   Sviridov said new customs regulations were being drawn up as
part of a government plan to crack down on copyright violations.

Belgian official discusses U.N. sanctions with Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Raymond Langendries, chairman of the
Belgian House of Representatives, has met with senior Iraqi
officials on U.N. weapons inspections and sanctions, an Iraqi
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Al-Iraq daily said that Langendries arrived Tuesday on a two-day
visit and met with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz.
	   ``Aziz hailed the efforts exerted by (Langendries) and all fair
friends in Belgium to lift the unjust embargo imposed on Iraqi
people,'' the newspaper said.
	   Iraq has been under punishing U.N. trade sanctions since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council has said it will
not lift the sanctions until Iraq has complied with resolutions
demanding the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq says it has done this, but U.N. weapons inspectors say they
suspect Iraq continues to hide prohibited weaponry and the means to
make more.
	   Iraq announced on Aug. 5 that it no longer would cooperate with
the inspectors. The Security Council responded by suspending its
periodic reviews of the sanctions.
	   Aziz is due to meet next Monday with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in New York to discuss the impasse.
	   Also on Tuesday, Langendries met with Iraq's Parliament speaker,
Sadoun Hammadi, and Industry Minister Adnan Abdel-Majid Jassim.
	   The two sides ``discussed means to improve cooperation in the
exchange of expertise and experts,'' the paper said.
	   During a visit in May last year, Langendries pledged to draw
Europe's attention to the plight of Iraqis under U.N. sanctions.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Anti-government student protesters
marched along a toll road in front the Parliament Wednesday after
troops blocked buses carrying them to the legislature.
	   The demonstration in Jakarta was one of three reported in the
crisis-ridden Southeast Asian nation on Wednesday as discontent
mounts over the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   In Palu, on Sulawesi island, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles)
northeast of Jakarta, students clashed with riot police outside the
provincial governor's office, the official Antara news agency
reported. At least ten people were injured.
	   In the second most populous city, Medan, as many as 700
students, workers and farmers staged protests.
	   Shops in the city, on the island of Sumatra, 1,400 kilometers
(870 miles) northwest of Jakarta, were shut although rumors that
the protests could turn violent proved unfounded.
	   There were no reports of arrests or injuries.
	   In Jakarta, a huge traffic jam ensued after a line of soldiers
stopped five buses and other vehicles carrying protesters about 100
meters (yards) from the Parliament.
	   About 700 students initially sat in the buses or climbed upon
their roofs chanting slogans and waving banners and flags.
	   Later about 50 got out and marched with the buses forming a
convoy behind them. They passed the Parliament and headed toward a
nearby university campus.
	   Wednesday's demonstrations in both cities were the latest in a
series against the government of President B.J. Habibie.
	   Most of the protests are in response to soaring prices and mass
unemployment which has brought misery to millions of Indonesians.

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hurricane Georges's wind and rain
swept into Haiti on Wednesday, where officials braced for flash
floods and landslides amid the eroded mountains of the impoverished
Caribbean nation.
	   Waves swamped the seaside boulevard in north coast Cap-Haitien,
tin roofs flew off homes and streamside residents raced for
shelters or higher ground.
	   ``We're scared a little, but we have a lot of faith,'' said
Port-au-Prince supermarket clerk Nadine Augustin, 19. Like most
Haitians, her parents had done little to prepare for the storm
barreling in from the neighboring Dominican Republic.
	   As Georges marched relentlessly northwest, a hurricane watch was
posted Wednesday for south Florida. Warnings were declared in Cuba
from Sancti Spiritus province eastward and in the central and
southern Bahamas.
	   At 5 a.m. (0900 GMT), Hurricane Georges was centered over the
Windward Passage about 120 miles (195 kilometers) east-southeast of
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It was moving west-northwest near 15 mph (24
kph).
	   Georges' winds dropped from 110 mph (177 kph) Tuesday to near 75
mph (120 kph) as it moved across the island of Hispaniola but it
was expected to strengthen again over open water.
	   The mammoth storm was on a trajectory that could send it
crashing into the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday.
Authorities urged tourists to leave the island chain, and residents
began boarding up windows.

South African troops meet unexpected resistance in Lesotho

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African troops tried to mop up
stubborn resistance near a Lesotho military compound Wednesday
while soldiers from Botswana fanned out in the kingdom's gutted
capital to stop looting.
	   As scattered gunfire echoed through the capital, Botswanan
soldiers shooed looters away from wrecked shops. Many stores were
still smoldering from fires set on Tuesday, the day 600 South
African troops crossed the border to quell a military uprising.
	   At the Makoanyne barracks northeast of Maseru, where 10 South
African soldiers were slain Tuesday during a South African
helicopter and infantry assault, dawn Wednesday was punctuated by
bursts of machine-gun fire from a mountain overlooking the
compound. Lesotho soldiers opposing the intervention have been
holed up on the mountain and have surprised the South Africans with
their fierce resistance.
	   Overnight, 60mm and 88mm mortar rounds crashing into the
compound from the mountain, sending South African soldiers
scurrying for protection in their armored personnel carriers.
	   Mutinous Lesotho soldiers put up unexpectedly heavy resistance
at the Kase Dam, Ratjemose Military Base and at the Makonyane
barracks with assault rifles, mortars, heavy machine guns and
anti-aircraft fire.
	   South African military officials in Pretoria said in a statement
that their troops, surprised by the ferocity of the opposition,
would be more aggressive and use more firepower to supress the
Lesotho mutineers.
	   ``Where the peace forces started out by being circumspect in
clashes, they will now shoot to kill,'' a military spokesman told
the South African Press Association.
	   South African media reported that both the Lesotho government
and the opposition said they were ready to negotiate an end the
crisis. However, it was not immediately clear Wednesday if senior
Lesotho government ministers were still in the country.
	   The intervention came at the request of Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili after a revolt by junior military officers from the
Lesotho Defense Force and amid opposition strikes that paralyzed
Maseru. Some of the ousted military leaders fled the country. The
remaining military appeared to be siding with an opposition
movement that claims elections last May _ swept by the ruling
Lesotho Congress Party _ were rigged.
	   South African troops were distributing fliers telling the people
of this Belgium-sized country that their intervention, on behalf of
the Southern African Development Community, was aimed at preventing
``anarchy'' and to ``create a stable environment for law and
order.''
	   However, the intervention triggered widespread arson and looting
of stores _ many of them South African-owned _ in the capital. With
the South African soldiers busy fighting Lesotho's troops, there
was no one to stop the outbreak of chaos in the streets.
	   Many of Lesotho's 2 million residents see the South Africans as
an invading force.
	   Michael Mohale, a resident of the capital, noted that South
Africa opposed military intervention in the Congo war. As he
watched a convoy of South African armored personnel carriers rumble
through Maseru, he said: ``We're a small country, so they just came
right in and didn't bother to keep a policy on no military
intervention.''
	   As the convoy growled past shattered and gutted stores, several
women jeered and pointed toward the border on the edge of town.
	   ``Go home,'' the women shouted.
	   Under President Nelson Mandela, South Africa has promoted
nonintervention throughout Africa.
	   The decision to send troops into Lesotho unleashed biting
criticism from South African opposition parties, churches and
civilian groups.
	   South Africa's first military intervention since the end of
apartheid in 1994 was quickly proving costly. Military officials in
Pretoria said at least nine South African soldiers had been killed.
A senior officer in Maseru said 10 had died in the fighting at the
Makoanyne barracks.
	   The military in Pretoria also said 17 South African soldiers had
been wounded and that about 40 rebels had died in the fighting.
	   A senior South African officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the force lacked troops and proper equipment to
handle the stiff resistance.
	   Combined task force spokesman Maj. Ben van Zyl said the South
African force could not achieve its objectives on the first day.
	   Botswana initially sent 200 of its troops for the intervention.

Property survey shows foreign investment to fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Foreign investment in Australian
property will probably fall over the next three years as part of
the fallout of the Asian economic crisis, a new survey released
Wednesday said.
	   The first-ever Australian Property Directions survey, conducted
by the Australian Property Institute), found almost three quarters
of respondents believed foreign investment would decrease over the
next year.
	   ``This is a telling indicator to us that the market should be in
for some adjustment,'' said Michael Collins, the API's New South
Wales president.
	   The survey measured the sentiment and expectations of three
groups _ valuers, fund managers and property analysts _ on a range
of topics affecting property industry activity.
	   In the next six months to a year, 71.4 percent expected a
continued fall in levels of foreign investment in Australian
property.
	   Over the next one to three years respondents predicted foreign
investment would continue to fall but perhaps level off at the end
of the period.
	   In the medium to long term, three to five years, most
respondents considered that foreign investment would increase or
remain steady.

Khatami returns home amid speculation of end to Rushdie affair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami returned home
Wednesday amid speculation that Iran might pull back from its death
sentence against British author Salman Rushdie.
	   More than 30 reporters were waiting for Khatami at the airport,
but he made no mention of Rushdie.
	   Instead, he focused on the tension between Iran and Afghanistan,
saying ``we don't want military confrontation or war.''
	   At a news conference on Tuesday in New York, Khatami suggested
that Iran wanted to put the Rushdie affair behind it, saying Iran
considered it ``completely finished.''
	   Rushdie has been in hiding since 1989 when the late Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a ``fatwa,'' or religious
edict, saying he should be punished for blasphemy against Islam for
his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   Khatami noted that his government already pledged not to enforce
the decree, saying: ``Iran has officially declared that in action,
it has no decision on this matter.''
	   In London, the Guardian newspaper said Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamel Kharazzi would make clear in a meeting with Britain's foreign
secretary that Iran was pulling back from Khomeini's edict.
	   The Guardian report said that in a bid to improve relations with
Britain, the Iranian government would ask a religious foundation
that has offered a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death to
cancel the reward.
	   That would be a major change from Iran's present position, which
is that while it cannot cancel the fatwa by Khomeini _ who died in
1989 _ it would not actively enforce it.
	   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Tuesday
from London that the British Foreign Office expected Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook's meeting with Kharazzi to occur on Thursday.
	   The IRNA report only mentioned the Rushdie affair as the
impediment to improving Iranian-British relations and quoted
reports as saying London hoped to upgrade the ties to the
ambassadorial level.
	   At his airport news conference, Khatami focused on the Iran's
problems with Afghanistan.
	   Tension between the two countries has risen since the Taliban
overran the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan on Aug.
8 and killed several Iranian diplomats posted there.
	   Iran has since deployed about 200,000 troops on its border with
Afghanistan, amid growing demands for vengeance by mobs of Iranian
demonstrators. The Taliban have built up forces in the area to
counter any attack.
	   ``If the conditions we want are implemented, there would be no
reason for military confrontation,'' Khatami said.
	   Iran has demanded that Afghanistan release some 50 Iranians it
says the militia is holding. Tehran also has asked for an apology
for the deaths of eight of its diplomats and a journalist. And it
wants the killers turned over to Tehran for punishment.
	   Khatami, who took office in August 1997, is considered a
moderate. There are hard-line elements in the government that
oppose the liberal reforms he has tried to introduce.
	   Last February, on the anniversary of Khomeini's edict, the
foundation that set the bounty said it might increase it.
	   The 15th Khordad Foundation, which last year upped a dlrs 2
million bounty to dlrs 2.5 million, said it will consider another
increase. And Iran's chief prosecutor, Morteza Moqtadaie, renewed
the death sentence.

Asset sales boost Bertelsmann profits in fiscal 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUETERSLOH, Germany (AP) _ Bertelsmann AG, Europe's biggest
media concern, said Wednesday its profits for the 1998 fiscal year
increased to 1.12 billion marks (dlrs 660 million) from 1.02
billion marks (dlrs 602 million) in 1997.
	   Sales of assets such as a paper factory in Italy and printing
plants in the United States helped boost profits in the fiscal year
ending June 30.
	   But poor performances in the book and music divisions weighed on
earnings, said Siegfried Luther, Bertelsmann's chief financial
officer.
	   The company's struggling book clubs in Britain, France and
Germany lowered fiscal-year profits by 200 million marks (dlrs 120
million).
	   Weak music sales, in Asia especially, cost Bertelsmann 100
million marks (dls 60 million), though this was compensated for by
a 100-million-mark profit from print-media division Gruner and
Jahr, Luther said.

Share prices rise for second consecutive day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices continued to climb for a second
straight day Wednesday, as investors bought shares in market
heavyweight HSBC Holdings.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 130.88 points, or 1.8
percent, to close at 7,504.39. On Tuesday, the index had surged
203.28 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 3.01 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
388 million), slightly down from Tuesday's 3.70 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 477 million).
	   Investors scooped up bargains on HSBC, whose shares have fallen
steeply over the past two weeks, traders said.
	   HSBC Holdings, which accounts for about a third of the index
weighting, rose 2.50 Hong Kong dollars to 138.00 while its
affiliate, Hang Seng Bank, rose 1.40 to 46.00.
	   Trading was also active in shares of Hong Kong
Telecommunications Ltd., following news that it succumbed to union
demands to delay a proposed 10 percent salary cut for almost all of
its 13,800 employees.
	   Hongkong Telecom rose 30 cents to 15.10.
	   While most shareholders might prefer that the company forge
ahead with cost-cutting plans, Jason Tang, manager of institutional
sales at South China Brokerage Co., said the delay for the salary
cuts by Hongkong Telecom is good news for the market.
	   It eased fears that other companies would follow the example of
Hongkong Telecom, one of the largest private employers in the
territory, he said.
	   ``Trading was very thin as the expected return on equities isn't
attractive,'' said Dickson Au, sales manager at Sassoon Securities
Ltd.
	   ``People would rather put their money in fixed deposits with
negotiable interest rates as high as 8 percent to 9 percent to
avoid the downside risk of equities,'' he said.
	   Among properties, leading Hong Kong developer Cheung Kong
Holdings rose 50 Hong Kong cents to 32.40, while its competitor
Sung Hung Kai Properties rose 55 cents to 24.40.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. rose 1.00 dollar to 37.40
after after news that it will rebrand two of its three mobile
telecommunications services in Hong Kong.
	   Cathay Pacific, the territory's flagship air carrier, gained 10
cents to close at 6.90. Wharf (Holdings) fell 20 cents to 7.80.

Afghan diplomat: Saudi downgraded relations over bin Laden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ An Afghan diplomat said Wednesday
that Saudi Arabia apparently decided to downgrade ties with Kabul
because the Taliban militia is harboring Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden.
	   Bin Laden is wanted by American authorities on suspicion of
directing attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last
month. The blasts killed 259 people and wounded thousands.
	   Saudi Arabia announced late Tuesday that it was expelling the
Afghan charge d'affaires and recalling its representative from
Kabul.
	   The official Saudi Press Agency said the Afghan envoy was
ordered to leave ``due to Saudi Arabia's national interests.'' It
did not elaborate.
	   The decision came a day before Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince
Abdullah was due to visit the United States, which has close
relations with the oil-rich Gulf state.
	   The Afghan charge, Mowlai Shihab Dilawar, told The Associated
Press on Wednesday that he has not been notified officially of the
decision but had heard about it from news reports.
	   ``I believe this decision was taken because of the presence in
Afghanistan of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden,'' Dilawar said.
	   Saudi Arabia is one of three countries that has recognized the
Taliban militia as the legitimate government in war-wracked
Afghanistan. The others are Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
	   The Taliban drove government forces from the capital, Kabul, in
1996 and now controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   Dilawar said the Taliban would do its best to restore relations
with Riyadh.
	   ``In spite of this decision, we still consider Saudi Arabia like
a sister country, and we will do all we can to improve relations
and bring them back to normal,'' Dilawar said.
	   In Kabul on Wednesday, the Taliban expressed surprise at Saudi
Arabia's action.
	   ``We don't know the reason for its decision to pull out its
diplomat from Kabul,'' foreign secretary Maulvi Hafeezullah said.
	   He noted that bin Laden has given the Taliban assurances that he
won't carry out any political activities while in Afghanistan. The
Taliban is not prepared to turn him over to any other country, he
said.
	   Hafeezullah suggested it might be best for Saudi Arabia if bin
Laden stayed in Afghanistan, saying, ``He may pose problems for
Saudi Arabia if he left for another country.'' He did not
elaborate.
	   Dilawar argued that the Taliban should not be held responsible
for bin Laden's presence because he was in Afghanistan before the
militia took over.
	   Bin Laden first went to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight
alongside Afghan mujahedeen trying to oust a Soviet occupation
army.
	   The Taliban has said bin Laden could remain even if his presence
invited further U.S. missile strikes.
	   The United States fired Tomahawk cruise missiles into
Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the Aug. 7 embassy
bombings. In Afghanistan, the strikes targeted camps set up by bin
Laden.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying growing world pressure to
end a crackdown in Kosovo, Serbia's security forces pounded a rebel
ethnic Albanian stronghold for a second day Wednesday.
	   Serb sources in Pristina reported that government troops
continued their offensive in the central Drenica region, the heart
of the ethnic Albanian rebellion against Serbia, after capturing at
least four villages from the rebels on Tuesday.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center reported that
Serb forces took control of two more villages Wednesday morning.
The center said eight villages have been burned while 20,000 people
fled their homes.
	   The region under attack is believed to be the last major
stronghold of the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army which is
fighting for Kosovo's independence from Serbia.
	   Serb-led troops have in the past seven months defeated the KLA
elsewhere throughout Kosovo. Their crackdown has claimed hundreds
of lives and sent an estimated 275,000 people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, fleeing.
	   Fearing that the refugees face a disastrous winter unless the
clashes stop, world leaders in the United Nations pushed Tuesday
for an immediate cease-fire and moved closer to using force against
Serb forces.
	   The Security Council was expected to adopt a resolution
Wednesday which calls for a cease-fire and threatens further action
if the violence continues. The draft resolution does not
specifically authorize NATO force to stop the clashes but calls for
unspecified ``additional measures'' if the clashes continue. It
gives no time frame.
	   Still, the United States has asked the NATO governing body to
begin rounding up commitments from NATO countries to contribute to
a possible multinational force, two senior U.S. officials said
Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   A U.S. envoy in Kosovo, Christopher Hill, visited some of the
refugees in the area southwest of the capital Pristina on Tuesday.
Hill was expected to meet ethnic Albanian leaders Wednesday.
	   In Belgrade, the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic shrugged off the threats and accused the West of being
anti-Serb.
	   The defiant reaction is typical of Milosevic. For years, he
ignored growing international condemnation of Serb excesses in
Bosnia until NATO struck at Bosnian Serb positions in 1995, helping
end the war there.
	   Milosevic sent his top ally, Serbian president Milan Milutinovic
to Kosovo on Wednesday. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In addition to demanding a cease-fire, the draft U.N. resolution
urges the Serbs and ethnic Albanian leadership to start negotiating
a solution to the crisis.
	   It demands Milosevic allow international monitoring in Kosovo
and the return of refugees.
	   Russia, which has opposed force in the past, said it would go
along with the resolution because it didn't specifically authorize
military intervention.
	   China however, still had problems with the threat of further
measures, council diplomats said. A U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said China could abstain from the vote.
	   Milosevic aide Zoran Lilic said Tuesday the world should ``leave
Serbia alone to solve its own problems.''
	   His Socialist party dismissed reports of a looming humanitarian
disaster in Kosovo, saying they presented an ``excuse for
continuation of pressure on our country.''

Opposition cautions Indian president against dismissing state
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's fractious opposition came
together Wednesday and urged the president to reject Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee's recommendation that a socialist government
in an eastern state be fired.
	   Top opposition leaders met President K.R. Narayanan in New Delhi
separately and said Vajpayee's recommendation to fire the Bihar
state government controlled by his political rivals smacked of
vendetta. Vajpayee's government says federal authorities should
take over running Bihar because law and order has collapsed there.
	   The president, who must make the decision, was consulting
politicians and legal experts. He has in the past has turned down a
similar request against another state government.
	   In Bihar, a general strike called by the governing party,
Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha, shut down shops and businesses, but no
violence was reported. Nearly 1,400 paramilitary forces guarded key
towns.
	   Vajpayee's Cabinet on Tuesday endorsed Bihar Governor Sunder
Singh Bhandari's recommendation that the state government be fired
on grounds of ``constitutional breakdown, financial mismanagement
and failure of law and order.'' Bihar is considered India's most
lawless state.
	   Bhandari is a senior leader of Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata
Party, but he is expected to act impartially. State governors are
appointed by the federal government to oversee local
administrations, while chief ministers who are members of state
assemblies are the top local politicians.
	   In New Delhi, Former Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral met the
president and later said the dismissal of the state government
would seriously damage democracy. He pointed out that Bihar Chief
Minister Rabri Devi had won a confidence vote in the state
legislature only two days ago.
	   Federal officials say that while Devi has the votes in the
legislature, she has lost control of law and order. Most of the
lawmakers in the Bihar legislature have criminal records and are
frequently accused of switching political loyalty in return for
hefty bribes.
	   Mulayam Singh Yadav, a leader of the Rashtriya Loktantrik
Morcha, who also met with the president Wednesday, called for
Bhandari's dismissal.
	   A key ally of Vajpayee's coalition government took the prime
minister's move as an opportunity to press its demand for firing a
rival party-led government in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.
	   Jayakumar Jayalalitha, leader of the All India Anna Dravida
Munnetra Kazhgam, told reporters in Madras, the capital of Tamil
Nadu state, that the situation in Tamil Nadu was ``far worse,
several times worse'' than in Bihar.
	   Vajpayee's coalition government badly needs Jayalalitha's
support for survival, but he has so far rejected calls to topple
the Tamil Nadu government led by her rivals.
	   Tension began building in Bihar last week following the state
government's rejection of the Vajpayee government's decision to
carve out a separate state for tribespeople to ensure speedy
development. Bihar is India's second most populous state.

U.N. says unemployment high and set to worsen by end of year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT, Thursday September 24. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The number of people without full time jobs will
reach a 1 billion record by the end of 1998, fueled by the Asian
financial crisis, according to an International Labor Office report
out Thursday.
	   The turmoil in Asia will cause the number of unemployed people
around the globe to rise 10 million to 150 million, the 258-page
study said.
	   In addition, a further 750 million to 900 million people _ 25-30
percent of the world's workers _ lack full time jobs or earn less
than the minimum needed to live, a situation the ILO calls
``underemployment.''
	   The study's author, ILO employment expert Rachid Amjad,
forecasted ``much more pressure on the global employment
situation'' in future years, but declined to be specific.
	   The ILO says governments, especially those in developing
countries, must invest more in worker training and skills fueled by
real economic demand.
	   ``The global employment situation is grim and getting grimmer,''
said Michel Hansenne, director-general of the ILO.
	   Economic growth in many parts of the world in early 1998,
expected to spur worldwide job increases, has cut unemployment and
underemployment in the United States and the European Union, the
report said.
	   More than 18 million workers are unemployed in the EU but output
and employment showed signs of picking up in mid-1998.
	   There has been an above-average jobs increase in the United
States, despite growing wage inequality and a fall in real wages.
	   But despite three decades of sustained growth in East and
Southeast Asia, the situation in the region has dramatically
deteriorated in the past year.
	   In Thailand, for example, the report said unemployment could
rise to about 6 percent of the labor force _ almost 2 million
jobless _ in 1998 compared to 1-2 percent or 400,000 to 700,000
unemployed two years ago.
	   In China, an estimated 3.5 million workers will lose their jobs
this year and unemployment will increase 5-6 percent.
	   Poverty is likely to rise in the Russian Federation. ``The
recent turmoil in Russian financial markets, partly a response to
untenably high interest rates, threatens to replicate the earlier
experience of Indonesia,'' the report said. In Indonesia, steep
increases in unemployment are being accompanied by food shortages.
	   Unemployment remains high in most Central and East European
transition economies, the study said.
	   Latin America is threatened in 1998 by a potential global
pull-back by investors in emerging markets which could push
unemployment and underemployment up.
	   The ILO estimates 1998 unemployment is 7.9 percent in Brazil,
11.3 percent in Venezuela, 3.4 percent in Mexico and 15.2 percent
in Colombia.
	   In sub-Saharan Africa, the study said, a prolonged period of
poor growth and deteriorating labor market conditions has given way
to slightly improving employment in many countries in 1998, but
most new jobs are informal and in low-productivity agriculture.

Khatami returns home amid speculation of end to Rushdie affair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami returned home
Wednesday amid speculation that Iran might pull back from its death
sentence against British author Salman Rushdie.
	   More than 30 reporters were waiting for Khatami at the airport,
but he made no mention of Rushdie.
	   Instead, he focused on the tension between Iran and Afghanistan,
saying ``we don't want military confrontation or war.''
	   At a news conference on Tuesday in New York, Khatami suggested
that Iran wanted to put the Rushdie affair behind it, saying Iran
considered it ``completely finished.''
	   Rushdie has been in hiding since 1989 when the late Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a ``fatwa,'' or religious
edict, saying he should be punished for blasphemy against Islam for
his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   Khatami noted that his government already pledged not to enforce
the decree, saying: ``Iran has officially declared that in action,
it has no decision on this matter.''
	   In London, the Guardian newspaper said Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamel Kharazzi would make clear in a meeting with Britain's foreign
secretary that Iran was pulling back from Khomeini's edict.
	   The Guardian report said that in a bid to improve relations with
Britain, the Iranian government would ask a religious foundation
that has offered a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death to
cancel the reward.
	   That would be a major change from Iran's present position, which
is that while it cannot cancel the fatwa by Khomeini _ who died in
1989 _ it would not actively enforce it.
	   But any steps that Khatami and his minister might take to reduce
the impact of the edict against Rushdie are likely to be opposed by
hard-liners in Iran.

Second auction for South Korea's Kia Motors aborted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ For the second time in less than a
month, creditors canceled an auction of South Korea's bankrupt Kia
Motors Co. on Wednesday because all bidders demanded bigger debt
write-offs.
	   The first attempt to auction off the country's second-largest
automaker was scuttled by creditors on Sept. 1 when bidders made
the same demand.
	   The creditor banks said then that they would write off dlrs 2.1
billion of Kia's dlrs 8.4 billion debt and put the company back on
the auction block.
	   But that effort failed to impress the three South Korean car
makers who submitted new bids for Kia on Monday. Ford Motor Co. of
the United States withdrew from the second round of bidding.
	   Hyundai Motor Co., Samsung Motors Corp. and Daewoo Motor Co. all
said Kia's debt load was still too heavy, Kia officials said.
	   Creditor banks said they will announce later whether they will
call a third auction or try to find another way to sell Kia and its
commercial vehicle arm, Asia Motors Corp.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure its battered economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Kia's collapse last year helped erode investor confidence in
South Korea's industries, leading to a flight of capital.
	   Kia produced 780,000 cars in 1997. Asia Motors can turn out
250,000 vehicles, mostly trucks and buses. The two companies employ
more than 18,000 workers.

	   Al-Iraq daily said that Langendries arrived Tuesday and met with
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz. He is paying the two-day
visit on behalf of the Iraqi-Belgian Solidarity Committee, Belgian
Foreign Office spokesman Pierre De Bauw said.
	   ``Aziz hailed the efforts exerted by (Langendries) and all fair
friends in Belgium to lift the unjust embargo imposed on Iraqi
people,'' the newspaper said.
	   Iraq has been under punishing U.N. trade sanctions since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council has said it will
not lift the sanctions until Iraq has complied with resolutions
demanding the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq says it has done this, but U.N. weapons inspectors say they
suspect Iraq continues to hide prohibited weaponry and the means to
make more.
	   Iraq announced on Aug. 5 that it no longer would cooperate with
the inspectors. The Security Council responded by suspending its
periodic reviews of the sanctions.
	   Aziz is due to meet next Monday with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in New York to discuss the impasse.
	   Also on Tuesday, Langendries met with Iraq's Parliament speaker,
Sadoun Hammadi, and Industry Minister Adnan Abdel-Majid Jassim.
	   The two sides ``discussed means to improve cooperation in the
exchange of expertise and experts,'' the paper said.
	   During a visit in May last year, Langendries pledged to draw
Europe's attention to the plight of Iraqis under U.N. sanctions.
	   In Brussels, De Bauw said that Belgium respects U.N. resolutions
on Iraq and supports the Annan initiatives. ``But we are also
proponents of measures that meet the humanitarian concerns of the
Iraqi people,'' he added.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Scania, one of the world's largest makers
of trucks, buses and engines, opened an office and service center
in Ukraine that is the company's biggest in Eastern Europe, a news
report said Wednesday.
	   The new center, located on 4,500 square meters (5,400 square
yards) of land on the outskirts of Kiev, can service 15 Scania
trucks simultaneously, Scania Vice President Urban Erdtman said.
	   He said Scania is seeking to capture 15 percent of Ukraine's

Turkish court upholds prison sentence for Islamic mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In another blow to Turkey's Islamic
movement, an appeals court Wednesday upheld a 10-month prison
sentence for the pro-Islamic mayor of Istanbul.
	   Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan was found guilty by a court in
Diyarbakir in April of inciting hatred based on religious
differences in a speech at a political rally.
	   Erdogan can no longer run for political office. He was seen as
the future leader of the Islamic movement.
	   He may be unseated as Istanbul's mayor in the coming weeks. The
Interior Ministry is now expected to ask a court to order his
ouster, news reports said.
	   Erdogan was informed of the verdict during a public engagement
in Istanbul and rushed back to his office without comment, the
private NTV station reported.
	   The charges stemmed from a speech he made during a rally in the
southeastern city of Siirt last year.
	   ``Minarets are our bayonets, domes are our helmets,'' he had
said, reading from a folk poem. ``Mosques are our barracks,
believers are our soldiers.''
	   Erdogan had hoped to take over the leadership of Virtue, the new
Islamic party formed to replace the Welfare party, which was closed
down by the Constitutional Court in February for violating the
constitution's secular principle.
	   The military was instrumental in outlawing Welfare, and
continues to pressure the government to quash Islamic strains in
daily life.

Defense ministers will have to pose a credible threat of force
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) - Tough talk and sabre-rattling over
Kosovo haven't made much of an impression on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, so NATO defense ministers meeting here Thursday
and Friday will have to ratchet things up a notch to get his
attention.
	   The U.N. Security Council is preparing to vote on a resolution
threatening force unless Milosevic backs off and negotiates
seriously with the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo, a part of
Serbia, which is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. NATO sources
said Wednesday some nations, including Germany and the Netherlands,
already have made committments of men and aircraft.
	   Milosevic's massive attacks on ethnic Albanian villages in
Kosovo have continued unabated despite previous NATO threats. His
seven-month crackdown on separatists fighting for the independence
of Kosovo has claimed hundreds of lives and forced as many as
275,000 people from their homes.
	   Forceful statements from the alliance's foreign ministers at
their meeting in Luxembourg in June had no visible effect. Massive
air exercises over Albania and Macedonia frightened no one. Ground
exercises in the same region failed to impress Belgrade. And recent
word out of Washington and Bonn that alliance patience is wearing
thin have had less effect on Serb forces than a speed bump on an
Abrams tank.
	   It's not only Kosovo that seems to be falling apart. In Bosnia,
where the allies have spent billions of dollars and claimed one of
their greatest successes, a Serbian hardliner has defeated the
moderate Biljana Plavsic for the Bosnian Serb presidency, a severe
blow to Western plans.
	   All of this should give the defense ministers from the 16 NATO
nations, along with their counterparts from the three newly
selected members Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, plenty to
talk about in this sun and sand resort on Portugal's south coast.
	   NATO military planners have set out a wide range of options for
action in Kosovo. Now the generals are waiting for the word from
the political side.
	   ``We know there are at least 50,000 people camping out in
Kosovo,'' said one NATO official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``Their campfires are creating enough thermal heat to be
picked up by satellite.''
	   The Vilamoura gathering is the ministers' annual ``informal''
meeting, an occasion to sit around in relaxed setting and
brainstorm problems facing the alliance. While ministers don't
usually make decisions at these meetings, the rapidly developing
situation in the Balkans should focus their attention. The allies
could issue an ``activation warning,'' setting the military
machinery in motion and moving Kosovo preparations one step closer
to action.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said NATO should launch air
strikes against Milosevic in three to five weeks. Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel sounded just as tough: ``He must realize the
international community will move with military force if
necessary.''
	   Four months ago, passions were high at NATO and the alliance was
threatening imminent action. That passion cooled over the summer,
however, as Western capitals questioned the effectiveness of a
direct military intervention. Now, senior diplomats in the United
States and Germany and sounding the get-tough siren again.
	   ``Things are coming to a head,'' said one NATO diplomat.
	   Thursday and Friday's meeting will mark the first time that
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic participate fully in NATO
deliberations. Fourteen of the 16 existing NATO nations have voted
to ratify accession of the three new members. The Netherlands and
Turkey have yet to do so.
	   The three will be officially welcomed into the NATO fold at a
summit in Washington next April.

Queen Elizabeth shows weariness at end of tropical tour

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES from lead graf with details on queen's condition.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ On the last day of an four-day
visit to Malaysia, Queen Elizabeth II showed signs of weariness
Wednesday, briefly leaning on a partition as doctors briefed her in
a stuffy mobile clinic located in the tropical former British
colony.
	   Her fatigued posture contrasted with the gauzy pale green dress
and billowy hat she wore during a 90-minute walk-through of the
Malaysian Association for the Blind.
	   The 72-year-old queen, who almost always shows perfect posture
in public, rested a hand on her hip for a few moments inside the
13-meter (40-foot) van. She may not have released her image was
being shown on short-circuit television to dozens of staff members
and officials.
	   Her trip to Malaysia was preceded by a stop in neighboring
Brunei. She has no more state visits planned for this year.
	   The van, equipped for an array of eye treatments, was
air-conditioned, but quickly became overheated with the royal party
and local staff members inside. Outside, the temperature climbed to
over 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit).
	   It was so crowded that a medical technician in a white coat put
her hands on the queen's back and arm to squeeze behind her, just
as if she were trying to pass a customer in a crowded shop aisle.
According to royal protocol, no one is supposed to touch the queen
except to shake her hand when she offers it.
	   The queen's state visit to Malaysia came during some of the
biggest political turmoil experienced in the Southeast Asian nation
since it became independent in 1957.
	   The queen landed the same day that fired deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim was jailed after addressing 35,000 demonstrators in
the main square of the capital, a few meters (feet) from the
cathedral where the royal couple worshipped.
	   Police shot tear gas and chemical-laced water jets at crowds
outside Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's residence Sunday, and on
Monday to disperse thousands outside a courthouse chanting
``Reform, reform'' as the queen's motorcade sped by.
	   Her press secretary, Geoff Crawford, said the queen had seen the
protesters.
	   But if so, there was no hint of it in her speech at a state
banquet on Tuesday night. She mentioned Malaysia's financial
difficulties, not its politics, and focused her comments on trade
and education.
	   On Wednesday, the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, also
visited the National Art Gallery and a British-Malaysian education
institute. The last public event was to be a tea with veterans from
World War II and the Malaysian Emergency, an anti-communist jungle
war in the 1950s.
	   She was to fly home late Wednesday, after hosting a banquet at
the British High Commission.

 &UR; Gadhafi meets representative of British Lockerbie families
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Issues delaying the trial of two Libyan suspects
in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet could be resolved ``in a matter
of weeks,'' representatives of British victims said Wednesday as
they headed home from talks with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Jim Swire, who speaks for some British families, and Robert
Black, a law professor at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland,
said their meeting with Gadhafi in Tripoli Tuesday was constructive
and they will soon submit new proposals to U.N. officials to speed
up the trial. They refused to give details.
	   ``I believe that if we can reach agreement over certain
technicalities which have been holding up the process, then the
trial could be under way within weeks,'' Swire told The Associated
Press from Tunis airport, where the men were waiting for a flight
home.
	   The United States and Britain propose to try the suspects in the
Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law. Libya has
accepted the proposal but continues to argue about specifics.
	   Swire said the Libyans offered no assurances that they will soon
surrender the suspects. ``But we are definitely more confident now
than when we left for Tripoli,'' he said.
	   Libya has agreed in principle to accept the U.S.-British
compromise plan. But Gadhafi has demanded guarantees for the legal
rights and safety of the men.
	   Britain and the United States _ which initially demanded a trial
on their own soil _ have said the offer is not negotiable. But they
have expressed some willingness to discuss details through U.N.
officials.
	   The U.S.-British proposal calls for the Libyan suspects, if
convicted, to serve their prison time in Britain. Libya has said
they should serve any sentence in Libya.
	   For their part, British families are concerned that officials
and lawyers should have full, unfettered access to all relevant
witnesses and evidence, wherever they are, said Swire, whose
daughter Flora died in the attack over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 270 people.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions in 1992 to try to force
Gadhafi to hand over the suspects for trial. The sanctions ban air
travel to and from Libya, freeze foreign assets and bar the sale of
some oil equipment.
	   The U.N. Security Council has passed a resolution saying that
the sanctions will be lifted when the suspects are turned over for
trial in the Netherlands.
	   Swire said the Libyans have not explicitly accepted a proposal
by Britain and the Netherlands to stage the trial at a Dutch air
base.
	   ``It is true they did not react as strongly as we expected ...
to the fact that the base is still available at certain times to
U.S. forces,'' he said. ``But they did not say the Dutch air base
is acceptable.''

Romanian finance minister dismissed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's Finance Minister Daniel
Daianu was dismissed Wednesday after months of being at odds with
the government and the party that supported him.
	   A new minister from the Liberal Party, which is part of the
ruling coalition, was due to be sworn in later, the president's
office said.
	   There was no reason given for Daianu's abrupt removal, although
the Liberal Party which supported Daianu told Prime Minister Radu
Vasile on Wednesday to remove him because he failed to promote
liberal policies in the country's finances and taxes were too high.
	   The new finance minister is Traian Decebal Remes, a member of
parliament's lower chamber committee for budget and finance. Remes
is a member of the Liberal Party, unlike Daianu.
	   National radio reported Remes was due to swear an oath to
President Emil Constantinescu later in the day.
	   Daianu is best known as an outspoken voice in the government
with his strong criticism of a dlrs 1.45 billion deal with American
company Bell Helicopters, under which Romania would purchase 96
attack helicopters.
	   Daianu has said he would resign rather then sign the deal, which
he says would cripple Romania's weak economy and increase budget
expenditures, which the government is trying to control.
	   It is unclear whether Romania will go ahead with the deal. Last
week Bell said that Romania could pay some of the money in Romanian
currency, which w ease the monetary burden.
	   Vasile has kept his options open on the helicopter deal and
Constantinescu has said it would be good for modernizing Romania's
military. Many Romanians think the deal is designed to score
political points with the United States.
	   Romania is struggling to retool its economy along market lines,
but the economy is slowed by bureaucracy, political bickering and
corruption, which have deterred some foreign investors.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying growing world pressure to
end its crackdown in Kosovo, Serbia's security forces pounded a
rebel ethnic Albanian stronghold for a second day Wednesday.
	   Serb sources in Pristina reported that government troops
continued their offensive in the Drenica region, heart of the
ethnic Albanian rebellion against Serbia, after capturing at least
four villages from the rebels on Tuesday.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center reported that
Serb forces took control of two more villages Wednesday morning.
The center said eight villages have been burned while 20,000 people
fled their homes.
	   The region under attack is believed to be the last major
stronghold of the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting for the province's independence from Serbia.
	   Serb-led troops have in the past seven months defeated the KLA
elsewhere throughout Kosovo. Their crackdown has claimed hundreds
of lives and sent an estimated 275,000 people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, fleeing.
	   Fearing that the refugees face a disastrous winter unless the
clashes stop, world leaders at the United Nations on Tuesday pushed
for an immediate cease-fire and moved closer to using force against
Serb forces.
	   The Security Council was expected to adopt a resolution
Wednesday calling for a cease-fire and threatening further action
if the violence continues. The draft resolution does not
specifically authorize NATO force but calls for unspecified
``additional measures'' if the clashes continue. It gives no time
frame.
	   Still, the United States has asked the NATO governing body to
begin rounding up commitments from NATO countries to contribute to
a possible multinational force, two senior U.S. officials said
Tuesday on condition of anonymity.
	   A U.S. envoy in Kosovo, Christopher Hill, visited some of the
refugees in the area southwest of the capital, Pristina, on
Tuesday. Hill was expected to meet ethnic Albanian leaders
Wednesday.
	   In Belgrade, the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic shrugged off the threats and accused the West of being
anti-Serb.
	   The defiant reaction is typical of Milosevic. For years, he
ignored growing international condemnation of Serb excesses in
Bosnia until NATO struck at Bosnian Serb positions in 1995, helping
end the war there.
	   Milosevic sent his top ally, Serbian president Milan
Milutinovic, to Kosovo on Wednesday. Kosovo is a province of
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Russia, which has opposed force in the past, said it would go
along with the U.N. resolution because it didn't specifically
authorize military intervention.
	   China however, still had problems with the threat of further
measures, council diplomats said. A U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said China could abstain from the vote.

Top liberal lawmaker recovers in hospital after heart attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Top liberal leader Grigory Yavlinsky is recovering
after suffering a heart attack, but is likely to remain in hospital
for some time, aides said Wednesday.
	   Yavlinsky, 46, was undergoing treatment and tests at Hospital
No. 23 in Moscow. The leader of the Yabloko faction, one of the
largest in the lower chamber of the Russian parliament, was
hospitalized last Friday.
	   Doctors had complained that Yavlinsky was working and receiving
too many visitors, imperiling his recovery.
	   ``They are displeased with the fact that their patient began
holding working conferences and particularly with the fact that
Yavlinsky is pestered by visitors,'' said Yabloko spokeswoman
Yevgenya Dillendorf.
	   Yavlinsky finished fourth in the 1996 presidential elections and
plans to run again in 2000. He recently turned down offers to take
a senior post in Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's new Cabinet.

Philippine stocks rise on bargain-hunting; peso falls on PAL

worries
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower; analyst comments

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose Wednesday on
bargain-hunting following a three-session losing streak, traders
said.
	   The peso, however, was dragged lower by the scheduled closure of
Philippine Airlines, with banks buying dollars because of concerns
about the settlement of the carrier's dlrs 2.1 billion debt,
dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 36.39 points,
or 3.2 percent, to 1,159.69. On Tuesday, the index fell 40.96
points, or 3.5 percent, bringing its total loss since Friday to
145.94 points.
	   Trading of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. shares
dominated market activity, accounting for roughly 54 percent of
total trades. PLDT rose 3.9 percent to close at 800 pesos (dlrs
17.98).
	   ``PLDT was the darling of the market again. There is a lot of
speculation involving the company since I think there are a lot of
groups interested in it,'' said Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president
for Diversified Securities Inc.
	   Early this month, PLDT came out with a plan which aims to thwart
hostile takeovers. The Securities and Exchange Commission has yet
to approve the plan and many investors have been taking advantage
of the situation by buying PLDT shares.
	   PLDT management is also buying up shares of the company from the
market to protect itself, traders said.
	   The scheduled closure Wednesday night of Philippine Airlines
appeared to have been already discounted by the market, Garcia
said.
	   Last-ditch efforts to save the airline continued after workers
rejected a management-proposed rescue plan on Tuesday requiring a
10-year suspension of employees' collective bargaining agreements
in exchange for 20 percent of the company's stock.
	   Garcia said foreigners actively picked up blue-chip stocks,
which had been heavily battered in recent trading days.
	   ``The rally wasn't broad-based. That's why the index gain was
considerable because investors focused largely on index-heavyweight
issues,'' he said.
	   With the country's economic fundamentals still shaky, and PAL's
closure threatening to further undermine the country's economy,
Wednesday's technical rebound may not be sustainable, traders said.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 44.566 pesos for the
day, up from Tuesday's 44.395 pesos.
	   It was last traded at 44.59 pesos, close to its intraday high of
44.63 pesos.
	   Traders said banks were bracing for a possible surge in dollar
demand once PAL starts selling its assets to raise funds to pay off
its debt.
	   The weak yen also put pressure on the local currency, dealers
said.
	   The central bank wasn't active in the market. It kept its
overnight borrowing and lending rates unchanged at 16 percent and
18 percent, respectively.

U.N. says world unemployment high and set to worsen by end of year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT, Thursday September 24. &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The number of people without full-time jobs
worldwide will reach a record high of 1 billion by the end of 1998,
fueled by the Asian financial crisis, according to an International
Labor Office report out Thursday.
	   The turmoil in Asia will cause the number of unemployed people
around the globe to rise 10 million, to 150 million, the 258-page
study said.
	   In addition, a further 750 million to 900 million people _ 25
percent to 30 percent of the world's workers _ lack full-time jobs
or earn less than the minimum needed to live, a situation the ILO
calls ``underemployment.''
	   The study's author, ILO employment expert Rachid Amjad, forecast
``much more pressure on the global employment situation'' in future
years, but declined to be specific.
	   The ILO says governments, especially those in developing
countries, must invest more in worker training and skills fueled by
real economic demand.
	   ``The global employment situation is grim and getting grimmer,''
said Michel Hansenne, director-general of the ILO.
	   Economic growth in many parts of the world in early 1998,
expected to spur worldwide job increases, has cut unemployment and
underemployment in the United States and the European Union, the
report said.
	   More than 18 million workers are unemployed in the EU but output
and employment showed signs of picking up in mid-1998.
	   There has been an above-average jobs increase in the United
States, despite growing wage inequality and a fall in real wages.
	   But despite three decades of sustained growth in East and
Southeast Asia, the situation in the region has dramatically
deteriorated in the past year.
	   In Thailand, for example, the report said, unemployment could
rise to about 6 percent of the labor force _ almost 2 million
jobless _ in 1998 compared to 1 percent to 2 percent of the labor
force, or 400,000 to 700,000 unemployed, two years ago.
	   In China, an estimated 3.5 million workers will lose their jobs
this year and unemployment will increase 5 percent to 6 percent.
	   Poverty is likely to rise in the Russian Federation. ``The
recent turmoil in Russian financial markets, partly a response to
untenably high interest rates, threatens to replicate the earlier
experience of Indonesia,'' the report said. In Indonesia, steep
increases in unemployment are accompanied by food shortages.
	   Unemployment remains high in most Central and East European
transition economies, the study said.
	   Latin America is threatened in 1998 by a potential global
pull-back by investors in emerging markets which could push
unemployment and underemployment up.
	   The ILO estimates that 1998 unemployment is 7.9 percent in
Brazil, 11.3 percent in Venezuela, 3.4 percent in Mexico and 15.2
percent in Colombia.
	   In sub-Saharan Africa, the study said, a prolonged period of
poor growth and deteriorating labor market conditions has given way
to slightly improving employment in many countries in 1998, but
most new jobs are informal and in low-productivity agriculture.

Russia maintains lucrative weapons exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian has managed to stabilize its level of arms
sales despite strong international competition and declining demand
in many parts of the world, according to a report Wednesday.
	   Yevgeny Ananyev, head of the Rosvooruzhenie state arms export
company, told the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper that annual exports
were stable at around dlrs 2.5 billion to dlrs 3 billion. The
export authority had coordinated all sales and marketing efforts to
ensure effective competition on world markets, he said.
	   Although well down from Soviet levels, Russia is one of the
world's top four arms exporters, supplying relatively inexpensive
weapons with a reputation for reliability.
	   Ananyev said Russia was offering some of its most modern weapons
for export because there was little demand for older models. He
cited examples such as the S-300 PMU1 anti-missile system, Kilo
class submarines, Su-27 and MiG-29 fighter jets and the Ka-50 Black
Shark attack helicopter.
	   With the Russian economy in crisis, arms exports are among the
country's few steady sources of hard currency and one of the few
sectors where Russian industry continues to operate effectively.

Seles beats retiring Sawamatsu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By K.P. HONG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Monica Seles, defending champion and the second
seed, became a quarterfinalist Wednesday with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3
victory over Japan's retiring Naoko Sawamatsu in the dlrs 450,000
Toyota Princess Cup tennis tournament.
	   It was the first singles match of the meet for Seles, who had a
first-round bye, and the final match on the WTA Tour for the
25-year-old Sawamatsu.
	   At the end of a two-hour match on Ariake Colosseum's center
court, spectators gave a long standing ovation as Sawamatsu spoke
tearfully about a seven-year career that included four WTA
tournament victories.
	   ``It was really difficult going into the match because I have
known Naoko for quite some time and I respect her so much as a
person as well as a player,'' Seles told reporters later.
	   ``I always have a tough time playing players who are retiring
... I lost to Chris (Evert) and I lost to Kumiko (Date). I was just
glad today that I didn't lose. But it could've been kind of a happy
victory if Naoko would be playing next year here,'' said Seles,
currently ranked sixth in the world.
	   Sawamatsu, one of Japan's leading tennis players for a decade
along with Date, may represent the country in a couple of
non-tournament events later this year, including the Sony Life Cup
tennis, a U.S.-Japan women's competition. Date retired in 1996.
	   Also in the day's second round, American Amy Frazier rallied
past third-seeded Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 0-6, 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``I don't think Amanda missed a shot in the first set,'' said
Frazier, currently ranked 63rd in the world. Coetzer is
10th-ranked. ``It's not that I played badly in the first set but
that she played perfect tennis.
	   ``So, I approached the second set thinking that I needed to just
hang in there and play each point. Once I won a few games she
probably missed more shots than she normally does and definitely
many more than in the first set. I just tried to keep the ball in
play and win point-by-point.''
	   In another upset, Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn beat
eighth-seeded Hernrieta Nagyova of Slovakia 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), also
advancing to the quarterfinals.
	   On Thursday, top seed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, who also had a
first-round bye, takes on Elena Likohvtseva of Russia.
	   Sanchez-Vicario, fourth-ranked in the world, finished second to
Seles in this tournament last year.

Arafat rejects resignation of senior Palestinian negotiator
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat turned down a
request by one of the top Palestinian negotiators with Israel, Saeb
Erekat, to be relieved of the job, officials said Wednesday.
	   Erekat, a minister of local government in Arafat's Cabinet,
apparently was angered by Arafat's decision last month to set up a
back channel with Israel and give Palestinian Parliament Speaker
Ahmed Qureia a prominent role in those talks.
	   Erekat's resignation offer was a sign of ongoing rivalries
within the Palestinian team that stem, in part, from Arafat's
practice of appointing several people to the same job.
	   In the talks with Israel, neither Erekat nor Qureia appeared to
have had a real mandate, with political analysts saying Arafat
reserves the final authority for himself.
	   Palestinian commentator Ghassan Khatib said it did not matter
who negotiated for the Palestinians ``because in the end it is the
president (Arafat) who does the decision-making.''
	   In the most recent example, Qureia told Arafat in the summer
that he was being asked by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's aide, Yitzhak Molcho, to hold secret talks.
	   Arafat told Qureia to give it a try. Qureia met seven times with
Molcho and three times with Netanyahu, most recently in August.
	   At the same time, Erekat was holding official talks with other
Netanyahu aides. While Erekat said publicly that no progress was
made, Molcho presented a draft on a West Bank pullback to Qureia.
	   Arafat in the end rejected the Israeli draft proposal, saying it
failed to address all elements of a U.S. peace initiative,
including plans for an additional troop withdrawal.
	   The United States, meanwhile, is pushing Israel and the
Palestinians to intensify talks on a troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank in the next few days.
	   During this time, Netanyahu and Arafat, accompanied by their
aides, will be in New York to address the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Netanyahu will speak on Thursday and Arafat on Monday, and both
are expected to meet separately with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   Erekat, who submitted his resignation Monday but was asked by
the Palestinian leader a day later to stay on, will travel to New
York with Arafat, Palestinian officials said.

NATO will try to pose credible threat of force in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ Tough talk and saber-rattling over
Kosovo haven't made much of an impression on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, so NATO defense ministers meeting here Thursday
and Friday will have to ratchet things up a notch to get his
attention.
	   Four months ago, passions were high at NATO and the alliance was
threatening imminent action. That passion cooled over the summer,
however, as Western capitals questioned the effectiveness of direct
military intervention in the restive province. Now senior diplomats
in the United States and Germany are sounding the get-tough siren
again.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said NATO should launch air
strikes against Milosevic in three to five weeks. Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel sounded just as tough: ``He must realize the
international community will move with military force if
necessary.''
	   The Western allies could issue an ``activation warning,''
setting the military machinery in motion and moving Kosovo
preparations one step closer to action.
	   NATO military planners have set out a wide range of options for
action in Kosovo. Now the generals are waiting for the word from
the political side.
	   The U.N. Security Council was preparing to vote on a resolution
threatening force unless Milosevic backs off and negotiates
seriously with the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo, a part of
Serbia, which is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   NATO sources said Wednesday that some nations, including Germany
and the Netherlands, already committed men and aircraft.
	   Milosevic's massive attacks on ethnic Albanian villages in
Kosovo have continued unabated despite previous NATO threats. His
seven-month crackdown on separatists fighting for the independence
of Kosovo has claimed hundreds of lives and forced as many as
275,000 people from their homes.
	   Forceful statements from the alliance's foreign ministers at
their meeting in Luxembourg in June had no visible effect. Massive
air exercises over Albania and Macedonia frightened no one. Ground
exercises in the same region failed to impress Belgrade. And recent
word out of Washington and Bonn that alliance patience is wearing
thin have had less effect on Serb forces than a speed bump on an
Abrams tank.
	   It's not only Kosovo that seems to be falling apart. In Bosnia,
where the allies have spent billions of dollars and claimed one of
their greatest successes, a Serbian hard-liner has defeated the
moderate Biljana Plavsic for the Bosnian Serb presidency, a severe
blow to Western plans.
	   All of this should give the defense ministers from the 16 NATO
nations, along with their counterparts from the three newly
selected members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, plenty to
talk about in the sun-and-sand resort of Vilamoura on Portugal's
south coast.
	   The Vilamoura gathering is the ministers' annual ``informal''
meeting, an occasion to sit around in a relaxed setting and
brainstorm about problems facing the alliance. While ministers
don't usually make decisions at these meetings, the rapidly
developing situation in the Balkans should focus their attention.
	   Thursday and Friday's meeting will mark the first time that
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic participate fully in NATO
deliberations. Fourteen of the 16 existing NATO nations have voted
to ratify accession of the three new members. The Netherlands and
Turkey have yet to do so.
	   The three will be officially welcomed into the NATO fold at a
summit in Washington in April.

Hub Power files lawsuits against Pakistan government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Hub Power Company, Pakistan's largest
private power company, which is mired in a bitter dispute over
power purchase rates with the government, has filed three lawsuits
against the government, a company spokesman said Wednesday.
	   ''The company in its petition has complained about the threats
to its officers, employees and direct contractors by the
government,'' a company statement said.
	   The suit was filed Tuesday in the Sindh High Court in Karachi.
	   The power company accuses the government of harassing its
employees and preventing them from traveling outside the country.
Details were not immediately available.
	   There was no immediate comment from the government.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government accuses Hub Power and
other private power companies of overcharging for the electricity
they are selling to the cash-strapped state utility, Water and
Power Development Authority.
	   The government wants tariffs cut 35 percent to 40 percent. It
also is trying to cancel contracts with electrical companies that
the government says paid bribes to former prime minister Benazir
Bhutto in exchange for permission to charge inflated rates. Both
Ms. Bhutto and power companies deny the allegations.
	   The dispute has badly effected the stock market in recent months
and shares of most private power companies have tumbled to new
lows.
	   The British National Power is a major shareholder in Hub Power
Company.

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Steve Simonsen became the most
expensive goalkeeper in British soccer history Wednesday when he
completed a 3.3-million-pound (dlrs 5.4 million) transfer from
Tranmere to Everton.
	   The signing of the 19-year-old 'keeper beats the 2.25 million
pounds (dlrs 3.7 million) Leeds paid Crystal Palace for Nigel
Martyn in July 1997.
	   Simonsen's contract is structured to take into account the
number of Premier League and England appearances he makes for the
club. Simonson is the England Under-21 'keeper.

Oil chiefs to meet for world summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to change focus of lede, CORRECT that
meeting will be in Venice stead Vienna; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With the global oil industry facing seriously
depressed prices and an uncertain future, top executives of some of
the biggest international petroleum companies are set to meet next
week to discuss a variety of issues, organizers said Wednesday.
	   The bosses of the oil companies are meeting Oct. 4-5 in Venice,
Italy _ but are taking careful pains to insist there is no
suggestion of price-fixing.
	   They have invited Lynn R. Coleman, a Washington energy lawyer
and former U.S. energy secretarty to attend all sessions.
	   The summit of about 20 companies is thought to be the first time
in recent years that oil industry chief executives have assembled
informally for talks on the future of the sector, the Financial
Times reported Wednesday.
	   ``The meeting, conceived over a year ago, is designed to provide
a forum for industry executives to meet and discuss key issues,
including industry restructuring, changing technology, the
geopolitics of petroleum and the industry in society,'' said J.
Robinson West, finance chairman of The Petroleum Finance Company,
the industry advisory company staging the event.
	   Petroleum Finance said there will be no discussion of pricing
arrangements at the meeting, where participants will include
representatives from a cross section of sectors, including
national, international and independent companies.
	   Companies expected to participate include some of the biggest
publicly quoted western oil groups, including Royal Dutch/Shell,
British Petroleum, Chevron, Elf Aquitaine, Total and Eni, the
Financial Times said.
	   Several of the largest state oil and gas groups, such as Saudi
Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer and exporter, and Statoil
of Norway, also plan to take part, along with the chief executives
of several leading independent oil companies, the newspaper said.
	   Russia will be represented by Gazprom, the country's biggest
company and its largest single source of hard currency, the
newspaper said.
	   The high-level talks follow BP's announcement last month that it
is to take over U.S. oil giant Amoco Corp in a 30.3 billion pound
(dlrs 53.9 billion) deal that is the biggest industrial merger in
U.S. history. The proposed marriage is currently being scrutinized
by the U.S. government for its implications for competition in the
marketplace.
	   The Financial Times quoted an unnamed senior European oil
industry executive as predicting that more big deals could result
from the gathering.
	   ``Everybody is on the prowl,'' the newspaper quoted him as
saying.
	   The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. offered a gloomy assessment
of the oil business last week, predicting depressed oil prices
won't recover any time soon, with the market glutted even as the
ripple effects of the Asian economic crisis.
	   Crude oil prices have plunged this year to levels unseen in a
decade _ and throughout the industry people are hoping to avoid a
repeat of the disaster that followed the price collapse of 1986.
	   The current troubles started in the winter, when OPEC started
pumping more oil just as the effects of the Asian economic crisis
began choking off demand.
	   OPEC has since said it would cut back production but its various
members have not lived up to their commitments _ leaving all
producers stuck with low prices.

Arafat rejects resignation of senior Palestinian negotiator
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat turned down a
request by one of the top Palestinian negotiators with Israel, Saeb
Erekat, to be relieved of the job, officials said Wednesday.
	   Erekat, a minister of local government in Arafat's Cabinet, was
apparently angered by Arafat's decision last month to set up a back
channel with Israel and give Palestinian Parliament Speaker Ahmed
Qureia a prominent role in those talks.
	   Erekat's resignation offer was a sign of rivalries within the
Palestinian team that stem, in part, from Arafat's practice of
appointing several people to the same job.
	   In the talks with Israel, neither Erekat nor Qureia appeared to
have had a real mandate, with political analysts saying Arafat
reserves the final authority for himself.
	   Palestinian commentator Ghassan Khatib said it did not matter
who negotiated for the Palestinians, ``because in the end it is
(Arafat) who does the decision-making.''
	   In the most recent example, Qureia told Arafat in the summer
that he was being asked by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's aide, Yitzhak Molcho, to hold secret talks.
	   Arafat told Qureia to give it a try. Qureia met seven times with
Molcho and three times with Netanyahu, most recently in August.
	   At the same time, Erekat was holding official talks with other
Netanyahu aides. While Erekat said publicly that no progress was
made, Molcho presented a draft on a West Bank pullback to Qureia.
	   Arafat in the end rejected the Israeli draft proposal, saying it
failed to address all elements of a U.S. peace initiative,
including plans for an additional troop withdrawal.
	   The United States, meanwhile, is pushing Israel and the
Palestinians to intensify talks on a troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank in the next few days.
	   During this time, Netanyahu and Arafat, accompanied by their
aides, were to be in New York to address the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Netanyahu was to speak on Thursday and Arafat on Monday, and
each was expected to meet separately with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   Erekat, who submitted his resignation Monday but was asked by
the Palestinian leader a day later to stay on, was to travel to New
York with Arafat, Palestinian officials said.

Asian stock markets close mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Wednesday,
with bargain hunting pushing up some markets and negative domestic
news pulling others down.
	   Stocks traded in Hong Kong climbed for a second straight day, as
investors bought shares of market heavyweight HSBC Holdings.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 130.88 points, or 1.8
percent, to close at 7,504.39. On Tuesday, the index surged 203.28
points.
	   Investors scooped up HSBC to take advantage of its low price
after the shares fell significantly over the past two weeks to
attractive levels relative the the company's earnings prospects,
traders said.
	   In Tokyo, Japanese financial markets were closed for a national
holiday.
	   On foreign exchange markets in Asia, the U.S. dollar was trading
at 136.54 yen late Wednesday, up 1.28 yen from late Tuesday in New
York.
	   Malaysian shares prices fell as investors digested the latest
political developments and an unprecedented series of statements by
the central bank, dealers said.
	   The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index
declined 9.19 points, or 2.4 percent, to close at 376.26.
	   Bank Negara, the country's central bank, re-released a statement
it had retracted Tuesday on loosening up banking regulations to
spur more lending to revive the economy.
	   Traders said the policy flip-flop hurt investors' confidence in
the market.
	   In Taiwan, shares fell after the release of higher August
unemployment figures and mounting concern over the local economy.
	   The key Weighted Stock Price Index shed 71.82 points, or 1
percent, to close at 6,962.17.
	   The number of jobless in August rose to 3.05 percent, the
highest level since Aug. 1996, reflecting the economic downturn in
Taiwan.
	   The government said the increase in joblessness was partly due
to downsizing and company closures.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher, but gains were capped by
uncertainty in neighboring Malaysia. The Straits Times Index closed
4.67 points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 900.99 points.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher on bargain hunting
following news the government has reached an agreement to roll over
its sovereign debt. The Composite Index rose 1.374 points to close
at 262.250 points.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower for the fourth
consecutive session. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 10.17 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 1,700.22.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher. The All
Ordinaries Index rose 39.2 points, or 1.5 percent to 2,573.6.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index fell 0.68 points to 291.93.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher on bargain-hunting
following a three-session losing streak. The 30-share Philippine
Stock Exchange Index closed up 36.39 points, or 3.2 prescient, to
1,159.69.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher amid buying in
blue-chip stocks by some institutional investors who believed the
Thai bourse has bottomed out. The Stock Exchange of Thailand Index
rose 8.14 points, or 3.6 percent, to 231.28.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Authorities Wednesday dismissed a claim of
responsibility for a bomb blast in downtown Milan that shattered
windows of a tax office, saying the group has never been heard of
before.
	   The only person injured was a man aboard a bus that passed just
as the bomb went off Tuesday night. He suffered cuts.
	   Investigators said the bomb was rudimentary and not very
powerful.
	   A group calling itself the Yellow Brigades claimed
responsibility in a call to police headquarters nearly 12 hours
after the blast.

Rees-Jones files suit against Ritz hotel and car service
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole
survivor of the car crash that killed Princess Diana, lodged a
complaint Wednesday against the Ritz Hotel and the Etoile-Limousine
car service for ``endangering the lives of others.''
	   At the time of the Aug. 31, 1997 crash, Rees-Jones was an
employee of Ritz owner Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of Dodi Fayed,
Diana's companion, who also died in the crash.
	   The driver of the car, Henri Paul, chief of security at the Ritz
Hotel, who also was killed in the crash, was legally drunk and
taking prescription drugs for depression at the time.
	   Paul was not licensed to drive the Mercedes 600 sedan, provided
to the Ritz by Etoile-Limousine. It remains unclear whether Ritz
management, including Al Fayed, was aware that Paul had been
drinking and taking medication before taking the wheel.
	   Questions recently have been raised as to whether the car had
faulty brakes and whether the Ritz was warned.
	   The Ritz maintains that photographers chasing the couple
precipitated the accident.
	   Under French law, lodging a complaint is the first step in
filing for damages.

More than 10,000 South Korean officials purged or reprimanded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ More than 10,000 public servants in
South Korea, including two assistant Cabinet ministers, have been
fired or reprimanded in an anti-corruption campaign, the government
announced Wednesday.
	   At the instruction of President Kim Dae-jung, the agency charged
with government management said it has been conducting a secret
probe of ministries and state-funded organizations since July to
ferret out corrupt officials.
	   About 500 officials were fired for taking bribes, the agency
said in a news release. They included two deputy Cabinet ministers
and 13 other senior officials indicted on bribery charges.
	   The remainder were given pay cuts and subjected to other
disciplinary actions, the release said.
	   Since its inception in February, Kim's government has campaigned
against corruption as a means of making South Korea a more
desirable place for foreign investment.
	   All previous governments fought to eradicate corruption among
government officials, teachers and businessmen. But the practice of
exchanging bribes and treating government officials to lavish
parties remains widespread.
	   South Korea has about 910,000 government officials, including
280,000 public school teachers. It also employs about 278,000
officials in 490 government-funded companies and other
institutions.

Vietnam will readjust economic targets amid regional crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam will again lower its economic
targets for next year as the regional economic crisis takes its
toll, the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan reported Wednesday.
	   New targets should be finalized by October when the next session
of the National Assembly convenes, said an economist who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``Our economic growth is slowing down. Many set economic targets
are not being met and there are also unresolved cultural and social
problems,'' Nhan Dan said.
	   The previous revision was announced last July after the
government lowered the target for gross domestic product growth to
between six to seven percent from nine percent.
	   The target for export growth was also lowered to 10 percent from
27 percent, while the target for industrial growth dropped from
13.5 percent to between 10 and 11 percent.
	   Investment from other Southeast Asian countries, Vietnam's major
trading partners, has dropped sharply since the regional crisis
started over a year ago.
	   Prime Minister Phan Van Khai urged government ministers and
local administrators at a recent monthly meeting to speed up
economic reforms and make the best use of domestic resources, Nhan
Dan reported.
	   The national currency, the dong, has lost over 20 percent of its
value since March 1997.

Opposition wins pardon agreement for prisoner of conscience
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Co-prime minister Hun Sen has agreed
to pardon an opposition party official convicted in questionable
circumstances of killing a relative of the Cambodian leader,
opposition and government sources said Wednesday.
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy Party announced in a statement that
Hun Sen had agreed to request a royal pardon for party security
chief Srun Vong Vannak, convicted last September for the 1996
murder of Hun Sen's brother-in-law Kov Samuth, a national police
official.
	   Vannak is currently serving a 13-year sentence at a Phnom Penh
prison.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International has described
Vannak as a ``prisoner of conscience,'' charging he was detained
``solely for his peaceful political affiliation and wrongly
convicted on politically motivated criminal charges.'' It has been
calling for his immediate and unconditional release.
	   ``While we would welcome the release from prison of Srun Vong
Vannak, we remain very concerned that the judgment against him
still stands,'' an Amnesty spokesman said Wednesday from the
group's headquarters in London.
	   ``This does not constitute an unconditional release which is
what we would ask for any prisoner of conscience,'' said the
spokesman, who declined to be named.
	   Vannak was arrested without a warrant in February 1997 and held
incommunicado for more than two weeks during which police extracted
a confession of Kov Samuth's murder. He disavowed it in court.
	   Two other men charged and convicted in the case, whose testimony
was instrumental to Vannak's conviction, recanted their testimony
shortly after the trial. They told human rights groups in letters
from prison that their confessions had been made under duress.
	   The Sam Rainsy party said Wednesday that Hun Sen agreed to the
pardon during Tuesday's summit meeting of rival party leaders in
the northwestern town of Siem Reap. The meeting was meant to end
the nation's post-election political turmoil and pave the wayFed wait only for a final
decision in the case before the pardon can move forward. He said
withdrawing the appeal would hasten the process.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk also said during the meeting that ``he
would be happy to grant this amnesty,'' according to the Sam Rainsy
Party's statement. In the past, the king has granted politically
sensitive pardons only with the express agreement of the country's
political leadership.

U.N. appeals for dlrs 139 million in aid to China's flood victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The United Nations launched an appeal Wednesday
for a total dlrs 139 million in disaster relief for flood victims
threatened by disease and impending cold weather.
	   The aid would be used to provide food, shelter, sanitation,
health care and other urgent needs of some 5.8 million people left
homeless by widespread flooding along the Yangtze River and in
northeastern China.
	   ``These are the people we identified as being very poor, very
vulnerable, and particularly in need,'' said Else Larsen, director
of the World Food Program in China.
	   The floods, the worst in decades, killed more than 3,000 people
and affected about 233 million. Many lost crops, livestocks and all
their possessions, said Kerstin Leitner, U.N. resident coordinator
in China.
	   To help meet the appeal, U.S. Ambassador to China James R.
Sasser announced that the U.S. government would provide dlrs 1.125
million in flood disaster relief, including dlrs 825,000 for the
U.N. appeal.
	   U.N. relief workers who recently toured flood ravaged areas said
some 2.9 million people remained camped atop Yangtze dikes still
surrounded by water, with conditions deteriorating due to the
cooler weather and a lack of sanitation.
	   Rats and other rodents that fled to the dikes along with the
human population were an additional health threat.
	   ``All drinking water supplies will have to be cleaned.
Otherwise, there will be an enormous threat of epidemics,'' Leitner
said. ``Although there have been no epidemics up to now it's going
to be a critical time.''
	   Many of those who died in previous floods in China perished of
diseases after the initial crisis had passed.
	   Most of those people will be trapped on the dikes for another
two months while waters receed very slowly over the waterlogged
land, the U.N. team members said.
	   In northeastern China, some 1.3 million people remain homeless.
In some areas, flood waters have been too deep for vehicles and too
shallow for boats, preventing delivery of shelter, clothing and
other aid supplies, they said.
	   Nighttime temperatures in northern China already are dropping to
about 0 C (32 F) and will plummet in another six weeks to as low as
minus 30 C (minus 22 F).
	   ``Without warm clothing and shelter, they are facing the danger
of freezing,'' Leitner said.
	   The U.N. appeal includes funds to buy construction materials,
plastic sheeting and insulation to enable families to put walls and
roofs on dugout mud shelters they are building in their destroyed
homes.

Liberian lawmakers cancel protest outside U.S. Embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Liberian lawmakers ordered
pro-government groups to abandon plans Wednesday to protest in
front of the U.S. Embassy, where a former warlord has taken refuge
since weekend gun battles.
	   The Liberian Senate said in a statement it had ordered a
demonstration organized by 15 civic groups to be canceled to
prevent ``certain unscrupulous individuals from exploiting the
situation to cause further chaos.''
	   The groups had planned to march to the embassy compound on the
western edge of the city center to protest the presence of former
rebel leader Roosevelt Johnson in the embassy.
	   Dozens of people died in a two-day clash involving forces loyal
to President Charles Taylor and supporters of Johnson _ the
president's chief rival.
	   Johnson turned up at the U.S. Embassy on Saturday, but was fired
on by Liberian forces as he spoke with embassy officials outside
the gate.
	   Johnson, two of his sons and several aides rushed into the
compound, but not before four of his men were killed and two
Americans wounded. He remained holed up in the embassy.
	   It is unclear what will happen to Johnson, though U.S. officials
have said he will not be handed over the government.
	   Taylor has promised that the embassy won't come under attack,
but the embassy has nevertheless evacuated nonessential staff and
flown in extra servicemen by helicopter. Most diplomats don't move
without a flak jacket and helmet.
	   Although the fighting has stopped, some people remain nervous,
recalling Liberia's civil war, which ended two years ago after
150,000 were killed and half the country's population became
refugees.

Russian government seeks additional aid from international lenders

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's new government
sought foreign assistance in a series of meetings Wednesday with
international lenders, but Russia appeared unlikely to get
additional money anytime soon.
	   Primakov has been calling on foreign lenders to help Russia
through its current economic crisis, and he renewed his request in
discussions with the visiting head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
	   ``We favor expansion of the EBRD's operations in Russia,''
Primakov said at the start of talks with the bank's president Horst
Koehler.
	   The EBRD, established in 1991 to help countries in Eastern
Europe move toward market economies, has provided loans to a number
of Russian industries.
	   ``I believe in Russia's ability to overcome the current
difficulties,'' Koehler was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   However, many private investors have fled Russia in recent
months, and foreign banks that bought billions of dollars of
government bonds have complained that they are being discriminated
against while the government tries to bail out Russian banks.
	   Other lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund, are
expected to delay installments on existing loans at least until the
new government details its plans for coping with the crisis. There
has been no serious talk of new loans to Russia by the IMF or
anyone else.
	   Meanwhile, a government auditor said he was misquoted in recent
reports in which he allegedly said billions of dollars of Western
loans had been either misused or stolen by Russia.
	   Venyamin Sokolov, chief auditor of parliament's Auditing
Chamber, spoke with the British Broadcasting Corp. over the weekend
and was quoted as saying that the IMF should not extend any more
loans to Russia because earlier money was mishandled.
	   At a news conference Wednesday, Sokolov said his words had been
misinterpreted and he had no evidence that IMF money had been
misspent. He did, however, criticize the IMF for its financial
advice to Russia and urged the Russian government to stop borrowing
abroad.
	   Russian officials were planning to hold separate talks with a
visiting IMF delegation, as well as discussions with Western banks
seeking better terms on debt restructuring deals.
	   Russia's banking system has been virtually paralyzed by the
crisis, which hit just over a month ago. Some banks remain closed,
while others are handling only limited transactions. Most
individual and corporate clients still cannot make routine payments
and transfers.
	   The foreign lenders are seeking assurances that Primakov's
government will continue free-market reforms, maintain control over
the money supply and offer foreign investors equal terms with
Russian companies and banks.
	   Primakov has been in office for 12 days and has yet to outline
his economic program or fill several key cabinet posts.
	   A new finance minister is expected to be named Thursday, and the
government also plans to present a tax reform package to parliament
soon, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin said Wednesday.
	   Also, Russian oil production in August was 24.8 million tons,
1.9 percent lower than in the same month last year. Oil is a
leading Russian export, and sagging world prices have contributed
to the country's economic woes.

China too slow in opening markets, U.S. trade official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A senior U.S. trade official accused China
Wednesday of stalling on opening its markets, saying slow progress
on trade was hurting economic ties.
	   China's failure to remove barriers to U.S. investments and
exports is ``taking a toll on our bilateral commercial relations,''
U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce David Aaron told a gathering of
U.S. business executives.
	   ``Ironically, our commercial relationship, which in the past has
helped us through difficult times, threatens to become the source
of increasing political friction,'' he said.
	   Aaron said China's trade surplus with the United States could
reach dlrs 60 billion by the end of the year, a 20 percent jump
over 1997.
	   The remarks reflect a resurgence of trade tensions, which had
eased in the months before and after U.S. President Bill Clinton's
June visit to China.
	   Beijing reacted angrily when the U.S. government recently
imposed new rules requiring treatment and certification of wooden
packaging from China to prevent destructive beetles from infesting
shipments.
	   The U.S. side has expressed impatience with the slow progress of
China's bid to join the World Trade Organization. That, and a lack
of movement on bilateral trade issues were ``cause for serious
concern,'' Aaron said.
	   Aaron predicted that congressional support for normal trade
relations would weaken if China did not do more to open its
markets.
	   The U.S. Congress votes annually whether or not to renew the
same tariffs the U.S. extends to most other nations, known as
``most favored nation'' status.
	   Chinese officials have claimed they are making progress on WTO
membership and have accused the United States and other countries
of making excessive demands at a time when their country is
struggling to carry out market-oriented reforms despite slowing
economic growth and rising unemployment.

Taiwan, China edge closer, slightly, to ending estrangement
</HEADLINE>

negotiations; no pickup; ADDS byline
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Rivals China and Taiwan on Wednesday edged closer
to ending their recent estrangement by ironing out details for
their first high-level meeting in five years.
	   Negotiators for Beijing and Taipei worked out plans for a
meeting next month between Taiwan's Koo Chen-fu and China's Wang
Daohan, elderly statesmen charged with trying to forge relations in
the absence of formal ties.
	   Koo and Wang have met for talks only once before, in Singapore
in 1993.
	   Lower-level officials were negotiating a second meeting when
China shut down talks in 1995 in anger over what Beijing perceived
as Taiwan's drift toward independence and away from reunification.
	   China also launched test-missiles and held war games around
Taiwan in an intermittent show of force that further alienated many
Taiwanese.
	   In an indication of the delicacy in bringing together the two
sides _ heirs to the seven-decade-old Chinese civil war _
negotiators spent several hours Wednesday discussing sightseeing
venues for Koo's visit to the mainland Oct. 14-19.
	   In the end, Shi Hwei-yow, secretary-general of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation, and Zhang Jincheng of China's Association for
Relations Across the Straits decided that Koo and Wang would not be
holding formal negotiations, but just ``exchanging opinions.''
	   The association, which invited Koo, apparently did not budge
from conditions that the trip be heavy on sightseeing and that Wang
and Koo meet in Shanghai, and not Beijing as Taipei requested.
	   ``If Mr. Wang Daohan doesn't come to Beijng, we as guests can in
no way force him. Our view then is that we should start in
Shanghai,'' Shi told reporters at the end of Wednesday afternoon's
talks.
	   Wang and Koo will meet at least four times during the visit, Shi
said. In addition, while in Beijing Koo will meet Vice Premier Qian
Qichen and may visit Peking Univeristy and the Forbidden City, the
former imperial palace.
	   Shi stressed that the arrangements could change. He was meeting
again with association officials over dinner Wednesday and before
his return to Taipei on Thursday.
	   With slight progress in hand, both sides declared success.
	   ``What's important is that Koo and Wang have several
opportunities to meet and exchange opinions,'' Shi said. ``That is
satisfactory.''
	   Association spokesman Li Yafei said anything that improves the
atmosphere is good for relations.
	   Even if the Wang and Koo meeting comes off, obstacles remain to
resuming negotiations.
	   Taiwan wants the talks to resume where they left off: covering
practical issues like fishing disputes as confidence builders.
China wants negotiations to move quickly to the topic of
reunification.
	   China and Taiwan have been separated for all but four of the
last hundred years. A brief reunification ended in 1949, when Mao
Tse-tung's Communists won a civil war and forced Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists from the mainland.

Malaysian media tows the government line in dispute with ousted
</HEADLINE>
deputy
 &UR; With Malaysia-Politics
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Worried about losing their jobs,
many Malaysian reporters would rather keep mum at a news conference
than grill a government official. At times, they prod foreign
journalists to pose questions in their stead.
	   That deference is apparent in the media coverage of the tumult
surrounding Anwar Ibrahim, the ousted deputy prime minister who was
jailed after spearheading opposition to his ex-boss, Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Editorial pages have largely been silent on the dispute between
Anwar and the prime minister, bitter foes who once enjoyed a
harmonious relationship as protege and mentor.
	   Often accused of muffling the media, Mahathir has said he
believes in press freedom as long as the reports are fair and do
not threaten national security. Critics scoff.
	   ``There's absolutely no chance of any dissenting voice,'' said
Indrajit Banerjee, a communications lecturer at University Sains
Malaysia in the city of Penang.
	   Anwar had staged a string of anti-government rallies since his
ouster Sept. 2, culminating in his arrest Sunday after police broke
up a protest by thousands of supporters in Kuala Lumpur. He has
been accused of sedition and sexual misconduct.
	   In a rare comment Wednesday, the pro-government New Straits
Times echoed Mahathir's accusation that the foreign press is trying
to damage Malaysia's image with negative reports on the political
turbulence.
	   ``Most of its retinue are transient journeymen. They flit in and
out of the country, writing and filing reports based on their
perceived rights and wrongs and collated from selected sources,''
the newspaper said in an editorial.
	   On Monday, the British Broadcasting Corp. and other foreign
television media accused the government of censorship. RTM, the
state-owned broadcasting house, blocked satellite transmissions of
footage of Anwar's arrest and protests but relented after diplomats
complained.
	   The Malaysian media is severely circumscribed by a law against
sedition, which forbids reporting on issues that the government
considers a threat to national security.
	   ``We've been working under those conditons for years,'' said a
senior newspaper reporter who requested anonymity. ``We just have
to tread carefully and abide by those laws.''
	   Most big newspapers are owned or controlled by the ruling UMNO
party and are required to get an operating license annually under a
law dating from British colonial days. The government can revoke
the license at any time.
	   In August, Mahathir forced the resignations of the chief editors
of Malaysia's two largest Malay newspapers, Utusan Melayu and
Berita Hariman, as well as the head of TV3, a private television
news station. All three were viewed as Anwar supporters.
	   Newspapers, however, reported the content of Anwar's speeches
before his arrest, including his description of Mahathir as a
``dictator.'' The prime minister, who has led his party to
landslide electoral victories four times since 1982, took the
attack in stride.
	   ``Now, I'm labeled a dictator. Well, an elected dictator, of
course,'' he said at a news conference.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Wednesday,
with bargain hunting pushing up some markets and negative domestic
news pulling others down. Stocks traded in Hong Kong climbed for a
second straight day, as investors bought shares of market
heavyweight HSBC Holdings. On foreign exchange markets in Asia, the
U.S. dollar was trading at 136.54 yen late Wednesday, up 1.28 yen
from late Tuesday in New York. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ International lenders ended marathon
talks in Paris Wednesday and agreed to reschedule dlrs 4.2 billion
of Indonesian sovereign debt payments, Indonesia's top economic
minister said. The decision, made before dawn Wednesday, is
regarded as crucial to attempts by the financially crippled country
to put its house in order as it tackles its worst economic crisis
in a generation. The meeting _ under the auspices of the so-called
Paris Club of creditor nations _ decided that all sovereign debts
due between Aug. 6, 1998, to March 31, 2000, will be rescheduled
over a period of between 11 and 20 years. (INDONESIA-DEBT)

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government and foreign firms lose an
estimated dlrs 1 billion a year due to the sale of counterfeit
goods in Russia, which range from handicrafts to computer software,
a government official said Wednesday. ``The illegal use of
copyrights is inflicting huge damage on Russia,'' Oleg Sviridov,
deputy chairman of the State Customs Committee, said at a
conference devoted to the topic. ``An immense sum of tax revenue is
not paid to the (state) budget,'' Sviridov was quoted as saying by
the Interfax news agency. The Russian government is chronically
short of cash, but it has shown little interest in stopping the
sale of counterfeit goods that cost it so much money.
(RUSSIA-COUNTERFEITS)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Latin America will not suffer the financial turmoil
that has engulfed Russia and Asia, the head of the International
Monetary Fund said in an interview published Wednesday. Michel
Camdessus told Le Figaro, a conservative French daily, that
although the economic trouble that has plagued Asia and Russia was
not over, he did not think the world was headed for a recession.
``The crisis is spreading, but I don't think despite the drop in
prices for raw materials and the recession in Japan that we are in
a free-fall scenario leading to worldwide deflation.''
(FRANCE-CAMDESSUS)
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam will again lower its economic
targets for next year as the regional economic crisis takes its
toll, the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan reported Wednesday.
New targets should be finalized by October when the next session of
the National Assembly convenes, said an economist who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The previous revision was announced last
July after the government lowered the target for gross domestic
product growth to between six to seven percent from nine percent.

Blood possibly contaminated with mad cow disease spills on highway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eight people were taken to hospital Wednesday
after a tanker spilled 22 tons of cattle blood possibly
contaminated with mad cow disease on a highway.
	   West Midlands police said a seal failed Wednesday morning on a
tanker carrying the blood north along the M6 highway between
Wednesbury and Walsall in central England.
	   Police Inspector Clive Isherwood said the blood is believed to
be from cows over 36 months old, destroyed as part of the
government's campaign to eradicate bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or BSE, from the national herd, and was itself due
to be destroyed.
	   ``It is not known of the blood is infected with BSE, but we are
taking all precautions necessary to ensure the safety of the
public,'' he said.
	   Four firefighters, two police officers, the tanker driver and
his wife were all taken to Walsall Manor Hospital to be cleaned up,
he said.
	   Two of the highway's three lanes were closed while the blood was
removed, causing long lines of traffic.

	   With three events remaining, Westwood has won 615,652 pounds
(dlrs 1,034,295), just ahead of Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland
with winnings of 606,067 pounds (dlrs 1,018,193).
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, the five-time defending European
money leader, has earned 593,417 (dlrs 996,941) and is far ahead of
the No. 4 name on the list, Patrik Sjoland of Sweden.
	   The remaining events on the European Tour include this week's
German Open followed by the Belgacom Open and the season-ending
Volvo Masters in Jerez, Spain.

Letter-writing campaign launched against United takeover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ More than 28,000 letters were mailed
to Manchester United shareholders Wednesday as part of a campaign
to stop the takeover of the club by Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB.
	   The United board has accepted the proposed 623-million-pound
(dlrs 1 billion) deal, which still needs approval of the club's
shareholders and government regulators.
	   A group called Shareholders United Against Murdoch has written
to all registered shareholders urging them to oppose the deal.
	   Founder member Michael Crick, who started the mail campaign at a
central Manchester post office, said: ``We want to get one message
across to the small shareholders: it's very important they do not
accept this deal.''
	   The deal is expected to go through _ subject to government
approval _ if institutional shareholders back it. But Crick said
opposition from the minority private shareholders could stop it.
	   ``We're working on the assumption that most individual
shareholders are United supporters,'' he said. ``Of course there
will be some that are just investors but the fact that a lot own
just a few shares each suggests a lot are fans.''
	   If enough banded together they could stop the deal by putting
pressure on politicians and the Office of Fair Trading, Crick said.

Philippine Airlines cancels closure while talks with union continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with PAL canceling closure because of union
offer
 &UR; AP Photos Staffing
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In a dramatic reprieve, Philippine
Airlines announced late Wednesday that it would not close as
scheduled at midnight because of ongoing negotiations with its
largest labor union.
	   All flights will be suspended while the talks continue, but
company facilities will remain open as normal, it said.
	   Earlier in the day, the ground workers' union offered to accept
a management-proposed rescue plan, but with modifications. PAL has
said the plan is a prerequisite for it to recover from a series of
crippling strikes and Asia's currency crisis.
	   Asked if the company's closure has now been averted, PAL
chairman Lucio Tan replied, ``It's still up to the unions.''
	   Tan holds a 70 percent stake in the airline, while the
government owns about 18 percent.
	   At Philippine Airlines offices around the country, airline
workers had held masses and prayer vigils Wednesday, hoping for a
way to avoid the flag carrier's scheduled midnight closure.
	   At Manila's airport, PAL workers lined up during their lunch
break in front of the domestic terminal with signs reading ``Keep
PAL flying,'' and prayed for an hour.
	   The government, meanwhile, struggled to prepare for the
shutdown's expected impact on the country's already ailing economy.
	   The scheduled demise of Asia's oldest airline had saddened many
Filipinos. Several television stations broadcast poignant scenes
Wednesday from its 57-year history.
	   On Tuesday, the ground workers had voted to reject the
management-proposed recovery plan.
	   But the union offered to accept the plan on Wednesday with
changes.
	   In the plan, Tan had offered workers 20 percent of the airline's
stock and three seats on its board in exchange for a 10-year
suspension of their collective bargaining agreement.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu, the head of an inter-agency
task force on PAL's closure, said the union's proposed changes
include an annual review of workers' salaries even though the
collective bargaining agreement is suspended.
	   He said the union is holding talks with the Labor Department to
discuss the modifications.
	   Asked if the closure had been averted, Espiritu replied, ``We
are hoping for a miracle.''
	   The airline announced last week that it would close at midnight
Wednesday as a result of the unions' rejection of the rescue plan.
	   PAL says creditors, to whom it owes dlrs 2.1 billion, have
insisted on guarantees of labor harmony before they approve a
restructuring plan.
	   PAL currently has a 50 percent share of domestic passenger
traffic, down from 75 percent before a pilots' strike in June.
	   PAL's closure would leave many areas of the sprawling
archipelago of 7,000 islands without air service. Two smaller
carriers were grounded last week over safety concerns and financial
problems.
	   The only alternative for travel among the country's islands is
slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries. Last Friday, a ferry carrying
454 people sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila.
	   If PAL closes, it would be the largest company to fail in the
Philippines since the onset of Asia's currency crisis, which hit
just as the airline was launching a dlrs 4 billion expansion and
refleeting plan.

Havel suggests Albright for Czech president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel has
an unusual idea for who might succeed him someday: Madeleine
Albright. And he swears he's not kidding.
	   Havel said Wednesday he hasn't had a chance to discuss his
proposal with the Czech-born U.S. secretary of state, whose maiden
name is Marie Korbelova.
	   ``It occurred to me on the plane on my way back home from
America, so I did not have the chance to ask her,'' said Havel, who
returned Saturday from an official visit to the United States.
	   It was not clear what impact, if any, the president's suggestion
would have on Czech legislators who elect the president.
	   Havel acknowledges he may not have a say in the issue.
	   ``It is not the president who decides who will become
president,'' he said.
	   Also, Czechs may not agree. According to a poll released last
week, almost two-thirds of the population cannot imagine anyone
other than Havel holding the presidential office.
	   Havel's current term, which is required to be his last, expires
in 2002. There is speculation that the often-ailing president may
step down early.

Tajik opposition troops return from Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A group of 25 Tajik opposition troops returned
home from neighboring Afghanistan on Wednesday with the help of
Russian border guards, a news report said.
	   About 250 opposition fighters are still in Afghanistan, awaiting
repatriation and integration into the Tajikistan government forces
under a peace accord signed last year.
	   Alexander Kondratyev, a Russian border guards spokesman, told
the Interfax news agency that the rebel troops were ferried across
the Pyandzh river from Afghanistan to Tajikistan on Russian border
patrol boats.
	   He said the boats will eventually bring all the remaining Tajik
opposition troops home.
	   Despite the 1997 peace accord, Tajikistan remains restive. There
are periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the
mostly Islamic opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the
peace deal and wage turf battles with one another.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Rivals China and Taiwan on Wednesday edged closer
to ending their recent estrangement by ironing out details for
their first high-level meeting in five years. Negotiators for
Beijing and Taipei worked out plans for a meeting next month
between Taiwan's Koo Chen-fu and China's Wang Daohan, elderly
statesmen charged with trying to forge relations in the absence of
formal ties. Koo and Wang have met for talks only once before, in
Singapore in 1993. Lower-level officials were negotiating a second
meeting when China shut down talks in 1995 in anger over what
Beijing perceived as Taiwan's drift toward independence and away
from reunification. (CHINA-TAIWAN)
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hurricane Georges's wind and rain
swept into Haiti on Wednesday, where officials braced for flash
floods and landslides amid the eroded mountains of the impoverished
Caribbean nation. As Georges marched relentlessly northwest, a
hurricane watch was posted Wednesday for south Florida. Warnings
were declared in Cuba from Sancti Spiritus province eastward and in
the central and southern Bahamas. The mammoth storm was on a
trajectory that could send it crashing into the Florida Keys by
late Thursday or early Friday. Authorities urged tourists to leave
the island chain, and residents began boarding up windows.
(CARIBBEAN-HURRICANE)
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African troops tried to mop up
stubborn resistance near a Lesotho military compound Wednesday
while soldiers from Botswana fanned out in the kingdom's gutted
capital to stop looting. Many stores were still smoldering from
fires set on Tuesday, when 600 South African troops crossed the
border to quell a military uprising. At the Makoanyne barracks
northeast of Maseru, where 10 South African soldiers died Tuesday
during a South African helicopter and infantry assault, dawn was
punctuated by bursts of machine-gun fire from a mountain
overlooking the compound. (LESOTHO)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities on Wednesday
interrogated the wife of the country's imprisoned opposition leader
in a relentless drive to stifle any further challenges to Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule. Azizah Ismail was
questioned about her role in the reform movement headed by her
husband, former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
Anwar was arrested Sunday amid a wave of domestic political turmoil
that has rocked the Southeast Asian nation and alarmed many foreign
leaders. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ Tough talk and saber-rattling over
Kosovo haven't made much of an impression on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, so NATO defense ministers meeting here Thursday
and Friday will have to ratchet things up a notch to get his
attention. Four months ago, passions were high at NATO and the
alliance was threatening imminent action. That passion cooled over
the summer, however, as Western capitals questioned the
effectiveness of direct military intervention in the restive
province. Now senior diplomats in the United States and Germany are
sounding the get-tough siren again. (NATO-KOSOVO)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami flew home today
amid speculation that Iran might pull back from its death sentence
against British author Salman Rushdie. More than 30 reporters were
waiting for Khatami at the airport, but he made no mention of
Rushdie. Instead, he focused on the tension between Iran and
Afghanistan, saying ``We don't want military confrontation or
war.'' At a news conference Tuesday in New York, Khatami suggested
that Iran wanted to put the Rushdie affair behind it, saying Iran
considered the matter ``completely finished.'' Rushdie has been in
hiding since 1989 when the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini issued a ``fatwa,'' or religious edict, saying he should
be punished for blasphemy against Islam for his book ``The Satanic
Verses.'' (IRAN-KHATAMI)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Wednesday,
with bargain hunting pushing up some markets and negative domestic
news pulling others down. Stocks traded in Hong Kong climbed for a
second straight day, as investors bought shares of market
heavyweight HSBC Holdings. On foreign exchange markets in Asia, the
U.S. dollar was trading at 136.54 yen late Wednesday, up 1.28 yen
from late Tuesday in New York. (ASIAN MARKETS)

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ International lenders ended marathon
talks in Paris Wednesday and agreed to reschedule dlrs 4.2 billion
of Indonesian sovereign debt payments, Indonesia's top economic
minister said. The decision, made before dawn Wednesday, is
regarded as crucial to attempts by the financially crippled country
to put its house in order as it tackles its worst economic crisis
in a generation. The meeting _ under the auspices of the so-called
Paris Club of creditor nations _ decided that all sovereign debts
due between Aug. 6, 1998, to March 31, 2000, will be rescheduled
over a period of between 11 and 20 years. (INDONESIA-DEBT)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's new government
sought foreign assistance in a series of meetings Wednesday with
international lenders, but Russia appeared unlikely to get
additional money anytime soon. Primakov has been calling on foreign
lenders to help Russia through its current economic crisis, and he
renewed his request in discussions with the visiting head of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. ``We favor
expansion of the EBRD's operations in Russia,'' Primakov said at
the start of talks with the bank's president Horst Koehler.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government and foreign firms lose an
estimated dlrs 1 billion a year due to the sale of counterfeit
goods in Russia, which range from handicrafts to computer software,
a government official said Wednesday. ``The illegal use of
copyrights is inflicting huge damage on Russia,'' Oleg Sviridov,
deputy chairman of the State Customs Committee, said at a
conference devoted to the topic. ``An immense sum of tax revenue is
not paid to the (state) budget,'' Sviridov was quoted as saying by
the Interfax news agency. The Russian government is chronically
short of cash, but it has shown little interest in stopping the
sale of counterfeit goods that cost it so much money.
(RUSSIA-COUNTERFEITS)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Latin America will not suffer the financial turmoil
that has engulfed Russia and Asia, the head of the International
Monetary Fund said in an interview published Wednesday. Michel
Camdessus told Le Figaro, a conservative French daily, that
although the economic trouble that has plagued Asia and Russia was
not over, he did not think the world was headed for a recession.
``The crisis is spreading, but I don't think despite the drop in
prices for raw materials and the recession in Japan that we are in
a free-fall scenario leading to worldwide deflation.''
(FRANCE-CAMDESSUS)
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam will again lower its economic
targets for next year as the regional economic crisis takes its
toll, the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan reported Wednesday.
New targets should be finalized by October when the next session of
the National Assembly convenes, said an economist who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The previous revision was announced last
July after the government lowered the target for gross domestic
product growth to between six to seven percent from nine percent.

Politicians discuss deadlock over IRA disarmament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Britain's governor for Northern
Ireland predicted Wednesday that the Irish Republican Army would
start disarming, the issue that has long bedeviled efforts to make
a peace agreement work.
	   ``It's no longer a question of if (weapons) decommissioning is
going to take place, it's a question of when,'' Mo Mowlam said
after discussing obstacles to April's peace agreement with Irish
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in Dublin.
	   Ahern said he wanted to see disarmament ``the sooner the
better,'' but neither he nor Mowlam said they had any deadline in
mind.
	   David Trimble, the Protestant politician elected to lead a new
multi-party government for Northern Ireland, insisted he won't
allow leaders of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party to participate
unless commanders of the outlawed IRA start disarming first.
	   ``It's not a matter of preconditions. It's a matter of them
doing what they agreed to do,'' Trimble said before launching a
public-relations drive to attract tourists from the Irish Republic
to Northern Ireland.
	   Noting that April's agreement had already provided early paroles
for more than 20 of an eligible 200 IRA prisoners, Trimble said it
would be ``quite wrong for them to expect to benefit ... if they're
defaulting on their obligations.''
	   Trimble leads the Ulster Unionist Party, chief representative of
the north's British Protestant majority. In July a new legislative
Assembly _ part of the new government framework for Northern
Ireland _ elected him to lead an administration alongside a
moderate Catholic politician, Seamus Mallon.
	   Other members of the as-yet-unformed administration must be
approved by majorities of the Assembly's Protestant and Catholic
blocs. Trimble, opposed by many Protestants, has a vulnerable
two-vote majority within the Protestant bloc.
	   April's agreement said Sinn Fein should press the IRA to destroy
its secret arms dumps by mid-2000. But it set no deadline for the
process to start, nor did it specify penalties if it failed to
happen. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams insisted Monday that IRA
disarmament was ``a dead-end issue'' and beyond his powers to
deliver.
	   Ahern and Mowlam want Trimble to invite Sinn Fein into the new
administration next month regardless of what the IRA does. Meetings
between Trimble and Ahern late Tuesday in Dublin, and between
Trimble and Adams earlier that day in Belfast, made no reported
progress.
	   Meanwhile, police in the Irish Republic arrested, then freed
without charge, seven men on suspicion of involvement in the
Continuity IRA, a dissident offshoot that has refused to join the
parent group's July 1997 truce.
	   Police seized a .22-calibre rifle and a handgun during searches
of the suspects' homes in Dublin and County Kildare west of the
Irish capital.
	   They are continuing to interrogate six men arrested Monday on
suspicion of involvement in another dissident group dubbed the Real
IRA, which killed 29 people in a car bombing last month. That group
called a cease-fire in the wake of that attack, Northern Ireland's
deadliest in its 30 years of political violence.

Portuguese media to blank out lurid aspects of Clinton probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal's main media outlets have had
enough of the lurid details about U.S. President Bill Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and say they won't repeat any
more of the sexual accusations against him.
	   In a joint statement issued Wednesday, the main national
newspapers, radio and TV stations issued a joint statement saying
they would no longer cover the ``intimate aspects'' of the
investigation into U.S. President Bill Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
	   Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's investigation had become
``inquisitorial,'' ``degrading'' and ``obscene,'' the statement
said.
	   The statement _ issued by the three national television
channels, four top radio stations, seven daily newspapers and a
weekly news magazine _ said the investigation had turned into a
``grotesque display of collective voyeurism.''
	   ``It is our profound conviction that the intimate life of a
human being, even if he is the president of the U.S., does not
justify this obscene intrusion,'' the statement said.
	   ``We will continue, obviously, to provide news about North
American issues which we believe to be of journalistic interest.''
	   Portugal is a largely conservative country and one where news
coverage rarely strays into the private lives of public officials.
	   However, the Starr investigation _ and the more squalid details
of alleged sexual activity _ has been given extensive coverage.
	   Newspaper stands in Portugal carry soft-porn publications with
nude photographs which passersby can clearly see. And even the more
serious papers run classified ads, with photos, for sex services.
	   Jose Manuel Fernandes, editor of the respected daily Publico,
said the move was not an attempt at censorship.
	   ``We've already published the (sexual) details and they're now
firmly in the public domain,'' Fernandes said in a telephone
interview.
	   ``But we won't exploit voyeurism,'' he added.
	   He said the media outlets had agreed not to compete against each
other ``to take advantage of public voyeurism which is not
politically relevant.''
	   ``The (sexual) details pouring out were becoming nauseous but
they were not adding anything to the story,'' he said.
	   ``We'll mention the existence of intimate aspects to put
articles in context, but we won't continue pursuing the sordid
physical aspects,'' he said.
	   Sandra Carvalho, a 27 year-old Lisbon security guard, has no
access to the Internet, where details of the Clinton case are
available, but said if she did she would probably have read the
Starr report ``out of curiosity.'' However, she supported the
Portuguese media's position.
	   ``(Clinton's) private life is no one else's business. It's too
much, it's been going on for too long,'' Carvalho said.
	   ``It would never have happened in Portugal. We tend to conceal
these things,'' she added.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Customs officials have seized more than 53,000
pirated compact discs worth 1.2 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 156,000) during raids in a busy suburban shopping mall, the
government reported Wednesday.
	   Officials arrested 15 people, aged between 16 and 51, in raids
Tuesday on 16 shops, a statement said. They were later released on
bail of up to 5,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 650), it said.
	   The confiscated goods included music and video compact discs,
CD-ROMs, and video game cartridges, it said.
	   In a separate development, customs officials also raided a
workshop manufacturing counterfeit mobile phone batteries and
accessories and seized 1.5 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
195,000 million) worth of goods Tuesday, the government reported
Wednesday.
	   Officers arrested five people, aged between 24 and 45, a
statement said.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure, especially from
the United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. Washington has placed Hong Kong on a watch list of
countries suspected of copyright violations.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated compact discs or
CD-ROMs still thrive in Hong Kong. Copies of local or Hollywood
movies are widely available for under 40 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 5) _ sometimes before they're released in local cinemas.
	   Customs officials claim they have closed down all local
factories producing counterfeit discs after a new law requiring
optic disc factories to obtain a license came into effect last
month.
	   In April, officers of an anti-corruption agency seized 7 million
pirated discs and production equipment worth U.S. dlrs 83 million,
the biggest such seizure in the territory.
	   Last year, customs officials seized 66 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 857,000) worth of counterfeit products and arrested 850
suspects.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A judge on the eastern island of Sakhalin was
slightly injured Wednesday when unknown assailants threw an
explosive device at him while he was walking his dog, a news agency
reported.
	   Pyotr Dedukh, chairman of the Alexandrovsk Sakhalinsky city
court, was returning home with his dog, a German Shepherd, when the
assailants hurled the explosive behind his back, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   It said the dog shielded its master, and prevented him from
being more seriously injured.
	   Dedukh, 38, is one of Sakhalin's youngest judges, and has been
handling several important criminal cases, ITAR-Tass said.

German far right could pull off another election shocker Sunday

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ While Germany focuses on Sunday's tight
federal parliamentary election, a statehouse race on the same day
in the east could sneak in a political jolt: a strong showing by
the far right.
	   Pollsters say none of the three extreme-right parties running in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania looks likely to clear the 5-percent
hurdle needed to enter the state parliament. But they also note
that similarly optimistic prognoses before local elections in
another eastern state turned out wrong.
	   In April, the anti-foreigner German People's Union came from
nowhere to win 13 percent of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt, in what was
interpreted as a protest against unemployment topping 20 percent.
	   The far right is not expected to win enough votes nationwide to
enter the federal parliament. But its nationalist, anti-foreigner
slogans have struck a chord in east, where the economic and social
upheavals of unification have left many people bitter and adrift.
	   Jochen Schmidt, a political scientist at the University of
Rostock, estimates the far right could get up to 16 percent of the
votes in the mostly rural state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
	   Wolfram Axthelm, spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrats in the state, describes support for the far
right as a ``transitional problem'' in the east.
	   ``A lot of people didn't profit immediately from German
unification as they'd hoped,'' he said. ``Four years ago the
protest vote was for the (former communists). This time maybe the
extreme right.''
	   But with three rival parties competing _ the People's Union, the
National Party of Germany and the Republicans _ how the protest
vote will be divided up is anyone's guess.
	   All three have plastered the state capital with placards
demanding ``Work for Germans First!'' and ``Criminal Foreigners
Out!''
	   About 3,000 people turned out for a National Party rally last
weekend in the Baltic port of Rostock, scene of a neo-Nazi arson
attack on a refugee home and skinhead riots in 1992.
	   Among them were Werner Kobrow and Heinz Fehling, both
unemployed, who insisted they ``weren't friends of the far-right
scene.'' But, they added, the party's demands for work for Germans
ahead of foreigners and the death penalty for child abusers
``aren't so bad at all.''
	   The People's Union hired an airplane to tow its banner over a
Kohl rally in Schwerin on Tuesday.
	   Kohl ignored the plane, while calling on the 2,000 or so
listeners to reject extremism and pointing out that ``there are a
lot of jobs in Germany that, without foreigners, would never be
filled ... in large part because Germans don't want to do them.''
	   At an earlier news conference, Kohl noted the difficulties of
getting accurate polls in the former communist east, where people
who grew up in a police state are still wary about volunteering
information to strangers.
	   ``I know that here in the east German states there is an
enormous movement in the radical right spectrum,'' Kohl said,
adding ``I don't know how the vote will go.''

Police roadblocks set up before opposition rally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Rally scheduled for 1500 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Masked police checked for weapons at
roadblocks around the capital Wednesday before the latest
opposition protest called by ex-President Sali Berisha.
	   Berisha, under criminal investigation for his role in rioting by
his supporters last week that threatened to topple the government,
has held a series of peaceful rallies in Tirana since the unrest of
Sept. 13-14.
	   The small crowds so far, none exceeding 3,000, show that the
former president who was forced to resign amid widespread unrest
last year has been unable to mount much support in Tirana.
	   Western powers have condemned Berisha and his Democratic Party
for the rioting. Prime Minister Fatos Nano's Socialist-led
government lifted Berisha's parliamentary immunity from arrest last
week, although authorities have not moved to detain him, wary of
causing another uprising.
	   The public prosecutor has launched an investigation of the
rioting, which left three people dead and scores injured.
	   The Democratic Party lost power to Nano's Socialist Party in
elections last year that followed months of unrest over the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes that wiped out the life
savings of many Albanians.
	   Since then, the party has rarely attended sessions of the
Socialist-dominated Parliament, and Berisha last week called openly
for Nano to resign, accusing him of being a communist-style
dictator.
	   The rioting began the day after popular politician and top
Berisha aide Azem Hajdari was shot to death. Berisha blamed Nano
for the killing, but Western officials say they believe Hajdari's
death was due to a private feud.

Malaysian police call in Anwar's wife for questioning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Anwar's wife avoiding comment
 &UR; AP Photo KL104-107
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Authorities clamped down Wednesday
on the wife of the country's imprisoned opposition leader, in their
relentless drive to stifle any further challenge to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule.
	   Azizah Ismail was questioned about her role in the reform
movement headed by her husband, former Malaysian deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar was arrested Sunday, amid some of the biggest upheaval in
this country's four decades of independence. The arrest alarmed
many foreign leaders.
	   Azizah, designated by her husband to carry on the opposition
movement after his arrest, was accompanied by two lawyers for the
interrogation at police headquarters.
	   No details of her remarks were released and Azizah did not stop
to speak to reporters as she drove out of the police station. It
was not immediately clear if she had been warned against talking to
the press, but one of her lawyers said police had intimidated her.
	   ``The police have been very hard on her and on me as a
counsel,'' said Uthaya Kuma. He did not give details of the
interrogation.
	   The reform movement picked up steam after her husband was ousted
from the No. 2 spot in the government earlier this month.
	   In addition to Anwar, a dozen of his associates have also been
sent to prison, to keep them from fomenting unrest. The government
has also sent out numerous reminders that the reform movement's
occasional demonstrations are illegal.
	   Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, meanwhile, was winding up her
trip to Kuala Lumpur, without making any public statements about
the political troubles in the former British colony.
	   Before answering her summons, Azizah rushed to a Kuala Lumpur
courthouse after hearing unconfirmed reports that her husband was
being brought there. Anwar faces charges ranging from disturbing
public order to sexual misconduct, including the crime of sodomy.
	   But she left dejected.
	   ``The police have told me that my husband won't be charged in
court today,'' she said as she drove off. Hundreds of Anwar's
supporters outside the courthouse shouted ``Allah Akbar'' or ``God
is Great'' and ``Reformasi.''
	   Anwar's defense attorneys waiting inside the courthouse were
incensed by the stalling tactics of the police.
	   ``We don't see the need for this cat-and-mouse game. It is
common courtesy to tell the lawyers if they are going to book
him,'' said Zainul Zachariah, one of Anwar's lawyers.
	   ``This is Malaysian transparency,'' he said.
	   Police also blocked access to Anwar's house to prevent
supporters gathering inside. Reporters were also barred from going
in by nearly one dozen riot policemen stationed outside the gates.
	   Family members were being allowed in after their identities were
verified and others could go in only with a written invitation from
the household, said Mohd. Khalid, a police officer at the scene.
	   But even after a family member came out and invited reporters
inside, police refused to allow them in.
	   Anwar's wife, who has spent most of her time inside the family's
home with the couple's six children, was being investigated for
allegedly making seditious statements. She alleged that police may
be planning to inject her husband, arrested Sunday, with the HIV
virus.
	   ``We called her to Bukit Aman to clarify certain things, not to
detain her,'' said Yaacob Mohamed Amin, the director of the
criminal investigation department. Bukit Aman, or the ``Hill of
Peace,'' is the name of Malaysia's police headquarters.
	   Anwar, 51, has adamantly denied all the charges against him. He
says trouble started when he began questioning Mahathir's policies.
	   Since his ouster, tens of thousands of supporters have
demonstrated at rallies throughout the country. Many supporters are
from the conservative Islamic party he founded during his student
days and they do not believe the government's sexual misconduct
allegations.
	   Police drove marchers away from the prime minister's residence
Sunday night in what was the first violent clash between police and
demonstrators in this Southeast Asian country in a decade.
	   Late Tuesday, the government disclosed that Anwar, arrested
under a colonial security law that allows imprisonment without
trial, was being held at Kuala Lumpur's police headquarters.
	   Eleven of his associates have also been detained under the
Internal Security Act and more than 100 supporters were detained
during the courthouse rally Monday.
	   One of them, Mohamad Ahmad, a former aide, was freed Tuesday by
a city magistrate.

As far as the Dutch are concerned, U.S. President Clinton can stay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The tolerant Dutch still accept
U.S. President Bill Clinton as a world leader and don't think he
should resign, according to the results of a telephone poll
publicized Wednesday.
	   An overwhelming 99 percent of those calling a computerized
telephone reaction line set up by the nation's largest daily, De
Telegraaf, said they think Clinton is still acceptable as a world
leader and want him to stay in office.
	   Up to 16,300 people called the line Tuesday, a day after the
broadcast of Clinton's grand jury testimony. They were given a
simple choice: Should he stay or should he go?
	   Only one percent of callers believe Clinton should resign.
	   While many European broadcasters showed only summaries of
Clinton's video testimony, three Dutch stations broadcast the video
tapes -- four hours worth -- in full.
	   The Dutch support is not surprising considering they are known
for their more laid-back attitudes toward sex. Although Dutch
politicians' sexual forays and private lives are occasionally
fodder for local tabloids, they rarely reach the mainstream media.
	   De Telegraaf, with a daily circulation of 800,000, is the
country's largest newspaper.

Rees-Jones files suit against Ritz hotel and car service
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with details on complaint, background.
CORRECTS Mercedes model number. ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole
survivor of the car crash that killed Princess Diana, filed suit
Wednesday against the Ritz Hotel and the Etoile-Limousine car
service for ``endangering the lives of others.''
	   At the time of the Aug. 31, 1997 crash, Rees-Jones was an
employee of Ritz owner Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of Dodi Fayed,
Diana's companion, who also died in the crash.
	   The driver of the car, Henri Paul, chief of security at the Ritz
Hotel, who also was killed in the crash, was legally drunk and
taking prescription drugs for depression at the time.
	   The legal action marked the first time that the Ritz management
and the car company have been legally targeted for responsibility
in the crash in a traffic tunnel under the Place de l'Alma.
	   The Ritz maintains photographers chasing the couple precipitated
the accident.
	   The legal action targets both the Ritz and Etoile-Limousine for
``failing to provide a licensed driver'' for the Mercedes in which
the princess was riding.
	   Paul was not licensed to drive the Mercedes 280S sedan, provided
to the Ritz by Etoile-Limousine.
	   Rees-Jones' lawyer, Christian Curtil, also specifically
requested the complaint be added to the investigation into the
accident, currently being led by Judge Herve Stephan.
	   In his complaint, Curtil criticized the management of
Etoile-Limousine for having agreed to rent a vehicle of that
category without a licensed driver.
	   The suit also targets the Ritz for having chosen
Etoile-Limousine when other companies which would have provided a
licensed driver were available.
	   The offense of endangering the lives of others is punishable by
a maximum one year in jail and a fine of 100,000 francs (dlrs
17,500).
	   Rees-Jones fell into a coma after the crash and his face had to
be surgically reconstructed. He was questioned several times by
French judicial officials but remembered very little of the fatal
evening.
	   He remained for a time on Al Fayed's payroll but later quit and
went to work part-time for a sports shop in central England.
	   Al Fayed is refusing to pay Rees Jones' legal costs and the suit
appears to reflect a further deterioration in their relationship.
	   Rees-Jones' complaint could lead to new parties, including the
Ritz and the limousine service, being placed under formal
investigation.
	   Until now, nine photographers and one motorcycle courrier have
been placed under formal investigation on charges of manslaughter
and failure to assist persons in danger.
	   It remains unclear whether Ritz management, including Al Fayed,
was aware that Paul had been drinking and taking medication before
taking the wheel. Questions recently have been raised as to whether
the car had faulty brakes and whether the Ritz was warned.

British regulators break up bookmaker merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fearing British gamblers would get stuck with
lower odds on the horses and sporting events, regulators on
Wednesday ordered bookmaker Ladbroke to sell rival Coral, which it
bought last year.
	   The 372 million pound (dlrs 625 million) takeover of Coral left
Britain's bookmaking industry with just two big national players _
Ladbroke and William Hill.
	   That's not enough competition to ensure that the ``punters,'' as
British gamblers are known, can expect reasonable odds at the
betting shops found on virtually any shopping street in Britain,
Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson ruled.
	   Ladbroke's purchase of Coral boosted its share of the British
market for off-track horse betting to 38 percent from 26 percent.
That compared with rival William Hill's 22 percent share.
	   Mandelson also found that ``as a result of this merger, prices
and standards of service in telephone betting would be less
favorable to punters.'' His decision followed unanimous findings by
Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
	   Christopher Bell, the managing director of Ladbroke Racing, said
his company was disappointed to see its big deal unravel, noting
that Ladbroke had originally gotten ``supportive'' advice on the
purchase from Britain's Office of Fair Trading.
	   ``We still strongly believe this transaction should have been
allowed to proceed,'' Bell said in a statement.
	   But the monopoly regulators _ who have greater authority than
the fair trade office _ found the deal would harm competition.
Mandelson ordered Ladbroke to sell Coral's operations, which it
purchased from the brewer Bass PLC, within six months.
	   Ladbroke would not identify any potential purchasers but tried
to play down any suggestion of being forced to sell at a low price.
	   ``Coral is trading well,'' Bell said. ``We will be selling a
company which is in better shape than when we bought it, and we
have already received a substantial amount of interest from
prospective partners.''
	   Ladbroke had tried to convince regulators that it could make the
deal less threatening to competition by selling off some of the
Coral bookmaking shops, as well as the Coral telephone betting
business and two greyhound tracks run by Coral.
	   But regulators said Ladbroke would still be too big.
	   Before the merger, Ladbroke was already Britain's top bookmaker,
with 1,900 betting shops, compared to 1,500 for William Hill.
Ladbroke picked up another 832 shops from Coral.

Polish government postpones major tax reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Solidarity-led government has
postponed major tax reforms until 2000, giving it more time to
weigh replacing the current income-based system with a
controversial flat tax.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek announced the decision late Tuesday
after a government meeting of Solidarity and its coalition partner,
the Freedom Union.
	   The two parties have held lengthy debates over the reform plan
proposed by Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, architect of
Poland's successful 1990 ``shock-therapy'' market reforms and the
head of the Freedom Union.
	   Balcerowicz called for a 22 percent flat tax to replace the
three, income-determined tax levels _ 19 percent, 30 percent and 40
percent.
	   He says the reform, which he hoped to install Jan. 1, would
boost growth and create jobs. But Solidarity and ex-communist
opposition politicians reject the flat tax because they say it
would hit low-income earners the hardest.
	   Tax discussions will continue this week, Buzek said. The
government on Tuesday approved only slight modifications of taxes
for 1999, including a reducing corporate tax to 32 percent from 36
percent.
	   The government also plans to eliminate housing deductions and to
introduce lower taxes for families, depending on the number of
children.

Khatami returns home amid speculation of end to Rushdie affair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With: Afghanistan-Islamic Gathering, Britiain-Rushdie Report
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami flew home
Wednesday amid speculation that Iran might pull back from its death
sentence against British author Salman Rushdie.
	   More than 30 reporters were waiting for Khatami at the airport,
but he made no mention of Rushdie. Instead, he focused on the
tension between Iran and Afghanistan, saying ``We don't want
military confrontation or war.''
	   At a news conference Tuesday in New York, Khatami suggested that
Iran wanted to put the Rushdie affair behind it, saying Iran
considered the matter ``completely finished.''
	   Rushdie has been in hiding since 1989 when the late Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a ``fatwa,'' or religious
edict, saying he should be punished for blasphemy against Islam for
his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   Khatami noted that his government already pledged not to enforce
the decree, saying: ``Iran has officially declared that in action,
it has no decision on this matter.''
	   In London, the Guardian newspaper said Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamel Kharazzi would make clear in a meeting with Britain's foreign
secretary that Iran was pulling back from Khomeini's edict.
	   The Guardian report said in a bid to improve relations with
Britain, the Iranian government would ask a religious foundation
that has offered a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death to
cancel the reward.
	   That would be a major change from Iran's present position, which
is that while it cannot cancel the fatwa by Khomeini _ who died in
1989 _ it would not actively enforce it.
	   But any steps that Khatami and his minister might take to reduce
the impact of the edict against Rushdie are likely to be opposed by
hard-liners in Iran.
	   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Tuesday
that meeting with Foreign Secretary Robin Cook may take place
Thursday.
	   At his airport news conference, Khatami focused on the Iran's
problems with Afghanistan.
	   Tension between the two neighbors has risen since the Taliban
overran the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan on Aug.
8 and killed several Iranian diplomats posted there.
	   Iran has since deployed about 200,000 troops on its border with
Afghanistan, amid growing demands for vengeance by mobs of Iranian
demonstrators. The Taliban have built up forces in the area to
counter any attack.
	   ``If the conditions we want are implemented, there would be no
reason for military confrontation,'' Khatami said.
	   Iran has demanded that Afghanistan release some 50 Iranians it
says the militia is holding. Tehran also has asked for an apology
for the deaths of eight of its diplomats and a journalist. And it
wants the killers turned over to Tehran for punishment.
	   Khatami, who took office in August 1997, is considered a
moderate. There are hard-line elements in the government that
oppose the liberal reforms he has tried to introduce.

Philippine Airlines, union resume negotiations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with PAL saying it could still close at
midnight if talks break down; ADDS quotes from employees
 &UR; AP Photos Available
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In a dramatic reversal, Philippine
Airlines announced late Wednesday that it might not close at
midnight as scheduled because talks have resumed with its largest
union. But it warned it would still close if the negotiations break
down.
	   PAL senior vice president Avalino Zapanta said flights would
still be halted at midnight and would remain suspended while the
talks continue.
	   Earlier in the day, the ground workers' union offered to accept
a management-proposed rescue plan, but with modifications. PAL has
said the plan is a prerequisite for it to recover from a series of
crippling strikes and Asia's currency crisis.
	   Asked if the company's closure has now been averted, PAL
chairman Lucio Tan replied, ``It's still up to the unions.''
	   Tan holds a 70 percent stake in the airline, while the
government owns about 18 percent.
	   At PAL offices around the country, airline workers held masses
and prayer vigils Wednesday, hoping for a way to avoid the flag
carrier's closure.
	   At the Manila ticket office, PAL workers were sharing a farewell
dinner when they heard the news of the possible reprieve.
	   ``It's a miracle,'' said Angie Ramos, a PAL employee. ``Our
prayers were heard.''
	   Letty Vida said she was looking forward to working on Thursday,
``and I hope it won't be just Thursday.''
	   The government, meanwhile, struggled to prepare for the expected
impact of a shutdown on the country's already ailing economy.
	   The scheduled demise of Asia's oldest airline had saddened many
Filipinos. Several television stations broadcast poignant scenes
Wednesday from its 57-year history.
	   On Tuesday, the ground workers had voted to reject the
management-proposed recovery plan. But the union offered to accept
the plan Wednesday afternoon with changes.
	   In the plan, Tan offered workers 20 percent of the airline's
stock and three seats on its board in exchange for a 10-year
suspension of their collective bargaining agreement.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu, the head of an inter-agency
task force on PAL's closure, said the union's proposed changes
include an annual review of workers' salaries despite the
suspension of the collective bargaining agreement.
	   He said the union was holding talks with the Labor Department to
discuss the modifications.
	   Asked if the closure had been averted, Espiritu replied, ``We
are hoping for a miracle.''
	   The airline announced last week that it would close at midnight
Wednesday as a result of the unions' rejection of the rescue plan.
	   PAL says creditors, to whom it owes dlrs 2.1 billion, have
insisted on guarantees of labor harmony before they approve a
restructuring plan.
	   PAL currently has a 50 percent share of domestic passenger
traffic, down from 75 percent before a pilots' strike in June.
	   PAL's closure would leave many areas of the sprawling
archipelago of 7,000 islands without air service. Two smaller
carriers were grounded last week over safety concerns and financial
problems.
	   The only alternative for travel among the country's islands is
slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries. Last Friday, a ferry carrying
454 people sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila.
	   If PAL closes, it would be the largest company to fail in the
Philippines since Asia's currency crisis, which hit just as the
airline was launching a dlrs 4 billion expansion and refleeting
plan.

Taliban and religious clerics discuss standoff with Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Saudi-Afghanistan, Iran-Khatami &QL; 
 &UR; By MOHAMMED RIAZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Tanks and armed personnel carriers
stood guard outside the war-damaged Kabul University Wednesday
while inside hundreds of religious clerics from throughout the
country discussed the deadly stand off with neighboring Iran.
	   Iran recently deployed about 200,000 soldiers to the Afghanistan
border after the Taliban religious army acknowledged the deaths of
eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist.
	   The Taliban responded by sending thousands of fresh troops to
its western borders. Neighboring countries and the United Nations
has been trying to avert an all-out war.
	   The Iranian diplomats were killed last month when the Taliban
army took over northern Mazar-e-Sharif from its opponents _ an
alliance of several small parties including one party that
represents the country's minority Shiite Muslims.
	   The Taliban has accused Iran, which is a majority Shiite Muslim
country, of arming and financing its opponents, a charge Iran
denies.
	   Iran has demanded an apology for the killings of the diplomats
and wants the culprits handed over for trial in Tehran.
	   The meeting, called by the Taliban's reclusive leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar, is being attended by about 400 clerics from around
the country.
	   The Taliban's Chief Justice Maulvi Noorullah Saqib told the
gathering Wednesday that ``Afghanistan will not bow down to the
threats of military action.''
	   Omar's Taliban army rules roughly 90 percent of the country and
its opponents the remaining 10 per cent.
	   The meeting of religious clerics comes as the Taliban faces
increasing isolation from the world community.
	   Saudi Arabia, one of only three countries to recognize the
Taliban govenrment, announced it was withdrawing its diplomat and
expelling the Taliban diplomat from Riyadh.
	   Pakistan, widely suspected of giving military aid to the
Taliban, and the United Arab Emirates are the only two other
nations to recognize the religious militia.
	   The United Nations is sending a fact-finding mission to Bamiyan
in central Afghanistan and Mazar-e-Sharif to investigate
allegations that the Taliban killed thousands of Shiite Muslims
during its takeover.
	   On Tuesday, Taliban Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed Hassan
accused the U.N. of a double standard for failing to censure the
anti-Taliban alliance for carrying out deadly rocket attacks on
Kabul this week that killed as many as 100 people.
	   The Taliban also accused the international community of failing
to condemn last year's massacre of an estimated 2,000 Taliban
troops in northern Afghanistan while under the control of the
opposition.
	   Hassan's speech showed little signs of reconciliation with Iran.
	   He dismissed any suggestion that the Taliban would apologize to
Iran and said the slain diplomats were ``conspirators'' posing as
diplomats.
	   The meeting of religious clerics is expected to conclude on
Thursday.

Communists keep up pressure on government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi's Communist allies kept up the
pressure Wednesday in a battle over the budget, but stopped short
of withdrawing support that could lead to the government's
collapse.
	   ``The government's proposals are completely inadequate,'' said
Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the Communist Refoundation, who has
been demanding for weeks that the government do more to fight
unemployment and help the chronically economically depressed south.
	   But Bertinotti left room for futher negotiations, saying that
the party's definitive stand on the budget would be taken by party
leaders Oct 3.
	   Bertinotti spoke after a meeting of leaders of parties that
support the government. Prodi called the session to test the mood
two days before presenting the 1999 budget.
	   Prodi depends on the Communists for a majority in the Chamber of
Deputies, falling 24 votes short without their support.
	   But the center-right opposition has twice bailed out Prodi, and
a new centrist party led by former President Francesco Cossiga has
hinted it might step in to allow the budget to pass.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eight people were taken to the hospital Wednesday
after a tanker spilled 22 tons of cattle blood possibly
contaminated with mad cow disease on a highway.
	   West Midlands police said a seal failed Wednesday morning on a
tanker carrying the blood north along the M6 highway between
Wednesbury and Walsall in central England.
	   Police Inspector Clive Isherwood said the blood is believed to
be from cows over 36 months old, destroyed as part of the
government's campaign to eradicate bovine spongiform encephalopathy
_ or BSE _ from the national herd, and was itself due to be
destroyed.
	   ``It is not known if the blood is infected with BSE, but we are
taking all precautions necessary to ensure the safety of the
public,'' he said.
	   A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
said ``the chances of this blood being infected with BSE are highly
remote.''
	   Police said four firefighters, two police officers, the tanker
driver and his wife were all taken to Walsall Manor Hospital to be
cleaned up.
	   Two of the highway's three lanes were closed while the blood was
removed, causing long lines of traffic.

Economists warn Yugoslavia faces potential chaos due to Kosovo

 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia is faced with staple
shortages and the prospect of hyperinflation and social unrest
because of Serbia's costly crackdown against ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, economists say.
	   Media on Wednesday quoted Yugoslav national bank governor Dusan
Vlatkovic as saying that because of the clashes in the troubled
Serbian province, the bank had to print extra dinars to cover the
costs.
	   He did not specify how much more money was printed but
independent economists said the Kosovo turmoil costs Yugoslavia
about 2 million German marks (dlrs 1.1 million) a day.
	   The country is already faced with an estimated 30 percent
monthly inflation. Additional printing of money will certainly
increase the rate, economists say.
	   Unemployment of nearly 50 percent and an estimated dlrs 9
billion foreign debt add to the troubles.
	   ``Because of Kosovo and other problems, we could not carry out
(economic) policies which we had planned,'' Vlatkovic was quoted as
saying by the independent Nasa Borba daily.
	   Because of looming shortages of cooking oil, sugar and milk,
some state-run shops have introduced rationing which bans sales of
more than 3 liters (quarts) of cooking oil and 5 kilograms (11
pounds) of sugar per person. Fresh milk could not be found in
Belgrade shops Wednesday.
	   Lines in front of some Belgrade shops have been forming because
of the shortages. Such scenes have not been seen in Yugoslavia,
made up of Serbia and small Montenegro, since 1993 when
hyperinflation reached thousands of percent a day.
	   Because of an European Union ban on foreign investments, imposed
this summer as a punishment for the Kosovo crackdown, and an outer
wall of sanctions maintained by the United States, Yugoslavia is
desperately short of foreign cash.
	   As the result of cash shortages, pensions and salaries in
state-run firms _ which average no more than dlrs 100 a month _ are
months late.
	   Frustrated by Serbia's hard-line economic and other policies,
Montenegro has stopped all contacts with the federal government
controlled by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Montenegro
stopped contributing to Yugoslav coffers some six months ago as it
tries to break free from Milosevic's grip.
	   Independent economist Ivan Vujacic said the cost of the Kosovo
campaign further adds to an already ailing economy plagued by
mismanagement and sanctions.
	   ``The overall Yugoslav economic picture is gloom and doom,''
said Vujacic. ``This could lead to major social unrest unless
drastic measures and reforms are introduced very soon.''

Cuban Vice President: France, Cuba speak same language
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo PAR105 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A day after France heftily increased its aid to
Cuba, Cuba's Vice President said that both countries ``spoke the
same language,'' and hoped to see relations with other European
countries flourish.
	   Carlos Lage, on a four-day visit to the French capital, met for
an hour with President Jacques Chirac and said they discussed the
role of Europe in the world, French ties with Latin America, and
business and tourism issues affecting the Caribbean island.
	   ``I've seen important unity in all of our meetings. We spoke the
same language,'' Lage told reporters after the meeting at the
Elysee Palace.
	   On Tuesday, Lage met with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
complained about U.S. economic policy toward Cuba.
	   France has long been a critic of U.S. policy toward Cuba,
arguing that the embargo disproportionately hurts poor people
rather than punishing the government.
	   France announced that development aid to Cuba will rise from 2
million francs (dlrs 300,000) in 1998 to 15 million francs (dlrs
2.5 million) in 1999.
	   Lage said he hoped a summit next June between leaders of
European and Latin American countries, including Cuba, would be a
good stage to further cement ties.
	   ``We think it's an excellent idea because relations between
Europe and Latin America are strategic and of great importance,''
he said.

Cups &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Six members of the French team that
won the World Cup and England teen-ager Michael Owen have been
named into a European All-Star selection based on the performance
this summer in France.
	   The Netherlands, a semifinalist, provided three players into the
first 11, with England and Croatia having one each.
	   The All-Star team was announced Wednesday at the end of a
three-day conference in Frankfurt of 50 national coaches from
European countries to review the World Cup.
	   The All-Star team: Edwin van der Sar (Netherlands); Lilian
Thuram (France), Marcel Desailly (France), Laurent Blanc (France),
Frank de Boer (Netherlands); Didier Deschamps (France), Emmanuel
Petit (France), Edgar Davids (Netherlands), Zinedine Zidane
(France); Michael Owen (England), Davor Suker (Croatia).
	   While France provided the bulk of the defense and the midfield,
the forward spots went to Owen, one of the most exciting young
players in Europe, and Suker, the Croatian star who was the top
World Cup scorer with six goals.
	   The substitutes: Peter Schmeichel (Denmark); Bixente Lizarazu
(France), Sol Cambell (England), Fernando Hierro (Spain), Paolo
Maldini (Italy); Ronald de Boer (Netherlands), Robert Jarni
(Croatia), David Beckham (England), Zvonimir Boban (Croatia);
Christian Vieri (Italy), Dennis Bergkamp (Netherlands).
	   Aime Jacquet, the coach who guided the French team to the title,
was presented a special UEFA achievement award.
	   The national coaches at the conference also voted to present an
award to Miroslav Blazevic in recognition of his World Cup campaign
at the helm of the Croatian national team, which he guided to a
third-place finish.
	   The conference, organized by UEFA, the governing body of
European soccer, heard several suggestions that are could be turned
into official UEFA proposals.
	   One would be to change the format of the World Cup finals. While
retaining 32 teams, European coaches would like to see the second
stage become another group, round-robin portion, with the two top
teams from each pool advancing to the semifinals.
	   In France, the first stage was played in groups, with the second
round becoming a knock-out competition.
	   A group system would prevent some of the bigger nations getting
knocked out in early stages, said Andy Roxburgh, UEFA's technical
director.
	   ``It would only add one match and would not extend the World
Cup,'' Roxburgh said. ``Most coaches felt six days between some
first-round matches was too long anyway.''
	   FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, had two observers at
the conference.
	   ``I am sure FIFA would listen to this,'' said Frits Ahlstrom,
UEFA's media director. ``If the coaches propose it, then it's up to
us to make an official proposal. It would be logical if you listen
to football people.''
	   While a majority of coaches opposed the sudden-death ``golden
goal'' rule, UEFA had no immediate plans to scrap it, Roxburgh
said.
	   Analyzing the World Cup, the coaches noted a positive attitude
toward attacking soccer, but lamented the lack of unified criteria
in refereeing, especially in the tackling from behind and passive
offside.
	   The coaches felt that the referees often failed to differentiate
between a non-aggressive tackle and a malicious, aggressive tackle
from behind which in all cases warrants a red card.
	   They also felt that the concept of the passive offside has led
to confusion and lack of uniformity among referees.
	   ``At the same time, holding, shirt-tugging and pushing has
reached such proportions that it is regarded as semi-legal. The
coaches regard this as a negative trait in the game, which must be
stamped out as quickly as possible,'' UEFA said in a statement.
	   The coaches unanimously called for a pool of professional
referees and assistants and said the best referees should be
retained for the final stages, irrespective of their nationalities.
	   In a comment directed at private interests trying to create a
Super League of top European clubs, Roxburg said the coaches felt
``football needs to be controlled by football.''
	   ``UEFA and FIFA must control all aspects of soccer,'' he said.

Auditor says he has no evidence that Russia misspent IMF money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian auditor, who had been quoted as saying
that Russia misspent Western loans, claimed Wednesday that his
comments had been misinterpreted.
	   Venyamin Sokolov, chief auditor of parliament's Auditing
Chamber, was quoted Sunday by the British Broadcasting Corp. as
saying by that International Monetary Fund loans had been misused.
He also reportedly said that no more money should be given to
Russia until efficient controls were in place.
	   But speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Sokolov said his
statement had been misinterpreted.
	   ``We have no grounds to say that the IMF credits have been spent
in violation of the agreements,'' he said.
	   Sokolov did say that some World Bank loans, including an 1995
credit for dlrs 740 million to support Russia's housing program,
had been spent unwisely. But he did not cite any legal violations.
	   He pointed to a dlrs 479,500 fee paid to a U.S. consultant as an
example how the loan enriched foreigners, but not Russia.
	   Sokolov has been highly critical of Russia's free-market reforms
and the IMF's prescriptions, saying they have ruined Russian
industry and agriculture.
	   The Auditing Chamber that he heads has released a report
criticizing the government, the Interfax news agency said. The
report said that the government spent dlrs 1.4 billion in World
Bank loans to finance budget spending and servicing foreign debt
instead of its declared goals of economic restructuring.
	   Sokolov said that Russia should stop borrowing abroad and rely
on its resources. It should also seek to get back capital that
Russians have taken out of the country because of the economic
turmoil.
	   ``The government has become addicted to foreign loans,'' he
said. ``If we want to cure our economy, we should stop taking this
drug.''
	   The auditing chamber was established by parliament's lower
house, the State Duma. The legislature is led by Communists who
generally oppose free-market reforms.

Foreign Ministry official suspected of spying for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A Finnish government official is
suspected of passing classified information about the European
Union to Russia, the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
	   ``It is a serious matter and officials at the Russian Embassy
who were mixed up in the affair are no longer in the country,'' a
ministry statement said.
	   The government is considering taking legal action against the
Foreign Ministry official, the brief statement said.
	   The official was not named, and no other details were
immediately available.
	   The Minister for European Affairs, Ole Norrback, confirmed that
the case is being investigated, but declined to give details.
	   ``We will comment on the matter as soon as we know exactly what
it's about,'' Norrback said.
	   Finland, which joined the EU in 1995, is due to take over the
union presidency in July 1999.

Leading French Socialist launches appeal in favor of Clinton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former French Culture Minister Jack Lang on
Wednesday brought together film stars and writers to launch
international appeal in favor of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Film stars Sophia Loren, Gerard Depardieu and Lauren Bacall were
among those who signed the petition. Others included Nobel Prize
winners Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Desmond Tutu.
	   The appeal, excerpts of which appeared in the Le Monde daily,
said Clinton has been subjected to ``inquisitorial harassment by a
fanatical prosecutor with unlimited power.''
	   It accused prosecutor Kenneth Starr of endangering democracy by
upsetting the balance of power and by his ``flagrant intrusions''
into private life.
	   The signatories of the appeal objected to what they believe is
the ``oppression'' that Clinton has suffered as a result of the
investigation into his sexual conduct.
	   ``A statesman has only to account for his public actions before
the public or the judicial system. All the rest is a matter of his
conscience,'' the appeal said.
	   Other prominent figures who signed the appeal included Clinton's
friend, the writer William Styron, German writer Guenter Grass, as
well as actresses Vanessa Redgrave and Liv Ullmann.
	   Lang, who is now a Socialist member of the French parliament,
has spoken out frequently in favor of Clinton.
	   Many French people find the investigation against Clinton an
intrusion into private life and are opposed to it.

Iraq invites 1,500 Iraqi expatriates to Baghdad meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The government has invited some 1,500
Iraqis who live outside the country to a meeting in Baghdad next
month to ``boost ties'' with their homeland, the official Iraqi
News Agency said Wednesday.
	   A similar meeting for expatriates was held in October 1996.
	   An estimated one million Iraqis live outside the country. Many
left because of economic difficulties after the United Nations
imposed trade sanctions in 1990.
	   The sanctions, which ban the sale of oil and other financial
dealings, were imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
	   IRNA said the three-day meeting would begin Oct. 5.
	   The meeting will be a ``means to boost ties between Iraqi
expatriates ... with their home country,'' the agency quoted
Abdel-Jabar al-Douri, deputy foreign minister, as saying. He gave
no details of the meeting's agenda.

Asset sales boost Bertelsmann profits in fiscal 1998
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background on Random House purchase &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GUETERSLOH, Germany (AP) _ Bertelsmann AG, Europe's biggest
media concern, said Wednesday its profits for the 1998 fiscal year
increased to 1.12 billion marks (dlrs 660 million) from 1.02
billion marks (dlrs 602 million) in 1997.
	   Sales of assets such as a paper factory in Italy and printing
plants in the United States helped boost profits in the fiscal year
ending June 30.
	   But poor performances in the book and music divisions weighed on
earnings, said Siegfried Luther, Bertelsmann's chief financial
officer.
	   The company's struggling book clubs in Britain, France and
Germany lowered fiscal-year profits by 200 million marks (dlrs 120
million).
	   Weak music sales, in Asia especially, cost Bertelsmann 100
million marks (dls 60 million), though this was compensated for by
a 100-million-mark profit from print-media division Gruner and
Jahr, Luther said.
	   About 31 percent of profits were evenly spread in Europe and the
United States. The U.S. share should raise over the next fiscal

Malaysian media toes the government line in dispute with ousted

 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Worried about losing their jobs,
many Malaysian reporters would rather keep mum at a news conference
than grill a government official. At times, they prod foreign
journalists to pose questions in their stead.
	   That deference is apparent in the media coverage of the tumult
surrounding Anwar Ibrahim, the ousted deputy prime minister who was
jailed after spearheading opposition to his ex-boss, Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Editorial pages have largely been silent on the dispute between
Anwar and the prime minister, bitter foes who once enjoyed a
harmonious relationship as protege and mentor.
	   Often accused of muffling the media, Mahathir has said he
believes in press freedom as long as the reports are fair and do
not threaten national security. Critics scoff.
	   ``There's absolutely no chance of any dissenting voice,'' said
Indrajit Banerjee, a communications lecturer at University Sains
Malaysia in the city of Penang.
	   Anwar had staged a string of anti-government rallies since his
ouster Sept. 2, culminating in his arrest Sunday after police broke
up a protest by thousands of supporters in Kuala Lumpur. He has
been accused of sedition and sexual misconduct.
	   In a rare comment Wednesday, the pro-government New Straits
Times echoed Mahathir's accusation that the foreign press is trying
to damage Malaysia's image with negative reports on the political
turbulence.
	   ``Most of its retinue are transient journeymen. They flit in and
out of the country, writing and filing reports based on their
perceived rights and wrongs and collated from selected sources,''
the newspaper said in an editorial.
	   On Monday, the British Broadcasting Corp. and other foreign
television media accused the government of censorship. RTM, the
state-owned broadcasting house, blocked satellite transmissions of
footage of Anwar's arrest and protests but relented after diplomats
complained.
	   The Malaysian media is severely circumscribed by a law against
sedition, which forbids reporting on issues that the government
considers a threat to national security.
	   ``We've been working under those conditions for years,'' said a
senior newspaper reporter who requested anonymity. ``We just have
to tread carefully and abide by those laws.''
	   Most big newspapers are owned or controlled by the ruling UMNO
party and are required to get an operating license annually under a
law dating from British colonial days. The government can revoke
the license at any time.
	   In August, Mahathir forced the resignations of the chief editors
of Malaysia's two largest Malay newspapers, Utusan Melayu and
Berita Hariman, as well as the head of TV3, a private television
news station. All three were viewed as Anwar supporters.
	   Newspapers, however, reported the content of Anwar's speeches
before his arrest, including his description of Mahathir as a
``dictator.'' The prime minister, who has led his party to
landslide electoral victories four times since 1982, took the
attack in stride.
	   ``Now, I'm labeled a dictator. Well, an elected dictator, of
course,'' he said at a news conference.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Finance Minister Daniel Daianu,
accused of failing to do enough to reform the ailing economy, was
abruptly dismissed Wednesday.
	   Daianu also was at odds with the government over a costly
helicopter deal.
	   Decebal Traian Remes, a little-known Liberal Party member was
sworn in as the new finance minister by President Emil
Constantinescu.
	   ``This reshuffle of the government ... is aimed at strengthening
the ministry'' at a moment of internal difficulties and instability
on the international market, Constantinesu said. He asked Remes to
speed up reforms in the ministry.
	   In a letter to Prime Minister Radu Vasile, the Liberal Party,
one of four parties in the governing coalition, accused the
conservative Daianu of failing to promote liberal policies in the
country's finances and of keeping high taxes.
	   Remes, 49, is head of a parliamentary committee for budget and
finance and is the author of his party's economic program, which
sees a decrease in the profit from 38 percent to 20 percent and
more incentives for investors.
	   He is known to support the dlrs 1.45 billion deal with American
company Bell Textron under which Romania would buy 96 attack
helicopters. Daianu said he would resign if the deal was signed,
claiming it would cripple Romania's weak economy.
	   Although reformists won elections almost two years ago, vowing
to reform the economy along western lines, purchasing power has
slumped and the national currency is overvalued, discouraging
exports, manufacturing and foreign investment.
	   Foreign and domestic investors have also been frustrated by
political bickering and bureaucracy. Romania has a fraction of the
investment of neighboring Hungary, which has less than half the
population.
	   Constantinescu asked Daianu to continue working as a negotiator
with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The president
suggested that Daianu return to the central bank where he worked
before.
	   Daianu was educated at Harvard University and worked as an
economic analyst for communist foreign intelligence.
	   Like many Romanians, Daianu criticized the Bell helicopter deal,
claiming it said would increase budget expenditures, which the
government is trying to curb.
	   Vasile has kept his options open and it is unclear whether
Romania will go ahead with the deal. Last week Bell said that
Romania could pay some of the money in Romanian currency, which
would ease the monetary burden.

EU orders new tests for budding eurocrats after cheating

accusations

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Tens of thousands of candidates seeking
jobs at the European Union Commission will have to resit entry
exams after the EU annulled the tests Wednesday because of cheating
allegations.
	   ``There are sufficient suspicions of leaks in at least one of
the preselection tests,'' said Erkki Liikanen, the top official in
charge of personnel at the EU's executive Commission.
	   Competition is intense for jobs at the EU institutions. On Sept.
14, 31,000 people sat the exam for administrative posts at the
Commission in 38 centers across the 15-nation EU. Only 475 people
were to have been selected for a shortlist to fill posts in the
European bureaucracy.
	   Candidates taking the exams in Rome and Brussels complained of
cheating, including reports that questions had been leaked in
advance and that some candidates had been able to make mobile phone
calls from toilets in the exam centers.
	   The exams for the Commission's level-A jobs, which require a
university degree, were the first to be held in five years. EU
officials said the exam had cost 1.2 million European currency
units (dlrs 1.4 million).
	   Liikanen said an investigation had been launched to find out who
responsible for the leaks.

Portuguese media to blank out lurid aspects of Clinton probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's investigation
has become ``inquisitorial,'' ``degrading'' and ``obscene,''
Portugal's main media outlets said Wednesday, and they won't repeat
any more of the sexual accusations against U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
	   In a joint statement, the main national newspapers, radio and TV
stations said they would no longer cover the ``intimate aspects''
of the investigation into Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
	   The statement _ issued by the three national television
channels, four top radio stations, seven daily newspapers and a
weekly news magazine _ said the investigation had turned into a
``grotesque display of collective voyeurism.''
	   ``It is our profound conviction that the intimate life of a
human being, even if he is the president of the U.S., does not
justify this obscene intrusion,'' the statement said.
	   ``We will continue, obviously, to provide news about North
American issues which we believe to be of journalistic interest.''
	   Portugal is a largely conservative country and one where news
coverage rarely strays into the private lives of public officials.
	   However, the Starr investigation _ and the more squalid details
of alleged sexual activity _ has been given extensive coverage.
	   Jose Manuel Fernandes, editor of the respected daily Publico,
said the move was not an attempt at censorship.
	   ``We've already published the (sexual) details and they're now
firmly in the public domain,'' Fernandes said in a telephone
interview. ``But we won't exploit voyeurism.''
	   Sandra Carvalho, a 27 year-old Lisbon security guard, has no
access to the Internet, where details of the Clinton case are
available, but said if she did she would probably have read the
Starr report ``out of curiosity.'' However, she supported the
Portuguese media's position.
	   ``(Clinton's) private life is no one else's business. It's too
much, it's been going on for too long,'' Carvalho said. ``It would
never have happened in Portugal. We tend to conceal these things.''

Mosley Sugar sees another worthy of the name
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``Sugar'' Shane Mosley of the United States
knocked down Eduardo Morales of Argentina twice and stopped him at
2:06 of the fifth round Tuesday night to retain the IBF lightweight
title.
	   Mosley, showing tremendous hand speed and quick intelligent
movement, dominated the top-ranked Morales from the outset. The
champion, who weighed 61 kilos (135 pounds), knocked down Morales,
60.7 kilos (134 pounds), with a stiff left jab and two hooks to the
body in the third round. The challenger got up at the count of
five.
	   Mosley's victory followed a unanimous decision by Angel Manfredy
over fellow American John Brown in defense of the super
featherweight title of the fringe WBU.
	   In the fifth round, Mosley, 29-0 with 27 knockouts, battered
Morales with head punches and then knocked him down with a right
hand. Morales rose at six but, after a flurry of punches, referee
Arthur Mercante Jr. stopped the bout at 2:06.
	   It was Morales' first loss against 27 victories.
	   ``I knew he was strong,'' the 27-year-old Mosley said. ``I knew
it would take time. I was better.''
	   The Manfredy-Brown fight was action-packed from the first to the
final bell as Brown kept coming forward firing while Manfredy
counterpunched.
	   ``He's tough,'' Manfredy said. ``My experience won the fight.''
	   Two officials scored it for Manfredy by three points and another
by five, although that margin appeared too wide.
	   ``It's politics,'' Brown said. ``They gave it to him.''
	   Brown was penalized a point in the 10th round when he was warned
for the third and fourth times for low blows by referee Wayne
Kelly.
	   After the fight, Manfredy didn't complain of the low blows, but
did say, ``He head-butted me too much. The referee didn't do a good
job.''
	   It was a head butt by the champion that opened a cut over
Brown's left eye in the last round.
	   The best round of the fight was the seventh when Brown shook
Manfredy with eight or nine head shots late, only to have Manfredy
come back with a terrific left hook and four or five head punches.
	   Also on the card, Masibulele Makepula of South Africa won the
vacant WBU junior flyweight championship on a technical decision
when Rafael Torres was unable to continue after being hit low in
the fifth round.
	   Makepula, 14-0 with 11 knockouts, was dominating the fight when
he hit Torres, 15-7, low with a right hand with 38 seconds left in
the fifth round.
	   When the Dominican was unable to continue, rules called for the
scorecards to be tallied because the fight had gone past the fourth
round.
	   Each of the three judges favored Makepula 40-36.

Iraq invites 1,500 Iraqi expatriates to Baghdad meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi government has invited some 1,500
Iraqis who live outside the country to a meeting in Baghdad next
month to ``boost ties'' with their homeland, the official Iraqi
News Agency said Wednesday.
	   A similar meeting for expatriates was held in October 1996.
	   An estimated one million Iraqis live outside the country. Many
left because of economic difficulties after the United Nations
imposed trade sanctions in 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
	   The news agency said the three-day meeting would begin Oct. 5.
	   The meeting will be a ``means to boost ties between Iraqi
expatriates ... with their home country,'' the agency quoted
Abdel-Jabar al-Douri, deputy foreign minister, as saying. He gave
no details of the meeting's agenda.

Police roadblocks set up before opposition rally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Rally scheduled for 1500 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Masked police checked for weapons at
roadblocks around the capital Wednesday before the latest
opposition protest called by ex-President Sali Berisha.
	   Berisha, under criminal investigation for his role in rioting by
his supporters last week that threatened to topple the government,
has held a series of peaceful rallies in Tirana since the unrest of
Sept. 13-14.
	   The small crowds so far, none exceeding 3,000, show that the
former president who was forced to resign amid widespread unrest
last year has been unable to mount much support in Tirana.
	   Western powers have condemned Berisha and his Democratic Party
for the rioting. Prime Minister Fatos Nano's Socialist-led
government lifted Berisha's parliamentary immunity from arrest last
week, although authorities have not moved to detain him, wary of
causing another uprising.
	   The public prosecutor has launched an investigation of the
rioting, which left three people dead and scores injured.
	   The Democratic Party lost power to Nano's Socialist Party in
elections last year that followed months of unrest over the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes that wiped out the life
savings of many Albanians.
	   Since then, the party has rarely attended sessions of the
Socialist-dominated Parliament, and Berisha last week called openly
for Nano to resign, accusing him of being a communist-style
dictator.
	   The rioting began the day after popular politician and top
Berisha aide Azem Hajdari was shot to death. Berisha blamed Nano
for the killing, but Western officials say they believe Hajdari's
death was due to a private feud.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The owner of a ferry that sank last
week, killing at least 46 people, has been ordered to halt the
operation of seven vessels with similar designs, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Maritime officials said they ordered the preventive suspension
of the passenger-cargo ships operated by Sulpicio Lines while they
are inspected to ensure their seaworthiness and the competence of
their crews to prevent a repeat of Friday's accident.
	   Arthur Lim, a lawyer for Sulpicio, said the company will appeal
the suspension.
	   ``This is not only illegal but also unfair,'' Lim said. ``An
accident that befalls one vessel should not be reason to ground all
the other vessels.''
	   Forty-five people are still missing from the sinking of the
Princess of the Orient, while at least 363 of the 454 people aboard
survived.
	   The ship sank in a tropical storm several hours after leaving
Manila for Cebu in the central Philippines.
	   Survivors said it listed toward its left in strong waves and
quickly sank.
	   Investigators say the ship was carrying a heavy cargo which may
have been improperly secured and shifted in the heavy waves,
causing the ship to tilt.
	   Sulpicio Lines has a total of 32 ships. It also owned the Dona
Paz, a ferry which collided with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in
the world's worst peacetime shipping disaster. A year later, 250
people died in the sinking of another ship owned by the company,
the Dona Marilyn.
	   Meanwhile, search teams continued to scour the area of the
accident outside Manila Bay for more survivors or bodies of missing
passengers and crew.
	   Some relatives of the missing gathered at a beach resort in the
town of Naic in Cavite province south of Manila as navy ships and
small fishing boats searched the waters nearby.
	   Four people were rescued on Tuesday from a small island but
there were no further reports of survivors there.
	   Following reports of bodies plucked from the sea, fish sales
dropped sharply in Cavite coastal towns because local residents
reportedly believe some of the fish may have eaten the flesh off
bodies floating in the water.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Trade this year between Egypt and Iraq under
the oil-for-food program will reach dlrs 250 million, Egypt's
charge d'affaires to Iraq said Wednesday.
	   About 200,000 Egyptians live in Iraq, a number that will
increase to between 3 million and 4 million after U.N. sanctions
are lifted, said the diplomat, Sherif Rihan. The sanctions were
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Rihan, who spoke at Cairo International Airport before heading
to Iraq, added that ``Iraq will need this number (of Egyptians) in
the battle of reconstruction.''
	   The U.N. oil-for-food program allows Iraq to sell limited
quantities of oil to buy necessities.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese industrialists, facing tough
competition abroad, have warned they may have to end their work
unless the government lifts tariffs on raw materials, reduces
electricity charges and allows easier credit.
	   The warning was issued after a meeting of representatives of
various industries Tuesday, local newspapers reported.
	   Some industrialists have threatened to take their business to
other countries ``where there are lucrative incentives to foreign
entrepreneurs,'' The Daily Star reported.
	   Others threatened to picket Cabinet meetings if their demands
were not met soon, the English-language daily added.
	   Robert Debbas, vice president of the Beirut Chamber of Commerce,
warned that the closure of industrial plants would deal a blow to
the economy, which has yet to recover from the devastation of the
1975-90 civil war.
	   ``There are already several plants in the country that have been
forced to close or lay off workers because industrialists could not
afford the cost of raw materials and electricity,'' The Daily Star
quoted Debbas as saying.
	   Ahmed Kabara, president of the council of exporters, said that
Lebanon's imports in 1997 were estimated at more than dlrs 7
billion, while its exports stood at less than dlrs 700 million.

Hindu politicians want pigs slaughtered to combat Japanese
</HEADLINE>
encephalitis &QL; 
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A slaughter of pigs in northern India is
necessary to control disease in the aftermath of devastating floods
_ at least according to Hindu nationalists who abhor the animal.
	   While medical experts and animal rights activists challenged the
plan to combat Japanese encephalitis, Bharatiya Janata Party leader
Kalraj Mishra said his activists were already urging people to kill
pigs. Mishra is also tourism minister in Uttar Pradesh, one of the
Indian states hardest hit by flooding over the past few months.
	   ``A better and more humane option would be to inoculate the
animals,'' said Shiraj Wahija, a doctor who heads the Uttar Pradesh
chapter of the Voluntary Health Association of India, a respected
private development group.
	   Animal Watch, a local animal rights groups, may file suit to
stop the slaughter.
	   ``Dogs spread rabies, cats spread diphtheria. Does that mean all
dogs and cats should be annihilated?'' said Satram Singh of Animal
Watch.
	   Pigs ``have no value,'' said the BJP's Mishra. While high-caste
Hindus like Mishra often do not eat pork, low-caste Hindus do and
many in Uttar Pradesh make their living as pig farmers.
	   The BJP's sister organization, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or
World Hindu Council, urged the government to slaughter pigs and
help pig farmers find other jobs.
	   Flood waters are receding, leaving behind damp breeding grounds
for mosquitoes, the pest that often transmits the Japanese
encephalitis virus to humans. The government has reported 83
Japanese encephalitis deaths in the past five weeks in Uttar
Pradesh. The virus is widespread in Asia, carried by mosquitoes,
pigs and water birds.

Klestil in Prague for talks on Czech membership in EU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Austrian President Tomas Klestil
said Wednesday that controversies in bilateral issues cannot
undermine Austria's support for the Czech Republic's membership in
the European Union.
	   ``There is no connection between bilateral problems and our
support,'' Klestil told a news conference after meeting his Czech
counterpart Vaclav Havel in Prague Wednesday.
	   ``For us, it is important that during our presidency we carry
talks with the new candidates as far as possible,'' Klestil said.
	   The Czech Republic is among the six countries which are expected
to enter the EU in the next expansion stage. The negotiations on
membership will begin in November during the final weeks of
Austria's EU presidency.
	   Both presidents, however, acknowledged that bilateral issues,
such as the post-war expulsion of Sudeten Germans from
then-Czechoslovakia or a controversial nuclear power plant the
Czechs are building near the Austrian border, also were discussed
at the meeting.
	   Of the 2.5 million ethnic Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia's
border regions know as Sudetenland after World War II, some 100,000
settled in Austria.
	   Last year, a joint Fund for the Future was established by the
Czech Republic and Germany to finance projects for Czech victims of
the Nazis as well as German victims of the expulsion.

Malaysia asks Thailand to block Anwar's supporters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Malaysian authorities have asked
Thailand to prevent 15 key supporters of arrested Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim from entering the country, a Thai security
official monitoring the border said Wednesday.
	   Malaysian authorities gave Thai border officials 15 names of
Anwar's supporters, most of whom are religious and community
leaders, and asked that they not be allowed to cross the frontier,
said the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   So far none on list has entered Thailand as Malaysian
authorities tightened security in the border area, the official
said.
	   The request has put Thai border officials in an awkward position
because of the close social and religious ties between Anwar's
supporters and Thai religious community leaders in the areas. It is
not clear how Thai border officials will respond to the request, he
said.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked Anwar Sept. 2,
accusing him of engaging in illegal sex acts. Anwar, the father of
six children, has adamantly denied all charges, saying the trouble
started when he began challenging Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   Anwar's arrest has sparked large demonstrations in the Malaysian
capital of Kuala Lumpur.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said the ministry has
not received a request from the Malaysian Embassy to bar anyone
form entering the country.
	   About 80 percent of the population in Thailand's four
southernmost border provinces are ethnic Malay Moslems.
	   Meanwhile, about 3,000 Thai Muslims in Pattani province, 1,050
kilometers (652 miles) south of Bangkok, gathered at a local mosque
to pray for a peaceful reconciliation in Malaysia. Pattani is the
heart of Thailand's Islamic south.
	   The gathering came as the popular Moslem Youth Movement of
Malaysia, founded by Anwar in his student days, lobbied Thai
Muslims in the border provinces for their support, urging them to
use their ties with Malaysia to pressure the Kuala Lumpur
government to back down from their allegations.
	   Thailand's Young Muslim Association of Thailand issued a
statement Wednesday expressing their concern over developments in
Malaysia and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful solution.
	   The organization spokesman said they were concerned over the
arrest of Anwar's supporters and urged the government to render
justice.

Anti-India group to discuss Kashmir in New York

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A Kashmiri leader opposed to Indian rule
in his troubled region was allowed to fly to New York to discuss
the issue with officials from Islamic countries, his aides said
Wednesday.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
nations gained independence from Britain in 1947. Kashmir is
divided between them, two-thirds in India and a third in Pakistan.
	   Umer Farooq left late Tuesday from the airport in Srinagar,
summer capital of Indian-held Kashmir. Last year and the year
before, Indian security had stopped Farooq at the airport when he
tried to make similar trips to attend meetings on the sidelines of
the opening of the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Farooq is a prominent member of a coalition of Kashmiri groups
that advocate either independence or merger with neighboring,
officially Islamic Pakistan for Indian-held Kashmir, the only
Muslim-majority state in predominately Hindu India.
	   Other coalition leaders were scheduled to leave Wednesday to
join Farooq in New York. Some 30 members of the coalition were
briefly detained after marching to local U.N. offices Wednesday to
deliver a letter of protest about the situation in Kashmir. Police
fired tear gas and beat the protesters to break up the
demonstration.

Business leaders urge new mechanism to cope with globalization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo GEV103 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ There is an urgent need for new mechanisms to cope
with growing global interdependence and associated problems like
the international spread of national economic crises, business
leaders were told Wednesday.
	   ``Until now the problem we had was how to manage a divided
world, whereas now our problem is to manage an integrated world,''
said Renato Ruggiero, director-general of the World Trade
Organization.
	   ``What is lacking is the appropriate international architecture
to manage this complex reality,'' he told a conference organized by
the International Chamber of Commerce.
	   Ruggiero said what was needed was a system to embrace the needs
of rich and poor countries alike and to encompass trade, finance,
development and human aspects of globalization.
	   The meeting, which runs through Friday, is meant to strengthen
ties between business leaders and top U.N. officials and come up
with new ideas to manage global economic, financial and social
challenges.
	   Helmut Maucher, chairman of the Swiss-based food and drink giant
Nestle, said that accusations by some left-wing that multinationals
were trying to muscle in and influence U.N. policy were
``disgusting.''
	   In a video message to the Geneva meeting, U.N. chief Kofi Annan
said the world body wanted ``global rules that are fair to all.''
	   ``Millions experience globalization not as a great new
opportunity but as a profoundly disruptive force, which attacks
both their living standards and their culture,'' Annan said.
	   ``In Indonesia, almost 15,000 workers are losing their jobs
every days this year. From Asia, the crisis has now spread to
Russia. It threatens Latin America. Even the buoyant markets of
North America and Europe are not immune.''
	   Niall FitzGerald, chairman of the Unilever multinational,
welcomed the call by British Prime Minister Tony Blair for a
radical overhaul of postwar institutions like the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank to deal with the financial crisis
and prepare for the next century.
	   All speakers stressed that a resort to protectionism and
national trade barriers were not the way to stop the knock-on
effect of economic crises.
	   ``Only by keeping markets open can we improve the chances of an
early recovery,'' said trade chief Ruggiero.

Spanish government rules out moving ETA prisoners as cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
gesture &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government on Wednesday dismissed a
call to move ETA prisoners closer to the Basque country as a
conciliatory gesture following the armed separatist group's
cease-fire.
	   ``I see no need, other than to confuse people, to make gestures
that at this point would not serve any purpose,'' Interior Minister
Jaime Mayor Oreja told reporters.
	   He was speaking in response to an appeal Tuesday from Jose
Antonio Ardanza, president of the Basque regional government, to
move the 536 ETA prisoners held in jails around the country closer
to the Basque country of northern Spain.
	   Some are now imprisoned as far away as the Spanish enclave of
Ceuta in North Africa or in the Canary Islands, off the coast of
West Africa.
	   One of ETA's long-standing demands is for its imprisoned members
to be transferred to the Basque region, although its cease-fire
announcement last Wednesday made no mention of this, nor did it
state any other condition for the truce.
	   Ardanza, speaking in Brussels after a meeting with
NATO-Secretary General Javier Solana of Spain, also suggested
releasing prisoners who have served most of their sentences and
prisoners with chronic illness.
	   Mayor's response reflects the government's stated position that
it will make no political concessions to ETA as the price for
starting a peace process to end 30 years of separatist conflict.
	   Government spokesman Josep Pique said Monday that ETA must first
lay down its weapons and disband as a condition for negotiations.
	   However, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has said that if the
cease-fire holds and ETA proves it wants peace, he would be willing
to ``explore the opportunities'' that arise from such a scenario.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in its drive for an independent
Basque homeland.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In another blow to Turkey's Islamic
movement, an appeals court Wednesday upheld a 10-month prison
sentence for the pro-Islamic mayor of Istanbul.
	   Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan was found guilty by a court in
Diyarbakir in April of inciting hatred based on religious
differences in a speech at a political rally.
	   Erdogan can no longer run for political office. He was seen as
the future leader of the Islamic movement.
	   He may be unseated as Istanbul's mayor in the coming weeks. The
Interior Ministry is now expected to ask a court to order his
ouster, news reports said.
	   The mayor has 15 days to ask the appeals court to review the
case before he begins serving the sentence. But appeals courts very
rarely overturn their own verdicts.
	   Erdogan will be eligible for parole after serving about
one-third of the sentence.
	   A crowd of about 50 people gathered in front of the Istanbul
municipality in a show of support for the mayor.

Georgian president orders investigation of nephew
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ President Eduard Shevardnadze has
ordered a probe into his nephew's business affairs following
allegations that his company committed fraud, the president's press
service said Wednesday.
	   Several Georgian newspapers on Tuesday published articles
charging that Nugzar Shevardnadze, director of the fuel importing
firm Iveria Plus, had failed to repay large debts to a Greek firm.
	   They also said that Europol, the European Union police
organization, was about to lodge charges of fraud and financial
misconduct against him.
	   A headline in the newspaper Dilit Gazeti said, ``International
scandals in the background of dirty business, or how long will
Nugzar Shevardnadze be protected by his roof,'' implying that he
had presidential protection. ``Roof'' is slang for mob-style
protection.
	   Shevardnadze's press service said the president on Tuesday
ordered the prosecutor general to investigate the allegations ``and
inform the people of the results.''
	   Iveria Plus issued a statement saying that the allegations were
part of a ``smear campaign'' aimed at President Shevardnadze in
advance of local elections in November and that his nephew was
innocent.
	   It was the second time this year that a relative has caused
problems for the Georgian president.
	   In March, Shevardnadze forced the government to annul the
results of a privatization tender won by his son-in-law, saying it
created the appearance of impropriety. The president told his
Cabinet that he needed not only protection from terrorists, but his
relatives as well.

Nicole Kidman glistens in new role as a London theater star
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP photo &QL; 
 &UR; By MATT WOLF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Nicole Kidman's long legs gleam, and so does her
talent, the critics raved Wednesday following the London stage
debut of the Hollywood star. So while the world may know Kidman
best as Mrs. Tom Cruise, the English were welcoming her as a
skilled theater actress here making just dlrs 400 a week.
	   ``The night is above all a personal triumph for Miss Kidman, an
actress who, if you ask me, is totally wasted in movies,''
Christopher Tookey wrote in The Daily Mail.
	   Kidman takes on five roles in ``The Blue Room,'' playwright
David Hare's free adaptation of the Austrian play ``Reigen''
(better known as ``La Ronde'') at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent
Garden.
	   One minute, she's appearing opposite co-star Iain Glen as a
politician's wife trapped in a loveless marriage, the next she's a
scantily clad prostitute _ not yet 20 _ whose clients include a
taxi driver and an aristocrat (both played by Glen).
	   The two-character play is directed by Sam Mendes, whose current
Broadway production of ``Cabaret'' won four Tony Awards in June.
``The Blue Room'' is expected to follow ``Cabaret'' to New York
later this season, especially now that Kidman has received mostly
rave reviews.
	   In other hands, Kidman's line-up of roles could seem
self-conscious and a shade coy, and it was lost on no one that she
bares considerably less of her body during the 100-minute play than
her lesser-known Scottish colleague, Glen. (That didn't stop
theater staff from confiscating 30 cameras from audience members at
an early performance.)
	   But the star of ``To Die For'' and ``Batman Forever'' won over
the opening night crowd with an unforced display of versatility
that led at least one critic to wonder whether her true abilities
had been fully tapped on screen.
	   Robert Gore-Langton in The Daily Express called Kidman ``not
only lovely to look at but a talent to watch.''
	   The Evening Standard reviewed her on both counts. While theater
writer Nicholas de Jongh was admiring her ``neatly provocative
performances,'' colleague Shane Watson fixated on her body: ``A
figure that not only matches up to the best but would be
exceptional on a 20-year-old, whereas Nicole is 31.''
	   Most rapturous was The Daily Telegraph's Charles Spencer, who
called the evening ``pure theatrical Viagra.'' That description may
well surprise those who think the play is in fact intended to be a
rather cool, clinical examination of our Eros-obsessed age.
	   Kidman may appear at various times wearing a mini-skirt or
wrapped in a sheet or even _ briefly _ naked. But Hare's play is
about unfulfilled love and lust, a dispassionate, sometimes
despairing look at contemporary sexual mores rather than a steamy
peep show for theatrical voyeurs.
	   Cruise kept a low profile on opening night, watching from back
stage.
	   The limited run through Oct. 31 was sold out well before the
play began previews at the 250-seat theater on Sept. 10.

Report: Khmer Rouge leader held hostage by comrades
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A top leader of the all-but-defunct Khmer Rouge
guerrilla movement is being held hostage by its hard-line commander
Ta Mok and wants to defect to the Cambodian government, the Far
Eastern Economic Review reported in its latest issue to be
published Thursday.
	   ``Ta Mok is holding Khieu Samphan as a hostage and using Khieu
Samphan to implement his fascist policy,'' Tep Khunnal, an aid to
Khieu Samphan and former Khmer Rouge diplomat, told the magazine in
an interview, a magazine press release said Wednesday.
	   Tep Khunnal and another Khmer Rouge official, Khan Soeun,
defected to the Cambodian government last week.
	   Veteran guerrilla fighter Ta Mok and the Khmer Rouge main
ideologue Nuon Chea took up leadership of the rebel group in a
power struggle with its longtime leader, Pol Pot.
	   Pol Pot died in April this year while under house arrest by his
comrades as the guerrillas were losing their last main base to the
government. His widow and daughter fled the guerrilla group and
defected with Khunnal and Soeun to the government, Cambodia's
defense minister said Monday.
	   Tep Khunnal and Khan Soeun had been among the last so-called
``intellectuals'' with the rebel group after its near total
collapse earlier this year, when large numbers of guerrillas
defected and government troops pushed the rest out from their last
major stronghold.
	   Ta Mok's remaining guerillas ``are crumbling and splitting into
pieces, having no money, no weapons, no liberated zone, and
especially no popular support. Ta Mok and his associates have no
future,'' Tep Khunnal told the weekly magazine.
	   Ta Mok loyalists were using terror tactics to maintain control
over the more than 10,000 civilians living in the United
Nations-administered refugee camp of Pu Noi, across Cambodia's
northern border inside Thailand, Tep Khunnal said.
	   The government in Phnom Penh maintains it wants to try Ta Mok,
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan for crimes against humanity during the
Khmer Rouge regime, which caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians between 1975 and 1979.
	   In June it had hinted of contacts with Khieu Samphan, when Hun
Sen said, ``We will forgive'' him if he helped capture Ta Mok and
Nuon Chea.
	   But Hun Sen later indicated Khieu Samphan, who never had armed
clout in the movement, would be unlikely to cooperate and it would
be better to capture him.
	   A score of other high-ranking Khmer Rouge have since defected
and been allowed to live in peace for what Hun Sen has identified
as national reconciliation, raising the prospect that none of the
Khmer Rouge would ever be tried for their genocidal activities.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A Finnish foreign ministry official is
suspected of passing classified information to Russia, including
documents about the European Union, the ministry said Wednesday.
	   ``We consider this to be a serious matter,'' said Jukka
Valtasaari, secretary of state in the Foreign Ministry. ``Some
information has been passed (to Russia) and some of it had to do
with the EU.''
	   ``We are concerned about the EU aspect of this,'' Valtasaari
said, but declined to give details of the documents.
	   He did not name the official or when the alleged spying took
place. After the incident was discovered, the official was given
new duties in the ministry, and the process of suspension will
begin soon, Valtasaari said.
	   Finnish police have interrogated the suspect, and had ``reason
to believe that a foreign power has received information which
could damage Finland's foreign relations,'' said Security Police
director Seppo Nevala.
	   ``This case is particularly problematic because an intelligence
agency has broken into the core area of foreign policy decision
making,'' Nevala said, but gave no further details. ``Now it is in
the hands of the public prosecutor.''
	   Two officials at the Russian Embassy also were involved in the
case ``over a period of time,'' Valtasaari said.
	   Valtasaari said one of the Russian diplomats had already left
the country when they found out about the case. ``The other one I
urged to leave,'' he added.
	   The Russian foreign ministry said the Kremlin was ``perplexed''
by the matter, the Russian news agency Interfax reported.
	   A member of the EU Commission in Brussels, who declined to be
identified, said the commission was not involved in the matter.
``It is a purely internal Finnish matter,'' the official said.
	   Finland, which joined the EU in 1995, is due to take over the
union presidency in July 1999.

China too slow in opening markets, U.S. trade official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with additional comments,
background

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's soaring trade deficit with the United
States threatens to spoil steadily improving relations, a senior
U.S. trade official warned Wednesday.
	   U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce David Aaron urged Chinese trade
and industry ministers in two days of meetings to do more to open
markets, revive a seemingly stalled effort to join the World Trade
Organization and head off a confrontation with Washington.
	   Barriers to U.S. investments and exports are ``taking a toll on
our bilateral commercial relations,'' Aaron told a gathering of
U.S. business executives.
	   ``Ironically, our commercial relationship, which in the past has
helped us through difficult times, threatens to become the source
of increasing political friction,'' he said.
	   China's trade surplus with the United States is projected to
reach dlrs 60 billion by the end of the year _ more than dlrs 1
billion a week _ a 20 percent increase over 1997's level, Aaron
said.
	   The unusually blunt tone Aaron took before the U.S. business
community signals a resurgence in trade tensions after a relaxing
year or so while U.S. and Chinese presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang
Zemin held summit meetings.
	   Aaron said his message registered with the high-ranking
officials he met.
	   ``Now of course, we have to translate those intentions into
sales and into actions,'' Aaron told reporters.
	   China reacted angrily this month when Washington set a 90-day
deadline for new rules requiring treatment and certification of
wooden packaging from China to prevent the destructive Asian
long-horned beetle from infesting shipments.
	   The regulations could affect up to half of China's U.S.-bound
exports, but Aaron said he heard ``no talk of retaliation'' from
Chinese officials. He explained to them that the beetles, native to
China but not North America, threaten to wipe out U.S. hardwood
forests.
	   Most worrisome for the U.S. side are Chinese moves to throw up
new barriers to trade and investment. Aaron noted that China
restricted imports of some power plant equipment in May, is
expected to impose price controls on imported medicines next month
and may close a loophole that has allowed foreign companies to
invest in the restricted telecommunications market.
	   Aaron predicted that congressional support for normal trade
relations would weaken if China did not do more to open its
markets. The U.S. Congress votes annually whether or not to renew
for China the same low tariffs most other nations receive.
	   Chinese officials have accused the United States and other
countries of making excessive trade demands on a developing country
struggling with slowing growth, rising unemployment and market
reforms.

	   ``This case is particularly problematic because an intelligence
agency has broken into the core area of foreign policy decision
making,'' Nevala said, but gave no further details. ``Now it is in
the hands of the public prosecutor.''
	   Two officials at the Russian Embassy also were involved in the
case ``over a period of time,'' Valtasaari said.
	   Valtasaari said one of the Russian diplomats had already left
the country when they found out about the case. ``The other one I
urged to leave,'' he added.
	   The Russian foreign ministry said the Kremlin was ``perplexed''
by the matter, the Russian news agency Interfax reported.
	   A member of the EU Commission in Brussels, who declined to be
identified, said the commission was not involved in the matter.
``It is a purely internal Finnish matter,'' the official said.
	   Finland, which joined the EU in 1995, is due to take over the
union presidency in July 1999.

Opposition cautions Indian president against dismissing state

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's fractious opposition came
together Wednesday and urged the president to reject Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee's recommendation that a socialist government
in an eastern state be fired.
	   Top opposition leaders met President K.R. Narayanan in New Delhi
separately and said Vajpayee's recommendation to fire the Bihar
state government controlled by his political rivals smacked of
vendetta. Vajpayee's government says federal authorities should
take over running Bihar because law and order has collapsed there.
	   The president, who must make the decision, was consulting
politicians and legal experts. He has in the past has turned down a
similar request against another state government.
	   In Bihar, a general strike called by the governing party,
Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha, shut down shops and businesses, but no
violence was reported. Nearly 1,400 paramilitary forces guarded key
towns.
	   Vajpayee's Cabinet on Tuesday endorsed Bihar Governor Sunder
Singh Bhandari's recommendation that the state government be fired
on grounds of ``constitutional breakdown, financial mismanagement
and failure of law and order.'' Bihar is considered India's most
lawless state.
	   Bhandari is a senior leader of Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata
Party, but he is expected to act impartially. State governors are
appointed by the federal government to oversee local
administrations, while chief ministers who are members of state
assemblies are the top local politicians.
	   In New Delhi, Former Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral met the
president and later said the dismissal of the state government
would seriously damage democracy. He pointed out that Bihar Chief
Minister Rabri Devi had won a confidence vote in the state
legislature only two days ago.
	   Federal officials say that while Devi has the votes in the
legislature, she has lost control of law and order. Most of the
lawmakers in the Bihar legislature have criminal records and are
frequently accused of switching political loyalty in return for
hefty bribes.
	   Mulayam Singh Yadav, a leader of the Rashtriya Loktantrik
Morcha, who also met with the president Wednesday, called for
Bhandari's dismissal.
	   A key ally of Vajpayee's coalition government took the prime
minister's move as an opportunity to press its demand for firing a
rival party-led government in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.
	   Jayaram Jayalalitha, leader of the All India Anna Dravida
Munnetra Kazhgam, told reporters in Madras, the capital of Tamil
Nadu state, that the situation in Tamil Nadu was ``far worse,
several times worse'' than in Bihar.
	   Vajpayee's coalition government badly needs Jayalalitha's
support for survival, but he has so far rejected calls to topple
the Tamil Nadu government led by her rivals.
	   Tension began building in Bihar last week following the state
government's rejection of the Vajpayee government's decision to
carve out a separate state for tribespeople to ensure speedy
development. Bihar is India's second most populous state.

Yugoslav officials shrug off threats, criticize world leaders

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces pounded a rebel ethnic
Albanian stronghold Wednesday for a second day, defying
international pressure to end a crackdown in Kosovo. Ethnic
Albanian sources claim 20,000 refugees were fleeing the fighting.
	   The action came as the U.N. Security Council prepared to vote,
possibly Wednesday, on a resolution threatening force unless
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic halts the fighting and begins
negotiations with ethnic Albanians on the future of the Serbian
province.
	   Two U.S. officials said Tuesday at the United Nations that the
Clinton administration has asked the North Atlantic Council to seek
commitments of arms, material and troops from NATO members to
complete plans for a multinational force for Kosovo.
	   But if the latest threats have alarmed Serbian officials, there
was little sign of that on the ground Wednesday, as government
forces tightened the noose around Kosovo Liberation Army rebels.
	   Smoke billowed from at least three towns and artillery resounded
in the central Drenica region, where Serbs reportedly captured at
least six villages from ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Drenica is the heart of the rebellion against Serbia and the
last major stronghold of rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence
from Serbia. .
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said eight other
villages have been burned while 20,000 people fled their homes.
	   Thousands of Serb police and armed Serb civilians patrolled the
winding dirt roads that lead into the Drenica region from all
directions Wednesday. They refused to allow reporters entry to
pockets of refugees near the town of Kosovska Mitrovica.
	   ``There are still many terrorists there today,'' said the
commander of one Serb police checkpoint near the village of
Vucitrn. ``There will be terrorists there tomorrow and there will
be terrorists there a year from now.''
	   Serb-led troops have in the past seven months defeated the KLA
elsewhere throughout Kosovo. Their crackdown has claimed hundreds
of lives and sent an estimated 275,000 people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, fleeing.
	   A Western aid worker said Wednesday that people in Drenica are
already packed 100 to a house.
	   ``If there are any more refugees, we just can't handle it
here,'' said the worker, who declined to give his name.
	   The Security Council was expected to adopt a resolution
Wednesday which calls for a cease-fire and threatens further action
if the violence continues. The draft resolution does not
specifically authorize NATO force to stop the clashes but calls for
unspecified ``additional measures'' if the clashes continue. It
gives no time frame.
	   Still, the United States has asked the NATO governing body to
begin rounding up commitments from NATO countries to contribute to
a possible multinational force, two senior U.S. officials said
Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   A U.S. envoy in Kosovo, Christopher Hill, visited some of the
refugees in the area southwest of the capital Pristina on Tuesday.
Hill was expected to meet ethnic Albanian leaders Wednesday.
	   In Belgrade, the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic shrugged off the threats and accused the West of being
anti-Serb.
	   The defiant reaction is typical of Milosevic. For years, he
ignored growing international condemnation of Serb excesses in
Bosnia until NATO struck at Bosnian Serb positions in 1995, helping
end the war there.
	   Milosevic sent his top ally, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic, to Kosovo on Wednesday. At a meeting with Yugoslav
army commanders, Milutinovic declared that Yugoslavia would defend
its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the official Tanjug news
agency reported.
	   He added that the world should put pressure on Albania because
it provides bases for the ``terrorists'' instead of threatening
Yugoslavia.
	   ``The terrorists and their supporters abroad were wrong when
they thought they could violate the integrity of our country and go
unpunished,'' he said.

Thai Airways resumes flights to Phnom Penh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thai Airways International resumed
flights to Cambodia on Wednesday after a two-day stoppage due to a
faulty communication system in Phnom Penh airport's control tower.
	   Thai Airways officials confirmed that its Wednesday flight to
Phnom Penh and the return flight to Bangkok went smoothly and that
the airline's flights would resume as scheduled.
	   ``Everything is back to normal,'' said an airline
representative, who declined to be named.
	   A Thai Airways flight on Sunday experienced minor problems
receiving weather and atmospheric information during landing at
Phnom Penh's Pochentong International Airport, according to The
Cambodia Daily newspaper.
	   Cambodian aviation officials discovered Sunday afternoon that a
part of the control tower's meteorological equipment was not
working and fixed the problem Tuesday, the newspaper reported.
	   Pochentong Airport was damaged in Cambodian leader Hun Sen's
violent coup d'etat against his co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh
last year and navigation equipment was looted in its aftermath.
	   A Vietnam Airlines jet crashed while attempting to land in bad
weather at the airport a month after the coup, killing 64. A
Cambodian investigation indicated that pilot error, rather than
equipment failure, appeared to be the main cause of the accident.

World record holder's death remains under study

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The day before she died, world-record holding
sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner made an appearance at a
gymnastics meet in Santa Barbara and visited her mother. When she
returned home, she felt ``a little tired'' and went to sleep, her
former coach and brother-in-law said.
	   There were ``no signs whatsoever that Florence was ill,'' Bob
Kersee told reporters Tuesday at UCLA.
	   The gold medalist's sudden death early Monday left her family
and the athletics world in shock. Despite earlier reports that
Griffith Joyner suffered from heart problems, Kersee said she
showed no sign of illness before she died.
	   ``In terms of heart seizures, heart attacks, all of that _ none
of that is true,'' he said. ``We, unfortunately, have no idea why
Florence left us.''
	   Coroner's tests were continuing, Orange County sheriff's Lt.
Hector Rivera said.
	   Kersee said, however, that she did suffer from exercise-induced
asthma and migraine headaches.
	   Late Tuesday, hundreds of well-wishers and friends gathered in
Leimert Park, not far from where Griffith Joyner grew up, to say
prayers, sing songs and remember her contributions to the
community.
	   Griffith Joyner blazed her way into national attention with her
world-record speed, her flashy, formfitting bodysuits and her
glittering, 15-centimeter (6-inch) fingernails.
	   She won gold medals in the 100- and 200-meter dashes and the
400-meter relay at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and at her death was
still the fastest woman sprinter ever.
	   Commenting on a seizure Griffith Joyner had in St. Louis two
years ago, Kersee said she was hospitalized overnight but doctors
could not find anything wrong and released her.
	   ``Losing Florence suddenly was a shock to the family,'' Kersee
said at UCLA's Drake Stadium, where he once coached Griffith
Joyner. ``It took me the whole flight from St. Louis to believe it.
I don't know if I accept it, but as a Christian I understand it.''
	   Her death reignited speculation about whether Griffith Joyner,
mother of a 7-year-old girl, had ever used performance-enhancing
substances during her athletics career. Her sister-in-law, Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, urged everyone to wait for the autopsy findings.
	   ``At this time I don't feel that it is appropriate (to
speculate), but I do know that there is going to be speculation,
but right now we don't have time to be concerned about that,''
Joyner-Kersee said in a television interview.
	   Kersee said no athlete he has coached ever failed or avoided a
drug test.
	   ``How would you feel if someone was spreading false rumors about
you and your daughter had to read about this?'' Kersee said.
	   Funeral plans were to be announced within days.
	   After her phenomenal performance at Seoul, opponents and some
U.S. sprinters accused Griffith Joyner of using
performance-enhancing drugs. She denied any doping, attributing her
success to a strenuous workout program before the Olympics.
	   Griffith Joyner never failed a doping test.
	   In 1989, U.S. sprinter Darrell Robinson said in the German
magazine Stern that he bought banned growth hormones for Griffith
Joyner. Robinson was paid dlrs 25,000 for his interview with the
magazine.
	   Griffith Joyner denied Robinson's charge that year in a
television interview, saying: ``Darrell, you are a compulsive,
crazy, lying lunatic.''
	   Arne Ljungqvist, vice president of the International Amateur
Athletic Federation and the organization's top antidoping official,
said it would be unfair to speculate about Griffith Joyner and
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   ``It's very unfortunate for sport if one is accused of doping
just for being an extremely good athlete,'' he said.

New residential mortgage loans fall 9.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In the latest confirmation of the slumping
property market, gross new residential mortgages declined nearly 10
percent in August from the previous month, finance officials said
Wednesday.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de facto
central bank, said new residential mortgages dropped 9.5 percent to
8.43 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.09 billion) last month.
	   New loans approved in August plunged by 42 percent from July to
6.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 787 million). The
authority attributed the sharp fall in approved loans to the low
level of transactions in July and August. Gross new loans represent
the actual amount lent by banks, compared to the amount approved to
be lent at a future date.
	   Property values have fallen by up to 50 percent since last
year's peak, deterring home buyers from purchasing apartments until
they are sure the market has hit the bottom.
	   High interest rates, the authority's tool for protecting the
local currency's peg to the U.S. dollar, are also making mortgage
payments more expensive.
	   The loan delinquency ratio rose to 0.44 percent from 0.34
percent in July. Loans overdue for more than three months are
considered delinquent by the authority.
	   Average loan size increased to 1.62 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 209,032) from 1.60 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
207,741) in July.
	   ``Although primary market activity revived in September, new
lending is expected to remain subdued,'' the authority's Chief
Executive David Carse said.
	   The government has frozen land sales and several major
developers this month slashed prices for new apartment, hoping to
breathe some life back to the moribund market.

Port authorities intercept 167 illegal immigrants

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with nationality of immigrants, details of journey &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   IRAKLEION, Greece (AP) _ Port police Wednesday apprehended 167
Iraqi Kurds packed aboard a Lebanese-flagged wooden boat off the
southeastern coast of Crete, authorities said.
	   The illegal immigrants, including 80 children and 31 women, said
the 20-meter (66-foot) vessel set sail from Lebanon five days ago
and was attempting to reach Italy.
	   The immigrants claimed they had been huddled below deck for the
duration of the journey and had not been given any food or water
since they set sail from Lebanon, authorities said.
	   Four of the immigrants were briefly treated for respiratory
problems caused by lack of food and water, police said.
	   According to local media, one of the immigrants reportedly
suffered a miscarriage during the trip and the fetus was thrown
overboard. The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Greece is one of the main routes for Iraqi Kurds and others
attempting to sneak into the European Union.
	   Port authorities apprehended the immigrants shortly before they
attempted to leave the boat, police said. They were all transferred
to the immigration center in Irakleion, Crete's largest city.
	   The boat's four-member crew, all Lebanese, were arrested and
were due to be formally charged later Wednesday.

Scuffles break out at headquarters of Egyptian leftist party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A large fist fight broke out Wednesday at
the headquarters of an Egyptian leftist party over a leadership
election, police officials said.
	   Two men were slightly injured in the scuffles between supporters
of rival leaders of the al-Ahrar Socialist Party, police said.
	   Police called in scores of officers to quell the fighting among
some 250 party members and hired thugs in the al-Ahrar offices in
downtown Cairo, the officials said.
	   The clashes began after Talaat Sadat, nephew of the late
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, stormed the party headquarters with
his followers, demanding to run in the election. Sadat had been
barred from the polls, which were triggered by the death of the
party's leader last month.
	   A leading candidate, Ragab Hamadeh, retaliated by calling in
about 200 thugs to throw Sadat out, said the police officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The al-Ahrar party, which was founded in 1975, calls for greater
political freedom, worker's rights, and the abolition of the state
of emergency, which has been in force since Sadat's assassination
in 1981.

Police confirm FBI presence in Uganda; legislators opposed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A senior police officer said Wednesday
FBI agents were helping Ugandan police combat terrorism but
declined to elaborate.
	   The officer spoke on condition he not be indentified. Police
spokesman Bob Ngobi said he had learned the agents were in Uganda
from ``general sources.''
	   ``If FBI is helping us to combat this new phenomenon of crime,
what is wrong with that?'' he said. ``The concern is the safety of
our people.''
	   Newspapers reported Wednesday that some members of a
parliamentary committee are opposed the participation of the FBI
agents in the recent arrests of several dozen people in the East
African nation alleged to be planning attacks on Ugandan and
American targets in the country.
	   Among those arrested were Ugandans and Somalis.
	   According to press reports, the agents have been in Uganda for
several weeks.
	   President Yoweri Museveni's government has refused comment, but
security in the country has been tightened since bombings last
month of three long-distance passenger buses in which 30 people
died.
	   Police say an anti-terrorist squad is being trained.
	   The state-owned New Vision newspaper Wednesday quoted legislator
Elly Karuhanga as telling the parliamentary committee before
foreign police agents enter the country on assignment, there should
be legislation permitting them to do so.
	   Ngobi said foreign nations assist Uganda in other fields and
there would be nothing new about the presence of FBI agents in
Uganda.
	   ``If they are helping us track down these people and giving us
expertise in this crime which has taken long in their countries, I
do not see anything wrong,'' Ngobi said.
	   He said the anti-terrorist squad is undergoing intensive
training with assistance from friendly countries, which he declined
to identify.
	   FBI agents have been in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania
investigating the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania in which 248 people, including 12 Americans, died in
Nairobi and another 11 were killed in Dar es Salaam.

Hurricane Georges barrels into Haiti; looting, curfew in Dominican
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE six reported storm deaths in Haiti,

Georges was centered near latitude 19.8 north, longitude 73.8

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hurricane Georges brought its
violent winds and rains to Haiti Wednesday, unleashing flash floods
that killed at least six people in this impoverished Caribbean
nation, local radio said, bringing the hurricane's reported death
toll to 27.
	   Witnesses told Radio Metropole the victims were killed when
floodwaters undermined and collapsed a house in Port-au-Prince's
Carrefour Feuilles neighborhood. Area streets were virtually
impassable because of water and storm-driven debris, although the
city's main arteries were clear.
	   At least 21 deaths had been attributed to the storm before
Wednesday's reported deaths, including 12 in the Dominican
Republic, where Georges set off looting and street violence. Two of
the dead were looters shot by police.
	   Elsewhere, battering ocean waves swamped the seaside boulevard
in north coast Cap-Haitien, tin roofs flew off homes and streamside
residents raced for shelters or higher ground.
	   Georges marched relentlessly to the northwest, and a hurricane
watch was posted Wednesday for south Florida. Warnings were
declared in Cuba from Sancti Spiritus province eastward and in the
central and southern Bahamas.
	   At 8 a.m. (1200 GMT), Hurricane Georges was centered over the
Windward Passage about 35 miles (55 kilometers) south-southeast of
the eastern tip of Cuba and 600 miles (975 kilometers) southeast of
Key West, Florida. It was moving west-northwest near 15 mph (24
kph).
	   Georges' winds dropped from 110 mph Tuesday to near 75 mph (120
kph) as it moved across the island of Hispaniola but were expected
to strengthen over open water.
	   In Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, few
people had means to prepare for the impending disaster. The Haitian
government was able to muster only dlrs 130,000 for emergency
assistance, said civil defense spokeswoman Yolaine Surena.
	   Mountain erosion and a lack of maintenance have left drainage
systems in Haitian cities choked with silt and unable to alleviate
flash floods, said meteorologist Renan Jean-Louis.
	   In November 1994, tropical storm Gordon killed at least 1,000 in
Haiti's southern provinces, drowning them in torrential streams or
burying them in mudslides.
	   ``Foundations give way every time the rain falls. The
environment is deteriorating ceaselessly because there is no
government enforcement of zoning regulations,'' Ernst Wilson, a
Haitian oceanographer and environmentalist, said of Wednesday's
reported deaths.
	   In the Dominican Republic, east of Haiti, soldiers enforced a
curfew in the capital of Santo Domingo Wednesday after Georges
ravaged the nation. At least 12 people were killed by the storm,
which also unleashed looting and street violence.
	   Looters waded waist-deep in water, balancing televisions and air
conditioners on their heads even as 110-mph (177 kmh) winds toppled
trees and crushed houses. Bands of youths with machetes and pistols
roamed the streets, many of them drunk.
	   ``We are occupying Santo Domingo to prevent criminal acts, which
we see practically as acts of terrorism,'' said armed forces chief
Ruben Paulino Alvarez.
	   Authorities said 80 percent of the roads in Santo Domingo were
impassable because of downed trees and power lines and widespread
flooding.
	   Some bands of youths used their machetes to hack away fallen
trees or to cut open fallen coconuts, but others threatened
passers-by, pulling open car doors.
	   Much of the Dominican countryside was incommunicado, and
authorities said it might take days before the full scope of the
damage was known.
	   President Bill Clinton has declared Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands a disaster area, releasing emergency aid.
	   The mammoth storm was on a trajectory that could send it
crashing into the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday.
Authorities urged tourists to leave the island chain, and residents
began boarding up windows in anticipation of Georges' fury.
	   In Puerto Rico, where Georges' damage is expected to amount to
hundreds of millions of dollars, residents began the sobering task
of recovery.
	   ``After the storm is always the worst,'' said Paula Aponte
Figueroa, 71, as she swatted at mosquitoes, the roof of her house
ripped off by the winds. ``You've got flooding, you've got
mosquitoes and I have nowhere to go.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A light aircraft crashed into a mountain in western
Japan Wednesday, killing all five people aboard, a transport
ministry official said.
	   The Cessna, owned by a private company, left Yao airport near
Osaka, western Japan, at 5:46 p.m. (0846GMT) and crashed shortly
after takeoff, said Hiroyoshi Ono, a transport ministry spokesman
at Tokyo's Haneda airport. The plane was bound for Nagoya, central
Japan.
	   The crash site was about 10 kilometers (6 miles) northeast of
Yao airport, Ono said.
	   Ono said the cause of the crash was not immediately known.

European Union says its exports to Asia down, imports up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Imports to European Union countries by nations
worst hit by the Asian financial crisis have risen by more than 20
percent in recent months, a senior European Union official said
Wednesday.
	   Exports by the EU to those countries, however, have declined by
some 30 percent, said the European executive commission's Deputy
Director-General for commercial policy Mogens Peter Carl.
	   Carl told a news conference in Geneva there has been a
cumulative ``sharp change'' in the pattern of trade between most
industrialized countries and nations in Asia and elsewhere worst
affected by the region's turmoil.
	   In terms of EU trade with those countries, there had been an
overall shift in ecus, the new European currency, of more than 50
percent.
	   However, Carl said that in terms of import and export volume,
the change would be much greater because of the devaluation of the
currencies of all the countries affected by the crisis.
	   Figures in ecus were unavailable from the European Union and no
figure has been given for the crisis-hit parts of Asia as a whole.
	   Figures released last week by the European Union, however, show
its exports to Japan have fallen by 12 percent and to Hong Kong by
7 percent from Jan to May.
	   Imports from Japan were up 18 percent and from Hong Kong up 22
percent over the same period.
	   Carl was speaking in Geneva on the eve of a World Trade
Organization meeting at which governments will start preparing for
trade talks to begin next year.
	   At a news conference, he reiterated the European Union's view
that the negotiations should take the form of a comprehensive new
round, which EU Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan has called the
``Millennium Round.''
	   The United States has said a traditional round may be too broad
and take too long to achieve. Some developing nations have said
they should be allowed to implement their existing commitments
under the Uruguay Round before taking on fresh obligations.
	   Carl said the European Union believed the talks should achieve a
very significant decrease in industrial tariffs and further market
opening in agriculture and services, including areas not already
included in existing agreements such as maritime transport.
	   But completely new matters should also be included in the talks,
such as international rules on investment, competition policy and
international lawmaking, Carl said.
	   ``We think this is indispensable, especially in circumstances
where there is risk of backtracking by some members of the WTO,''
he added.
	   Anti-free trade campaigners have accused the WTO system of
causing increased poverty in developing countries. But Carl said
the EU believed free trade and the WTO system was not the cause of
the Asian financial crisis, but a solution.
	   He said the EU will present to Thursday's meeting a
non-exhaustive list of possible trade liberalization priorities and
the EU was open to the inclusion of other issues.
	   ``We cannot stand still, we must move forward, and the community
will take the lead in that respect,'' said Carl.

European rights court condemns Britain in caning case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Court of Human Rights
condemned Britain Wednesday for laws which allowed a man get away
with beating his nine-year stepson with a garden cane.
	   A panel of nine judges at the court based in Strasbourg, France,
ruled unanimously that Britain had violated article three of the
European Human Rights Convention which states ``no one should be
subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment.''
	   The decision was hailed by children's rights activists.
	   ``This is a landmark judgment for millions of children in the UK
and across Europe,'' said the British campaign group End Physical
Punishment for Children.
	   Britain's Labour government also welcomed the ruling and said it
would ``clarify'' laws to ensure such cases do not happen again.
	   ``This is a commonsense decision which I welcome,'' said Health
Minister Paul Boateng. ``There is no excuse for such behavior, and
it is right and proper to condemn it.
	   But the leader of the Conservative opposition blasted the
judgment as interference in family life.
	   ``We've taken the nanny state too far when we have to have court
rulings about what people can do with their own children in their
own home on things like this,'' William Hague told BBC radio.
	   In a statement, the European court said a doctor discovered
bruises on a child in 1993 which indicated the boy had been beaten
with a cane, using ``considerable force, on more than one
occasion.'' The boy's name was not released.
	   His stepfather was charged with assault causing actual bodily
harm, but acquitted after claiming the beatings amounted
``reasonable punishment,'' which is a permissible defense under
English law for parents charged with assaulting their children.
	   The European court awarded the child, now aged 14, 10,000 pounds
(dlrs 16,800) compensation and legal costs of 20,000 pounds (dlrs
33,600).

Penguins still unsure about Kasparaitis injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Darius
Kasparaitis of Lithuania underwent further tests Tuesday but still
doesn't know how badly he injured his right knee.
	   An MRI test was inconclusive and the North American National
Hockey League club plan more tests. Part of the problem is that
swelling in the knee is making the diagnosis more difficult.
	   Kasparaitis, the Penguins' most dependable defenseman last
season, may have torn his anterior cruciate ligament after becoming
tangled with Detroit's Darryl Laplante along the boards in an
exhibition game Sunday.
	   Kasparaitis will likely miss the season if the ACL is torn. A
tear in the same knee forced him to miss the final 35 games of the
New York Islanders' lockout-shortened 1995 season.
	   ``He's a big part of our offense, a big part of our team,''
right winger Jaromir Jagr said.

Scuffles break out at headquarters of Egyptian leftist party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A large fist fight involving Anwar Sadat's
nephew broke out Wednesday at the headquarters of an Egyptian
leftist party over a leadership election, police officials said.
	   Two men were slightly injured in the scuffles between supporters
of rival leaders of the al-Ahrar Socialist Party, police said.
	   Police called in scores of officers to quell the fighting among
some 250 party members and hired thugs in the al-Ahrar offices in
downtown Cairo, the officials said.
	   The clashes began after Talaat Sadat, nephew of the late
Egyptian president, stormed the party headquarters with his
followers, demanding to run in the election. Sadat had been barred
from the polls, which were triggered by the death of the party's
leader last month.
	   A leading candidate, Ragab Hamadeh, retaliated by calling in
about 200 thugs to throw Sadat out, said the police officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The al-Ahrar party, which was founded in 1975, calls for greater
political freedom, worker's rights, and the abolition of the state
of emergency, which has been in force since Sadat's assassination
in 1981.

Report: Rushdie death sentence will be lifted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Rushdie meets Foreign Office officials, quotes,
comment from British Muslims; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; With Iran-Khatami &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Salman Rushdie met with British Foreign Office
officials Wednesday amid reports that Iran is preparing to withdraw
publicly the threat on the author's life.
	   ``We met with representatives of the (Foreign Office) this
morning concerning remarks made by Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami,'' said a statement by Rushdie supporters who accompanied
him to the meeting.
	   ``We remain cautiously optimistic.''
	   At a news conference on Tuesday in New York, Khatami suggested
that Iran wanted to put the Rushdie affair behind it, saying Iran
considered it ``completely finished.''
	   And London's Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday that Kamal
Kharrazi, Iran's foreign minister, plans to announce the lifting of
the Rushdie death threat when he meets with British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook in New York Thursday.
	   Publication of Rushdie's '' Satanic Verses'' in 1988 caused an
uproar among Muslims around the world, who contended that it
insulted Islam. The novel brought an Iranian ``fatwa,'' or death
sentence from Iran's Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini in February 1989.
Islamic militants put a 1.2 million pound (dlrs 2 million) bounty
on the Indian-born British writer's head.
	   Two members of the International Rushdie Defense Committee
accompanied the author to the Foreign Office Wednesday. They said
they hoped to meet with government officials again on Thursday.
	   Iran hopes the move to dissociate Tehran from the bounty will
lead to a new diplomatic relationship with Britain, and help Tehran
shake its pariah status, the Guardian reported.
	   Kharrazi is likely to tell Cook that the Iranian government is
calling on the Khordad Foundation, which in 1989 offered the
bounty, to drop the offer and provide other firm indications that
the affair is over, the newspaper reported.
	   Iran has long claimed that the fatwa is an irreversible
religious edict, even though it has no plans to send anyone to kill
the author. But Britain, also anxious to end the affair, is seeking
solid guarantees.
	   British Muslims said Wednesday the Iranian government has no
authority to lift the fatwa.
	   ``It is Islamic law, it will remain so irrespective of what does
or does not happen in Tehran,'' said Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, leader
of an umbrella group that styles itself the the Muslim Parliament
of Great Britain. ``The fatwa stands.''
	   Siddiqui was, however, careful to emphasize that the parliament
was not calling for Muslims in Britain to attempt to carry out the
death sentence.
	   ``We have always said that the fatwa is valid, but as far as
Muslims here are concerned, they should make sure they are not
involved in carrying out the fatwa,'' he said.

Olympic airways flights to take place on schedule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - All Olympic Airways flights will take
place as scheduled despite a planned four-day strike by civil
aviation employees, the state-run national carrier announced
Wednesday.
	   Olympic said its own employees and ground crews will replace
strikers during the labor action set to start Thursday. It added
that all its flights, both international and domestic, will take
place as scheduled. Olympic has its own terminal and facilities at
Athens airport, the country's largest.
	   But hundreds of regularly scheduled flights to and from Greece
by foreign carriers and charter companies will still be affected by
the strike, being staged by the 2,700-strong civil aviation union.
	   The union is demanding more money and protesting government
plans to revamp the civil aviation service by splitting it up
according to specialization.
	   In an effort to stop the action, the civil aviation authority
has asked the courts to rule it illegal.

South African troops meet unexpected resistance in Lesotho

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South African troops struggled to mop up
stubborn resistance near a Lesotho military compound Wednesday
while soldiers from Botswana fanned out in the kingdom's gutted
capital to stop looting.
	   Scattered gunfire and explosions echoed through the capital, and
many stores were still smoldering from fires set on Tuesday, when
600 South African troops crossed the border to quell a military
uprising.
	   The military said 170 mutinous Lesotho soldiers had been
captured.
	   Despite attempts to stop it, looting continued for a second day.
A young man was seen leaving a sacked store bent down under a
bundle of goods in a blanket and clutching a children's bike. A
Botswanan soldier looked on.
	   South African military officials in Pretoria said in a statement
that their troops, surprised by the ferocity of the opposition,
would be more aggressive and use more firepower to supress the
Lesotho mutineers.
	   ``Where the peace forces started out by being circumspect in
clashes, they will now shoot to kill,'' a military spokesman told
the South African Press Association.
	   South Africa's first military intervention since the end of
apartheid in 1994 was quickly proving costly. Military officials in
Pretoria said at least nine South African soldiers had been killed.
A senior officer in Maseru said 10 had died in the fighting at the
Makonyane barracks.
	   The military in Pretoria also said 17 South African soldiers had
been wounded and that about 40 rebels had died in the fighting.
	   The decision to send troops into Lesotho unleashed biting
criticism from South African opposition parties, churches and
civilian groups. Callers to talk-radio shows almost unanimously
denounced it.
	   ``We are neighboring countries. We are brothers and sisters. Why
are we killing each other?'' said Tony Leon, leader of the
opposition Democratic Party.
	   At the Makonyane barracks northeast of Maseru, where 10 South
African soldiers were slain Tuesday during a South African
helicopter and infantry assault, bursts of machine-gun fire from
the mountain overlooking the compound punctuated the dawn.
	   Lesotho soldiers opposing the intervention have been holed up on
the mountain and surprised the South Africans with their fierce
resistance.
	   Overnight, 60mm and 88mm mortar rounds crashed into the compound
from the mountain, sending South African soldiers scurrying for
protection in their armored personnel carriers.
	   Mutinous Lesotho soldiers also put up unexpectedly heavy
resistance at the Kase Dam, Ratjemose Military Base and at the
Makonyane barracks with assault rifles, mortars, heavy machine guns
and anti-aircraft fire.
	   A senior South African officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the force lacked troops and proper equipment to
handle the stiff resistance.
	   South African media reported that both the Lesotho government
and the opposition said they were ready to negotiate an end to the
crisis. However, it was not immediately clear Wednesday if senior
Lesotho government ministers were still in the country.
	   The intervention came at the request of Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili after a revolt by junior military officers from the
Lesotho Defense Force and amid opposition strikes that paralyzed
Maseru.
	   Some of the ousted military leaders fled the country. The
remaining military appeared to be siding with an opposition
movement that claims elections last May _ swept by the ruling
Lesotho Congress Party _ were rigged.
	   South African troops were distributing fliers telling the people
of this Belgium-sized country that their intervention, on behalf of
the Southern African Development Community, was aimed at preventing
``anarchy'' and to ``create a stable environment for law and
order.''
	   Many of Lesotho's 2 million residents see the South Africans as
an invading force.
	   Michael Mohale, a resident of the capital, noted that South
Africa opposed military intervention in the Congo war. As he
watched a convoy of South African armored personnel carriers rumble
through Maseru, he said: ``We're a small country, so they just came
right in and didn't bother to keep a policy on no military
intervention.''
	   As the convoy growled past shattered and gutted stores, several
women jeered and pointed toward the border on the edge of town.
	   ``Go home,'' the women shouted.
	   Under President Nelson Mandela, South Africa has promoted
nonintervention throughout Africa.

Russian, Ukrainian interior ministers sign cooperation protocol
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The interior ministers of Ukraine and
Russia signed a cooperation protocol on Wednesday to enhance
coordination in the fight against organized and economic crime.
	   The document on mutual cooperation in the years 1999-2000
provides for the creation of a permanent working group that would
coordinate the activities of the two neighboring nations'
law-enforcement bodies.
	   At their meeting Wednesday, Ukraine's interior minister, Yuriy
Kravchenko, and his visiting Russian counterpart, Sergei Stepashin,
noted that cooperation between the two countries already has
boosted their crime-fighting efforts.
	   Over the past year, that cooperation has resulted in the arrest
of 3,000 criminals and the seizure of more than 200 kilograms (440
pounds) of drugs and smuggled goods worth 60 million hryvna (dlrs
20 million at the current exchange rate), Kravchenko said.

Iraq invites 1,500 Iraqi expatriates to Baghdad meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES typo in name of news agency graf 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The government has invited some 1,500
Iraqis who live outside the country to a meeting in Baghdad next
month to ``boost ties'' with their homeland, the official Iraqi
News Agency said Wednesday.
	   A similar meeting for expatriates was held in October 1996.
	   An estimated one million Iraqis live outside the country. Many
left because of economic difficulties after the United Nations
imposed trade sanctions in 1990.
	   The sanctions, which ban the sale of oil and other financial
dealings, were imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
	   INA said the three-day meeting would begin Oct. 5.
	   The meeting will be a ``means to boost ties between Iraqi
expatriates ... with their home country,'' the agency quoted
Abdel-Jabar al-Douri, deputy foreign minister, as saying. He gave
no details of the meeting's agenda.

Experts restore Stalin mosaic in former Stalingrad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A huge mosaic depicting Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin was put back in its old place of honor Wednesday, 42 years
after it was removed from the wall of a planetarium in the city of
Volgograd.
	   The mosaic, commissioned while Stalin was still alive and the
city was known as Stalingrad, was unveiled in 1954, a year after
his death. The Kremlin ordered it destroyed after his crimes were
revealed by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956.
	   But local art experts felt that the 2-meter by 2.5-meter (yards)
stone and marble mosaic was a work of art worth saving, so they
covered it with thick layers of paint, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   On Wednesday, after a year of painstaking restoration, the
mosaic was restored to its original place on the planetarium wall,
the news agency said.
	   It did not say who found the mosaic, or who ordered it restored.

Long-lost Rimbaud manuscript to be sold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - A six-page, hand-scrawled rough draft of Arthur
Rimbaud's masterpiece ``A Season in Hell'' has turned up in a
private collection and will be sold at auction next month.
	   Smudged, yellowed with age, and filled with corrections, the
notebook-size pages give a rare glimpse into the creative genius of
the precocious writer who renounced poetry at 19 to travel the
world.
	   ``Une Saison en Enfer'' (A Season in Hell), a prose poem dating
from 1873, has long been a cult work among Rimbaud admirers. It
expresses his passion for the writer Paul Verlaine, his lover with
whom he would eventually quarrel, as well as his religious and
aesthetic convictions.
	   The manuscript, which experts thought had been destroyed long
ago, belongs to a 97-year-old bibliophile who claims he has never
shown it in public.
	   Jacques Guerin, one of France's foremost collectors, told the
daily Le Figaro Wednesday that he was getting rid of the manuscript
to remove a weight from his chest.
	   ``I'm a little bit like the old man who marries off his
daughters before dying,'' he was quoted as telling Le Figaro.
``Better to marry them off than leave them old maids on the street.
So I've avoided the street.''
	   The manuscript will be sold by French auctioneer Jacques Tajan
on Nov. 17 at Drouot Montaigne. A spokeswoman for the auction house
said an estimate would not be available until next month.
	   Guerin, who has been collecting rare manuscripts since he was
22, said he first stumbled on the Rimbaud manuscript in London in
1938, but couldn't afford to buy it.
	   He finally tracked it down in 1950.
	   ``It hasn't ever left my library or been shown to anyone,''
Guerin was quoted as telling Le Figaro.

Police confirm Albanian gang leader arrested in Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ An Albanian gang leader wanted in
connection with crimes committed during last year's unrest in
Albania has been arrested in Greece, police said Wednesday.
	   Alfred Nebiu, 25, known by the nickname Kakami, was arrested
Tuesday, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga.
	   Greek police assisted by Interpol, the international police
agency, made the arrest, Bizhga said. There was no immediate
comment from Greek police officials.
	   Nebiu headed an armed gang in Vlora, in southern Albania,
accused of various crimes during the 1997 unrest that erupted after
pyramid investment schemes collapsed, costing many Albanians their
life savings.
	   Six members of his gang have been arrested previously. While the
formal accusation only mentions ``criminal activity,'' police
sources said Nebiu and his gang were accused of nine murders and
other crimes.

Court asked to ban expansion of alleged biological weapons plant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The mayor of a small Israeli town asked the
Supreme Court Wednesday to block the government from expanding a
scientific facility in his city because according to press reports
the facility manufactures biological weapons.
	   The government said the reports, which have appeared in Israeli
newspapers attributed to unnamed ``foreign reports,'' are
inaccurate, but citing security reasons, refused to say in open
court what the institute makes.
	   The Supreme Court is to consider the petition Thursday.
	   The Biological Institute has been operating for decades in Nes
Tsiona, a small bedroom community south of Tel Aviv.
	   In his petition to the Supreme Court, Nes Tsiona's Mayor Yossi
Shevo wrote that the institute conducts research ``in the area of
biological weapons and manufactures ... violent bacteria, which
constitute a danger to the lives of the people living in the
vicinity of the institute.''
	   Shevo said he based his claim on the unattributed foreign
reports.
	   Interviewed on Israel's Army radio, Shevo said the institute
ought to be transferred to an unpopulated area in Israel's Negev
desert, where the country's nuclear reactor is located.
	   In its response to the court, the Justice Ministry wrote on
behalf of the government that the foreign press reports were
``inaccurate.''
	   However the state refused to say in open court what the
inaccuracies are ``for reasons of security.'' It was prepared to
tell this to the judges behind closed doors, provided the
petitioners were not present.
	   Journalist Yossi Melman, who has written books about Israeli
intelligence and covers the issue for the Haaretz newspaper, said
``it is accepted in the international intelligence community that
the institute in Nes Tsiona manufactures biological weapons.''
	   Fifteen years ago the institute's deputy director, Marcus
Klingberg, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for passing state
secrets to the Soviet Union.
	   Last week a court released the 80 year-old scientist on health
grounds but because of the knowledge he possesses, he is still
considered a security risk by the state and remains under
round-the-clock surveillance.
	   The state admitted that the institute employs about 300 people,
120 of them scientists in the fields of biology, biochemistry,
biotechnology, chemistry, mathematics, pharmacology, physics and
environmental sciences.
	   The lawyer for Nes Tziona, Shai Segal told The Associated Press
he will demand a thorough environmental impact study, but
regardless of the results, the community will continue to seek the
removal of the institute from Nes Tsiona.

Election results to be announced Thursday

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Final results of nationwide
elections will be announced Thursday, international organizers of
the vote announced Wednesday. They are expected to confirm reports
of a hardliner's upset victory for the Bosnian Serb presidency.
	   International officials had hoped the elections _ the third in
three post-war years _ would further sideline hard-line
nationalists opposed to ethnic tolerance and other provisions of
the 1995 peace agreement.
	   But officials familiar with unofficial results said the
Western-supported incumbent had lost to a hardliner in the race for
the Bosnian Serb presidency and that Croat nationalists were
winning over more moderate Croats in the Federal Parliament.
	   ``We see this disappointing, but it is the exception rather than
the rule,'' said U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard.
	   Still, ``everything else has moved in the right direction,''
toward greater democratic pluralism and greater power for parties
supporting the Dayton peace accord, he added, alluding to good
showings by moderates in some parliamentary races.
	   Bosnia is divided between the Bosnian Serb half of the country
and a federation of Muslims and Croats, running the other half.
Both of those entities have their own governments but are linked by
a third joint central government.
	   In the Serb part, nationalist Nikola Poplasen seems to have
defeated U.S. backed president Biljana Plavsic - a blow to
expensive western efforts to cement her moderate Serb government.
Plavsic already conceded defeat on Monday.
	   Moderate Kresimir Zubak also seems to have lost the Croat seat
of the three-member, three-nation Bosnian presidency to a hardline
rival believed opposed to cooperation with Muslims in the
Croat-Muslim Bosnian Federation.
	   Moderate Zivko Radisic, however, appears to have defeated
incumbent Momcilo Krajisnik for the Serb seat on the Bosnian
presidency. Krajisnik is allied with Radovan Karadzic, the wartime
Bosnian Serb leader now under double indictment by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal.
	   Bracing for possible trouble with Poplasen as Bosnian Serb
president, Bosnian High Commissioner Carlos Westendorp on Tuesday
said that he would act if there is ``deliberate disruption of the
democratic process by any leader.''
	   Westendorp, Bosnia's highest-ranked international official, did
not specify what action he would take but has the authority to
remove uncooperative officials.
	   Branding the elections a failure, the daily Oslobodjenje wrote:
``Bosnia took a step back from democracy ... and came closer to to
the option of the final ethnic division, which represents a failure
of the U.S. policy in Bosnia.''

Legislator proposes freezing assets of Italian insurer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli legislator demanded Wednesday that
the government freeze the Israeli assets of an Italian insurance
companies that reneged on an agreement to pay dlrs 100 million to
families of Holocaust victims who were policyholders.
	   Assicurazioni Generali, Italy's largest insurer, announced
Tuesday that it would not honor the settlement it negotiated with
families of Holocaust victims and U.S. insurance commissioners.
	   The company blamed the other parties, saying they had not lived
up to the agreement.
	   In response, Israeli legislator Michael Kleiner demanded that
the Israeli government freeze the assets of Migdal, an Israeli
insurance company bought by Generali recently for dlrs 200 million.
	   ``It is clear that these assets need to be frozen and maybe, at
a later stage, if an agreement is not worked out with Generali,
sold as part of the money given to the families of victims,''
Kleiner told Israel radio.
	   The legislator also reiterated a demand that Generali post the
names of policy holders on the Internet so heirs and Holocaust
survivors can check whether they are entitled to money.
	   Motti Sherf, a spokesman for the Israeli insurance commissioner
said freezing Migdal's assets would fall outside the commissioner's
jurisdiction and would require special legislation.
	   Kleiner, meanwhile, criticized an earlier decision to present
Generali President Antoine Bernheim with an award for having
contributed to the Israeli economy. Dozens of international
business leaders are to receive the ``Jubilee Award,'' along with
Bernheim.
	   According to organizers, Bernheim is still among the recipients.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his aides were en
route to New York on Wednesday and could not immediately be reached
for comment.
	   But Kleiner said it was ``shocking to think that Generali's
president will receive an award from the prime minister for buying
an Israeli company with funds stolen from Jews.''
	   Generali is one of 16 European insurance companies named in a
federal class-action suit filed last year in New York. Another suit
was filed in February in a Los Angeles Superior Court by family
members of five Holocaust victims.
	   Some Jewish leaders have praised Generali for actions such as
assisting Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, in
gathering lists of Holocaust victims.
	   Last year, Generali established a dlrs 12 million fund for
Holocaust survivors. The company has expressed support for an
international commission to investigate claims by victims and their
families.

petitioners were not present.
	   Journalist Yossi Melman, who has written books about Israeli
intelligence and covers the issue for the Haaretz newspaper, said
``it is accepted in the international intelligence community that
the institute in Nes Tsiona manufactures biological weapons.''
	   Fifteen years ago the institute's deputy director, Marcus
Klingberg, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for passing state
secrets to the Soviet Union.
	   Last week a court released the 80 year-old scientist on health
grounds but because of the knowledge he possesses, he is still
considered a security risk by the state and remains under
round-the-clock surveillance.
	   The state admitted that the institute employs about 300 people,
120 of them scientists in the fields of biology, biochemistry,
biotechnology, chemistry, mathematics, pharmacology, physics and
environmental sciences.
	   The lawyer for Nes Tziona, Shai Segal told The Associated Press
he will demand a thorough environmental impact study, but
regardless of the results, the community will continue to seek the
removal of the institute from Nes Tsiona.

Faldo ends 13-year relationship with Leadbetter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Faldo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ When Nick Faldo went looking for a swing
that could stand the test of championship pressure, he turned to
David Leadbetter and won six majors. Now that he's mired in a deep
slump, Faldo is looking elsewhere.
	   Faldo has sent his longtime teacher a letter saying he needed a
fresh start with a new swing coach. Leadbetter said Faldo has
decided to work with Chip Koehlke of the Faldo Golf Institute in
Orlando.
	   ``It's disappointing when you work so hard with a player for so
many years,'' Leadbetter said. ``We had a good relationship, as far
as these things go in this field. Sometimes you need a fresh
outlook, I suppose. Still, it was a bit of a shock.''
	   Faldo, who is at the German Masters this week, said Wednesday he
hasn't spoken to Leadbetter for five weeks.
	   ``Obviously, we hadn't been communicating, and the last couple
of months I have been burning my buns and getting nowhere,'' Faldo
said. ``I decided to have a lesson with Chip and he showed me a lot
of things, which was great. It was clearing the air.''
	   Faldo and Leadbetter comprised one of the most famous
teacher-student relationships in golf. Leadbetter was often at
Faldo's side on the practice range wearing his trademark Panama
hat; Faldo often referred him to simply as ``Lead.''
	   Faldo, a rising English star who had come up short in the
biggest tournaments, turned to Leadbetter in the spring of 1985 and
asked him to revamp his swing from top to bottom. Faldo went two
years without winning before emerging as the world's dominant
player.
	   He made 18 pars in the final round to win the British Open at
Muirfield and went on to win the Open in 1990 and 1992. He also is
the last man to win consecutive U.S. Masters (1989-90), and added
his third green jacket in 1996 with a final-round 67 to come from
six strokes back to beat Greg Norman.
	   When Faldo was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in St.
Augustine, Florida, in May, he credited Leadbetter for turning his
game around.
	   In his letter, sent to the Leadbetter Golf Academy, Faldo said
he felt he should start with someone new because of the worse slump
of his career. Faldo has dropped to 65th in the world rankings and
has not won since the 1997 Nissan Open in Los Angeles.
	   Leadbetter also said it could be a business-related decision.
	   ``He was asked to promote the Nick Faldo Institute as much as he
could in the last year,'' Leadbetter said. ``That's why you didn't
often hear my name associated with his when he spoke.''

Police confirm FBI presence in Uganda; legislators opposed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A senior police officer confirmed reports
on Wednesday that FBI agents were helping Ugandan police combat
terrorism.
	   Newspapers reported Wednesday that some legislators are opposed
to the participation of the FBI agents in the recent arrests of
several dozen people alleged to be planning attacks on Ugandan and
American targets in the country.
	   The officer who confirmed the presence of the FBI agents spoke
on condition he not be indentified. He did not elaborate further.
	   Police spokesman Bob Ngobi refused to confirm the reports, but
asked: ``If FBI is helping us to combat this new phenomenon of
crime, what is wrong with that?'' he said. ``The concern is the
safety of our people.''
	   According to the press reports, the agents have been in the East
African nation for several weeks.
	   President Yoweri Museveni's government has refused comment, but
security in the country has been tightened since bombings last
month of three long-distance passenger buses in which 30 people
died. Among those arrested were Ugandans and Somalis.
	   The state-owned New Vision newspaper Wednesday quoted legislator
Elly Karuhanga as saying that foreign agents should not be allowed
in on assignment until legislation is passed that would allow them
to do so.
	   Ngobi said foreign nations assist Uganda in other fields and
there would be nothing new about the presence of FBI agents in
Uganda.
	   ``If they are helping us track down these people and giving us
expertise in this crime which has taken long in their countries, I
do not see anything wrong,'' Ngobi said.
	   He acknowledged that an anti-terrorist squad is undergoing
intensive training with assistance from friendly countries, which
he declined to identify.
	   FBI agents have been in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania
investigating the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in those
countries in which 259 people, including 12 Americans, were killed.

Philippine Airlines, union resume last-minute negotiations to avert
</HEADLINE>
closure
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Estrada saying PAL
chairman is no longer interested in keeping PAL open; company
official saying compromise is unlikely; conditions demanded by
union for agreeing to rescue plan; other details
 &UR; AP Photos Available
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hours before its scheduled midnight
closure, Philippine Airlines resumed talks with its largest union
Wednesday after workers agreed to partially accept a
management-proposed rescue plan.
	   But a PAL official doubted whether an agreement could be reached
in time to save Asia's oldest airline.
	   ``We don't think a compromise is possible,'' PAL chief finance
officer Jimmy Bautista said.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada, who tried to mediate
between the two sides, said PAL chairman Lucio Tan was ``no longer
interested'' in keeping the airline operating.
	   ``He has given up,'' Estrada said. ``In case PAL returns, it
will be under new management.''
	   Tan holds a 70 percent stake in the airline, while the
government owns about 18 percent.
	   The scheduled demise of Asia's oldest airline has saddened many
Filipinos. Several television stations broadcast poignant scenes
Wednesday from its 57-year history.
	   At PAL offices around the country, airline workers held masses
and prayer rallies Wednesday, hoping for a way to avoid the flag
carrier's closure.
	   At Manila's airport, scores of employees, many dressed in black,
held a prayer vigil during their lunch hour in front of the
domestic terminal building.
	   The government, meanwhile, struggled to prepare for the impact
of a shutdown on the country's already ailing economy.
	   PAL ground workers rejected the management rescue plan in a
referendum Tuesday, but on Wednesday their union agreed to accept
it with modifications. PAL has said the plan is a prerequisite for
it to recover from a series of crippling strikes and Asia's
currency crisis.
	   In the plan, Tan offered workers 20 percent of the airline's
stock and three seats on its board in exchange for a 10-year
suspension of their collective bargaining agreement.
	   The union agreed to the 10-year suspension if PAL accepted an
annual review of salary structures, retention of all benefits,
security of tenure, and a halt to spin-off companies, Bautista
said.
	   PAL announced last week that it would close at midnight
Wednesday unless the union accepts the rescue plan.
	   The airline says creditors, to whom it owes dlrs 2.1 billion,
have insisted on guarantees of labor harmony before they approve a
restructuring plan.
	   PAL currently has a 50 percent share of domestic passenger
traffic, down from 75 percent before a pilots' strike in June.
	   Its closure would leave many areas of the sprawling archipelago
of 7,000 islands without air service. Two smaller carriers were
grounded last week over safety concerns and financial problems.
	   The only alternative for travel among the country's islands is
slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries. Last Friday, a ferry carrying
454 people sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila.
	   If PAL closes, it would be the largest company to fail in the
Philippines since Asia's currency crisis, which hit just as the
airline was launching a dlrs 4 billion expansion and refleeting
plan.

Ukraine's president warns of looming financial collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on
Wednesday made his darkest economic forecast yet, warning that
Ukraine was standing on the verge of its deepest financial crisis
since independence in 1991.
	   ``Never in the last seven years of independence had we faced
such a threat of financial catastrophe as today,'' Kuchma said.
	   ``Unfortunately, the forecasts for the near future are much
worse than we expected before,'' he told a meeting of regional
newspaper editors in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.
	   Ukraine's government is desperately trying to avert an economic
collapse following a financial crisis that hit the former Soviet
republic in the wake of turmoil in neighboring Russia.
	   After two years of relative stability in Ukraine's financial
market, the country's currency, the hryvna, is falling steadily,
reflecting the government's failure in recent years to implement
reforms needed to increase budget revenues and boost economic
growth.
	   In an attempt to stabilize the hryvna, the cash-strapped Cabinet
ordered the conversion of state treasury bills held by foreign and
domestic investors, restricted trading in U.S. dollars at the
currency exchange and allowed local authorities to arbitrarily
impose price controls.
	   However, more than 70 anti-crisis measures approved by the
government so far have done little to improve the economic
situation and restore the confidence of foreign investors to
attract the much-needed money, Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tyhypko
said.
	   Speaking at the same venue, Tyhypko said tax and other payments
to the state budget have fallen sharply this month. Despite
receiving more than dlrs 500 million in aid from the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank in recent weeks, Ukraine needs more
foreign aid to withstand the crisis, he said.
	   Tyhypko added that Ukraine could no longer hope for private
domestic or foreign loans and could only rely on credits from
international financial organizations or foreign governments.
	   He said Ukraine has won preliminary approval from the European
Commission on receiving an ECU 150 million (dlrs 165 million) loan
and is negotiating with the governments of Japan and other
countries over financial aid.
	   Meanwhile, the situation in the financial market appeared to be
worsening.
	   The hryvna, which had remained stable until mid-August at around
2.1 to the U.S. dollar, continued to plunge this week to 3.18 to
the dollar Tuesday. The rate was dangerously close to the edge of
the currency trading band of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar introduced by
the government this month.
	   Ukrainian commercial banks conducted a closed-door meeting
Tuesday to discuss ways to avoid bankruptcy, which bankers said
awaits many of them if they agree to the government's debt
conversion plan.
	   The plan is expected to deprive the banks of cash. They are to
exchange their bonds, the last of which mature by August 1999, into
paper maturing at the end of 2000.
	   Ukraine is desperate to postpone at least some of debt payments
since its total debt obligations far exceed the budget revenues
expected through the end of 1998.

Bulgaria to cut subsidies for state radio, TV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Government will stop subsidizing state
radio and television in 2008 under a broadcast media law parliament
adopted Wednesday.
	   Government subsidies will be reduced at the end of 2002 and
viewers' fees will make up the difference until the end of 2007.
After that, state radio and television will subsist from fees
alone.
	   No such fees are charged at present. Households will be charged
0.6 percent of the government-set minimum monthly wage, while
companies and institutions will be charged 2.5 percent of the
minimum monthly wage, currently leva 55,000 (some dlrs 33).
	   All three opposition parties _ the Socialists, the
Social-Democratic Euroleft and an alliance led by an ethnic Turkish
party _ boycotted sessions formulating the law and have announced
they will challenge it in court.
	   The law still needs to be signed by President Petar Stoyanov to
take effect. Stoyanov has not announced yet whether he would sign
it. He can ask the lawmakers to reconsider legislation but he
cannot override their vote if they refuse to.
	   The new law replaces an old one discarded after parts of it were
ruled invalid by Constitutional Court for allowing too much direct
government control.

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Liberian lawmakers ordered
pro-government groups to abandon plans Wednesday to protest in
front of the heavily fortified U.S. Embassy, where a former warlord
has taken refuge since weekend gun battles.
	   The Liberian Senate ordered that a demonstration organized by 15
civic groups be canceled to prevent ``certain unscrupulous
individuals from exploiting the situation to cause further chaos,''
a statement said.
	   The groups had planned to march to the seaside U.S. compound to
protest the presence there of former rebel leader Roosevelt Johnson
_ sparking fears at the embassy that the situation could again turn
violent.
	   The government of President Charles Taylor has repeatedly
demanded that Johnson, Taylor's chief rival, be turned over to
them.
	   Inside the compound Wednesday morning, embassy employees worked
through the rain to stack sandbags on the roof, setting up nests
where snipers or machine-gunners could be posted.
	   Others sealed a front gate with roll after roll of barbed wire.
American servicemen, some of them heavily armed and dressed for
combat, patrolled around the buildings and the grounds.
	   Just outside, a U.S. Navy commando and an embassy security
officer were inspecting the surrounding neighborhood with a group
of West African peacekeepers, searching out potential weak points
in the defenses. The peacekeepers, known as ECOMOG, have patrolled
parts of Liberia for years, and have a heavy force now around the
U.S. Embassy.
	   Dozens of people died in a two-day clash that began Friday night
involving Taylor's forces and supporters of Johnson, who has since
been charged with treason along with 21 other people.
	   Looking for a safe haven, Johnson turned up at the U.S. Embassy
on Saturday, but was fired on by Liberian forces as he spoke with
embassy officials outside the gate.
	   Johnson, two of his sons and several aides rushed into the
compound, but not before at least three of his men were killed and
two Americans were wounded. He remained holed up in the embassy
Wednesday, camped out on the floor of a lobby.
	   It is unclear what will happen to Johnson, though U.S. officials
have said he will not be handed over the government.
	   Diplomats _ who did not want Johnson coming into the compound at
all _ now find themselves reluctantly protecting him.
	   State Department officials in Washington are negotiating with
Taylor's government, seeking a solution. That may involve flying
him to a neutral country _ though Taylor's government has
repeatedly demanded that not happen again.
	   In 1996, when Liberia's 7-year civil war was still raging and
Taylor and Johnson controlled competing factions, Johnson sought
shelter at the embassy and was eventually flown to Ghana on a U.S.
helicopter.
	   While Taylor has promised that the embassy won't come under
attack, most of the staff have been evacuated and extra troops have
been brought in to shore up the compound's defenses. The U.S.
government has also suggested that Americans living in Liberia
leave the country for the time being.
	   Liberia's civil war ended two years ago, after 150,000 people
were killed and half the country's population became refugees.
Taylor was elected president in elections last year.

Police call on governments to harmonize car theft and insurance

fraud laws

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police from 24 countries called on
governments Wednesday to harmonize legislation on international car
thefts, smuggling and insurance fraud, to beef up international
protection of car owners and insurers.
	   The move came at the close of a three-day convention on
international vehicle thefts attended by the police and two
international organizations in Bulgaria's capital. The police also
urged their governments endorse a United Nations proposal that
would ease the return of internationally stolen motor vehicles.
	   International police have recorded more than 1 million car
thefts since the collapse of the Cold War in 1989. Many of the
vehicles are believed to have been smuggled out of Western counties
into the former Soviet bloc or the Middle East.
	   Legal differences between countries are often prevent cars
smuggled over international borders from being returned to their
owners when police impound them. The cars often change ownership
several times, and most owners buy them in good faith.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A deputy director and an editor of Iran's
official news agency will be released on bail, the agency reported
Wednesday.
	   Mohammad Reza Sadeq, the deputy director of the Islamic Republic
News Agency, and Ali-Reza Khosravi, the social affairs editor, will
be released on bail of 100 million rials (dlrs 33,333) each, IRNA
said.
	   The agency report gave no idea of when the release would take
place.
	   Sadeq and Khosravi were detained Tuesday after Mohsen
Rafiqdoust, a senior cleric, filed a complaint to a Tehran court
about an IRNA report on an attempt on his life on Sept. 13.
	   The nature of the complaint is not known, but on Sept. 13 the
agency initially suggested that Rafiqdoust had been injured, saying
he was ``in satisfactory condition'' and ``received no serious
injuries.''
	   Later the agency reported Rafiqdoust had not been hurt in the
attack, which occurred when shots were fired through the window of
his high-rise office in North Tehran from nearby hills.
	   Rafiqdoust, a hard-line cleric, is the head of a foundation that
cares for the poor and persons disabled in the Iran-Iraq war of
1980-88.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Lawyers for French cyclist Richard Virenque said
Wednesday that they plan to file suit against Willy Voet, the
former Festina physio who accused him of drug abuse.
	   ``We are clearly going to file a complaint against him,''
Gilbert Collard, Virenque's lawyer, said on France 3 television.
	   ``Willy Voet is the accused who has become the accuser, the
pyromaniac who the firemen want, the thief who cries robbery,'' he
said.
	   Voet had accused Virenque, one of France's top cyclists, of drug
abuse, saying that he took the same substances as other members of
the team that was expelled from the Tour de France.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government agreed to speed up its
privatization program by promising to sell off 40 state-owned
companies as quickly as possible, a state-controlled newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The Herald said the first of the companies, the Zimbabwe
Reinsurance Corp., would be offered for sale to private
shareholders immediately.
	   It is fully owned by the government.
	   Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said the sale of state
companies and the state's shareholdings in other firms was expected
to raise 3.6 billion Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 130 million) before the
end of the year.
	   He told The Herald that among state firms being sold were a
finance house, a holding company with large construction interests,
a tobacco company and parts of the state ironworks and steelmaker
ZISCO.
	   International lending institutions and Western donors have
called for the speeding up privatization under market-led economic
reforms adopted in 1992 after a decade of socialist economic
policies.

	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ Legislative elections in
Central African Republic that were originally planned for this week
have been rescheduled to run in two stages in November to December,
authorities said Wednesday.
	   The country's electoral commission had complained it was not
prepared, saying it needs logistical equipment and at least another
dlrs 3.1 million in funding.
	   In a statement signed by President Ange-Felix Patasse, the
government said the first round of elections would now take place
on Nov. 22 and run-off elections between the leading candidates
would take place on Dec. 16.
	   Members of the legislature will be sworn in on Jan. 1.
	   A number of opposition parties have boycotted the election
plans, originally due to begin on Sept. 20, accusing Patasse of
trying to manipulate the process.
	   United Nations peacekeepers led by eight African countries and
supported by French and Canadian troops will remain in the country
to set the stage for the poll.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Hunger has struck several areas of
Mozambique, affecting more than 300,000 people, and it is feared
that the situation will gradually worsen until the next harvest,
around April 1999.
	   The Mozambique News Agency, AIM, quoted a senior official of the
Mozambican relief agency, the Disasters Control Office, Joao
Zamissa, as saying that of the 300,000 people at risk, 120,000 will
receive food because of the seriousness of their situation.
	   ``The hunger was caused either by the flooding that hit central
Mozambique during the last crop year, or by exceptionally dry
conditions in other parts of the country,'' said Zamissa.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Another 120 police officers in
Lindelani township, north of Durban, on Wednesday where at least 36
people have died since the beginning of April.
	   The fighting is believed to be the result of a power struggle
between two factions of the Inkatha Freedom Party.
	   Seven people were shot dead and several homes gutted in violence
in the informal settlement on Tuesday last week.
	   A joint police and army operational center was established in
Lindelani section to monitor the situation.
	   The additional policemen, from North-West and Northern Province,
would be deployed for at least two months.

Court asked to ban expansion of alleged biological weapons plant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The mayor of a small Israeli town asked the
Supreme Court Wednesday to block the government from expanding a
scientific facility in his city because the facility reportedly
manufactures biological weapons.
	   The government said the press reports, which have appeared in
Israeli newspapers attributed to unnamed ``foreign reports,'' are
inaccurate, but citing security reasons, refused to say in open
court what the institute makes.
	   The Supreme Court is to consider the petition Thursday.
	   The Biological Institute has been operating for decades in Nes
Tsiona, a small bedroom community south of Tel Aviv.
	   In his petition to the Supreme Court, Nes Tsiona's Mayor Yossi
Shevo wrote that the institute conducts research ``in the area of
biological weapons and manufactures ... violent bacteria, which
constitute a danger to the lives of the people living in the
vicinity of the institute.''
	   Shevo said he based his claim on the unattributed foreign
reports.
	   Interviewed on Israel's Army radio, Shevo said the institute
ought to be transferred to an unpopulated area in Israel's Negev
desert, where the country's nuclear reactor is located.
	   In its response to the court, the Justice Ministry wrote on
behalf of the government that the foreign press reports were
``inaccurate.''
	   However the state refused to say in open court what the
inaccuracies are ``for reasons of security.'' It was prepared to
tell this to the judges behind closed doors, provided the
petitioners were not present.
	   Journalist Yossi Melman, who has written books about Israeli
intelligence and covers the issue for the Haaretz newspaper, said
``it is accepted in the international intelligence community that
the institute in Nes Tsiona manufactures biological weapons.''
	   Fifteen years ago, the institute's deputy director, Marcus
Klingberg, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for passing state
secrets to the Soviet Union.
	   Last week a court released the 80 year-old scientist on health
grounds but because of the knowledge he possesses, he is still
considered a security risk by the state and remains under
round-the-clock surveillance.
	   The state admitted that the institute employs about 300 people,
120 of them scientists in the fields of biology, biochemistry,
biotechnology, chemistry, mathematics, pharmacology, physics and
environmental sciences.
	   The lawyer for Nes Tziona, Shai Segal, told The Associated Press
he will demand a thorough environmental impact study, but
regardless of the results, the community will continue to seek the
removal of the institute from Nes Tsiona.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who
has the power to send financial markets soaring or plummeting with
a few well chosen words, could be getting ready to tell investors
Wednesday what they want to hear most _ that the Fed will cut U.S.
interest rates to fight a widening global financial crisis.
	   Expectations of such a move were heightened Tuesday by comments
of William McDonough, president of the New York regional Fed bank.
``The balance of risk has shifted from one of concern about
inflation to one of concern about inadequate growth,'' said
McDonough.
	   ``I can assure you that as I go into that meeting I will
continue to be very aware of potential weakness in our economy,''
McDonough told reporters after a speech in London, referring to
next Tuesday's closed-door discussions by the Federal Open Market
Committee, the group of Fed governors and regional bank presidents
who set interest rate policies.
	   If the FOMC does move interest rates, it is possible Greenspan
will signal such a change in remarks he was scheduled to deliver
Wednesday before the Senate Budget Committee.
	   Wall Street got off to a strong start Wednesday in anticipation
of Greenspan's appearance. Hopes that Greenspan would give
investors some indication of what Fed policy-makers will do next
week sent the Dow Jones industrial average surged upward by 100
points immediately after the opening bell but gave back some of
those gains in later trading.

Siemens forms fund for Nazi slave laborers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Following Volkswagen's lead, Siemens announced
plans Wednesday for a 20 million mark (dlrs 12 million) fund to
compensate former slave laborers forced to work for the company by
the Nazis during World War II.
	   The electronics giant, along with VW, is one of several German
businesses under pressure from lawsuits in the United States and
threats of more at home from Nazi-era victims.
	   Volkswagen last week became the first of these firms to agree to
victim payments when it announced its own 20 million mark fund, a
change of heart after arguing for years that it had no legal duty
to pay back wages for labor forced on it by the Nazi war machine.
	   Siemens had a similar change of heart: Almost a year ago, at its
150th anniversary celebrations, the company had insisted it could
do no more for its former slave laborers than express ``deepest
regrets.''
	   The Munich-based Siemens said its fund is in addition to the 7.2
million marks it paid to the Jewish Claims Conference in 1961 and
to providing humanitarian help for victims.
	   Other firms that used slave labor during World War II also have
donated to Jewish groups; Daimler gave 20 million marks (dlrs 11
million) and Krupp, the steel and engineering group, said it
provided 10 million marks (dlrs 5.5 million) in 1959.
	   But the threat of lawsuits has raised the pressure on German
firms to pay direct claims to the thousands of concentration camp
inmates, mostly Jews, forced to work in their factories.
	   Along with Siemens and Volkswagen, Krupp, Daimler-Benz, Audi and
BMW are named in a New York lawsuit seeking a portion of company
profits for thousands of people for former slave laborers.
	   Recently some of Germany's biggest firms suggested they'd be
willing to contribute to a publicly administered fund, but
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has rejected any government involvement.
	   It is a long-running dispute: Companies say the current
government, as successor to the Nazi regime, should handle
compensation for slave laborers. But the government, which has paid
billions in compensation for health damage and imprisonment, argues
the companies are responsible for back wage claims.
	   An organization separate from Siemens will manage its fund, the
company said in a statement. It gave no further details other than
that the money will be distributed quickly and without a lot of red
tape.

Dutch mothers' union demands a salary for raising children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A small group of Dutch mothers has
launched a protest campaign urging the government to start paying
mothers for their work raising children.
	   The Dutch Union of Mothers for a Collective Labor Agreement is
demanding the Dutch government pay 2,500 guilders (dlrs 1,300) a
month to all mothers 21 years and older with children under the age
of 18.
	   ``Mothers deserve the same rights as other workers,'' union
chairwoman Mariete Hauwert said Wednesday.
	   The plan would allow mothers to stay at home to raise children
instead of working and leaving the children to others' care, she
added.
	   A series of weekly demonstrations outside parliament began
Tuesday with just eight of the union's 85 members taking part.
Hauwert explained the small turnout by claiming she is fighting for
women too pressed for time and money to travel to the seat of
government for a protest.
	   Social Services and Employment Ministry spokesman Toine
Asselbergs said the government was not considering paying mothers.
	   ``There is no discussion about it in the ministry,'' Asselbergs
said.

<TEXT>
	   LWEZA, Uganda (AP) _ Princess Anne on Wednesday opened the first
center in Africa to provide holistic care for people with AIDS,
saying she expected its benefits to be widespread.
	   ``I have no doubt around Africa and in other parts of the world
thousands will benefit from this facility,'' the 48-year-old
princess said, tugging on a cord to unveil a plaque dedicating the
Mildmay Center.
	   The project is largely funded by the British government with
support from the Ugandan government and the World Bank. It is
managed by Mildmay International, a British-based Christian aid
group.
	   Ruth Sims, chief executive of Mildmay International, said the
center will be ``a place of comfort, of care, and of help'' for
thousands of people.
	   Anne, Queen Elizabeth II's only daughter, is on a four-country,
11-day visit to Africa, focusing on charity work. She also was
scheduled to travel to Tanzania, Kenya and Mauritius.
	   The princess also visited privately with President Yoweri
Museveni, who said Uganda's aggressive campaign to contain the
spread of AIDS is working, a government statement said.
	   At least 10 percent of Uganda's population of nearly 20 million
people is infected with the AIDS virus, and more than 500,000 have
died, according to government statistics. But the rate of HIV
infection in some areas is half the level of a decade ago,
according to World Bank figures.
	   With a preventive education program working well, the government
is now working to improve care for AIDS victims.
	   Dr. Veronica Moss, medical director at Mildmay, said the center
is unusual in that in addition to providing care through medicine
and nursing, it will provide physiotherapy, occupational therapy,
nutritional advice, counseling, and pastoral and spiritual care.
	   ``We'll try to treat the whole patient,'' she said.
	   The first patients won't arrive until Oct. 5 at the center in
Lweza, 6 kilometers (about 4 miles) east of Kampala. It is set on a
hill, attractively built of red bricks and tiles.
	   It is modeled after the charity's hospice in East London, where
60 percent of those admitted are of African origin, mostly from
Uganda.
	   Both children and adults who have HIV- or AIDS-related problems
may be referred for treatment and advice as outpatients, Moss said.
	   For example, many infected individuals have health problems such
as pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and skin problems. Some
suffer from mental health problems such as memory loss, confusion,
disorientation and psychiatiric conditions.
	   Subsidized rates will be offered to those who cannot afford to
pay, Moss said. The minimum fee will be 500 Ugandan shillings (U.S.
cents 40). The fee for private patients will be 30,000 (dlrs 24).

IOC drug chief says FloJo faced especially tough drug tests in
</HEADLINE>
Seoul &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Olympic officials singled out Florence
Griffith Joyner for rigorous drug testing during the 1988 Seoul
Games because of rumors she used steroids, the IOC's top
anti-doping official said Wednesday.
	   But Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the International
Olympic Committee's medical commission, said Griffith Joyner passed
all the tests and it was unfair to suggest she was a drug cheat.
	   Griffith Joyner, who won three gold medals in Seoul and still
holds world records in the 100 meters and 200 meters, died Monday
in California at the age of 38.
	   Coroner's tests were continuing in an effort to determine the
cause of death.
	   Media reports in Europe have focused on suspicions that Griffith
Joyner used performance-enhancing drugs and speculation that her
death was linked to the long-term effects of steroids.
	   De Merode said he assigned his top doping control expert to test
Griffith Joyner after she won the 100 and 200 in Seoul.
	   ``Since there were rumors at the time, we performed all possible
and imaginable analyses on her,'' de Merode told the Brussels daily
Le Soir. ``We never found anything.''
	   Germany's Manfred Donike, considered the world's foremost
anti-doping expert, failed to discover even minute traces of doping
products, well below the legal threshold, de Merode said.
	   ``So there should not be the slightest suspicion,'' he said.
``Let her rest in peace. The issue is closed.''
	   But speculation continued unabated across Europe.
	   Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, a French sports doctor and doping
expert, said Griffith Joyner's muscle development before the Seoul
Olympics was ``humanly impossible.''
	   ``In using a drug with a virilizing effect she lost some of her
cardio-vascular immunity,'' he told the French sports daily
L'Equipe. ``The procedure is known. One uses anabolic steroids,
then one stops three weeks before an important event, then one uses
growth hormones (undetectable by anti-doping controls) to not lose
anything.
	   ``Florence Griffith-Joyner was never tested positive, but the
controls don't constitute proof of not taking drugs. It is probable
that she used large doses but others, notably in Eastern Europe,
did the same. Other famous athletes are going to die and we will
know it.''
	   In Germany, Werner Franke, a professor at Heidelberg in
molecular biology and a specialist on doping, said he was convinced
Griffith-Joyner took illegal substances.
	   ``This death was foreseeable,'' he said.
	   But Helmut Digel, president of the German Sports Federation,
urged caution.
	   ``The death of Florence Griffith-Joyner should not be a cause of
speculation that brings on a war against drugs,'' he said. ``The
principle of fair-play forbids saying someone is guilty without
evidence.''
	   Britain's Sebastian Coe, two-time Olympic gold medalist in the
1,500 meters and former world record-holder in the 800, also said
it was unfair to conclude that Griffith Joyner used drugs.
	   ``I set a world record that lasted 18 years,'' Coe said.
``People do make progress at rates that raise eyebrows. It would be
wrong to suggest because an athlete makes a startling breakthrough
in a performance, they're cheating.''
	   ``It's always a balance of judgment and I'm wary of knee jerk
reactions,'' Coe said. ``The final arbiter has to be a positive
test.''

Norway's prime minister due back after depression sick-leave
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Three weeks after taking sick leave because
wrestling with Norway's problems depressed him, Prime Minister
Kjell Magne Bondevik on Thursday is to return to work _ and to the
problems.
	   A statement from the prime minister's office on Wednesday said
he has recovered and will resume his full duties.
	   ``He stopped by the office briefly today, without acting as
prime minister,'' said Oivind Oestang, the prime minister's
spokesman.
	   Norwegians, including politicians and the news media, have
generally reacted sympathetically to Bondevik's leave. Allowing the
Christian Democratic prime minister to recover in private was seen
as the natural, decent thing to do in this Nordic welfare state.
	   ``He can be happy that he was allowed to have his sickness in
peace,'' wrote the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet in a commentary on
Wednesday. ``Unlike his colleague Bill Clinton, his private life
has not been politicized.''
	   But the moment Bondevik steps back into the public spotlight,
mercy ends. The prime minister and his minority coalition are
expected to face a tough autumn session in Parliament, which opens
Oct. 2.
	   ``Being prime minister is a job that demands 100 percent.
Special arrangement or consideration from members of parliament is
not something Bondevik can count on,'' said Kirsti Kolle Groendahl,
president of the parliament.
	   Bondevik, a 51-year-old Lutheran minister, took office 11 months
ago as head of a three-party minority coalition. His popularity
soared early in the term, as he managed to defy predictions that
his colation would only last a few weeks.
	   His sick leave, originally one week from Aug. 31 and then
extended twice, was for ``a depressive reaction to overwork.'' It
came just as his government opened internal negotiations on
proposal for next year's national budget.
	   Bondevik's coalition of the Christian Democrats, the Center
Party and the Liberals has just 42 seats in the 165 seat
parliament, and is reported to have been bitterly split over key
issues in the draft 1998 budget it will present on Oct. 5.
	   Norway, the world's second-largest oil exporter, is expected to
face a tough round of budget cuts as lower oil prices and global
financial uncertainty contributed to chilling the Norwegian economy
after a five-year economic boom.
	   ``The prime minister and his crew are heading into a tough
period,'' said Oslo's Dagsavisen newspaper in its Wednesday
editorial. ``There is a good chance that the government will not
survive the budget session.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ African leaders defended their decisions
to intervene in the Congo conflict, telling heads of state that the
sprawling nation would collapse if rebels ousted President Laurent
Kabila.
	   The foreign ministers of Namibia and Zimbabwe, speaking Tuesday
at the U.N. General Assembly, urged a negotiated settlement to end
the fighting that began in August with a rebellion in the eastern
Congo and has since dragged in surrounding countries.
	   France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, urged regional
efforts continue to try to find a solution to the conflict and
repeated French calls for a conference on peace in the Great Lakes
part of Africa.
	   ``It is illusory to hope for a separate settlement in each of
these states,'' involved in Congo, he said, according to prepared
text of his speech. ``A regional crisis such as this calls for a
regional solution.''
	   Congolese Foreign Minister Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe was
scheduled to address the assembly on Wednesday, along with minsters
from Tanzania and Niger.
	   Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola have sent in forces to help Kabila
quell the insurgency that he and his supporters say is aided by
Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The two countries deny helping the rebels but Uganda admits it
has troops in northeastern Congo to defend its security interests,
and Rwanda has reserved the right to intervene to protect itself
from Rwandan Hutu rebel attacks.
	   ``Misguided men driven by blind ambition and appetite for
needless confrontation have plunged the Democratic Republic of the
Congo into a destructive war,'' Namibian foreign minister Theo-Ben
Gurirab told the assembly.
	   He justified Namibia's backing of Kabila, saying his country
sent in troops ``for the sole purpose of preventing the collapse of
the state machinery and the violation of the sovereignty and
territorial integrity'' of a fellow African country.
	   Zimbabwe's foreign minister, Stan Mudenge, also defended his
country's decision to intervene on Kabila's behalf, saying troops
were sent in to uphold the nation's territorial integrity.
	   The rebels are a coalition of Tutsi fighters, former Kabila
supporters and disaffected government soldiers who accuse Kabila of
corruption and ethnic favoritism.
	   Mozambique's foreign minister, Leonardo Santos Simao, urged a
settlement.
	   ``Africa and the international community cannot afford to add a
new chapter of conflicts of regional proportions, especially taking
into account that virtually all other long-lasting conflicts in
this continent continue to defy our collective imagination,'' he
said.
	   Similar sentiments were expressed by European leaders Tuesday
regarding the conflict in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian separatists
are fighting Serb forces for independence.
	   Austrian foreign minister, Wolfgang Schussel said the abuses
perpetrated on civilians exceeded ``any justifiable proportion.''
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel went a step further,
threatening military intervention if Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic doesn't rein in the Serb troops.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that the people of Kosovo are
facing a desperate winter without proper food or shelter, the U.N.
Security Council is demanding a cease-fire in the Yugoslav province
and threatening further action if the violence there continues.
	   A draft of a resolution expected to be adopted later Wednesday
doesn't specifically authorize NATO force to stop the Serb
offensive on ethnic Albanian separatists. But countries such as the
United States have said that such authorization is not necessary
for military intervention.
	   The United States has asked NATO to seek commitments from
countries to contribute to a possible multinational force, two
senior U.S. officials said Tuesday on condition of anonymity.
	   The U.N. resolution doesn't go that far, stating only that ``the
council would consider further action and additional measures to
maintain or restore peace and stability in the region,'' if a
political settlement isn't reached.
	   It gives no time frame.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Wednesday that the
resolution was ``sufficient'' for now, but that the council and
other concerned nations must wait and see what happens before
taking any further steps.
	   In comments to reporters at a breakfast meeting, he stressed
that the council alone determines whether force is necessary.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and a quarter-million
uprooted since February, when Serb forces began a crackdown in the
province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for the independence of
Kosovo; Western nations have called on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to return the autonomy he stripped from the province in
1989.
	   In addition to demanding a cease-fire, the draft resolution
urges the Serbs and ethnic Albanian leadership to start
negotiating. It demands that Milosevic allow international
monitoring in Kosovo and insists on the return of refugees.
	   Russia, which has opposed force in the past, said it would go
along with the resolution because it didn't specifically authorize
military intervention. Another resolution would be necessary to do
that, Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov said.
	   China, however, still had problems with the threat of further
measures, council diplomats said. China is free to abstain from the
vote.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said immediate military
action was not the goal.
	   ``The objective was to recognize the seriousness of the
humanitarian situation, as a consequence of a very bad political
situation, and to pass a ... resolution which made Belgrade realize
that the international community was losing its patience,''
Greenstock said.
	   The next step _ presumably authorizing military intervention _
would have to wait until Milosevic reacts, he said.
	   ``There is no agreement among anybody about next steps,'' he
said. ``We're just concentrating on now.''
	   Lavrov said Russia _ which has cultural and religious ties to
the Serbs _ opposed military intervention.
	   ``The use of force is the last resort, and it could only be done
on the decision of the Security Council,'' he said.

Russian middle class on the hunt for jobs, with little success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The primly dressed Russians waited in a line
hundreds of people long, slowly shuffling forward, somber and
unsure of what they would find at the end.
	   They found frustrated job seekers like themselves, shoving and
elbowing each other toward small booths, hearing painful answers to
desperate questions.
	   ``How much are you paying accountants?'' ...
	   ``Well, how much experience have you got? None?'' There is an
alternative: ``We pay truck drivers 300 rubles (dlrs 19) a month.''
	   As Russia endures its latest financial crisis and companies fire
thousands of employees, the country's fledgling middle class is
joining the lines at job fairs in a desperate hunt for work _ and
finding that the middle class may no longer exist.
	   When Communism fell, many Russians found work with private firms
that paid them enough to live comfortably, travel, and buy more
luxury goods.
	   That created a middle class that could never have existed during
the Soviet Union _ when private companies were banned and western
amenities were too expensive for all but the elite.
	   But the latest economic crunch _ and Wednesday's job fair in
southern Moscow _ showed how fragile the middle class was, and how
desperate those who belonged to it are to sustain their new
lifestyles.
	   ``People are first looking at how much the job pays, and then
whether it falls within their specialty,'' said Alexander Lugovoi,
a manager with a company that reworks hard metals. ``Really,
they're looking for anything available.''
	   Most of the job offers were for work in factories, the city bus
system, or other state-owned entities that offered wages of about
1,500 rubles (dlrs 100) a month. The jobs most sought, with
companies that pay wages on time and offer chances for advancement,
are nearly nonexistent.
	   ``There's nothing for me here,'' said 40-year-old Margarita
Kolosova, an accountant who was fired earlier this summer.
``There's no demand for people of my age or specialty. If I'd known
it would be like this, I wouldn't have come.''
	   Some lined up to talk with lawyers, job counselors, and even
psychologists for advice about their mostly fruitless efforts.
	   ``You've got to have a strategy, some goal you're shooting
for,'' said one job counselor, who refused to give his name, to a
pair of job seekers having little success.
	   Others had already found a strategy for finding work: Settle for
less.
	   ``I came looking for something that would pay dlrs 500 to dlrs
1000 a month,'' said 30-year-old Artur Girsh, who lost his job when
his food import company went bankrupt at the start of the crisis.
``But if I got even half that, it would be acceptable.''
	   Still, even those willing to take lower wages said it wasn't
easy to find work that suited their experience, or their minimal
expectations.
	   ``I'm looking for construction work, something that pays around
2000 rubles (dlrs 125) a month,'' said 30-year-old Andrei Tsaryov,
who came in from the Saratov region to test his luck in Moscow's
job market. ``Back home they've been withholding my salary for half
a year. Even though I'm not having much luck, I've got to keep
looking.''

Massacre survivor awakes from coma, report says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An alleged drug-trafficker who survived the
massacre of his extended family last week has emerged from a coma
and spoken to investigators, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Police believe Fermin Castro was the target of the Sept. 17
slayings, in which 18 children, women and men died at a ranch near
Ensenada, a popular resort city 50 miles south of the U.S. border.
	   Castro suffered a bullet wound to the head. The daily Reforma
said he had regained consciousness and mentioned the name of one
person who may have been responsible for the massacre in El Sauzal.
	   Castro remained under heavy military guard at an Ensenada
hospital, the report said.
	   Federal police have detained 10 people in connection with the
killings.
	   Investigators say the massacre may have been related to Castro's
alleged drug-trafficking activities. Relatives, however, say Castro
is a rancher with no involvement in drugs.

German wants Starr prosecuted for spreading pornography, slandering
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Many have expressed disgust with the
highly explicit coverage of U.S. President Clinton's affair with a
White House intern. Now a German journalist wants to do something
about it.
	   Wenzel Pleil, a reporter for the Flensburger Tageblatt newspaper
in northern Germany, said Wednesday he had hired a lawyer to push
for criminal charges against special prosecutor Kenneth Starr _
distributing pornographic material and slandering Clinton.
	   ``Pornographic material'' on the Clinton-Lewinsky case in the
Internet ``was available in every nursery,'' in Germany, Pleil, the
44-year-old father of a 4-year-old girl, said in a telephone
interview.
	   In addition, he said he felt it was ethically and morally
``unacceptable to watch a person dragged through the dirt with the
blessings of the state.''
	   Pleil's reaction reflected that of most Germans, who have shown
sympathy for the president and shock at the level of details being
reported.
	   Some politicians have compared Starr's investigation to the
Inquisition, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl weighed in this week with
his disgust, saying the ``catastrophic'' coverage made him ``throw
up.''
	   Pleil's attorney, Max Mulert, said he had sent a letter to
federal prosecutors in Washington asking them to consider bringing
charges against Starr ``and other unknown people, who are
responsible for the affair.''
	   ``The accused is suspected of malicious gossip against a
political person and of circulating and publishing pornographic
scriptures (writing) in the worldwide web and TV,'' he said.
	   The two were also considering bringing charges in Germany as
well.
	   Mulert said he was shocked to hear teen-agers making schoolyard
jokes about ``the intimate details'' of the Clinton sex scandal.
	   ``We have laws to protect minors from pornography,'' he said.
``This was published worldwide.''
	   According to Mulert, Starr would face up to five years in prison
under the German penal code if convicted of degrading Clinton and
``obstructing his public and political work.''
	   In addition, publishing pornographic writings and making them
available to those under age 18 is punishable by a sentence of one
year.

Olympic airways flights to take place on schedule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ All Olympic Airways flights will take
place as scheduled despite a planned four-day strike by civil
aviation employees, the Greek national carrier announced Wednesday.
	   Olympic said its own employees and ground crews will replace
strikers during the labor action set to start Thursday. The
state-run company added that all its flights, both international
and domestic, will take place as scheduled. Olympic has its own
terminal and facilities at Athens airport, the country's largest.
	   But hundreds of regularly scheduled flights to and from Greece
by foreign carriers and charter companies will still be affected by
the strike, being staged by the 2,700-strong civil aviation union.
	   The union is demanding more money and protesting government
plans to revamp the civil aviation service by splitting it up
according to specialization.
	   In an effort to stop the action, the civil aviation authority
has asked the courts to rule it illegal.

Nicole Kidman glistens in new role as a London theater star
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Recasts &QL; 
 &UR; With AP photo
 &UR; By MATT WOLF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Critics drooled over Nicole Kidman's long legs --
as well as her talent -- Wednesday following the London stage debut
of the Hollywood star.
	   So while Britons may think of Kidman first as Mrs. Tom Cruise,
the theater world was welcoming her as a skilled newcomer making
just dlrs 400 a week.
	   ``The night is above all a personal triumph for Miss Kidman, an
actress who, if you ask me, is totally wasted in movies,''
Christopher Tookey wrote in The Daily Mail.
	   Kidman takes on five roles in ``The Blue Room,'' playwright
David Hare's free adaptation of the Austrian play ``Reigen''
(better known as ``La Ronde'') at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent
Garden.
	   One minute, she's appearing opposite co-star Iain Glen as a
politician's wife trapped in a loveless marriage, the next she's a
scantily clad prostitute _ not yet 20 _ whose clients include a
taxi driver and an aristocrat (both played by Glen).
	   The two-character play is directed by Sam Mendes, whose current
Broadway production of ``Cabaret'' won four Tony Awards in June.
``The Blue Room'' is expected to follow ``Cabaret'' to New York
later this season, especially now that Kidman has received mostly
rave reviews.
	   In other hands, Kidman's line-up of roles could seem
self-conscious and a shade coy, and it was lost on no one that she
bares considerably less of her body during the 100-minute play than
her lesser-known Scottish colleague, Glen. (That didn't stop
theater staff from confiscating 30 cameras from audience members at
an early performance.)
	   But the star of ``To Die For'' and ``Batman Forever'' won over
the opening night crowd with an unforced display of versatility
that led at least one critic to wonder whether her true abilities
had been fully tapped on screen.
	   Robert Gore-Langton in The Daily Express called Kidman ``not
only lovely to look at but a talent to watch.''
	   The Evening Standard reviewed her on both counts. While theater
writer Nicholas de Jongh was admiring her ``neatly provocative
performances,'' colleague Shane Watson fixated on her body.
	   ``We knew she wasn't fat, we knew she'd look pretty good, but
this! A figure (narrow hips, bosoms at armpit level, long rangy
legs, no _ repeat no _ cellulite or any interruptions to the
all-over moonstone skin) that not only matches up to the best but
would be exceptional on a 20-year-old. Whereas Nicole is 31,''
Watson raved.
	   Most rapturous was The Daily Telegraph's Charles Spencer, who
called the evening ``pure theatrical Viagra.'' That description may
well surprise those who think the play is in fact intended to be a
rather cool, clinical examination of our Eros-obsessed age.
	   Kidman may appear at various times wearing a mini-skirt or
wrapped in a sheet or even _ briefly _ naked. But Hare's play is
about unfulfilled love and lust, a dispassionate, sometimes
despairing look at contemporary sexual mores rather than a steamy
peep show for theatrical voyeurs.
	   Cruise kept a low profile on opening night, watching from back
stage.
	   The limited run through Oct. 31 was sold out well before the
play began previews at the 250-seat theater on Sept. 10.

Police claim to have suspects in slaying of prominent financier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Investigators in the slaying of a prominent
Ukrainian financier and politician have identified the perpetrators
of one of the most notorious contract killings in the country,
Ukraine's interior minister said Wednesday.
	   The slaying of Vadym Hetman, former lawmaker and chairman of the
Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange, might have been prompted by
large-scale financial operations involving Ukraine's central bank
and a number of Ukrainian and Russian commercial banks, Yuriy
Kravchenko said.
	   ``We are talking about operations conducted by the National Bank
of Ukraine and involving a large volume of money, the movement of
which we are currently tracking,'' Kravchenko said in comments
cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   He said a group of Ukrainian and Russian investigators looking
into the case have found that some of those believed responsible
for the killing are no longer alive. Kravchenko did not provide
further details.
	   Hetman, who headed the Ukrainian National Bank in 1992, was
killed by four shots in the elevator of his Kiev apartment building
on April 22.
	   Ukrainian media have called his slaying the most significant
contract killing in Ukraine since the country gained independence
in 1991.

Rees-Jones files suit against Ritz hotel and car service
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with statement from Rees-Jones' London lawyer saying
French court would have to decide who responsible and guilty
verdict could lead to damages for ex-bodyguard.
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole
survivor of the car crash that killed Princess Diana, filed suit
Wednesday against the Ritz Hotel and the Etoile-Limousine car
service for ``endangering the lives of others.''
	   At the time of the Aug. 31, 1997 crash, Rees-Jones was an
employee of Ritz owner Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of Dodi Fayed,
Diana's companion, who also died in the crash.
	   The driver of the car, Henri Paul, chief of security at the Ritz
Hotel, who also was killed in the crash, was legally drunk and
taking prescription drugs for depression at the time.
	   The legal action marked the first time that the Ritz management
and the car company have been legally targeted for responsibility
in the crash in a traffic tunnel under the Place de l'Alma.
	   The Ritz maintains photographers chasing the couple precipitated
the accident.
	   The legal action cites both the Ritz and Etoile-Limousine for
``failing to provide a licensed driver'' for the Mercedes in which
the princess was riding.
	   Paul did not have the type of license required by law to drive
the Mercedes 280S sedan, provided to the Ritz by Etoile-Limousine.
	   Rees-Jones' lawyer, Christian Curtil, also specifically
requested the complaint be added to the investigation into the
accident, currently being led by Judge Herve Stephan.
	   In his complaint, Curtil criticized the management of
Etoile-Limousine for having agreed to rent a vehicle of that
category without a driver licensed to operate it.
	   The suit also targets the Ritz for having chosen
Etoile-Limousine when other companies which would have provided a
licensed driver were available.
	   The offense of endangering the lives of others is punishable by
a maximum one year in jail and a fine of 100,000 francs (dlrs
17,500).
	   Rees-Jones' London lawyer, David Crawford, later issued a
statement saying it would be up to the French court ``to decide who
is responsible and for which offenses.''
	   If those parties were found guilty, Crawford's statement
continued that ``those responsible may also be liable to pay
damages to Trevor Rees-Jones.''
	   Rees-Jones fell into a coma after the crash and his face had to
be surgically reconstructed. He was questioned several times by
French judicial officials but remembered very little of the fatal
evening.
	   He remained for a time on Al Fayed's payroll but later quit and
went to work part-time for a sports shop in central England.
	   Al Fayed is refusing to pay Rees Jones' legal costs incurred
early on in the investigation, and the suit appears to reflect a
further deterioration in their relationship.
	   Rees-Jones' complaint could lead to new parties, including the
Ritz and the limousine service, being placed under formal
investigation.
	   Until now, nine photographers and one motorcycle courrier have
been placed under formal investigation on charges of manslaughter
and failure to assist persons in danger.
	   It remains unclear whether Ritz management, including Al Fayed,
was aware that Paul had been drinking and taking medication before
taking the wheel. Questions recently have been raised as to whether
the car had faulty brakes and whether the Ritz was warned.

Georges swipes through Virgin Islands; two reported missing

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Forcibly accustomed to
the ravages hurricanes bring, Virgin Islanders this week found
themselves coping yet again _ without water, power, telephones and
even roofs over their heads.
	   Hurricane Georges slammed into St. Thomas, St. John and St.
Croix Monday. It took until Wednesday for some residents to pick up
the phone and hear a familiar sound: a dial tone, connecting them
to the outside world.
	   The storm's 110-mph (180 kph) fury sank dozens of boats and
drove others onto streets, smashed wooden piers and boardwalks, and
stripped the pristine islands of much of their lush green foliage.
It blew away many of the familiar blue tarpaulins that had served
as roofs for dozens of families since disastrous Hurricane Marilyn
hit in 1995.
	   ``I cry all the time when I see my home,'' said Milda Luz
Mendez, 49, whose roof was sucked into the sky at the height of the
storm. ``This is the fourth time I'm losing my roof in 10 years,
beginning with Hurricane Hugo. I don't know if I can take this any
longer.''
	   By initial accounts, this week's damage wasn't nearly as
catastrophic as that caused by Marilyn, or Hurricane Hugo a decade
ago. Several people were injured by flying debris, one man was
hospitalized in a coma after a roof collapse and two people, both
houseboat dwellers, were reported missing.
	   In St. Croix, Frederiksted's Ann E. Abrahamson pier, a familiar
sight to cruise ship visitors, was extensively damaged by a 20-foot
(6-meter) storm surge that swept into jewelry stores on the
streets.
	   A 15-foot (4.5-meter) boat sat squarely on King Street. Some
boats sank at marinas. The lawn of a new park, freshly laid down,
was destroyed in Christiansted.
	   Power in Fredericksted was lost, and crews removed snapped
coconut palms and other debris from streets.
	   In Christiansted, the storm severely eroded the beachfront
surrounding Hotel on the Key. Wooden staircases and windows at the
pink, Danish-style Christian Hotel were broken.
	   Some 2,400 tourists weathered out the storm in hotels, most of
them in St. Thomas, according to the Virgin Islands Tourism
Association. More than 900 residents were sheltered during the
storm, the Red Cross said.
	   National Guard troops, U.S. marshals and police manned
roadblocks to enforce an 8 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew ``to prevent further
injuries through accidental electrocutions,'' said Gov. Roy E.
Schneider.
	   Many St. Croix residents remember the destruction caused by
Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and the rampant looting by hundreds that
came after. Thirteen people were arrested this week on looting,
curfew violations and burglary charges.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The government's asylum policy came
under severe criticism Wednesday after a Nigerian woman died
following a struggle with police trying to deport her. Two
policemen charged with assault.
	   The government and judicial authorities are investigating
Tuesday's incident at Brussels international airport. Police tried
to subdue Semira Adamu by putting a pillow on her face as she
resisted efforts to strap her into a seat on a Togo-bound plane.
	   As passengers looked on, Ms. Adamu, 20, struggled, then fell
into a coma. She was taken to hospital where she died hours later
of a brain hemorrhage.
	   Ms. Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed that
her family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already
has three wives. Belgium argued that was no ground for refugee
status.
	   Police had previously tried to deport Ms. Adamu six times, but
her resistance forced them to abandon previous attempts to put her
on a plane.
	   Politicians from the ruling center-left coalition and the
opposition called for reform of asylum procedures and many
expressed outrage that the use of a pillow to subdue recalcitrant
asylum seekers was standard practice.
	   ``The asylum policy has to be humane,'' said Senator Bert
Anciaux, chairman of the opposition ID21 party.
	   Judicial authorities interrogated three policemen who were
involved in the deportation attempt and charged two with assault
and battery without the intent to kill. They were detained for
several hours and then released.
	   Adamu's death led to angry protests by sympathizers outside the
home of Interior Minister Louis Tobback in Leuven, 16 kilometers
(10 miles) east of Brussels. In front of the national parliament,
some 150 demonstrators shouted ``Tobback murderer.''
	   Tobback said he regretted the incident but added first reports
indicated that police were not acting illegally as Ms. Adamu had
exhausted her appeals against an expulsion order.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International condemned the
asylum laws.
	   ``The death of Semira is part of a series of complaints and is
the results of several new laws to get asylum in Belgium,'' said AI
spokeswoman Joelle Noel.
	   Some 4,000 people whose asylum requests were turned down by the
Belgian authorities were repatriated last year. Some 300 needed
police escorts.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Enjoying increasing mobile phone sales,
Finnish telecommunications group Nokia said Wednesday its third
quarter performance would remain strong and predicted 1 billion
cellular phone subscribers worldwide by 2005.
	   ``Strong market development in 1998 has reinforced our
confidence in the outlook for the third quarter and has, again,
resulted in an upward revision of our long term subscriber
estimates,'' said Jorma Ollila, Nokia's president.
	   ``We now estimate that there will be about 1 billion subscribers
in the year 2005 and that a substantial portion of the phones sold
that year will have multimedia capabilities,'' Ollila said.
	   The company estimates the number of global mobile phone
subscribers at 250 million at mid-year 1998.
	   Last year, Nokia sold 21 million cellular hand sets, making it
the world's second largest mobile phone maker after Motorola Inc.,
based in Schaumburg, Illinois.
	   During January to June, Nokia increased net sales of mobile
phones by 41 percent over the same period 1997, to 18.95 billion
markkaa (dlrs 3.7 billion).
	   Nokia is a world leader in digital mobile phone technology, and
has supplied GSM equipment to 67 operators in 35 countries. Its
total sales encompass 130 countries, with main markets in the
United States, Britain, Germany and China. It employs 41,000 people
worldwide.
	   Nokia's total pretax profit last year more than doubled to a
record 8.37 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.64 billion).

War-Crimes investigators search several Bosnian Croat premises for
</HEADLINE>
evidence

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International war crimes
investigators backed by about 30 armored vehicles and hundreds of
NATO-led peacekeepers searched former Bosnian wartime offices
Wednesday for evidence in ongoing trials at The Hague.
	   Last Friday, the U.N. Tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands issued
a search warrant allowing investigators to enter ``various
premises'' in the central Bosnian city of Vitez and in Mostar and
Siroki Brijeg in the south of the country, said Kelly Moore,
spokeswoman for the Tribunal in Sarajevo.
	   No further details on the action were available.
	   The Vitez area was the scene of blatant atrocities during the
1992-95 war. Several Bosnian Croat military and civilian officials,
including Dario Kordic and Tihomir Blaskic, are currently jailed in
The Hague for masterminding war crimes in around Vitez.
	   According to eyewitnesses, armed NATO troops searched the
wartime Croat defense ministry in Mostar for several hours.
Investigators carried out several boxes, files, books, a computer
and a map.

Romanian finance minister dismissed

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Finance Minister Daniel Daianu was
dismissed Wednesday, after criticism he was doing too little to
reform Romania's ailing economy.
	   Daianu was also at odds with the government over a costly deal
to purchase U.S.-made military helicopters.
	   In a letter to Prime Minister Radu Vasile, the Liberal Party,
one of four parties in the governing coalition, had accused Daianu
of failing to promote economic reforms and lower taxes.
	   Decebal Traian Remes, a Liberal Party member, was sworn in
Wednesday as the new finance minister by President Emil
Constantinescu. Remes, 49, heads a parliamentary committee for
budget and finance and is the author of his party's economic
program, which seeks more incentives for foreign investors.
	   He is also known to support the dlrs 1.45 billion deal to buy 96
attack helicopters from U.S. manufacturer Bell Helicopter Textron.
Daianu had said he would resign if the deal was signed, claiming it
would cripple Romania's weak economy.
	   ``This reshuffle of the government ... is aimed at strengthening
the ministry'' at a moment of internal difficulties and instability
on the international market,'' Constantinesu said.
	   Although reformists won elections almost two years ago, vowing
to reform the economy along Western lines, purchasing power has
slumped and the national currency is overvalued, discouraging
exports, manufacturing and foreign investment.
	   Foreign and domestic investors have also been frustrated by
political bickering and bureaucracy. Romania has a fraction of the
investment of neighboring Hungary, which has less than half the
population.

Police arrest 10 accused of insurrection plot in Cameroon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ Police in northwestern Cameroon
arrested 10 people on charges of plotting to stage a violent
insurrection against the central government, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The 10 suspects were arrested in the northwestern city of
Bamenda, the independent Herald newspaper reported. Bamenda was the
scene last year of anti-government rioting that left more than a
dozen people dead.
	   Police this week seized several automatic rifles and other
weapons after searching the homes of the suspects.
	   Bamenda, the seat of Cameroon's primary opposition movement, is
home to a simmering independence movement that wants to establish
an independent English-speaking state.
	   Anglophones make up 20 percent of Cameroon's 13 million people,
but say they are treated as second-class citizens by Francophone
rulers.
	   One of the suspects arrested this week was also accused of
manufacturing rudimentary guns, the newspaper reported.

Kosovo Albanians caught between hope, bitterness over NATO
</HEADLINE>
inaction &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KICIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ At the mention of NATO, the
weatherbeaten Kosovo farmer looking at his dead brother bites back
tears and sees a glint of hope.
	   ``I know they want to help,'' says Rexhep Mustafa, 54, hours
after losing his older brother to the bullets of a Serb sniper.
``When will they come?''
	   Like thousands of ethnic Albanians throughout Kosovo, Mustafa
and his neighbors huddle around foreign news broadcasts daily,
believing they will one day hear that NATO fighter jets are taking
off to halt seven months of fighting that has killed more than 600
people and forced nearly 300,000 from their homes.
	   But many others are disenchanted with months of political
wrangling in distant meeting rooms that has stymied international
action. Meanwhile, friends or relatives die. Villages are razed.
Fear of a harsh winter sets in.
	   ``Does NATO know what's happening?'' said Mustafa, who tends
cows and chickens in northern Kosovo after working most of his life
for the Serbs in nearby gold mines. ``Show them.''
	   The West appears to be inching closer to military intervention.
	   On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council was expected to pass a
resolution demanding an end to the violence in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo and hinting at force if the Serbs continued
their crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   But the ethnic Albanians have heard such talk for months.
	   Despite renewed Western discussion as the nearing winter
threatens homeless refugees, this week Serb forces launched a
blistering artillery bombardment and armored attack on the Drenica
region of central Kosovo, the last of the province's ethnic
Albanian rebel strongholds.
	   A humanitarian aid worker predicted that the Serb offensive will
create more suffering for the thousands of civilians trapped in
Drenica long before the international community hammers out a
course of action.
	   And the most urgent problem now _ the refugees _ can't be solved
with fighter jets, she said.
	   ``What can NATO do if they intervene now?'' asked the worker,
who declined to be named. ``Drop crates of food on the refugees?''
	   Unconvinced, Mustafa and his neighbors tell visiting Westerners
that only NATO can stop more bloodshed.
	   Mustafa, baring his blackened teeth in a grimace, motions toward
the body of his 58-year-old brother Halil, who was tending his cows
when snipers cut him down in his grassy pasture.
	   But refugees scattered throughout western Kosovo increasingly
agree with the aid worker that Western actions should focus on
helping feed them or keeping them safe from police.
	   ``I love NATO,'' says Xhavit Rudi, 30, a farmer who lost his
house, cows and tractor to the scorched-earth campaign of Serb
security forces. ``But make them know that people are dying. It's
very late.''
	   He said his biggest fears now are lack of food and intimidation
by police trying to root out rebel sympathizers from among the
civilian population.
	   Western leaders first threatened NATO airstrikes on Serb
security forces in Kosovo last spring. Tough Western talk resulted
in a June flyby of 68 NATO fighter jets and 17 support aircraft
along Serbia's borders in Albania and Macedonia.
	   Amid U.S.-propelled shuttle diplomacy and the threats, Serbian
officials held back their full firepower, enabling the KLA to
capture as much as 40 percent of the mountainous province by
mid-July.
	   Western diplomats then worried that any NATO intervention could
bolster the Kosovo Liberation Army's war for independence. The West
does not favor independence for Kosovo, since border changes in the
Balkans often spawn further bloodshed.
	   In late July, Serb forces started using heavy artillery,
Katyusha rockets and Russian-made tanks in an offensive that
devastated western Kosovo.
	   Now Serb police fighting in Kosovo shrug off the possibility of
NATO intervention.
	   ``You're going to bomb us?'' taunts a wiry Serb police officer
guarding a main highway. His colleagues, wielding Kalashnikov
assault rifles, group around and laugh as he moves his left hand to
represent a NATO fighter jet.
	   His right hand, an anti-aircraft missile, hits the target and
elicits a chuckle.
	   ``What do you think?'' the policeman says. ``Will NATO come?''

Turkish police capture over 750 kilos of cocaine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MERSIN, Turkey (AP) _ Police on Wednesday seized 752 kilograms
(1,654 pounds) of cocaine on a Bahamas-flagged ship from Chile with
the help of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, which had been
tracking the vessel.
	   ``It is the largest single seizure of cocaine in Turkey,'' said
Hakuk Bahcekapili, chief of police in this Mediterranean port city.
He estimated the street value in Turkey at about dlrs 3.6 million.
	   Bahcekapili said the Turkish coast guard seized the Silkeborg
late Tuesday as it headed for Mersin, 550 kilometers (458 miles)
south of Ankara, the capital.
	   ``The DEA was constantly channeling information to us,'' he
said. ``The DEA has been tracking it with electronic
surveillance.''
	   Bahcekapili said 14 people were arrested but did not identify
them. The Anatolia news agency said two foreigners were among them,
including an Italian.
	   According to Anatolia, the ship's cargo was fruit juice bound
for Mersin, . The agency said the cocaine was to be trucked to
western Europe and Russia. Turkey is a transit point for drugs
moving from Asia to Europe and North America.
	   On Saturday, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said over 13.6 tons
(14.9 short tons) of drugs had been seized in Turkey over the past
year.

Cuba braces for Hurricane Georges' march across the Caribbean
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Caribbean-Hurricane &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro put his
ministers on alert Wednesday as Hurricane Georges began bearing
down on the island after lashing Puerto Rico and the neighboring
island of Hispaniola.
	   During a surprise visit to the National Institute of
Meteorology, Castro said his government was ready for any
emergency, according to news reports from Havana monitored in
Mexico City.
	   ``We know what to do in any of the cases or variants of the
trajectory that Georges is following,'' Mexico's official Notimex
news agency quoted Castro as saying. ``I also gave instructions not
to do anything hasty, because there is time and we have planned
everything in case the hurricane makes landfall in Cuba.''
	   Added Castro, ``no one will be forgotten in this new battle by
the Cuban people. We are a nation that has overcome adversity with
unity.''
	   A hurricane warning was in effect in Cuba today from Sancti
Spiritus province eastward _ essentially the eastern half of the
island.
	   In the easternmost Cuban provinces of Guantanamo, Santiago,
Holguin and Las Tunas, volunteer work teams were helping farmers
harvest any remaining crops and evacuate their livestock from areas
vulnerable to flooding, the news reports said.
	   Concerns about hurricane damage were especially high in the
east, which has suffered in recent months from a severe drought and
lies directly in Georges' path.
	   As the storm nears, people will be evacuated with the help of
the military as necessary. Castro said the armed forces would help
in getting medicine, food and any other help to hurricane victims
after Georges passes.
	   Castro said his country would offer the services of its doctors
to neighboring nations hit hard by Hurricane George.

Dutch mothers' union demands a salary for raising children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A small group of Dutch mothers has
launched a protest campaign urging the government to start paying
them for raising children.
	   The Dutch Union of Mothers for a Collective Labor Agreement is
demanding the Dutch government pay 2,500 guilders (dlrs 1,300) a
month to all mothers at least 21 years old until their children
reach age of 18.
	   ``Mothers deserve the same rights as other workers,'' union
chairwoman Mariete Hauwert said Wednesday.
	   The plan would let mothers stay at home to raise children
instead of working and leaving the children to others' care, she
added.
	   A series of weekly demonstrations outside parliament began
Tuesday with just eight of the union's 85 members taking part.
Hauwert explained the small turnout by saying she is fighting for
women too pressed for time and money to travel to the seat of
government for a protest.
	   Social Services and Employment Ministry spokesman Toine
Asselbergs said the government was not considering paying mothers.
	   ``There is no discussion about it in the ministry,'' Asselbergs
said.

India's space program receives boost with Russian cryogenic
</HEADLINE>
engines &QL; 
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An ambitious Indian space project held
up in 1992 after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's refusal to
supply technology was on track again Wednesday as the first of
seven cryogenic engines from Moscow was flown in, officials said.
	   The engines are crucial to the development of the
geo-synchronous satellite launch vehicle that would carry a 2,500
kilogram communication satellite.
	   Using liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, cryogenic engines work
at extremely low temperatures. ``Geo-synchronous'' describes
satellites that orbit the earth in exactly 24 hours.
	   The satellite is expected to be launched from a southern Indian
launching station in 1999 to a stationary point in an orbit high
above the earth's surface.
	   One engine arrived in India Wednesday, and one each would be
sent from Russia every month for the next six months, officials of
the Indian Space Research Organization were quoted as saying by
United News of India news agency.
	   India's ISRO had reached an agreement with Russia's Glavkosmos
organization in 1990 for transfer of know-how related to the
cryogenic engines, but the transfer of technology was stalled by
Yeltsin in 1992.
	   India had then accused Moscow of acting under pressure from the
United States, which suspected New Delhi could use the engines in
its nuclear program.
	   The agreement was later reworked, but the delay pushed back the
GSLV launch by four years. Meanwhile, Indian scientists tried to
indigenously develop a scaled-down version of the engines and
carried out preliminary tests.
	   The Russian cryogenic engines will be used in the crucial third
part of the project. The communication satellite will be capable of
carrying digital audio, video and other data, ISRO officials said.
	   Also Wednesday, Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes said
New Delhi had sought modifications in the Sukhoi Su-30 jets it is
buying from Russia, but assured Moscow the dlrs 1.8 billion deal
would remain unaffected.
	   ``There is now a revised schedule for the delivery of the
aircraft, there might be some slight delay but the entire deal is
on course,'' Fernandes was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of
India news agency.
	   India already has received eight Su-30 fighters of the
contracted 40 advanced it ordered from Russia in a deal concluded
in 1996. The rest are expected to be delivered by 2000.
	   India is among the most lucrative customers for Russia's weapons
industry.

Congolese rebels say they killed 50 attackers in eastern town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels said Wednesday they had
repelled a dawn attack by Rwandan Hutu militia and local warriors
fighting against what they see as Rwandan involvement in seven-week
rebellion.
	   Lunda Bululu, one of rebel leaders, said rebel forces had killed
at least 50 Rwandan Hutu and Mai-Mai fighters when they attempted
to cut the road outside rebel headquarters in Goma at 5.30 a.m.
local time (0330 GMT).
	   Bululu said five women and one child at Ndosha orphanage, 4
kilometers (2 miles) west of Goma, were killed when the attackers
opened fire from banana plantations.
	   He said five rebels were wounded, but residents put the number
of rebels killed to 24.
	   The road was opened after a two-hour gunbattle, and soldiers on
foot patrolled the area and searched houses for the attackers
believed to hiding in and around the rebel stronghold at the
northern end of Lake Kivu.
	   The attack was the most serious since Sept. 14 when Hutu rebels,
who fled Rwanda in fear of reprisals for the 1994 genocide, teamed
up with other tribes in the region and attacked Goma and Gisenyi
across the border in Rwanda. At least 300 people were killed.
	   President Laurent Kabila has accused neighboring Rwanda and
Uganda of sponsoring the rebellion that broke out Aug. 2 and swept
through eastern Congo and threatened the capital, Kinshasa, until
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia sent troops to prop up Kabila.
	   The rebels claim to hold much of eastern Congo, including
Kisangani, the country's third-largest city. The government claims
it is retaking the region, but the rebels dispute the claims, and
have taken journalists to several places to demonstrate they are
still in control.
	   Uganda and Rwanda both deny aiding the rebel movement. Uganda
admits to having troops inside Congo to protect its western borders
from attacks by Ugandan rebels based in eastern Congo.
	   Rwanda has threatened to intervene openly to prevent Hutu rebels
from using Congo as a rear base for attacks inside the country and
to stop what it says is government-orchestrated persecution of
ethnic Tutsis in Congo.
	   Anti-Tutsi sentiments have been running high in eastern Congo,
where non-Tutsi tribes have often resorted to force to protest what
they say is unjust land distribution and grip of local Tutsis on
the economy and politics.
	   The traditional fighters, known as Mai-Mai, recently joined
forces with the Rwandan Hutu rebels who were apparently armed and
trained by the government to fight the anti-Kabila movement.
	   The Hutu rebels are remnants of the former Rwandan Hutu army and
Interahamwe militia that were were defeated in July 1994 when
Tutsi-led rebels seized power in Rwanda and stopped the 90-day
slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus.
	   The conflict in Central Africa has drawn in most of Congo's nine
neighbors, each of whom is concerned that the instability in Congo
may undermine its own security.
	   On Wednesday, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba flew to the
Rwandan capital, Kigali, for consultations with the Rwandan
authorities, his spokesman, Etienne Ngangura, said. He offered no
details and no comment was available from Rwandan government.

Legislator proposes freezing assets of Italian insurer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Netanyahu adviser &QL; 
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli legislator demanded Wednesday that
the government freeze the Israeli assets of an Italian insurance
companies that reneged on an agreement to pay dlrs 100 million to
families of Holocaust victims who were policyholders.
	   Assicurazioni Generali, Italy's largest insurer, announced
Tuesday that it would not honor the settlement it negotiated with
families of Holocaust victims and U.S. insurance commissioners.
	   The company blamed the other parties, saying they had not lived
up to the agreement.
	   In response, Israeli legislator Michael Kleiner demanded that
the Israeli government freeze the assets of Migdal, an Israeli
insurance company bought by Generali recently for dlrs 200 million.
	   ``It is clear that these assets need to be frozen and maybe, at
a later stage, if an agreement is not worked out with Generali,
sold as part of the money given to the families of victims,''
Kleiner told Israel radio.
	   The legislator also reiterated a demand that Generali post the
names of policy holders on the Internet so heirs and Holocaust
survivors can check whether they are entitled to money.
	   Motti Sherf, a spokesman for the Israeli insurance commissioner
said freezing Migdal's assets would fall outside the commissioner's
jurisdiction and should be handled by elected lawmakers.
	   Kleiner, meanwhile, criticized an earlier Israeli government
decision to present Generali's president, Antoine Bernheim with an
award for having contributed to the Israeli economy. Dozens of
international business leaders are to receive the ``Jubilee
Award,'' along with Bernheim at a summit sponsored by the prime
minister's office.
	   According to organizers, Bernheim is still among the recipients.
	   Bobby Brown, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said that if Generali adheres to one provision of the
agreement which, in his interpretation, requires the publication of
policy information, it should still receive the prize.
	   ``If they do that ... they are moving ahead trying to find
justice, at least partial justice,'' Brown said. ``If they refuse,
we will have to reconsider the whole situation.''
	   Kleiner said it was ``shocking to think that Generali's
president will receive an award from the prime minister for buying
an Israeli company with funds stolen from Jews.''
	   Generali is one of 16 European insurance companies named in a
federal class-action suit filed last year in New York. Another suit
was filed in February in a Los Angeles Superior Court by family
members of five Holocaust victims.
	   Some Jewish leaders have praised Generali for actions such as
assisting Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, in
gathering lists of Holocaust victims.
	   Last year, Generali established a dlrs 12 million fund for
Holocaust survivors. The company has expressed support for an
international commission to investigate claims by victims and their
families.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The government's asylum policy came
under severe criticism Wednesday after a Nigerian woman died
following a struggle with police trying to deport her. Two
policemen charged with assault.
	   The government and judicial authorities are investigating
Tuesday's incident at Brussels international airport. Police tried
to subdue Semira Adamu by putting a pillow on her face as she
resisted efforts to strap her into a seat on a Togo-bound plane.
	   As passengers looked on, Ms. Adamu, 20, struggled, then fell
into a coma. She was taken to hospital where she died hours later
of a brain hemorrhage.
	   Ms. Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed that
her family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already
has three wives. Belgium argued that was not grounds for refugee
status.
	   Police had previously tried to deport Ms. Adamu six times.
	   Politicians from the ruling center-left coalition and the
opposition called for reform of asylum procedures and many
expressed outrage that the use of a pillow to subdue recalcitrant
asylum seekers was standard practice.
	   ``The asylum policy has to be humane,'' said Senator Bert
Anciaux, chairman of the opposition ID21 party.
	   Judicial authorities interrogated three policemen who were
involved in the deportation attempt and charged two with assault
and battery without the intent to kill. They were detained for
several hours and then released.
	   Adamu's death led to angry protests by sympathizers outside the
home of Interior Minister Louis Tobback in Leuven, 16 kilometers
(10 miles) east of Brussels, and the national parliament, where
some 150 demonstrators shouted ``Tobback murderer.''
	   Tobback said he regretted the incident but added first reports
indicated that police were not acting illegally as Ms. Adamu had
exhausted her appeals against an expulsion order.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International condemned the
asylum laws.
	   ``The death of Semira is part of a series of complaints and is
the results of several new laws to get asylum in Belgium,'' said AI
spokeswoman Joelle Noel.
	   Some 4,000 people whose asylum requests were turned down by the
Belgian authorities were repatriated last year. Some 300 needed
police escorts.

Russian government seeks additional aid from international lenders

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will continue to seek financial assistance
from abroad while pursuing free-market reforms to combat the crisis
in its economy, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday.
	   Primakov has been calling on international lenders to help
Russia through its crisis, but without a clear-cut plan of action,
it appears unlikely that any funds will be forthcoming.
	   At a meeting with Horst Koehler, the visiting head of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Primakov said
Russia needed help to rebuild its economy.
	   Primakov, who has been in office for 12 days and has yet to
outline his economic program or fill several key cabinet posts,
said Russia would continue economic reforms, but their
implementation will be ``considerably adjusted.''
	   The prime minister said for Russia to overcome the crisis, his
government needs foreign support, ``both in the form of
consultations and financial backing.''
	   The EBRD, established in 1991 to help countries in Eastern
Europe move toward market economies, has provided loans to a number
of Russian industries.
	   Koehler, without making any firm commitment, said the bank was
prepared to invest further in Russia if the government takes
``resolute'' moves to stabilize the economy and restore investors'
confidence.
	   Many private investors have fled Russia in recent months, and
foreign banks that bought billions of dollars of government bonds
have complained that they are being discriminated against while the
government tries to bail out Russian banks.
	   Lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund, are expected
to delay installments on existing loans at least until the new
government details its plans for coping with the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, there has been no serious talk of new loans to Russia
by the IMF or anyone else.
	   Russian officials were planning to hold separate talks with a
visiting IMF delegation, as well as discussions with Western banks
seeking better terms on debt restructuring deals.
	   Russia's banking system has been virtually paralyzed by the
crisis, which hit just over a month ago. Some banks remain closed,
while others are handling only limited transactions. Most
individual and corporate clients still cannot make routine payments
and transfers.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov blamed the current crisis on bad
advice from the IMF to reform the economy on monetarist principles.
	   ``This led to the absence of a customs policy, tax juggling,
robbing of companies, unrestrained lending rates of commercial
banks and impossible energy tariffs,'' he said at a meeting with
Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger.
	   The privatization program of earlier governments ``robbed the
nation'' and put property in the hands of people unable to manage
them, Luzhkov said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin said Wednesday that a
new finance minister was expected to be named Thursday, and that
the government plans to present a ``revolutionary'' tax reform plan
to parliament soon.
	   Russian stocks ended lower Wednesday in light trading. The
Russian Trading System Index dropped 4 percent to close at 47.65
points, down from 49.65 on Tuesday.
	   The official ruble rate remained at about 16 to the U.S. dollar,
but was being exchanged at rates as high as 13 to the dollar at
currency exchanges on the street.

Georgian president orders investigation of nephew

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ President Eduard Shevardnadze has
ordered a probe into his nephew's business affairs following
allegations that his company committed fraud, the president's press
service said Wednesday.
	   Several Georgian newspapers on Tuesday published articles
charging that Nugzar Shevardnadze, director of the fuel importing
firm Iveria Plus, had failed to repay large debts to a Greek firm.
	   They also said that Europol, the European Union police
organization, was about to lodge charges of fraud and financial
misconduct against him.
	   A headline in the newspaper Dilit Gazeti said, ``International
scandals in the background of dirty business, or how long will
Nugzar Shevardnadze be protected by his roof,'' implying that he
had presidential protection. ``Roof'' is slang for mob-style
protection.
	   But Shevardnadze insisted he wasn't particularly close to his
nephew, and had not given him any help.
	   ``He is not a member of my (immediate) family,'' the president
said. ``And I do not know what business he runs, or if he is good
or not in running it. If he had been good at it, there would not be
such a fuss now.''
	   Shevardnadze's press service said the president on Tuesday
ordered the prosecutor general to investigate the allegations ``and
inform the people of the results.''
	   Iveria Plus issued a statement saying that the allegations were
part of a ``smear campaign'' aimed at President Shevardnadze in
advance of local elections in November and that his nephew was
innocent.
	   It was the second time this year that a relative has caused
problems for the Georgian president.
	   In March, Shevardnadze forced the government to annul the
results of a privatization tender won by his son-in-law, saying it
created the appearance of impropriety. The president told his
Cabinet that he needed not only protection from terrorists, but his
relatives as well.

	   VAGANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces drove deeper into the
heartland of the ethnic Albanian rebellion Wednesday in a defiant
show of power as world leaders edged closer to intervening to stop
the bloodshed.
	   Serb artillery boomed in the west and east of the Drenica region
of central Kosovo, threatening thousands of civilians. Up to 20,000
civilians were believed trapped by the fighting.
	   Thousands of Serb police, Yugoslav soldiers and armed Serb
civilians, many of them teenagers, patrolled nearly all routes into
the Drenica region Wednesday, tightening a noose on the several
hundred lightly armed rebels who built a network of trenches and
sandbag bunkers in the mountainous area.
	   The latest offensive came as the U.N. Security Council prepared
to vote on a resolution which U.S. officials say threatens force
unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic halts the fighting and
begins talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the Serbian
province.
	   Serb forces appeared intent on crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army in advance of any internationally demanded peace moves. The
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed that 11 ethnic
Albanian civilians were killed Tuesday.
	   Police prevented reporters from traveling freely through the
Drenica area Wednesday. ``There are still many terrorists there
today,'' said the commander of one Serb police checkpoint near the
village of Vucitrn. ``There will be terrorists there tomorrow and
there will be terrorists there a year from now.''
	   Along the fringes of the area, evidence of conflict was
apparent. Vaganica, a small village three kilometers (1.5 miles)
inside the Drenica area was deserted Wednesday, except for dogs and
abandoned farm animals roaming through the streets.
	   Reporters could hear the thud of distant artillery, but unlike
the day before, no small arms fire, indicating Serbs were softening
up resistance before infantry assaults.
	   A worker from UNICEF, who refused to give his name, said
refugees were trying to escape Drenica into the town of Kosovska
Mitrovica, northwest of Pristina. He said recent fighting in recent
months had already driven 20,000 to the homes of relatives or to
cramped quarters in local schools and mosques.
	   Another Western aid worker, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Wednesday that people in Kosovska Mitrovica suburbs already
were packed 100 to a house and any new arrivals would have to camp
in the nearby muddy open fields.
	   ``If there are any more refugees, we just can't handle it
here,'' said the worker.
	   Milosevic sent his top ally, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic, to Kosovo on Wednesday. At a meeting with Yugoslav
army commanders, Milutinovic declared that Yugoslavia would defend
its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the official Tanjug news
agency reported.
	   He added that the world should put pressure on Albania because
it provides bases for the ``terrorists'' instead of threatening
Yugoslavia.

Norway's prime minister due back after depression sick-leave
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Three weeks after wrestling with Norway's
problems led him to take sick leave to deal with his depression,
Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik on Thursday is to return to
work _ and to the problems.
	   A statement from the prime minister's office on Wednesday said
he has recovered and will resume his full duties.
	   ``He stopped by the office briefly today, without acting as
prime minister,'' said Oivind Oestang, the prime minister's
spokesman.
	   Norwegians, including politicians and the news media, have
generally reacted sympathetically to Bondevik's leave. Allowing the
Christian Democratic prime minister to recover in private was seen
as the natural, decent thing to do in this Nordic welfare state.
	   ``He can be happy that he was allowed to have his sickness in
peace,'' wrote the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet in a commentary on
Wednesday. ``Unlike his colleague Bill Clinton, his private life
has not been politicized.''
	   But the moment Bondevik steps back into the public spotlight,
mercy ends. The prime minister and his minority coalition are
expected to face a tough autumn session in Parliament, which opens
Oct. 2.
	   ``Being prime minister is a job that demands 100 percent.
Special arrangement or consideration from members of parliament is
not something Bondevik can count on,'' said Kirsti Kolle Groendahl,
president of the parliament.
	   Bondevik, a 51-year-old Lutheran minister, took office 11 months
ago as head of a three-party minority coalition. His popularity
soared early in the term, as he managed to defy predictions that
his colation would only last a few weeks.
	   His sick leave, originally one week from Aug. 31 and then
extended twice, was for ``a depressive reaction to overwork.'' It
came just as his government opened internal negotiations on
proposals for next year's national budget.
	   Bondevik's coalition of the Christian Democrats, the Center
Party and the Liberals has just 42 seats in the 165 seat
parliament, and is reported to have been bitterly split over key
issues in the draft 1998 budget it will present on Oct. 5.
	   Norway, the world's second-largest oil exporter, is expected to
face a tough round of budget cuts as lower oil prices and global
financial uncertainty contribute to chilling the Norwegian economy
after a five-year economic boom.
	   ``The prime minister and his crew are heading into a tough
period,'' said Oslo's Dagsavisen newspaper in its Wednesday
editorial. ``There is a good chance that the government will not
survive the budget session.''

Siemens forms fund for Nazi slave laborers

laborers; ADDS number of slave laborers in Siemens' wartime
factories &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Following Volkswagen's lead, Siemens announced
plans Wednesday for a 20 million mark (dlrs 12 million) fund to
compensate former slave laborers forced to work for the company by
the Nazis during World War II.
	   The electronics giant, along with VW, is one of several German
businesses under pressure from lawsuits in the United States and
threats of more at home from Nazi-era victims.
	   Volkswagen last week became the first of these firms to agree to
victim payments when it announced its own 20 million mark fund, a
change of heart after arguing for years that it had no legal duty
to pay back wages for labor forced on it by the Nazi war machine.
	   Siemens had a similar change of heart: Almost a year ago, at its
150th anniversary celebrations, the company had insisted it could
do no more for its former slave laborers than express ``deepest
regrets.''
	   The Munich-based Siemens said its fund is in addition to the 7.2
million marks it paid to the Jewish Claims Conference in 1961 and
to providing humanitarian help for victims. Siemens estimates that
between 10,000 and 20,000 slave laborer worked in its wartime
factories.
	   Other firms that used slave labor during World War II also have
donated to Jewish groups; Daimler gave 20 million marks (dlrs 11
million) and Krupp, the steel and engineering group, said it
provided 10 million marks (dlrs 5.5 million) in 1959.
	   But the threat of lawsuits has raised the pressure on German
firms to pay direct claims to the thousands of concentration camp
inmates, mostly Jews, forced to work in their factories.
	   Lawyers representing former slave laborers criticized Siemens,
as they did Volkswagen, for setting up a fund to avoid larger
payments a lawsuit might demand.
	   Siemens is seeking ``the cheapest alternative,'' said Munich
attorney Michael Witti, who filed the U.S. lawsuit with his New
York-based colleague Ed Fagan. ``We will find justice for these
people in the end.''

As body count grows, opposition mounts to Lesotho intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Lesotho &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ As the body count grows, South
Africa faces mounting opposition at home to its use of force to
quell unrest in neighboring Lesotho.
	   The images of battle contrast with the new South Africa's role
as a conciliatory, non-interventionist voice on the continent after
years of military aggression under white rule.
	   As newspapers on Wednesday splashed bloody pictures of dead
South African soldiers on their front pages, opposition parties in
Parliament condemned the military move as unnecessary and costly in
lives and money.
	   At least 10 South African soldiers died in fighting at one
barracks alone, a senior officer in Maseru said, though the
military command in Pretoria gave a death toll of nine for the
whole operation.
	   Mamello Morrison, a spokeswoman for the opposition in Lesotho,
flew to Cape Town on Wednesday to slam the intervention and appeal
for South African troops to withdraw.
	   ``The power of the (Lesotho) people is being vanquished because
South Africa wants to uphold the avarice of a few people in
power,'' she told a news conference.
	   Such criticisms have been rare for South Africa, which since it
emerged from apartheid after all-race elections in 1994 has tried
to act as a peacebroker in African conflicts from Rwanda to Angola.
	   Political analysts warned the intervention may hurt South
Africa's image in its home continent, especially with neighbors who
still remember when apartheid forces crossed borders with impunity.
	   ``It may be seen in some places as the old power flexing its
muscles,'' said Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at the Royal
United Services Institute, a London-based defense think tank.
	   But Eyal said South Africa's image beyond Africa would likely be
untarnished because Western countries would welcome South Africa
playing an active role in ending political instability.
	   Professor Mike Hough of the Institute of Strategic Studies in
Pretoria noted the intervention, supported by Botswanan troops, was
under the auspices of the Southern African Development Community, a
regional trade body, and also at the invitation of Lesotho's
elected government.
	   Deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad told reporters the
intervention was a specific response to prevent a military coup.
	   ``It does not represent a major shift in our foreign policy,''
he said. ``We are still commited to trying to find solutions
through political means.''
	   However, talk radio callers and local newspapers joined the
chorus of opposition, noting that South Africa had opposed military
intervention in a civil war in the Congo.
	   ``What was the difference between the two situations? Why
exercise restraint in one instance and blunder in the other?'' said
an editorial in the Cape Times newspaper.
	   Hough believes the answer is simple self-interest.
	   With South African businesses dotting Maseru's streets and
mindful of a potential refugee crisis on its own borders, South
Africa wanted to impose order in a country paralyzed by opposition
protesters alleging May's elections were rigged.
	   ``The immediate consideration is that South Africa's interests
were threatened,'' Hough said.
	   However, analysts and lawmakers fear South African soldiers may
end up trapped in the Belgium-sized kingdom of 2 million people.
	   Though the army has promised to leave when order is restored, it
is unlikely that will happen before a settlement has been reached
between Lesotho's squabbling political factions. Hough said this
could take several months.
	   More worryingly, some warn Lesotho soldiers fleeing into the
country's mountains could fight a lengthy hit-and-run war.

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council is demanding a
cease-fire in Kosovo and threatening further action if the violence
continues in the Yugoslav province, where tens of thousands of
refugees face a desperate winter.
	   A draft of a resolution expected to be adopted Wednesday doesn't
specifically authorize NATO forces to stop the Serb offensive on
ethnic Albanian separatists. But countries such as the United
States have said such authorization isn't necessary for military
intervention.
	   The United States has asked the NATO governing body to begin
rounding up commitments from NATO countries to contribute to a
possible multinational force, two senior U.S. officials said
Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The U.N. resolution doesn't go that far, stating only that ``the
council would consider further action and additional measures to
maintain or restore peace and stability in the region,'' if a
political settlement isn't reached.
	   It gives no time frame.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Wednesday the
resolution was sufficient for now, but that the council and other
concerned nations must wait for the next step before looking at any
military intervention.
	   He stressed that the Security Council alone determines whether
force is necessary.
	   The resolution cites Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows
for the use of force by member states if regional peace and
security is threatened. Nevertheless, there is no explicit
authorization for member states to intervene.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and more than a quarter
million uprooted since Serb forces began a crackdown in February on
ethnic Albanian separatists, who constitute 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence of
Kosovo; Western nations have called on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to return the autonomy he stripped from the province in
1989.
	   In addition to demanding a cease-fire, the draft resolution
urges the Serbs and ethnic Albanian leadership to start negotiating
a solution to the crisis.
	   It demands Milosevic allow international monitoring in Kosovo
and the return of refugees.
	   Russia, which has opposed force in the past, said it would go
along with the resolution because it didn't specifically authorize
military intervention. Another resolution was necessary to do that,
Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov said.
	   ``The use of force is the last resort, and it could only be done
on the decision of the Security Council,'' he said.
	   China, however, still had problems with the threat of further
measures, council diplomats said.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said the goal of the
resolution was to end the fighting and halt a humanitarian
disaster. Immediate military action was not the objective, he said.
	   Italy's foreign minister Alberto Dini, in a briefing with
reporters, questioned how any direct military action would be
carried out and stressed that the international community ``must
push diplomacy further and not despair yet.''.

Election results to be announced Thursday

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Final results of Bosnia's
nationwide elections will be announced Thursday, international
organizers of the vote announced Wednesday. They are expected to
confirm reports of a hardliner's upset victory for the Bosnian Serb
presidency.
	   International officials had hoped the elections _ the third in
three post-war years _ would further sideline hard-line
nationalists opposed to ethnic tolerance and other provisions of
the 1995 peace agreement.
	   But officials familiar with unofficial results said the
Western-supported incumbent had lost to a hardliner in the race for
the Bosnian Serb presidency and that Croat nationalists were
winning over more moderate Croats in the Federal Parliament.
	   ``We see this disappointing, but it is the exception rather than
the rule,'' said U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard.
	   ``Everything else has moved in the right direction,'' toward
greater democratic pluralism and greater power for parties
supporting the Dayton peace accord, Gelbard said, alluding to good
showings by moderates in some parliamentary races.
	   Bosnia is divided between a Bosnian Serb entity of the country
and a federation of Muslims and Croats. Both of those entities have
their own governments but are linked by a third joint central
government.
	   In the Serb part, nationalist Nikola Poplasen seems to have
defeated U.S. backed president Biljana Plavsic _ a blow to
expensive western efforts to cement her moderate Serb government.
Plavsic already conceded defeat on Monday.
	   Moderate Kresimir Zubak also seems to have lost the Croat seat
of the three-member, three-nation Bosnian presidency to a hardline
rival believed opposed to cooperation with Muslims in the
Croat-Muslim Bosnian Federation.
	   Moderate Zivko Radisic, however, appears to have defeated
incumbent Momcilo Krajisnik for the Serb seat on the Bosnian
presidency. Krajisnik is allied with Radovan Karadzic, the wartime
Bosnian Serb leader now under double indictment by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal.

Kosovo Albanians caught near western border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - A group of Kosovo Albanians were caught
Wednesday in a forest near the Slovak and Austrian borders in
north-western Hungary, the state news agency MTI reported.
	   Border guards apprehended 31 men, eight women and one child, all
without travel documents, and took them into custody.
	   They crossed into Hungary illegally days ago and two smugglers
took them to the western border by bus after they had paid
2,000-2,500 German marks each (dlrs 1,000-1,250), the illegal
aliens told authorities.
	   If they are declared refugees of war, they will be granted
asylum if they request it for the duration of the conflict.
	   Serb and Yugoslav forces wage a bitter campaign against rebel
ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern Kosovo province, that has
killed hundreds of people and forced thousands to flee their homes.
	   The republics of Serbia and Montenegro make up Yugoslavia, which
borders Hungary to the south.

Iran releases official agency journalists from detention

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with journalists's release; ADDS return of

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A deputy director and an editor of Iran's
official news agency were released from detention Wednesday, the
agency reported.
	   Mohammad Reza Sadeq, the deputy director of the Islamic Republic
News Agency, and Ali-Reza Khosravi, the social affairs editor, were
welcomed on their release by fellow editors and journalists, IRNA
said.
	   The agency did not say they had been obliged to pay bail, as had
been expected.
	   The complaint against the two men appeared to have been
withdrawn, the agency said.
	   Sadeq and Khosravi were detained Tuesday after Mohsen
Rafiqdoust, a senior cleric, filed a complaint to a Tehran court
about an IRNA report on an attempt on his life on Sept. 13.
	   The nature of the complaint was not known, but on Sept. 13 the
agency initially suggested that Rafiqdoust had been injured, saying
he was ``in satisfactory condition'' and ``received no serious
injuries.''
	   Later the agency reported Rafiqdoust had not been hurt in the
attack, which occurred when shots were fired through the window of
his high-rise office in North Tehran from nearby hills.
	   Rafiqdoust, a hard-line cleric, is the head of a foundation that
cares for the poor and persons disabled in the Iran-Iraq war of
1980-88.
	   Meanwhile, the managing director of the banned newspaper Tous,
Mohammad Mohsen Sazgara, returned to Tehran earlier Wednesday and
was admitted to Mehr Hospital, government officials said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   Sazgara, who arrived from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, had expressed
fears before boarding the flight that he would be arrested.
	   The state has detained three senior staffers of Tous since it
shut down the newspaper on Sept. 16 for allegedly publishing
articles ``detrimental to national interests.''
	   Tous angered hard-liners with its anti-war stance. The newspaper
has called for a diplomatic solution rather than military strikes
in the conflict with the Taliban in Afghanistan.
	   The newspaper also angered hard-liners by questioning the
authority of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual guide.

	   VAGANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces drove deeper into the
heartland of the ethnic Albanian rebellion Wednesday in a defiant
show of power as world leaders edged closer to intervening to stop
the bloodshed.
	   Serb artillery boomed in the west and east of the Drenica region
of central Kosovo, threatening thousands of civilians. Up to 20,000
civilians were believed trapped by the fighting.
	   Thousands of Serb police, Yugoslav soldiers and armed Serb
civilians, many of them teenagers, patrolled nearly all routes into
the Drenica region Wednesday, tightening a noose on the several
hundred lightly armed rebels who built a network of trenches and
sandbag bunkers in the mountainous area.
	   The latest offensive came as the U.N. Security Council prepared
to vote on a resolution which U.S. officials say threatens force
unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic halts the fighting and
begins talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the Serbian
province.
	   Serb forces appeared intent on crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army in advance of any internationally demanded peace moves. The
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed that 11 ethnic
Albanian civilians were killed Tuesday.
	   Police prevented reporters from traveling freely through the
Drenica area Wednesday.
	   Along the fringes of the area, evidence of conflict was
apparent. Vaganica, a small village three kilometers (1.5 miles)
inside the Drenica area was deserted Wednesday, except for dogs and
abandoned farm animals roaming through the streets.
	   Reporters could hear the thud of distant artillery, but unlike
the day before, no small arms fire, indicating Serbs were softening
up resistance before infantry assaults.
	   A worker from UNICEF, who refused to give his name, said
refugees were trying to escape Drenica into the town of Kosovska
Mitrovica, northwest of Pristina. He said recent fighting in recent
months had already driven 20,000 to the homes of relatives or to
cramped quarters in local schools and mosques.
	   Another Western aid worker, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday that people in Kosovska Mitrovica suburbs
already were packed 100 to a house and any new arrivals would have
to camp in the nearby muddy open fields.
	   ``If there are any more refugees, we just can't handle it
here,'' said the worker.
	   Milosevic sent his top ally, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic, to Kosovo on Wednesday. At a meeting with Yugoslav
army commanders, Milutinovic declared that Yugoslavia would defend
its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the official Tanjug news
agency reported.
	   He added that the world should put pressure on Albania because
it provides bases for the ``terrorists'' instead of threatening
Yugoslavia.

China appeals for entry into WTO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ China's foreign minister again appealed
for his country's entry into the World Trade Organization, citing
China's efforts to stabilize the Asian economic crisis and the
opening of its markets for more business
	   ``China is already qualified for entry, regrettably,
negotiations have dragged on and on,'' Tang Jiaxuan told the U.N.
General Assembly.
	   China has been lobbying for 12 years for entry into the WTO, the
main international body governing global trade relations and
setting fair trade rules. There is general agreement China should
join the organization and be bound by its responsibilities, but
there is disagreement on the conditions of entry.
	   Beijing wants to enter as a developing country, meaning it would
have to take only gradual measures to cut barriers to imports of
goods and services.
	   The United States, which has a big trade deficit with China, and
other major traders have refused to let China in unless Beijing
opens its markets wider.
	   China is striving ``to keep abreast of economic globalization
and will be even more active in opening up to the world,'' Tang
said.
	   Since the Asian financial crisis began in July 1997, China has
resisted pressure to devalue its currency, the renminbi, ``for
which we have endured great pressure and paid a heavy price,'' he
said.
	   China's exports _ a driving force in its economy _ rose a
sluggish 7.6 percent during the first half of the year.
	   A slowdown in exports will likely make it more difficult for
Chinese leaders to meet their target for 8 percent economic growth
this year. The threshold is seen as critical to creating new jobs
and staving off unrest among millions of workers being laid off
from inefficient, bankrupt state industries.

Legislator proposes freezing assets of Italian insurer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli legislator demanded Wednesday that
the government freeze the Israeli assets of an Italian insurance
company that reneged on an agreement to pay dlrs 100 million to
families of Holocaust victims who were policyholders.
	   Assicurazioni Generali, Italy's largest insurer, announced
Tuesday that it would not honor the settlement it negotiated with
families of Holocaust victims and U.S. insurance commissioners.
	   The company blamed the other parties, saying they had not lived
up to the agreement. Generali refused to say precisely what
provisions of the agreement it feels have been violated.
	   In response, Israeli legislator Michael Kleiner demanded that
the Israeli government freeze the assets of Migdal, an Israeli
insurance company bought by Generali recently for dlrs 200 million.
	   ``It is clear that these assets need to be frozen and maybe, at
a later stage, if an agreement is not worked out with Generali,
sold as part of the money given to the families of victims,''
Kleiner told Israel radio.
	   The legislator also reiterated a demand that Generali post the
names of policy holders on the Internet so heirs and Holocaust
survivors can check whether they are entitled to money.
	   Motti Sherf, a spokesman for the Israeli insurance commissioner
said freezing Migdal's assets would fall outside the commissioner's
jurisdiction and should be handled by elected lawmakers.
	   Generali is one of 16 European insurance companies named in a
federal class-action suit filed last year in New York. Another suit
was filed in February in a Los Angeles Superior Court by family
members of five Holocaust victims.
	   Last year, Generali established a dlrs 12 million fund for
Holocaust survivors. The company has expressed support for an
international commission to investigate claims by victims and their
families.

Police raid hoard, seize extremely rare ancient coin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police have seized what they have
described as an extremely rare ancient Greek coin during a raid at
a collector's home.
	   ``Many of the confiscated coins are rare and unique and
especially the one made of electrum, taking into account that there
is one other like it that is on display at the British Museum,''
the police said in an announcement Wednesday.
	   Electrum is a blend of silver and gold and was one of the first
materials used for the manufacture of precious coins.
	   According to police, the electrum coin was part of a collection
of nearly 3,000 coins confiscated Tuesday from the home of
Theodoros Pitidi-Potou, a 57-year-old collector and member of the
Greek Numismatic Society.
	   Pitidi-Potou told police he was the legal owner of the coins,
but was arrested because it is a crime in Greece to collect
unregistered ancient artifacts. He was being held and will be
charged with violating antiquities laws.
	   According to John Orna-Ornstein, an expert at the British Museum
in London, the coin found by police could be a rare example of a
5th cent. B.C. electrum coin. If it is similar or the same as the
one displayed in the museum, its worth could run in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hurricane Georges brought its
violent winds and rains to Haiti Wednesday, unleashing flash floods
and killing at least 11 people in this poor Caribbean country.
	   The hurricane's unofficial death toll was 37, including 17 in
the Dominican Republic, where Georges set off looting and street
violence. Two of the dead were looters shot by police.
	   As Georges marched relentlessly to the northwest, a hurricane
watch was posted for south Florida. As many as 100,000 people in
the Florida Keys were being ordered to leave for the mainland
Wednesday.
	   Four people died in Puerto Rico, where the government's
insurance commissioner, Juan Garcia, estimated damages at dlrs 1
billion.
	   In the capital of the Dominican Republic, looters waded
waist-deep in water, balancing televisions and air conditioners on
their heads even as 110 mph (177 kmh) winds toppled trees and
crushed houses. Bands of youths with machetes and pistols roamed
the streets, many of them drunk.
	   Haiti's Radio Metropole reported that nine people were killed
when floodwaters collapsed two homes in a Port-au-Prince
neighborhood. Deaths also were reported in Gonaives and the
northern town of Marmelade.
	   Elsewhere, battering ocean waves swamped the seaside boulevard
in the northern Haitian city of Cap-Haitien, and tin roofs flew off
homes.
	   ``We're scared a little, but we have a lot of faith,'' said
Port-au-Prince supermarket clerk Nadine Augustin. Like most people
in the Western Hemisphere's poorest country, her family had little
means to prepare for the storm.
	   The Haitian government was able to muster only dlrs 130,000 for
emergency assistance, said civil defense spokeswoman Yolaine
Surena.
	   Mountain erosion and a lack of maintenance have left drainage
systems in Haitian cities choked with silt and unable to alleviate
flash floods, said meteorologist Renan Jean-Louis.
	   ``Foundations give way every time the rain falls. The
environment is deteriorating ceaselessly because there is no
government enforcement of zoning regulations,'' Haitian
environmentalist Ernst Wilson said Wednesday.
	   In November 1994, tropical storm Gordon killed at least 1,000 in
Haiti's southern provinces, drowning them in torrential streams or
burying them in mudslides.
	   At 11 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), Hurricane Georges was centered over
the Windward Passage about 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of the
eastern tip of Cuba and 595 miles (955 kilometers) southeast of Key
West, Florida. It was moving west-northwest near 15 mph (24 kph).
	   Warnings were declared in Cuba from Sancti Spiritus province
eastward and in the central and southern Bahamas. Cuban President
Fidel Castro put his ministers on alert.
	   ``No one will be forgotten in this new battle by the Cuban
people. We are a nation that has overcome adversity with unity,''
Mexico's official Notimex news agency quoted Castro as saying.
	   The mammoth storm was on a trajectory that could send it
crashing into the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday.
	   Georges' winds dropped from 110 mph (177 kmh) Tuesday to near 75
mph (120. kmh) Wednesday as it moved across the island of
Hispaniola, but were expected to strengthen over open water.
	   In the Dominican Republic, east of Haiti, soldiers enforced a
curfew in the capital of Santo Domingo after Georges ravaged the
nation.
	   ``We are occupying Santo Domingo to prevent criminal acts, which
we see practically as acts of terrorism,'' said armed forces chief
Ruben Paulino Alvarez.
	   Georges knocked out communications with the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Henry Laskowski, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in
San Juan, said roofs were blown off and trees were felled on St.
Croix, which is part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, but there were no
reports of fatalities.
	   In Puerto Rico, residents began the sobering task of recovery.
	   ``After the storm is always the worst,'' said Paula Aponte
Figueroa, 71, as she swatted at mosquitoes, the roof of her house
ripped off by the winds. ``You've got flooding, you've got
mosquitoes and I have nowhere to go.''

Russian Communist Party head warns of threat of dictatorship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Russia's Communist Party chief warned on
Wednesday that the financial crisis in his homeland could spawn a
military dictatorship.
	   The financial and social situation in Russia remains ``very
serious,'' and encourages those who dream of military dictatorship,
party chief Gennadi Zyuganov told reporters. Once created, such a
dictatorship would not only destroy Russia but ``pull Europe into
the whirlpool of catastrophe,'' he added.
	   Zyuganov, in Vienna since Wednesday, asked Austria for help in
combating ``hunger, cold and unemployment,'' the Austria Press
Agency reported.
	   The Communists demand new policies to master the Russian crisis
in a democratic way, including securing existing jobs and creating
new ones. Policies under President Boris Yeltsin ``support theft
and corruption,'' Zyuganov was quoted as saying.
	   ``Cooperation with Europe is very important for our country,''
he reportedly said, warning of an upcoming ``hungry winter'' in
some parts of Russia.
	   He urged European politicians to recognize that their
``unequivocal support of Yeltsin'' contributed to the present
Russian crisis.

Brazilian president says fiscal austerity measures urgently needed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANY CABRERA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on
Wednesday said Brazil ``urgently needed'' fiscal austerity measures
to withstand the turmoil in world financial markets.
	   Since Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on its debt in
mid-August, Brazil's stability has been shaken by the loss of
confidence in emerging markets and a strong outflow of capital. The
country's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 50 billion from
the dlrs 70 billion posted at the end of July.
	   Cardoso said austerity measures would help regain the confidence
of Brazil's neighbors and investors.
	   ``It is a commitment not only to those who invest in Brazil but
also to other countries, especially in Latin America, who like us
are trying to make internal adjustments and build up strength to
weather external storms,'' Cardoso added.
	   He said Brazil needed to cut government spending to reduce a
budget deficit equal to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP).
	   ``The losses have to stop,'' Cardoso said. ``The state has to
use only the resources that society can pay for.''
	   Cardoso said the government also plans to crack down on tax
evasion and broaden the taxpayer base as a way to raise more
revenue.
	   With the latest polls showing Cardoso winning the Oct. 4
elections, he could afford to make call for such potentially
unpopular measures.
	   A survey published Wednesday shows that Cardoso would win his
bid for reelection with 47 percent of the vote. His nearest
challenger, Luiz Inacio ``Lula'' da Silva, of the leftist Workers
Party, has 24 percent of the vote.
	   Cardoso said the Group of Seven leading industrial countries
``should give the International Monetary Fund sufficient funding to
be used in case of need in Latin American countries and a type of
contingency fund that would seek to prevent crises.''
	   He made no reference to the size or the timing of such a
contingency fund.
	   Cardoso also said that he will ``do everything possible'' to
protect the country's currency, the real, and hopes Brazil can cut
interest rates soon to promote economic growth.
	   To prevent a collapse of the real and stem heavy capital
outflows, the government on Sept. 10 raised interest rates from
29.75 percent to 49.75 percent.
	   The president said economic growth is ``indispensable'' for job
creation, which he characterized as a top national priority.
Brazil's unemployment rate is around 8 percent, its highest level
since Cardoso took office four years ago.
	   ``We must grow, but we haven't been able to because of the
public deficit,'' he said.

Russian Communist Party head warns of threat of dictatorship

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Russia's Communist Party chief warned on
Wednesday that the financial crisis in his homeland could spawn a
military dictatorship.
	   The financial and social situation in Russia remains ``very
serious,'' and encourages those who dream of military dictatorship,
party chief Gennadi Zyuganov told reporters. Once created, such a
dictatorship would not only destroy Russia but ``pull Europe into
the whirlpool of catastrophe,'' he added.
	   Zyuganov, in Vienna since Wednesday, asked Austria for help in
combating ``hunger, cold and unemployment,'' the Austria Press
Agency reported.
	   The Communists demand new policies to master the Russian crisis,
including securing existing jobs and creating new ones. Policies
under President Boris Yeltsin ``support theft and corruption,''
Zyuganov was quoted as saying.
	   ``Cooperation with Europe is very important for our country,''
he reportedly said.
	   He urged European politicians to recognize that their
``unequivocal support of Yeltsin'' contributed to the present
Russian crisis.

Last-minute negotiations fail to save Philippine Airlines

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ailing Philippine Airlines announced
Wednesday its definitive closure after last-minute negotiations
failed to persuade its largest union to accept a recovery plan.
	   The closure of Asia's oldest airline leaves many areas of the
7,000-island Philippine archipelago without air service. Two
smaller carriers were grounded last week over safety concerns and
financial problems.
	   PAL had announced that it would close at midnight Wednesday
unless workers accepted the rescue plan, which it said was a
prerequisite for recovering from a series of crippling strikes and
Asia's currency crisis.
	   PAL is the largest Philippine company to fail since the regional
financial crisis, which hit just as the airline was launching a
dlrs 4 billion expansion and refleeting plan.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said its closure should
serve as a lesson on the need for management and labor to work
harmoniously together, something which eluded PAL for years.
	   ``It's sad that a national symbol, an institution is going
under. But we have to run these symbols substantially well because
if not, they will not last long,'' he said.
	   Hours before its scheduled closure at midnight Wednesday, PAL
resumed talks with its ground workers' union after it agreed to
partially accept the management plan.
	   But after several hours of negotiations PAL said it could not
accept the conditions attached by the union to the plan.
	   ``It is unfortunate that no agreement was reached,'' said PAL
executive vice president Manolo Aquino. ``Therefore it is with a
sad note that we announce the closure of Philippine Airlines.''
	   PAL's demise saddened many Filipinos. Several television
stations broadcast poignant scenes Wednesday from its 57-year
history.
	   At PAL offices around the country, airline workers held masses
and prayer rallies, hoping for a way to avoid the flag carrier's
closure. At Manila's airport, scores of employees, many dressed in
black and carrying signs reading ``Keep PAL flying,'' held a prayer
vigil in front of the domestic terminal.
	   The government, meanwhile, struggled to prepare for the impact
of a shutdown on the country's already ailing economy.
	   PAL ground workers rejected the management rescue plan in a
Tuesday referendum, but on Wednesday their union agreed to accept
it with modifications.
	   In the plan, PAL chairman Lucio Tan offered workers 20 percent
of the airline's stock and three seats on its board in exchange for
a 10-year suspension of their collective bargaining agreement.
	   Tan holds a 70 percent stake in the airline, while the
government owns about 18 percent.
	   The union said they would agree to the suspension if PAL
accepted an annual review of salary structures, retention of all
current benefits, security of tenure, and a halt to spin-off
companies.
	   The airline says creditors, to whom it owes dlrs 2.1 billion,
had insisted on guarantees of labor harmony before they approved a
restructuring plan.
	   PAL had a 50 percent share of domestic passenger traffic, down
from 75 percent before a pilots' strike in June.
	   The only alternative for travel among the country's islands is
slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries. Last Friday, a ferry carrying
454 people sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila.
	   PAL was founded on Feb. 26, 1941, by a group of businessmen who
wanted to profit from a gold mining boom in the northern
Philippines. The first flight carried five passengers from Manila
to the northern mountain city of Baguio the following month.
	   In July 1946, four chartered PAL planes took American servicemen
home from the Philippines, making PAL the first Asian airline to
cross the Pacific.

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The top U.S. envoy for the
Balkans expressed doubt Wednesday that a hard-liner likely to be
declared the winner of the Bosnian Serb presidency will abide by
the U.S.-brokered peace agreement that ended the Bosnian war.
	   Final results from the Sept. 12-13 nationwide elections are
expected Thursday, according to international overseers. The
results are expected to confirm reports that hard-line Nikola
Poplasen upset the U.S. favorite, Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic.
	   Poplasen's victory is seen as a serious blow to Western efforts
to stitch Bosnia back together after a 3{-year war that ended with
the 1995 Dayton peace agreement.
	   ``I'll be very frank: speaking for the United States of America,
if the results that we read about are true and Mr. Poplasen is
elected ... we have serious questions about his willingness to
implement the provisions of the Dayton agreement,'' U.S. envoy
Robert Gelbard told reporters.
	   ``Based on the past, I would be misleading you if I did not tell
you we have the most serious questions,'' Gelbard added. After
meeting Plavsic, Gelbard said ``we also are very worried'' about
Poplasen's ``constant cries for violence.''
	   Nevertheless, Gelbard told reporters earlier in Sarajevo that
``everything else has moved in the right direction,'' alluding to
good showings by moderates in some parliamentary races.
	   Bosnia is divided between a Bosnian Serb republic and a
federation of Muslims and Croats. Both of those entities have their
own governments but are linked by a third joint central government.
	   Gelbard reiterated that the United States will do everything in
its power to protect Bosnia's integrity and ``even any discussions
of secession would be considered the most critical violation'' of
the peace agreement.
	   Moderate Kresimir Zubak also seems to have lost the Croat seat
of the three-member, three-nation Bosnian presidency to a hardline
rival believed opposed to cooperation with Muslims.
	   Moderate Zivko Radisic, however, appears to have defeated
incumbent Momcilo Krajisnik for the Serb seat on the Bosnian
presidency. Krajisnik is allied with Radovan Karadzic, the wartime
Bosnian Serb leader now under double indictment by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal.
	   Gelbard said that U.S. aid to the Bosnian Serbs depends on their
leaders' future policies.
	   The United States wants to help the people in the Bosnian Serb
half of country, Gelbard said. ``But to do that, there have to be
policies and programs in place that reflect democracy and an
approach for further development of market economy.''
	   In Sarajevo, the daily newspaper Oslobodjenje branded the
elections a failure. ``Bosnia took a step back from democracy ...
and came closer to to the option of the final ethnic division,
which represents a failure of the U.S. policy in Bosnia,'' the
newspaper said.

Tourism to suffer biggest blow with PAL closure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Philippine-Airlines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ With tourism already weakening
because of the Asian currency crisis, Philippine Airlines' closure
will be a major blow to the country's tourism industry, officials
said Wednesday.
	   ``The tourism industry stands to be the hardest hit,'' Tourism
Secretary Gemma Cruz-Araneta said.
	   She said PAL's closure will drastically cut tourist arrivals to
the Philippines.
	   As a result, the country is expected to lose about 36.5 percent
of the estimated 259 million pesos (dlrs 6 million) it receives
each day from foreign tourists, the Department of Tourism said.
	   The amount includes accommodation, shopping, food,
transportation, tours and entertainment expenditures, it said.
	   PAL had a 50 percent share of domestic air passenger traffic,
down from 75 percent before a devastating pilots' strike in June.
	   Direct and indirect employment from tourism accounts for 8.71
percent of total Philippine jobs, the tourism department said.
	   Tourism industry leaders are pushing the government encourage
other airlines to fill up the slack left by PAL and give incentives
to domestic carriers in acquiring or leasing new aircraft.
	   PAL's management shut down the ailing 57-year-old flag carrier
at midnight Wednesday after labor unions rejected a survival plan.

Mexico City police officer arrested in kidnapping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The head of Mexico City's judicial police
says he cannot control the actions of every one of his 3,700
officers but he pledges to punish those who are caught in
wrongdoing, media reports said Wednesday.
	   Mauricio Tornero's comments came after an officer from the
division devoted to bank robbery investigations and a former
officer were arrested Tuesday for allegedly demanding 30,000 pesos
_ about dlrs 3,000 _ in ransom for a kidnapped boy.
	   Since he became chief last December, Tornero said at least 80
judicial agents have been booked on various criminal charges such
as extortion, abuse of authority, battery and kidnapping.
	   ``We are facing the reality that there is a phenomenon of
corruption which we want to dismantle, but to do that we need the
public to come forth and denounce these crimes,'' Tornero told
reporters.
	   In the latest case, officer Arturo Gutierrez, former officer
Eugenio Aguilar and another suspect, Homero Leal, were captured
Tuesday in southern Mexico City when they tried to collect the
ransom, the judicial police said in a statement.
	   Gutierrez, a 6-year veteran of the force, was the eighth officer
from the bank robbery division to be arrested in the last two weeks
for alleged kidnapping, the daily Reforma reported.

State workers protest government austerity program

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Colombian state
workers went on strike Wednesday to protest President Andres
Pastrana's austerity program, paralyzing the judicial system and
cancelling school for millions of children.
	   Colombia's leading labor federations called the 48-hour strike,
chiefly to demand salary increases commensurate with projected 18
percent inflation. Pastrana's two-month government says it will
limit the increases to a maximum of 14 percent, arguing that the
country's financial predicament demands spending cuts.
	   No essential services were halted by the strike, in which
900,000 workers were called to participate. Telecommunications, oil
production and hospital emergency services were unaffected.
	   Labor Minister Hernando Yepes Arcila called the protest
``premature and unjust.''
	   ``The policies being carried out by the government are not
capricious but rather are confronting economic realities,'' he
said.
	   The comptroller general, Carlos Ossa, went further, proposing a
wage freeze for the public and private sector.
	   In the central oil refining city of Barrancabermeja, 265
kilometers (165 miles) north of Bogota, rebels of the National
Liberation Army called an ``armed strike'' in solidarity with the
unionists, threatening to destroy any vehicles traveling on the
region's highways.

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Angry that a former Liberian warlord
remains holed up at the U.S. embassy, pro-government groups renewed
calls Wednesday for protests demanding he be turned over. Liberian
officials, however, refused to let the demonstrations go forward.
	   The Liberian Senate ordered that a demonstration organized by 15
civic groups be canceled to prevent ``certain unscrupulous
individuals from exploiting the situation to cause further chaos,''
a statement said.
	   The groups had planned to march to the seaside U.S. compound to
protest the presence there of former rebel leader Roosevelt Johnson
_ sparking fears at the embassy that the situation could again turn
violent.
	   The government of President Charles Taylor has repeatedly
demanded that Johnson, Taylor's chief rival, be turned over to
them.
	   ``The delay of the transfer of Johnson and others to the
Liberian government is a sign of defeat and a mockery of
democracy,'' the Congress of National Trade Unions of Liberia said
in a statement, calling for a demonstration Thursday at the
embassy.
	   The justice ministry, however, said no permit would be issued
for that march, either.
	   Inside the compound on Wednesday morning, embassy employees
worked through the rain to stack sandbags on the roof, setting up
nests where snipers or machine-gunners could be posted. Other
workers sealed a front gate with roll after roll of barbed wire.
American servicemen, some of them heavily armed and dressed for
combat, walked around the buildings and the grounds.
	   Just outside, a U.S. Navy commando and an embassy security
officer were inspecting the surrounding neighborhood with a group
of West African peacekeepers, searching out potential weak points
in the defenses. The peacekeepers, known as ECOMOG, have patrolled
parts of Liberia for years, and have a heavy force now around the
U.S. Embassy.
	   Dozens of people died in a two-day clash that began Friday night
involving Taylor's forces and supporters of Johnson.
	   Looking for a safe haven, Johnson turned up at the U.S. Embassy
on Saturday, but was fired on by Liberian forces as he spoke with
embassy officials outside the gate.
	   Johnson, two of his sons and several aides rushed into the
compound, but not before at least three of his men were killed and
two Americans were wounded. He remained in the embassy Wednesday,
camped out on a lobby floor.
	   It is unclear what will happen to Johnson, though U.S. officials
have said he will not be handed over the government.
	   Diplomats _ who did not want Johnson coming into the compound at
all _ now find themselves reluctantly protecting him.
	   ``The government forces tried to kill everyone in the Johnson
party, so how can we hand him over to them?'' one diplomat asked,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   State Department officials in Washington are negotiating with
Taylor's government, seeking a solution. That may involve flying
him to a neutral country _ though Taylor's government has
repeatedly demanded that not happen again.
	   In 1996, when Liberia's 7-year civil war was still raging and
Taylor and Johnson controlled competing factions, Johnson sought
shelter at the embassy and was eventually flown to Ghana on a U.S.
helicopter.
	   The diplomat said no quick end to the standoff seemed at hand.
	   ``I'm concerned about the inflexibility of both'' the Liberians
and the American government, said the diplomat.
	   While Taylor has promised that the embassy won't come under
attack, most of the staff have been evacuated and extra troops have
been brought in to shore up the compound's defenses. The U.S.
government has also suggested that Americans living in Liberia
leave the country for the time being.
	   Liberia's civil war _ mostly fought by rival warlords _ ended
two years ago, after 150,000 people were killed and half the
country's population became refugees. Taylor was elected president
last year.

Some 300 U.S. Marines land on Kuwaiti beach in war drill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Some 300 U.S. Marines landed Wednesday on a
Kuwaiti beach in an exercise designed to protect a tiny state that
still feels threatened by Iraq.
	   Five jet-engined hovercrafts glided ashore from the USS Essex
and USS Anchorage and discharged the troops and their armored cars.
	   A total of 1,500 Marines are taking part in the live-fire war
games in Kuwait's desert. U.S. Embassy spokesman Claud Young said
the drills demonstrate America's ``capabilities and commitment to
the security of the region.''
	   U.S. forces have conducted scores of maneuvers in Kuwait since
the end of the 1991 Gulf War that ended a seven-month Iraqi
occupation of the country.
	   Kuwait signed 10-year defense agreements with the United States,
Britain, France and Russia after the war.

European Union says its exports to Asia down, imports up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Imports to some European Union countries have
risen by more than 20 percent since the Asian financial crisis, a
senior European Union official said Wednesday.
	   Exports by the EU to Asian countries, however, have declined by
about 30 percent, said Mogens Peter Carl, deputy director-general
for commercial policy for the European Commission, the EU's
executive body.
	   Carl said there has been a ``sharp change'' in trade between
industrialized countries and Asia and other regions in financial
turmoil, which he did not specify.
	   The trade balance, or the difference between exports and
imports, has declined by 50 percent, when measured in terms of
ecus, the new European currency.
	   However, Carl said the change in actual volume of imports and
exports would be greater because the prices of imports declined
after financially troubled nations devalued their currencies.
	   Figures in ecus were unavailable from the European Union and no
figure has been given for Asia as a whole.
	   Figures released last week by the European Union, however, show
its exports to Japan have fallen by 12 percent and to Hong Kong by
7 percent from Jan to May.
	   Imports from Japan were up 18 percent and from Hong Kong up 22
percent over the same period.
	   Carl spoke in Geneva on the eve of a World Trade Organization
meeting to prepare for next year's trade talks.
	   The EU wants a comprehensive new round, which EU Commissioner
Sir Leon Brittan has called the ``Millennium Round.'' Those talks
aim to significantly reduce industrial tariffs, further open
markets in agriculture and services, including maritime transport
and other sectors not in existing agreements.
	   Carl said the talks should also cover new issues, such as
international investment rules, competition policy and
international lawmaking.
	   ``We think this is indispensable, especially in circumstances
where there is risk of backtracking by some members of the WTO,''
he added.
	   The United States has said a traditional round may be too broad
and take too long to achieve. Some developing nations want to
uphold existing commitments under the Uruguay Round before taking
on new obligations.
	   Anti-free trade campaigners have accused the WTO system of
causing increased poverty in developing countries. But Carl said
the EU believed free trade and the WTO system was not the cause of
the Asian financial crisis, but a solution.
	   He said the EU will present to Thursday's meeting a list of
priorities for freeing trade and that the EU was open to the
inclusion of other issues.
	   ``We cannot stand still, we must move forward, and the community
will take the lead in that respect,'' said Carl.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The day before she died, world-record holding
sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner made an appearance at a
gymnastics meet in Santa Barbara and visited her mother. When she
returned home, she felt ``a little tired'' and went to sleep, her
former coach said.
	   There were ``no signs whatsoever that Florence was ill,'' Bob
Kersee told reporters Tuesday at UCLA.
	   The gold medalist's sudden death early Monday left her family
and the athletics world in shock. Despite earlier reports that
Griffith Joyner suffered from heart problems, Kersee said she
showed no sign of illness before she died.
	   ``In terms of heart seizures, heart attacks, all of that _ none
of that is true,'' he said. ``We, unfortunately, have no idea why
Florence left us.''
	   In response to media speculation in Europe that Griffith
Joyner's death might be due to drug use during her career, the
IOC's leading drug authority said the sprinter was subjected to
rigorous testing at the 1988 Olympics, and passed every test.
	   Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC's medical
committee, said Wednesday that Griffith Joyner had been singled out
for testing in Seoul because of rumors she used steroids.
	   Coroner's tests were continuing, Orange County sheriff's Lt.
Hector Rivera said.
	   Kersee said, however, that she did suffer from exercise-induced
asthma and migraine headaches.
	   Late Tuesday, hundreds of well-wishers and friends gathered in
Leimert Park, not far from where Griffith Joyner grew up, to say
prayers, sing songs and remember her contributions to the
community.
	   Griffith Joyner blazed her way into national attention with her
world-record speed, her flashy, formfitting bodysuits and her
glittering, 15-centimeter (6-inch) fingernails.
	   She won gold medals in the 100- and 200-meter dashes and the
400-meter relay at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and at her death was
still the fastest woman sprinter ever.
	   Commenting on a seizure Griffith Joyner had in St. Louis two
years ago, Kersee said she was hospitalized overnight but doctors
could not find anything wrong and released her.
	   ``Losing Florence suddenly was a shock to the family,'' Kersee
said at UCLA's Drake Stadium, where he once coached Griffith
Joyner. ``It took me the whole flight from St. Louis to believe it.
I don't know if I accept it, but as a Christian I understand it.''
	   Her death reignited speculation about whether Griffith Joyner,
mother of a 7-year-old girl, had ever used performance-enhancing
substances during her athletics career. Her sister-in-law, Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, urged everyone to wait for the autopsy findings.
	   ``At this time I don't feel that it is appropriate (to
speculate), but I do know that there is going to be speculation,
but right now we don't have time to be concerned about that,''
Joyner-Kersee said in a television interview.
	   Kersee said no athlete he has coached ever failed or avoided a
drug test.
	   ``How would you feel if someone was spreading false rumors about
you and your daughter had to read about this?'' Kersee said.
	   Funeral plans were to be announced within days.
	   After her phenomenal performance at Seoul, opponents and some
U.S. sprinters accused Griffith Joyner of using
performance-enhancing drugs. She denied any doping, attributing her
success to a strenuous workout program before the Olympics.
	   Griffith Joyner never failed a doping test.
	   In 1989, U.S. sprinter Darrell Robinson said in the German
magazine Stern that he bought banned growth hormones for Griffith
Joyner. Robinson was paid dlrs 25,000 for his interview with the
magazine.
	   Griffith Joyner denied Robinson's charge that year in a
television interview, saying: ``Darrell, you are a compulsive,
crazy, lying lunatic.''
	   Arne Ljungqvist, vice president of the International Amateur
Athletic Federation and the organization's top antidoping official,
said it would be unfair to speculate about Griffith Joyner and
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   ``It's very unfortunate for sport if one is accused of doping
just for being an extremely good athlete,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A ruling party official Wednesday ruled
out talks with ex-President Sali Berisha on resolving Albania's
political crisis, but said a meeting with others from Berisha's
Democratic Party was possible.
	   Petro Koci, secretary of the Socialist Party of Prime Minister
Fatos Nano, also said some kind of government shakeup would occur
in the next week in response to two days of rioting last week by
Berisha's supporters that threatened to topple the government.
	   ``We are ready for dialogue with the Democratic Party, but not
with Berisha,'' Koci told state radio. ``He headed the coup.''
	   Berisha, under criminal investigation for his role in the Sept.
13-14 rioting, later repeated his call for Nano's resignation at a
peaceful rally by about 2,000 supporters in the capital's central
Skanderbeg Square.
	   ``Nano is ready to kill and imprison the opposition,'' Berisha
said in calling the prime minister a Communist-style dictator.
	   Berisha has repeatedly rejected negotiations with Nano's
government, demanding instead that Nano should resign.
	   But criticism from Western powers of his role in the rioting and
small crowds at a series of protests called by Berisha _ none
exceeding 3,000 people so far _ show the former president has
little leverage to force his push for power.
	   Along with warnings of isolation by the West if his supporters
again resort to violence, Berisha also faces possible prosecution
for allegedly trying to overthrow Nano's government.
	   Last week, the Socialist-dominated Parliament voted to lift
Berisha's immunity from arrest, and the public prosecutor announced
he was investigating the rioting that left three people dead and
scores injured.
	   The Democratic Party lost power to Nano's Socialists in
elections last year that followed months of unrest over the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes that wiped out the life
savings of many Albanians. Since then, the party has rarely
attended Parliament, where it holds 27 of the 155 seats. The
Socialists hold 100 seats.
	   Last week's rioting began the day after popular politician and
top Berisha aide Azem Hajdari was shot to death. Berisha blamed
Nano for the killing, but Western officials say they believe
Hajdari's death was due to a private feud.

	   VAGANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces drove deeper into the
heartland of the ethnic Albanian rebellion Wednesday in a defiant
show of power as world leaders edged closer to intervening to stop
the bloodshed.
	   Serb artillery boomed in the west and east of the Drenica region
of central Kosovo. Up to 20,000 civilians were believed trapped by
the fighting.
	   Thousands of Serb police, Yugoslav soldiers and armed Serb
civilians, many of them teenagers, patrolled nearly all routes into
the Drenica region Wednesday, tightening a noose on the several
hundred lightly armed rebels who built a network of trenches and
sandbag bunkers in the mountainous area.
	   The latest offensive came as the U.N. Security Council prepared
to vote on a resolution which U.S. officials say threatens force
unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic halts the fighting and
begins talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the Serbian
province.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo, and the rebels
are fighting for independence from Serbia, the dominant of two
republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   Serb forces appeared intent on crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army in advance of any internationally demanded peace moves. The
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed that 11 ethnic
Albanian civilians were killed Tuesday.
	   Police prevented reporters from traveling freely through the
Drenica area Wednesday.
	   ``There are still many terrorists there today,'' said the
commander of one Serb police checkpoint near the village of
Vucitrn. ``There will be terrorists there tomorrow and there will
be terrorists there a year from now.''
	   Along the fringes of the area, evidence of conflict was
apparent. Vaganica, a small village three kilometers (1.5 miles)
inside the Drenica area was deserted Wednesday, except for dogs and
abandoned farm animals roaming through the streets.
	   Reporters could hear the thud of distant artillery, but unlike
the day before, no small arms fire.
	   A worker from UNICEF, who refused to give his name, said
refugees were trying to escape Drenica into the town of Kosovska
Mitrovica, northwest of Pristina. He said fighting in recent months
had already driven 20,000 to the homes of relatives or to cramped
quarters in local schools and mosques.
	   Another Western aid worker, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Wednesday that people in Kosovska Mitrovica suburbs already
were packed 100 to a house and any new arrivals would have to camp
in the nearby muddy open fields.
	   Milosevic sent his top ally, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic, to Kosovo on Wednesday. At a meeting with Yugoslav
army commanders, Milutinovic declared that Yugoslavia would defend
its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the official Tanjug news
agency reported.
	   He added that the world should put pressure on Albania because
it provides bases for the ``terrorists'' instead of threatening
Yugoslavia.

Guidi claims third victory, Olano stays top with four stages to go
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALAMANCA, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Fabrizio Guidi of the Polti team
won the 18th stage of the Tour of Spain on Wednesday, his third
victory in the 22-stage cycling marathon. Spaniard Abraham Olano of
the Banesto team remained overall leader.
	   Guidi covered the 223-kilometer (138-mile) flat run from the
northern city of Leon south to Salamanca in 5 hours, 59 minutes and
40 seconds, winning the leg in a sprint finish.
	   The top positions in the overall standings were hardly altered
by the day's racing that took close to one hour longer than the
organizers had predicted.
	   Several breakaway attempts were neutralized, the leaders were
kept together and the pack imposed a relatively relaxed pace until
the final sprint.
	   With four stages to go, Olano remained 22 seconds clear of

Report: Lawyer says fugitive Italian financier will accept
</HEADLINE>
extradition from France &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Fugitive Italian financier Licio Gelli has decided
not to fight extradition from France, his lawyer said Wednesday,
according to the ANSA news agency.
	   Attorney Michele Gentiloni was quoted as saying that the
79-year-old Gelli could be back in Italy within days.
	   He fled in May just as his 12-year prison sentence for bank
fraud was to begin.
	   Police caught up with him earlier this month on the French
Riviera. He has been hospitalized with heart trouble since his
arrest, and Gentiloni said poor health was one reason Gelli had
decided to come home as soon as possible.
	   If he had fought extradition, it could have prolonged his stay
in France for months.
	   ``Knight Commander Licio Gelli, in consideration of his state of
health and for family reasons has decided to accept extradition,''
the lawyer said, according to ANSA.
	   Gelli was once one of Italy's biggest influence peddlers and he
headed the powerful _ and shadowy _ Masonic lodge P-2, which stood
for Propaganda 2. The lodge was exposed in the 1980s and accused of
plotting to install a right-wing dictatorship in Italy.
	   Since Gelli's disappearance, police have found millions of
dollars in gold bars and cash in his villa in Tuscany.
	   He was convicted in the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, then
Italy's largest bank. The collapse touched off a huge financial
scandal for the Vatican because the Vatican Bank owned part of
Ambrosiano.
	   Gelli's jailbreak in May was not his first. He escaped from a
Swiss prison in 1983, a year after his arrest in connection with an
investigation of Propaganda Due. He surrendered in that same city
four years later, and was extradited to Italy in 1988.

Guidi claims third victory, Olano stays top with four stages to go

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore cycle designator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SALAMANCA, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Fabrizio Guidi of the Polti team
won the 18th stage of the Tour of Spain on Wednesday, his third
victory in the 22-stage cycling marathon. Spaniard Abraham Olano of
the Banesto team remained overall leader.
	   Guidi covered the 223-kilometer (138-mile) flat run from the
northern city of Leon south to Salamanca in 5 hours, 59 minutes and
40 seconds, winning the leg in a sprint finish.
	   The top positions in the overall standings were hardly altered
by the day's racing that took close to one hour longer than the
organizers had predicted.
	   Several breakaway attempts were neutralized, the leaders were
kept together and the pack imposed a relatively relaxed pace until
the final sprint.
	   With four stages to go, Olano remained 22 seconds clear of
Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of the ONCE-Deutsche Bank team in the
No. 2 spot. Olano also stayed 31 seconds ahead of his team
colleague from Banesto and fellow Spaniard Jose Maria Jimenez in
third place.
	   Thursday's 19th stage tests the climbing abilities of the pack
once again with a 170.4-kilometer (105.6-mile) run between the

Hamas backers renew vows of revenge over slain fugitives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ About 4,000 supporters of the
radical Islamic group Hamas rallied Wednesday in memory of two of
the group's members slain by Israeli troops earlier this month.
	   ``Revenge, revenge!'' they chanted, while Palestinian police
watched from a distance but did not interfere. ``Allahu akbar _ God
is great!''
	   The demonstrators waved green Islamic flags and large pictures
of Hamas fugitives and brothers Adel and Imad Awadallah, who were
slain Sept. 11 when Israeli troops raided their West Bank hideout.
Both were wanted for attacks on Israel.
	   The rally, staged in a Gaza City refugee camp, was the biggest
Hamas gathering in Gaza in more than a year, since the release of
Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin from Israeli jail last September.
	   Yassin, the group's founder and spiritual leader, addressed the
crowd, telling them, ``We should continue our armed struggle, our
jihad, to face the enemy by all means,'' he said. ``We will follow
our way until victory.''
	   Hamas had threatened to stage attacks and kidnap Israeli
soldiers during the two-day Jewish New Year's holiday, which ended
at sundown Tuesday without incident.
	   Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip before the
holidays in response to threats following the killing of the
Awadallah brothers, but has been gradually easing the closure and
allowing Palestinian workers to begin returning to jobs in Israel.
	   In a leaflet distributed at the rally, Hamas warned that the
danger of attacks had not passed.
	   ``The feeling of insecurity in the Israeli street will remain.
We will make them afraid, because we are going to take revenge in
spite of all challenges,'' said the leaflet, signed by Hamas'
military wing.
	   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has an uneasy relationship
with Hamas, trying to avoid open confrontation but also trying to
meet Israeli demands to crack down on militants.
	   On Wednesday, Palestinian police arrested a leading Islamic
youth activist in Gaza, his family said Thursday. Police did not
confirm the arrest of Ayman Paha, 24, who headed the student
council at Islamic University in Gaza, and no charges were known to
have been brought.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A ruling party official Wednesday ruled
out talks with ex-President Sali Berisha on resolving Albania's
political crisis, but said a meeting with others from Berisha's
opposition party was possible.
	   Petro Koci, secretary of the Socialist Party of Prime Minister
Fatos Nano, said some kind of government shakeup would occur in the
next week in response to two days of rioting last week by Berisha's
supporters that threatened to topple the government in this
impoverished Balkan nation.
	   ``We are ready for dialogue with the Democratic Party, but not
with Berisha,'' Koci told state radio. ``He headed the coup.''
	   Berisha, under criminal investigation for his role in the Sept.
13-14 rioting, which left three people dead, repeated his call for
Nano's resignation at a peaceful rally Wednesday by about 2,000
supporters in the capital's central Skanderbeg Square.
	   ``Nano is ready to kill and imprison the opposition,'' Berisha
said, calling the prime minister a communist-style dictator.
	   Berisha has repeatedly rejected negotiations with Nano's
government, demanding instead that Nano should resign.
	   But criticism from Western powers of his role in the rioting and
small crowds at a series of protests called by Berisha _ none
exceeding 3,000 people so far _ show the former president has
little leverage to force his push for power.
	   Along with warnings of isolation by the West if his supporters
again resort to violence, Berisha also faces possible prosecution
for allegedly trying to overthrow Nano's government.
	   Last week, the Socialist-dominated Parliament voted to lift
Berisha's immunity from arrest, and the public prosecutor announced
he was investigating the rioting.
	   The Democratic Party lost power to Nano's Socialists in
elections last year that followed months of unrest over the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes that wiped out the savings
of many Albanians. Since then, the Democratic Party has rarely
attended Parliament, where it holds 27 of the 155 seats. The
Socialists hold 100 seats.
	   Last week's rioting began the day after popular politician and
top Berisha aide Azem Hajdari was shot to death. Berisha blamed
Nano for the killing, but Western officials say they believe
Hajdari's death was due to a private feud.

Food aid pledged to stave off famine in Zambia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ More than half of rural Zambia is in
urgent need of food aid to avert famine, the government says.
	   The nation of 12 million people faced a serious shortfall in
corn and cereals, the staple foods, because of above normal
rainfall in the north and drought in the south during the last
rainy season, Vice-President Christon Tembo told lawmakers.
	   He said 1.2 million people in 44 of Zambia's 72 districts will
receive 45,000 tons of corn provided by donors and distributed by
the U.N. World Food Program.
	   The European Union also has pledged 12,500 tons of maize being
transported from South Africa, and Italy promised 1,200 tons of
rice, Tembo said in a report to the parliament in Lusaka on
Tuesday.
	   Food aid will be needed for about five months to stave off
famine until the next rain season has settled in, he said. Among
areas facing ``chronic'' food shortages were Mongu, Choma, and
Mazabuka in southern Zambia and Nyimba and Chipata in the east.

Croatia's only independent televised news show shuts down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's only independent televised news
program shut down Wednesday, strangled by insufficient resources
and lack of political will to keep it going.
	   ``It's like writing with a blunt pencil,'' said Tena Perisin,
chief news editor of the network channel TVMreza, which had offered
the only other public option to pro-government news on the three
other channels _ all state run.
	   Only the news program was shutting down for lack of an operating
budget. The station, owned by Nino Pavic, a close ally of Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman, remained on air Wednesday.
	   With Tudjman frequently slammed by foreign leaders for tight
government control of the media, it was in his interest to have a
private news program operating as a way of deflecting such
criticism.
	   But the decision to starve the news program until it was forced
to shut down suggested that its independent reporting ahead of
elections scheduled for early next year was more of a concern to
Tudjman's HDZ party than any fallout from it going off the air.
	   The news staff of 30 was paid rarely and even batteries for tape
recorders were unaffordable, said Perisin. Cameramen had to do
interviews in sunlight because of lack of lighting, and all but one
phone line was disconnected because bills were not paid, she said.
	   TVMreza started a year and half ago and its news program quickly
gained a reputation for serious and objective reporting, despite
chronic lack of funds. More than a quarter of the population tuned
into the channel to watch the evening news.
	   TVMreza is owned by Europa Press Holding, controlled by Pavic.
Tudjman has often drawn international condemnation for keeping a
tight grip on media.
	   ``It seems that the existence of a popular, independent,
alternative news program is not in someone's interest,'' Perisin
hinted, suggesting that the program was starved of funds, after its
staff started taking its mandate to report objectively seriously.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Police arrested seven men Wednesday in an
anti-terrorist operation, following a joint intelligence operation
with the national intelligence agency, MI5.
	   Scotland Yard released no names and said nothing about what the
men were suspected of doing. However, the British news agency Press
Association said it was understood that the operation was aimed at
associates of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident who has been
linked to the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Armed officers were not involved in making the arrests, which
were made at daybreak Wednesday at seven homes, police said.
Another premises was also being searched, police said.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council is demanding a
cease-fire in Kosovo and threatening further action if the violence
continues in the Yugoslav province, where tens of thousands of
refugees face a desperate winter.
	   A draft of a resolution expected to be adopted Wednesday doesn't
specifically authorize NATO forces to stop the Serb offensive on
ethnic Albanian separatists. But countries such as the United
States have said such authorization isn't necessary for military
intervention.
	   The United States has asked the NATO governing body to begin
rounding up commitments from NATO countries to contribute to a
possible multinational force, two senior U.S. officials said
Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   NATO defense ministers were to meet Thursday in Vilamoura,
Portugal to discuss Kosovo. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said the meeting ``is a last step in planning, not the first step
in deciding'' whether to intervene.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will continue to seek financial assistance
from abroad while pursuing free-market reforms to combat the crisis
in its economy, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday.
	   Primakov has been calling on international lenders to help
Russia through its crisis, but without a clear-cut plan of action,
it appears unlikely that any funds will be forthcoming.
	   At a meeting with Horst Koehler, the visiting head of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Primakov said
Russia needed help to rebuild its economy.
	   Primakov, who has been in office for 12 days and has yet to
outline his economic program or fill several key cabinet posts,
said Russia would continue economic reforms, but their
implementation will be ``considerably adjusted.''
	   The prime minister said for Russia to overcome the crisis, his
government needs foreign support, ``both in the form of
consultations and financial backing.''
	   The EBRD, established in 1991 to help countries in Eastern
Europe move toward market economies, has provided loans to a number
of Russian industries.
	   Koehler, without making any firm commitment, said the bank was
prepared to invest further in Russia if the government takes
``resolute'' moves to stabilize the economy and restore investors'
confidence.
	   Many private investors have fled Russia in recent months, and
foreign banks that bought billions of dollars of government bonds
have complained that they are being discriminated against while the
government tries to bail out Russian banks.
	   Lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund, are expected
to delay installments on existing loans at least until the new
government details its plans for coping with the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, there has been no serious talk of new loans to Russia
by the IMF or anyone else.
	   Russian officials were planning to hold separate talks with a
visiting IMF delegation, as well as discussions with Western banks
seeking better terms on debt restructuring deals.
	   Russia's banking system has been virtually paralyzed by the
crisis, which hit just over a month ago. Some banks remain closed,
while others are handling only limited transactions. Most
individual and corporate clients still cannot make routine payments
and transfers.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov blamed the current crisis on bad
advice from the IMF to reform the economy on monetarist principles.
	   ``This led to the absence of a customs policy, tax juggling,
robbing of companies, unrestrained lending rates of commercial
banks and impossible energy tariffs,'' he said at a meeting with
Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger.
	   The privatization program of earlier governments ``robbed the
nation'' and put property in the hands of people unable to manage
them, Luzhkov said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin said Wednesday that a
new finance minister was expected to be named Thursday, and that
the government plans to present a ``revolutionary'' tax reform plan
to parliament soon.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, in a telephone conversation with French
President Jacques Chirac, said the government was working on a plan
to stabilize the economy, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Chirac voiced full support for Yeltsin and the anti-crisis
efforts, the report said.
	   Russian stocks ended lower Wednesday in light trading. The
Russian Trading System Index dropped 4 percent to close at 47.65
points, down from 49.65 on Tuesday.
	   The official ruble rate remained at about 16 to the U.S. dollar,
but was being exchanged at rates as high as 13 to the dollar at
currency exchanges on the street.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Authorities clamped down Wednesday
on the wife of the country's imprisoned opposition leader in their
drive to stifle any further challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's 17-year-rule.
	   Azizah Ismail was questioned about her role in the reform
movement headed by her husband, former Malaysian deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar was arrested Sunday, amid some of the biggest upheaval in
this country's four decades of independence. The arrest alarmed
many foreign leaders.
	   Azizah, designated by her husband to carry on the opposition
movement after his arrest, was accompanied by two lawyers for the
interrogation at police headquarters.
	   Several hours later she said a new police order under the
Internal Security Act prohibits her from speaking at rallies or
gatherings even at her house.
	   Azizah told reporters that only family members, relatives and
close friends could visit the house and that Anwar's supporters
were totally prohibited from entering the premises.
	   ``The police have been very hard on her and on me as a
counsel,'' said one of her lawyers, Uthaya Kuma. He did not give
details of the interrogation.
	   The reform movement picked up steam after Azizah's husband was
ousted from the No. 2 spot in the government earlier this month.
	   ``I don't have to do a lot ... the reform (movement) has started
in the hearts of the people,'' she said.

Scuffles break out at headquarters of Egyptian leftist party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; ADDS shots reportedly fired, 1 wounded, grafs 2-3; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A large fist fight broke out Wednesday at
the headquarters of an Egyptian leftist party over a leadership
election, police officials said.
	   Egypt's official Middle East News Agency said several shots were
fired during the scuffles between supporters of rival leaders of
the al-Ahrar Socialist Party, and one man was wounded in the hand.
	   The report could not be confirmed late Wednesday with the
police, whose officials earlier told The Associated Press that two
men were slightly injured in the fist fight.
	   Police called in scores of officers to quell the fighting among
some 250 party members and hired thugs in the al-Ahrar offices in
downtown Cairo, the officials said.
	   The clashes began after Talaat Sadat, nephew of the late
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, stormed the party headquarters with
his followers, demanding to run in the election. Sadat had been
barred from the polls, which were triggered by the death of the
party's leader last month.
	   A leading candidate, Ragab Hamadeh, retaliated by calling in
about 200 thugs to throw Sadat out, said the police officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The al-Ahrar party, which was founded in 1975, calls for greater
political freedom, worker's rights, and the abolition of the state
of emergency, which has been in force since Sadat's assassination
in 1981.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian miners will participate in a national day
of protest on Oct. 7 by staging a one-day strike, a news agency
reported Wednesday.
	   Miners have not been paid for six months and workers at some
enterprises have not recieved salaries for eight or nine months,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The miners are owed at least 3.2 billion rubles (dlrs 200
million) in back wages, the report said.
	   Trade unions have organized the Oct. 7 protest with Communists
and other hardliners. Labor groups have held an annual protest day
in October in recent years.

Poll shows German election race still close
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl and rival Gerhard
Schroeder remained locked in a tight race just four days before
national elections, according to a poll published Wednesday.
	   Schroeder's Social Democrats would receive 41.1 percent of
Sunday's vote, compared to 36.1 percent for Kohl's party of
Christian Democrats.
	   The poll of 1,600 people, published in the conservative
Frankfurter Allgemeine daily newspaper, did not give a margin of
error. But polls of this size usually have a margin of error of
plus or minus 3 percentage points.
	   The environmental Greens party would get 7 percent of the vote,
according to the poll, and the Free Democratic Party, the junior
partner in Kohl's government coalition, would get 6.5 percent,
passing the 5 percent hurdle needed to remain in parliament.
	   East Germany's former communists, the Party of Democratic
Socialism, received 4.7 percent, with other smaller parties lumped
together at 4.6 percent.
	   As campaigning entered its final days, Kohl did damage control
Wednesday by reassuring voters his party does not plan to increase
value-added tax on consumer products.
	   Claudia Nolte, Kohl's minister for family issues, recently said
a sales tax increase made sense because it would draw more revenue
from the wealthy. She later said she had slipped up and denied the
party was discussing such a move.
	   Kohl, in an interview with national TV station ZDF, said Nolte
merely had said some ``dumb stuff'' in the heat of a discussion.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who
has the power to send financial markets soaring or plummeting with
a few well chosen words, could be getting ready Wednesday to tell
investors what they want to hear most _ that the Fed will cut U.S.
interest rates to fight a widening global financial crisis.
	   Wall Street got off to a strong start Wednesday in anticipation
of Greenspan's appearance. Hopes that he would give investors some
indication of what Fed policy-makers will do next week pushed the
Dow Jones industrial average up by more than 100 points and had it
hovering around 8,000 at midday.
	   Expectations of such a move were heightened Tuesday by comments
of William McDonough, president of the New York regional Fed bank.
``The balance of risk has shifted from one of concern about
inflation to one of concern about inadequate growth,'' said
McDonough.
	   ``I can assure you that as I go into that meeting I will
continue to be very aware of potential weakness in our economy,''
McDonough told reporters after a speech in London, referring to
next Tuesday's closed-door discussions by the Federal Open Market
Committee, the group of Fed governors and regional bank presidents
who set interest rate policies.
	   If the FOMC does move interest rates, it is possible Greenspan
will signal such a change in remarks today before the Senate Budget
Committee.
	   The Fed has not changed interest rates since March 1997 and
Greenspan in the past has liked to put financial markets on notice
of an impending change in Fed policy.
	   At present, however, markets are perplexed. In a Sept. 4 speech
delivered at the University of California at Berkeley, Greenspan
warned that ``it is not credible that the United States can remain
an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing
greatly increased stress.''
	   Greenspan went on to say that the central bank had switched from
being worried about too-much growth in the United States triggering
inflation to being more concerned about the financial turmoil
overseas, which at the time of his speech had moved from Asia to
Russia and was threatening Latin America.
	   While he didn't promise any rate cuts or give any hint to
possible timing, the mere fact that he was expressing growing
concern about financial turmoil was enough to propel the Dow Jones
industrial average to a 381-point gain on the first trading day
after his comments, the biggest one-day point increase in history.
	   But one week ago, Greenspan sent markets in the opposite
direction when in an appearance before the House Banking Committee
he deflated expectations of coordinated interest rate cuts among
the world's seven largest economies. His comments sent the Dow
plunging Thursday by 216 points following huge drops in Tokyo and
other overseas markets because of disappointment that the Fed will
not soon act.
	   Lower U.S. interest rates would help a number of countries
struggling to defend their currencies by lowering the value of the
U.S. dollar on global markets. The lower U.S. rates would also
bolster global confidence by assuring foreign businesses that the
Fed stood ready to insure that U.S. growth would continue to serve
as an economic engine for the rest of the world.
	   Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities in New York,
said that he believed the possibility of a Fed rate cut at
Tuesday's meeting was growing just because the situation in Latin
America, where Brazil is struggling to defend its currency, is
growing more tenuous since Russia's botched devaluation of the
ruble last month.
	   Brazil is the largest economy in a region of the world that
takes one-third of U.S. exports.
	   ``The most obvious thing the United States could do (to help
faltering economies overseas) would be to cut interest rates,''
Moran told a conference on the Asian crisis sponsored by the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
	   But he and other economists said the central bank may still be
reluctant to move at next week's meeting. With the U.S. labor
market still tight, despite growing layoffs in manufacturing
because of a falloff in Asian exports, many analysts believe the
Fed may want to wait until its November or December meeting before
deciding whether a U.S. rate cut is warranted.

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Civil defense authorities evacuated about 167,000
people from their homes in eastern Cuba on Wednesday as Hurricane
Georges bore down on the island after lashing neighboring Haiti.
	   Heavy rains began soaking Cuba's southeastern coast early
Wednesday. Civil defense teams evacuated people from flood-prone
areas in the eastern provinces of Guantanamo, Holguin, Santiago and
Camaguey, according to news reports.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro put his ministers on alert
Wednesday to brace for the hurricane.
	   Volunteers on Wednesday also wrapped up work helping farmers
harvest coffee and other remaining crops, and evacuate livestock
from low-lying areas, the reports said.
	   Concerns about possible hurricane damage were especially acute
in eastern Cuba, which is suffering from a severe drought.
	   A hurricane warning was in effect from Sancti Spiritus province
eastward _ half of the island.
	   Georges was expected to strike Cuba on Wednesday afternoon,
probably making landfall on the southeastern coast of Guantanamo
province, officials said. From there, the hurricane was expected to
travel north across the island.
	   Castro made a surprise visit to the National Institute of
Meteorology on Wednesday, and said his government was ready for any
emergency.
	   ``We know what to do in any of the cases or variants of the
trajectory that Georges is following,'' the Mexican government news
agency Notimex quoted Castro as saying.
	   ``I also gave instructions not to do anything hasty, because
there is time and we have planned everything,'' the president
added.
	   Castro said that the armed forces would help get medicine, food
and other help to hurricane victims after Georges passes. He also
offered to send Cuban doctors to neighboring nations that needed
them.

Poll: One-third of Russians say dictatorship is only solution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to include number polled, other information

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One third of Russians believe the president should
have ``supreme power,'' and that dictatorship is the only way out
of the current economic crisis, according to a poll released
Wednesday.
	   Those polled named former Gen. Alexander Lebed as the most
likely person to establish a dictatorship, according to the
Interfax news agency, which reported on the poll.
	   The nationwide poll was conducted among 2,400 Russians last
weekend by the National Public Opinion Center, which said it had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The report
did not say how the respondents were contacted.
	   The poll findings correspond to a common perception that many
Russians yearn for strong _ and even dictatorial _ leadership to
solve the country's deep problems. When he was acting prime
minister earlier this month, Viktor Chernomyrdin explicitly warned
that the country was in danger of lurching into fascism.
	   Thirty-three percent of those polled said the Russian president
should have ``supreme power,'' the pollsters said, while 34 percent
said the establishment of a dictatorship was the only solution to
the economic crisis.
	   Forty-five percent disagreed that a dictatorship was the only
solution; 21 percent were undecided.
	   Asked who is most likely to establish a dictatorship, 19 percent
named Lebed, the governor of the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk.
Lebed, a nationalist, says he strongly believes in the democratic
process.
	   Fourteen percent said the communists and their allies were the
most likely dictators, and 8 percent said they thought a military
dictatorship was most likely.
	   Only 18 percent said they thought nobody could establish a
dictatorship, and 23 percent were undecided.

Guatemala fears rain, humidity will damage coffee crop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Flooding and infrastructure damage in
Guatemala's northeastern coffee-producing region will hurt the
upcoming coffee harvest, the Guatemalan Coffee Association said
Wednesday.
	   The associated estimated that 20 hectares (50 acres) of coffee
have been lost and warned that high humidity levels were increasing
fungal infections at plantations, which could affect both the
1998-99 harvest and that of the following season.
	   The heavy rain and flooding that devastated Mexico's chief
coffee-producing state of Chiapas also hit the low-altitude San
Marcos area, across the border in Guatemala.
	   Plantations on higher ground haven't been affected, the
association said in a press release. A number of coffee plantations
were swept away by flooding, and several communities have been cut
off since Sept. 7 by washed-out roads and bridges.
	   The association said the area received 1.2 meters of rain in
Sept. 5-10, 25 percent of a normal year's amount. However, the rain
wasn't strong enough to cause significant falls of the ripening
fruit, and serious damage wasn't expected.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Colombian state
workers went on strike Wednesday to protest President Andres
Pastrana's austerity program, paralyzing the judicial system and
cancelling school for millions of children.
	   The 48-hour strike was called by Colombia's leading labor
federations, chiefly to demand salary increases commensurate with
projected 18 percent inflation. Pastrana's two-month-old government
says it will limit the increases to a maximum of 14 percent,
arguing that the country's financial predicament demands spending
cuts.
	   ``The Colombian people know that we are doing all we can to
reactivate the economy,'' Pastrana said during a news conference in
New York in which he asked workers to have patience.
``Unfortunately in the economic realm the results aren't always
seen overnight.''
	   No essential services were halted by the strike, in which
900,000 workers were called to participate. Telecommunications, oil
production and hospital emergency services were unaffected.
	   National Workers Federation leader Wilson Borja said that in
addition to the wage demand, unions want the government to keep
interest rates low and to abandon a plan to introduce a 15 percent
sales tax on some basic food items.
	   Labor Minister Hernando Yepes Arcila called the protest
``premature and unjust,'' adding that ``the policies being carried
out by the government are not capricious.''
	   The comptroller general, Carlos Ossa, went further, proposing a
wage freeze for the public and private sector.
	   In the central oil refining city of Barrancabermeja, 265
kilometers (165 miles) north of Bogota, rebels of the National
Liberation Army called an ``armed strike'' in solidarity with the
unionists, threatening to destroy any vehicles traveling on the
region's highways.

Last-minute negotiations fail to save Philippine Airlines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines, the oldest
carrier in Asia, is closing its doors after last-minute
negotiations failed to persuade its largest union to accept a
recovery plan.
	   The closure of PAL late Wednesday leaves many areas of the
7,000-island Philippine archipelago without air service. Two
smaller carriers were grounded last week over safety concerns and
financial problems.
	   PAL had said it would shut down unless workers accepted the
rescue plan, which it said was a prerequisite for recovering from a
series of crippling strikes and Asia's currency crisis.
	   PAL is the largest Philippine company to fail since Asia's
currency crisis, which hit just as the airline was launching a dlrs
4 billion expansion and refleeting plan.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said its closure should
serve as a lesson on the need for management and labor to work
harmoniously together, something which eluded PAL for years.
	   ``It's sad that a national symbol, an institution is going
under. But we have to run these symbols substantially well because
if not, they will not last long,'' he said.
	   Hours before its scheduled midnight closure, PAL resumed talks
with its ground workers' union after it agreed to partially accept
the management plan. But after several hours of negotiations, PAL
said it could not accept the union's conditions.
	   ``It is unfortunate that no agreement was reached,'' said PAL
executive vice president Manolo Aquino. ``Therefore it is with a
sad note that we announce the closure of Philippine Airlines.''
	   PAL's demise saddened many Filipinos. Several television
stations broadcast poignant scenes Wednesday from its 57-year
history. At PAL offices around the country, airline workers held
masses and prayer rallies, hoping for a way to avoid the flag
carrier's closure.
	   At Manila's airport, scores of employees, many dressed in black
and carrying signs reading ``Keep PAL flying,'' held a prayer vigil
in front of the domestic terminal.
	   The government, meanwhile, struggled to prepare for the impact
of a shutdown on the country's already ailing economy.
	   PAL had a 50 percent share of domestic passenger traffic, down
from 75 percent before a pilots' strike in June.
	   The only alternative for travel among the country's islands is
slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries. Last Friday, a ferry carrying
454 people sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila.
	   PAL was founded on Feb. 26, 1941, by a group of businessmen who
wanted to profit from a gold mining boom in the northern
Philippines. The first flight carried five passengers from Manila
to the northern mountain city of Baguio.
	   In July 1946, four chartered PAL planes took American servicemen
home from the Philippines, making PAL the first Asian airline to
cross the Pacific.

Siemens forms fund for Nazi slave laborers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs, ADDS dlr to mark rate in graf 5, removes extra

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Following Volkswagen's lead, Siemens announced
plans Wednesday for a 20 million mark (dlrs 12 million) fund to
compensate former slave laborers forced to work for the company by
the Nazis during World War II.
	   The electronics giant, along with VW, is one of several German
businesses under pressure from lawsuits in the United States and
threats of more at home from Nazi-era victims.
	   Volkswagen last week became the first of these firms to agree to
victim payments when it announced its own 20 million mark fund, a
change of heart after arguing for years that it had no legal duty
to pay back wages for labor forced on it by the Nazi war machine.
	   Siemens had a similar change of heart: Almost a year ago, at its
150th anniversary celebrations, the company had insisted it could
do no more for its former slave laborers than express ``deepest
regrets.''
	   The Munich-based Siemens said its fund is in addition to the 7.2
million marks (dlrs 4.3 million) it paid to the Jewish Claims
Conference in 1961 and to providing humanitarian help for victims.
Siemens estimates that between 10,000 and 20,000 slave laborer
worked in its wartime factories.
	   Other firms that used slave labor during World War II also have
donated to Jewish groups; Daimler gave 20 million marks (dlrs 11
million) and Krupp, the steel and engineering group, said it
provided 10 million marks (dlrs 5.5 million) in 1959.
	   But the threat of lawsuits has raised the pressure on German
firms to pay direct claims to the thousands of concentration camp
inmates, mostly Jews, forced to work in their factories.
	   Lawyers representing former slave laborers criticized Siemens,
as they did Volkswagen, for setting up a fund to avoid larger
payments a lawsuit might demand.
	   Siemens is seeking ``the cheapest alternative,'' said Munich
attorney Michael Witti, who filed the U.S. lawsuit with his New
York-based colleague Ed Fagan. ``We will find justice for these
people in the end.''
	   Along with Siemens and Volkswagen, Krupp, Daimler-Benz, Audi and
BMW are named in a New York lawsuit seeking a portion of company
profits for thousands of former slave laborers.
	   Recently some of Germany's biggest firms suggested they'd be
willing to contribute to a publicly administered fund, but
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has rejected any government involvement.
	   It is a long-running dispute: Companies say the current
government, as successor to the Nazi regime, should handle
compensation for slave laborers. But the government, which has paid
billions in compensation for health damage and imprisonment, argues
the companies are responsible for back wage claims.
	   An organization separate from Siemens will manage its fund, the
company said in a statement. It gave no further details other than
that the money will be distributed quickly and without a lot of red
tape.

French foreign minister says Iraq no longer a threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After seven years of intense and intrusive
U.N. arms inspections, Iraq's capabilities to threaten its
neighbors are virtually non-existant, France's foreign minister
said Wednesday.
	   ``It's a broken country in that respect,'' Hubert Vedrine told
reporters. ``So what's at stake is its capacity to rebuild ... to
become a threat.''
	   He called for a ``sense of proportion,'' when viewing Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions demanding it destroy its weapons
of mass destruction.
	   His comments, made ahead of his address to the General Assembly,
come at a time when U.N. inspections have been paralyzed because of
Baghdad's Aug. 5 decision to stop working with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   They also came as chemical weapons experts were arriving at the
United Nations to report on tests conducted by Swiss and French
labs on missile parts suspected of having traces of the deadly VX
agent.
	   A U.S. lab found traces of the gas, but preliminary and
unofficial results from the European laboratories are inconclusive,
diplomats say.
	   Iraq has said it tried to produce the chemical agent but was
never able to make enough of it, or stabilize it properly, to load
it into missile warheads.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles to deliver them _ before the Security Council will lift
crippling sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990,
touching off the Gulf war.
	   France, along with Russia and China, has generally taken a more
sympathetic view toward Iraq in council discussions, and has pushed
to switch the inspections of Iraq's nuclear weapons program to a
less intrusive ongoing monitoring phase.
	   In his speech to the assembly, Vedrine said Iraq must comply
with U.N. resolutions calling for the ``controlled dismantlement''
of its weapons of mass destruction _ and nothing more _ before
sanctions will be lifted.
	   ``Once that objective is achieved, our aim must be to re-insert
Iraq into the international community,'' he said.
	   ``The only way to achieve that end is by Iraq's complete
compliance with the relevant resolutions: all the resolutions,
nothing but the resolutions,'' he said.
	   France is keen to see sanctions lifted so French firms can begin
developing Iraq's vast oil fields.
	   In his comments to reporters, Vedrine sought to downplay
differences with the United States over how to deal with Iraq's
disarmament, saying ``there is no conceptual disagreement with the
U.S. on this.''
	   ``There may be differences in details,'' he said, but the
differences are slight.

Yugoslav officials shrug off threats, advance into rebel stronghold

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Serb casualty report, Rugova calls for
international intervention; Serb president says Yugoslavia ready to
defend its sovereignty; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAGANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces drove deeper into the
heartland of the ethnic Albanian rebellion Wednesday in a defiant
show of power as world leaders edged closer to intervening to stop
the bloodshed.
	   Serb artillery boomed in the west and east of the Drenica region
of central Kosovo, threatening up to 20,000 civilians who had fled
their homes and were believed to be trapped by the fighting.
	   Thousands of Serb police, Yugoslav soldiers and armed Serb
civilians, many of them teen-agers, patrolled nearly all routes
into the Drenica region Wednesday, tightening a noose on several
hundred lightly armed rebels who built a network of trenches and
sandbag bunkers in the mountainous area.
	   The latest offensive came as the U.N. Security Council prepared
to vote on a resolution demanding that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic halt the fighting and begin talks with ethnic Albanians
on the future of the Serbian province.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the main Albanian political
figure, Ibrahim Rugova, appealed again Wednesday for world leaders
to ``intervene to stop the Serbian offensive.''
	   But Serbia's president, Milan Milutinovic, said during a visit
to Kosovo that his government ``is not threatening anyone'' and was
prepared ``to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.''
	   Serb forces appeared intent on crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army in advance of any internationally demanded peace moves. The
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed that 11 ethnic
Albanian civilians were killed Tuesday. Serb sources said three
police were killed and five wounded in Tuesday's fighting.
	   Police prevented reporters from traveling freely through the
Drenica area Wednesday. ``There are still many terrorists there
today,'' said the commander of one Serb police checkpoint near the
village of Vucitrn. ``There will be terrorists there tomorrow and
there will be terrorists there a year from now.''
	   Along the fringes of the area, evidence of conflict was
apparent. Vaganica, a small village in the Drenica area, was
deserted Wednesday, except for dogs and abandoned farm animals
roaming the streets.
	   Reporters could hear the thud of distant artillery, but unlike
the day before, no small arms fire, indicating Serbs were softening
up resistance.
	   A worker from the UNICEF, who refused to give his name, said
refugees from Drenica were trying to escape to the town of Kosovska
Mitrovica, northwest of Pristina.
	   Another Western aid worker, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Wednesday that people in Kosovska Mitrovica already were
packed 100 to a house, and new arrivals would have to camp in muddy
open fields nearby.
	   ``If there are any more refugees, we just can't handle it
here,'' said the worker.
	   At a meeting with Yugoslav army commanders, Milutinovic declared
that Yugoslavia would defend its sovereignty and territorial
integrity, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
	   He added that the world should put pressure on Albania because
it provides bases for the ``terrorists'' instead of threatening
Yugoslavia.
	   Meanwhile, Serbia's crackdown on Kosovo has been a costly one,
according to media reports Wednesday.
	   Yugoslav national bank governor Dusan Vlatkovic was quoted as
saying that the bank had to print extra money to cover the costs of
the clashes in Kosovo. Independent economists say the turmoil costs
Yugoslavia about dlrs 1.1 million a day.
	   The country is already faced with an estimated 30 percent
monthly inflation, unemployment of nearly 50 percent and shortages
of staples like cooking oil, sugar and milk.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Wednesday that a widening foreign financial crisis will require
policymakers to be ``especially sensitive to the deepening signs of
global distress,'' but he stopped short of promising to immediately
reduce U.S. interest rates.
	   In widely anticipated testimony, Greenspan told Congress there
was no doubt the currency crisis that began 14 months ago in
Thailand has entered a new ``more virulent phase'' with the
collapse last month of the Russian economy.
	   He said Fed policymakers were closely watching developments, but
gave no indication that they were prepared to reduce interest rates
when they meet Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Manila's television stations played
John Denver's ``Leaving on a Jet Plane'' as Filipinos bid a sad
farewell Wednesday to Philippine Airlines, Asia's oldest airline.
	   Flight attendants cried as they hugged each other on their last
flights, while passengers who once derided PAL as standing for
``Plane Always Late'' turned nolstalgic.
	   At midnight, PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino
announced the collapse of talks with the airlines' largest union on
a compromise to save the ailing company.
	   Earlier in the day, scores of PAL employees, many of them
dressed in black, held a prayer vigil to ``Keep PAL flying'' at the
domestic airport. In PAL offices around the country, staffers held
Masses and shared farewell dinners.
	   The last domestic flight of the 57-year-old airline arrived in
Manila from the central city of Cebu. A few minutes later PAL's
last international flight left Manila for San Francisco.
	   ``I never thought that I would be flying the last flight,''
Capt. Alfredo Magbanua told GMA 7 television. ``I don't feel good
about it.''
	   Magbanua asked his passengers to pray for the ``resurrection''
of the airline so that ``once more we can see the colors of this
airline flying high in our skies and also in the world.''
	   One tearful ground worker said she was happy working for the
company, her first job.
	   ``No matter what they say about Philippine Airlines, it gave us
pride, even if they said it was always late ... I love this
company,'' she said.
	   GMA 7 anchorman Mike Enriquez bid ``good-bye to Philippine
Airlines'' at the close of the station's late evening news
broadcast.
	   ``It will be rough and it will be difficult,'' he said. ``But
this is the Philippines and we Filipinos have shown the world and
more importantly ourselves that the harder we fall the higher we
rise.''

on the U.S. economy will force the Fed to cut interest rates before

further evidence of a U.S. slowdown will be needed for the central

balance of risk has shifted from one of concern about inflation to
one of concern about inadequate growth,'' said McDonough.

the U.S. economy were increasing, noting in particular big declines
over the past month in stock prices, but he said that so far all
the market turmoil has not ``produced any significant weakness in

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ailing Philippine Airlines, the
oldest carrier in Asia, announced its closure Wednesday after
last-minute negotiations failed to persuade its largest union to
accept a recovery plan.
	   The closure leaves many areas of the 7,000-island Philippine
archipelago without air service. Two smaller carriers were grounded
last week over safety concerns and financial problems.
	   PAL had said it would close at midnight Wednesday unless workers
accepted the rescue plan, which it said was a prerequisite for
recovering from a series of crippling strikes and Asia's currency
crisis.
	   PAL is the largest Philippine company to fail since Asia's
currency crisis, which hit just as the airline was launching a dlrs
4 billion expansion and refleeting plan.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said its closure should
serve as a lesson on the need for management and labor to work
harmoniously together, something that eluded PAL for years.
	   ``It's sad that a national symbol, an institution is going
under. But we have to run these symbols substantially well because
if not, they will not last long,'' he said.
	   Hours before its scheduled midnight closure, PAL resumed talks
with its ground workers' union after it agreed to partially accept
the management plan.
	   But after several hours of negotiations PAL said it could not
accept the conditions attached by the union to the plan.
	   ``It is unfortunate that no agreement was reached,'' said PAL
executive vice president Manolo Aquino. ``Therefore it is with a
sad note that we announce the closure of Philippine Airlines.''
	   PAL's demise saddened many Filipinos. Several television
stations broadcast poignant scenes Wednesday from its 57-year
history.
	   At PAL offices around the country, airline workers held masses
and prayer rallies, hoping for a way to avoid the flag carrier's
closure.
	   At Manila's airport, scores of employees, many dressed in black
and carrying signs reading ``Keep PAL flying,'' held a prayer vigil
in front of the domestic terminal.
	   The government, meanwhile, struggled to prepare for the impact
of the airline shutdown on the country's already ailing economy.
	   Under the failed rescue plan, PAL chairman Lucio Tan offered
workers 20 percent of the airline's stock and three seats on its
board in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement.
	   Tan holds a 70 percent stake in the airline, while the
government owns about 18 percent.
	   The union said it would agree to the suspension if PAL accepted
an annual review of salary structures, retention of all current
benefits, security of tenure, and a halt to spin-off companies.
	   The airline says creditors, to whom it owes dlrs 2.1 billion,
had insisted on guarantees of labor harmony before they approved a
restructuring plan.
	   PAL had a 50 percent share of domestic passenger traffic, down
from 75 percent before a pilots' strike in June.
	   The only alternative for travel among the country's islands is
slow, often-unreliable ocean ferries. Last Friday, a ferry carrying
454 people sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila.
	   PAL was founded on Feb. 26, 1941, by a group of businessmen who
wanted to profit from a gold mining boom in the northern
Philippines. The first flight carried five passengers from Manila
to the northern mountain city of Baguio.
	   In July 1946, four chartered PAL planes took American servicemen
home from the Philippines, making PAL the first Asian airline to
cross the Pacific.

	   Greenspan also noted that labor markets in the U.S. economy
remain tight and hourly compensation is continuing to grow more
rapidly, but he said there is no evidence yet that inflation is
getting out of hand. And he cautioned that ``looking forward, the
restraining effects of recent developments on the U.S. economy are
likely to intensify.''
	   Greenspan repeated remarks that the increasing risks to the U.S.
economy had prompted the Fed in August to change its policy
directive from one leaning toward increasing interest rates to
fight inflation to a neutral stance.
	   And since that time, Greenspan said Wednesday, ``Deteriorating
foreign economies and their spillover to domestic markets have
increased the possibility that the slowdown in growth of the
American economy will be more than sufficient to hold inflation in
check.''

Scuffles break out at headquarters of Egyptian leftist party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Confirms shots fired via party newspaper; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Shots were fired Wednesday in a brawl
involving a nephew of the late President Anwar Sadat at the
headquarters of an Egyptian leftist party.
	   Egypt's official Middle East News Agency and an official of the
party's newspaper said several shots were fired during scuffles
between supporters of rival leaders of the al-Ahrar Socialist
Party.
	   MENA reported one man was wounded in the hand. An official of
the Al-Ahrar daily, who refused to give his name, declined to say
whose supporters had opened fire or give further details.
	   No police spokesman was available late Wednesday to comment on
the shooting, but earlier police officials had told The Associated
Press that two men were slightly injured in the fist fight.
	   Police called in scores of officers to quell the fighting among
some 250 party members and hired thugs in the al-Ahrar offices in
downtown Cairo, the officials said.
	   The clashes began after Talaat Sadat, nephew of the former
president, stormed the party headquarters with his followers,
demanding to run in the election. Sadat had been barred from the
polls, which were triggered by the death of the party's leader last
month.
	   A leading candidate, Ragab Hamadeh, retaliated by calling in
about 200 thugs to throw Sadat out, said the police officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The al-Ahrar party, which was founded in 1975, calls for greater
political freedom, worker's rights, and the abolition of the state
of emergency, which has been in force since Sadat's assassination
in 1981.

Policemen charged after death of Nigerian deportee

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The government's asylum policy and
Interior Minister Louis Tobback came under severe criticism
Wednesday after a Nigerian woman died following a struggle with
police trying to deport her. Two policemen were charged with
assault.
	   A few dozen demonstrators were able to force their way into the
Belgian senate, shouting Tobback was a ``murderer'' and calling on
him to resign. Tobback said he would consider stepping down only if
it was proven the police force made errors.
	   ``I will take full responsibility for what occurred,'' he said.
``What will happen over the coming days, I will decide for
myself.''
	   The government and judicial authorities are investigating
Tuesday's incident at Brussels international airport. Police tried
to subdue Semira Adamu by putting a pillow on her face as she
resisted efforts to strap her into a seat on a Togo-bound plane.
	   As passengers looked on, Ms. Adamu, 20, struggled, then fell
into a coma. She was taken to hospital where she died hours later
of a brain hemorrhage.
	   Ms. Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed that
her family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already
has three wives. Belgium argued that was not grounds for refugee
status.
	   Police had tried to deport Ms. Adamu six times.
	   Politicians from the ruling center-left coalition and the
opposition called for reform of asylum procedures and many
expressed outrage that the use of a pillow to subdue recalcitrant
asylum seekers was standard practice.
	   ``The asylum policy has to be humane,'' said Senator Bert
Anciaux, chairman of the opposition ID21 party.
	   Judicial authorities interrogated three policemen who were
involved in the deportation attempt and charged two with assault
and battery without the intent to kill. They were detained for
several hours and then released.
	   Adamu's death led to angry protests by sympathizers outside the
home of Tobback in Leuven, 16 kilometers (10 miles) east of
Brussels, and the national parliament, where some 150 demonstrators
shouted ``Tobback murderer.''
	   A few of them broke into the building where Tobback was
preparing for a press conference.
	   Tobback said he regretted the incident but added first reports
indicated that police were not acting illegally as Ms. Adamu had
exhausted her appeals against an expulsion order.
	   Nevertheless, he said, ``What happened is one of the blackest
days in my political career.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International condemned the
asylum laws.
	   ``The death of Semira is part of a series of complaints and is
the results of several new laws to get asylum in Belgium,'' said AI
spokeswoman Joelle Noel.
	   Some 4,000 people whose asylum requests were turned down by the
Belgian authorities were repatriated last year. Some 300 needed
police escorts.

	   In his Sept. 4 speech at the University of California at
Berkeley, Greenspan said: ``It is not credible that the United
States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that
is experiencing greatly increased stress.''
	   Those comments and the promise they offered of rate cuts down
the road were enough to boost the Dow Jones industrial average by
381 points, its biggest one-day point gain ever.
	   One week ago, Greenspan sent markets in the opposite direction
when in an appearance before the House Banking Committee he
deflated expectations of coordinated interest rate cuts among the
world's seven largest economies. His comments sent the Dow plunging
the next day, Thursday, by 216 points following huge drops in Tokyo
and other overseas markets because of disappointment that the Fed
would not soon act.
	   Lower U.S. interest rates would help a number of countries
struggling to defend their currencies by lowering the value of the
U.S. dollar on global markets. The lower U.S. rates would also
bolster global confidence by assuring foreign businesses that the
Fed stood ready to insure that U.S. growth would continue to serve
as an economic engine for the rest of the world.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ As the body count grows, South
Africa faces mounting opposition at home to its use of force to
quell unrest in neighboring Lesotho.
	   The images of battle contrast with the new South Africa's role
as a conciliatory, non-interventionist voice on the continent after
years of military aggression under white rule.
	   As newspapers on Wednesday splashed bloody pictures of dead
South African soldiers on their front pages, opposition parties in
Parliament condemned the military move as unnecessary and costly in
lives and money.
	   At least 10 South African soldiers died in fighting at one
barracks alone, a senior officer in Maseru said, though the
military command in Pretoria gave a death toll of eight for the
whole operation.
	   Mamello Morrison, a spokeswoman for the opposition in Lesotho,
flew to Cape Town on Wednesday to slam the intervention and appeal
for South African troops to withdraw.
	   ``The power of the (Lesotho) people is being vanquished because
South Africa wants to uphold the avarice of a few people in
power,'' she told a news conference.
	   Such criticisms have been rare for South Africa, which since it
emerged from apartheid after all-race elections in 1994 has tried
to act as a peacebroker in African conflicts from Rwanda to Angola.
	   President Nelson Mandela, in Washington on a visit, stressed
that ``peaceful solutions'' to problems must always be sought. But
trying to explain the Lesotho intervention, he said, ``But whether
we're going to continue with that policy indefinitely must depend
on the reality on the ground.''

Live on TV: fugitive takes four hostage with hand grenade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's top fugitive took a family of
four hostage and, in a live television interview Wednesday,
threatened to blow them up with a hand grenade.
	   ``I have chosen a road and there is no return,'' Sorin Matei,
27, an escaped Greek-Romanian convict, told Athens' Skai television
station in a broadcast without precedent in Greece.
	   He let one hostage go after an hour of negotiations with Skai
anchorman Nikos Evangelatos, but refused to release the others.
	   On Sept. 6, Matei used a hand grenade to take a police officer
hostage for almost eight hours before security forces released him.
He fled in a taxi and police were unable to track him down until
Wednesday, when they located him hiding inside a multi-storied
apartment building near the capital's red light district.
	   But Matei, a drug addict, again managed to elude police, sliding
down a skylight and bursting into the family's apartment. He then
telephoned Evangelatos.
	   ``When you shoot heroin, you are both dead and alive,'' Matei
told him. He admitted that he could not think straight ``because
I'm a junkie and my head is bleeding.''
	   A former mental patient, Matei escaped from a police holding
facility last July. At the time he had already spent nearly a
decade in jail, serving sentences for attempted murder, a series of
armed robberies and thefts. He had nearly a quarter century left to
serve.
	   ``When you're looking at 50 years in jail, you don't have many
choices,'' he told Evangelatos.
	   Matei was watching developments unfold on a television set,
often asking Evangelatos for the names and ranks of police officers
on the streets below as they appeared on the screen.
	   He also gave the phone to Soultana Ginaki, 58 and her
24-year-old daughter. Often rambling and hurling vulgarities at
authorities, Matei then released the family's 24-year-old son, who
had medical problems.
	   ``He has tied us all together and is clenching the hand
grenade,'' the daughter said. Except for the mother and daughter,
Matei was also holding hostage the daughter's 35-year-old fiancee.
	   Matei demanded a fast sports car, dlrs 500,000, a first aid kit,
``and amphetamines. I've taken so much heroin that my eyes are
closing and I could drop the grenade.''
	   After two and-a-half hours, he accused Evangelatos of trying to
jack up his ratings.
	   ``I'm calling another station,'' Matei said and hung up.

Rees-Jones files suit against Ritz hotel and car service
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from Al Fayed &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole
survivor of the car crash that killed Princess Diana, filed suit
Wednesday against the Ritz Hotel and the Etoile-Limousine car
service for ``endangering the lives of others.''
	   At the time of the Aug. 31, 1997 crash, Rees-Jones was an
employee of Ritz owner Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of Dodi Fayed,
Diana's companion, who also died in the crash.
	   The driver of the car, Henri Paul, chief of security at the Ritz
Hotel, who also was killed in the crash, was legally drunk and
taking prescription drugs for depression at the time.
	   The legal action marked the first time that the Ritz management
and the car company have been legally targeted for responsibility
in the crash in a traffic tunnel under the Place de l'Alma.
	   The Ritz maintains photographers chasing the couple precipitated
the accident.
	   The legal action cites both the Ritz and Etoile-Limousine for
``failing to provide a licensed driver'' for the Mercedes in which
the princess was riding.
	   Paul did not have the type of license required by law to drive
the Mercedes 280S sedan, provided to the Ritz by Etoile-Limousine.
	   Rees-Jones' lawyer, Christian Curtil, also specifically
requested the complaint be added to the investigation into the
accident, currently being led by Judge Herve Stephan.
	   In his complaint, Curtil criticized the management of
Etoile-Limousine for having agreed to rent a vehicle of that
category without a driver licensed to operate it.
	   The suit also targets the Ritz for having chosen
Etoile-Limousine when other companies which would have provided a
licensed driver were available.
	   The offense of endangering the lives of others is punishable by
a maximum one year in jail and a fine of 100,000 francs (dlrs
17,500).
	   Rees-Jones' London lawyer, David Crawford, later issued a
statement saying it would be up to the French court ``to decide who
is responsible and for which offenses.''
	   If those parties were found guilty, Crawford's statement
continued that ``those responsible may also be liable to pay
damages to Trevor Rees-Jones.''
	   Rees-Jones fell into a coma after the crash and his face had to
be surgically reconstructed. He was questioned several times by
French judicial officials but remembered very little of the fatal
evening.
	   He remained for a time on Al Fayed's payroll but later quit and
went to work part-time for a sports shop in central England.
	   Al Fayed is refusing to pay Rees Jones' legal costs incurred
early on in the investigation, and the suit appears to reflect a
further deterioration in their relationship.
	   Rees-Jones' complaint could lead to new parties, including the
Ritz and the limousine service, being placed under formal
investigation.
	   A statement issued in London on Al Fayed's behalf said that Al
Fayed ``has provided everything possible for Trevor Rees- Jones,
including the medical treatment and support for him and his
family'' in Paris and Britain.
	   However, the statement acknowledged a ``dispute'' between Al
Fayed and Rees-Jones' English lawyers ``in connection with some of
their costs.''

Cuba braces for Hurricane Georges' march across the Caribbean
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with 200,000 people evacuated in eastern
Cuba, other detail. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Civil defense authorities evacuated more than
200,000 people from their homes in eastern Cuba on Wednesday as
Hurricane Georges bore down on the island after lashing neighboring
Haiti.
	   Heavy rains began soaking Cuba's southeastern coast early
Wednesday. Civil defense teams evacuated people from flood-prone
areas in the eastern provinces of Guantanamo, Holguin, Santiago and
Camaguey, according to news reports.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro put his ministers on alert
Wednesday to brace for the hurricane.
	   Volunteers on Wednesday also wrapped up work helping farmers
harvest coffee and other remaining crops, and evacuate livestock
from low-lying areas, the reports said.
	   Concerns about possible hurricane damage were especially acute
in eastern Cuba, which is suffering from a severe drought.
	   A hurricane warning was in effect from Sancti Spiritus province
eastward _ half of the island.
	   Georges was expected to strike Cuba on Wednesday afternoon,
probably making landfall on the southeastern coast of Guantanamo
province, officials said. From there, the hurricane was expected to
travel north across the island.
	   Citizens were encouraged to monitor government radio reports for
hurricane updates, and Raul Castro, head of the armed forces was
overseeing evacuation efforts, according to reports on state-run
Radio Rebelde.
	   The president made a surprise visit to the National Institute of
Meteorology on Wednesday, and said his government was ready for any
emergency.
	   ``We know what to do in any of the cases or variants of the
trajectory that Georges is following,'' the Mexican government news
agency Notimex quoted Fidel Castro as saying.
	   ``I also gave instructions not to do anything hasty, because
there is time and we have planned everything,'' the president
added.
	   Castro said that the armed forces would help get medicine, food
and other help to hurricane victims after Georges passes. He also
offered to send Cuban doctors to neighboring nations that needed
them.

China appeals for entry into WTO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with other details from speech. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ China's foreign minister again appealed
for his country's entry into the World Trade Organization, citing
China's efforts to stabilize the Asian economic crisis and the
opening of its markets for more business
	   ``China is already qualified for entry, regrettably,
negotiations have dragged on and on,'' Tang Jiaxuan told the U.N.
General Assembly in a speech that also outlined Beijing's firm
stance on Taiwan and the intent to protect human rights.
	   China has been lobbying for 12 years for entry into the WTO, the
main international body governing global trade relations and
setting fair trade rules. There is general agreement China should
join the organization and be bound by its responsibilities, but
there is disagreement on the conditions of entry.
	   China wants to enter as a developing country, meaning it would
have to take only gradual measures to cut barriers to imports of
goods and services.
	   The United States, which has a big trade deficit with China, and
other major traders have refused to let China in unless Beijing
opens its markets wider.
	   China is striving ``to keep abreast of economic globalization
and will be even more active in opening up to the world,'' Tang
said.
	   Since the Asian financial crisis began in July 1997, China has
resisted pressure to devalue its currency, the renminbi, ``for
which we have endured great pressure and paid a heavy price,'' he
said.
	   China's exports _ a driving force in its economy _ rose a
sluggish 7.6 percent during the first half of the year.
	   China is especially concerned that Taiwan _ which Beijing views
as a renegade province _ may enter the WTO before China.
	   ``Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory,'' Tang
said. ``The successful return of Hong Kong and the upcoming return
of Macao provide useful inspiration for settlement of the Taiwan
question.''
	   In his speech, Tang also promoted the idea of China as a
supporter of human rights _ despite its campaign to crack down on
dissidents.
	   Next month, China plans to sign a U.N. declaration on human
rights, which ``testifies to the resolve of the Chinese government
in promoting and protecting human rights,'' Tang said.
	   ``Earth-shaking changes have taken place in China in the past
two decades,'' he said. The Chinese people are enjoying ``a higher
degree of freedom and equality than ever before.''
	   He also called for better efforts to end nuclear proliferation
and urged dialogue and negotiations to stop conflicts in Kosovo,
Kashmir, Africa and the Middle East.
	   China, itself a nuclear power, ``urges countries with the
largest arsenals to accelerate the nuclear disarmament process.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Wednesday that a widening foreign financial crisis will require
policy-makers to be ``especially sensitive to the deepening signs
of global distress'' but he stopped short of promising any
immediate reductions in U.S. interest rates.
	   In widely anticipated testimony, Greenspan told the U.S.
Congress there was no doubt the currency crisis that began 14
months ago in Thailand has entered a new ``more virulent phase''
with the collapse last month of the Russian economy.
	   While indicating that Fed policy-makers were watching
developments closely, he gave no indication that they were prepared
to reduce interest rates when they meet Tuesday.
	   Wall Street began Wednesday strongly with the Dow Jones
industrial average up more than 100 points immediately after the
opening bell and investors bid prices higher still after
Greenspan's remarks were released at midafternoon. Investors viewed
Greenspan's expressions of growing concern about the global crisis
as a further evidence that rate cuts are on the way.
	   Private economists believe that growing signs of Asia's impact
on the U.S. economy will force the Fed to cut interest rates before
the end of the year, but Greenspan's remarks seemed to signal that
further evidence of a U.S. slowdown will be needed for the central
bank to act.
	   ``With few signs that the financial crisis that started in Asia
last year has subsided, or is about to do so, policy-makers around
the world have to be especially sensitive to the deepening signs of
global distress which can impact their own economies,'' Greenspan
told the Senate Budget Committee Wednesday.
	   Hopes for a cut in interest rates had been heightened by
comments Tuesday by William McDonough, president of the New York
regional Fed bank. ``The balance of risk has shifted from one of
concern about inflation to one of concern about inadequate
growth,'' said McDonough.
	   In his comments Wednesday, Greenspan agreed that the threats to
the U.S. economy were increasing, noting in particular big declines
over the past month in stock prices, but he said that so far all
the market turmoil has not ``produced any significant weakness in
the American economy as a whole.''
	   Greenspan also noted that labor markets in the U.S. economy
remain tight and hourly compensation is continuing to grow more
rapidly, but he said there is no evidence yet that inflation is
getting out of hand. And he cautioned that ``looking forward, the
restraining effects of recent developments on the U.S. economy are
likely to intensify.''
	   Greenspan repeated remarks he made in September, that the
increasing risks to the U.S. economy had prompted the Fed in August
to change its policy directive from one leaning toward increasing
interest rates to fight inflation to a neutral stance.
	   And since that time, Greenspan said Wednesday, ``Deteriorating
foreign economies and their spillover to domestic markets have
increased the possibility that the slowdown in growth of the
American economy will be more than sufficient to hold inflation in
check.''
	   In a Sept. 4 speech, Greenspan said: ``It is not credible that
the United States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a
world that is experiencing greatly increased stress.''
	   Those comments and the promise they offered of rate cuts down
the road were enough to boost the Dow Jones industrial average by
381 points, its biggest one-day point gain ever.
	   But one week ago, Greenspan sent markets in the opposite
direction when in an appearance before the House Banking Committee
he deflated expectations of coordinated interest rate cuts among
the world's seven largest economies. His comments sent the Dow
plunging Thursday by 216 points following huge drops in Tokyo and
other overseas markets because of disappointment that the Fed would
not soon act.
	   Lower U.S. interest rates would help a number of countries
struggling to defend their currencies by lowering the value of the
U.S. dollar on global markets. The lower U.S. rates would also
bolster global confidence by assuring foreign businesses that the
Fed stood ready to ensure that U.S. growth would try to ignite
growth in the rest of the world.

German wants Starr prosecuted for spreading pornography, slandering

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Many have expressed disgust with the
highly explicit coverage of U.S. President Clinton's affair with a
White House intern. Now a German journalist wants to do something
about it.
	   Wenzel Pleil, a reporter for the Flensburger Tageblatt newspaper
in northern Germany, said Wednesday he had hired a lawyer to push
for criminal charges against special prosecutor Kenneth Starr _
distributing pornographic material and slandering Clinton.
	   Pleil's attorney, Max Mulert, said he had sent a letter to
federal prosecutors in Washington asking them to consider bringing
charges against Starr ``and other unknown people, who are
responsible for the affair.''
	   While both Pleil and Mulert aren't sure their request will be
met, they say they're trying to send a signal on how most Germans
feel about Clinton.
	   ``Pornographic material'' on the Clinton-Lewinsky case in the
Internet ``was available in every nursery,'' in Germany, Pleil, the
44-year-old father of a 4-year-old girl, said in a telephone
interview.
	   In addition, he said he felt it was ethically and morally
``unacceptable to watch a person dragged through the dirt with the
blessings of the state.''
	   Pleil's reaction reflected that of most Germans, who have shown
sympathy for the president and shock at the level of details being
reported.
	   Some politicians have compared Starr's investigation to the
Inquisition, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl weighed in this week with
his disgust, saying the ``catastrophic'' coverage made him ``throw
up.''
	   ``The accused is suspected of malicious gossip against a
political person and of circulating and publishing pornographic
scriptures (writing) in the worldwide web and TV,'' he said.
	   The two were also considering bringing charges in Germany as
well, where the legal system allows for prosecuting crimes even if
they were not committed on German soil.
	   Mulert said he was shocked to hear teen-agers making schoolyard
jokes about ``the intimate details'' of the Clinton sex scandal.
	   ``We have laws to protect minors from pornography,'' he said.
``This was published worldwide.''
	   According to Mulert, Starr would face up to five years in prison
under the German penal code if convicted of degrading Clinton and
``obstructing his public and political work.''
	   In addition, publishing pornographic writings and making them
available to those under age 18 is punishable by a sentence of one
year.

 &UR; U.S. envoy doubts likely Bosnian Serb president &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The top U.S. envoy for the
Balkans expressed doubt Wednesday that a hard-liner likely to be
declared the winner of the Bosnian Serb presidency will abide by
the U.S.-brokered peace agreement that ended the Bosnian war.
	   Final results from the Sept. 12-13 nationwide elections are
expected Thursday, according to international overseers. The
results are expected to confirm reports that hard-line Nikola
Poplasen upset the U.S. favorite, Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic.
	   Poplasen's victory is seen as a serious blow to Western efforts
to stitch Bosnia back together after a 3 1/2-year war that ended
with the 1995 Dayton peace agreement.
	   ``I'll be very frank: speaking for the United States of America,
if the results that we read about are true and Mr. Poplasen is
elected ... we have serious questions about his willingness to
implement the provisions of the Dayton agreement,'' U.S. envoy
Robert Gelbard said after meeting with Plavsic.
	   ``We also are very worried'' about Poplasen's ``constant cries
for violence,'' he said.
	   Nevertheless, Gelbard told reporters earlier in Sarajevo that
``everything else has moved in the right direction,'' alluding to
good showings by moderates in some parliamentary races.
	   Bosnia is divided between a Bosnian Serb republic and a
federation of Muslims and Croats. Both of those entities have their
own governments but are linked by a third joint central government.
	   Gelbard reiterated that the United States will do everything in
its power to protect Bosnia's integrity and ``even any discussions
of secession would be considered the most critical violation'' of
the peace agreement.
	   Moderate Kresimir Zubak also seems to have lost the Croat seat
of the three-member, three-nation Bosnian presidency to a hard-line
rival believed opposed to cooperation with Muslims.
	   Moderate Zivko Radisic, however, appears to have defeated
incumbent Momcilo Krajisnik for the Serb seat on the Bosnian
presidency. Krajisnik is allied with Radovan Karadzic, the wartime
Bosnian Serb leader now under double indictment by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal.
	   Gelbard said that U.S. aid to the Bosnian Serbs depends on their
leaders' future policies.
	   The United States wants to help the people in the Bosnian Serb
half of country, Gelbard said. ``But to do that, there have to be
policies and programs in place that reflect democracy and an
approach for further development of market economy.''
	   In Sarajevo, the daily newspaper Oslobodjenje branded the
elections a failure. ``Bosnia took a step back from democracy ...
and came closer to the option of the final ethnic division, which
represents a failure of the U.S. policy in Bosnia,'' the newspaper
said.

Refugees trapped in hills; Trims; Council vote scheduled for 1930

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council is demanding a
cease-fire in Kosovo and threatening further action if the violence
continues in the Yugoslav province, where tens of thousands of
refugees face a desperate winter.
	   A draft of a resolution expected to be adopted Wednesday doesn't
specifically authorize NATO forces to stop the Serb offensive on
ethnic Albanian separatists. But countries such as the United
States have said such authorization isn't necessary for military
intervention.
	   The United States has asked the NATO governing body to begin
rounding up commitments from NATO countries to contribute to a
possible multinational force, two senior U.S. officials said
Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   NATO defense ministers were to meet Thursday in Vilamoura,
Portugal to discuss Kosovo. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel,
in New York for the General Assembly, said the meeting ``is a last
step in planning, not the first step in deciding'' whether to
intervene.
	   The U.N. resolution states only that ``the council would
consider further action and additional measures to maintain or
restore peace and stability in the region,'' if a political
settlement isn't reached.
	   It gives no time frame.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Wednesday the
resolution was sufficient for now, but that the council and other
concerned nations must wait for the next step before looking at any
military intervention.
	   He stressed that the Security Council alone determines whether
force is necessary.
	   The resolution cites Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows
for the use of force by member states if regional peace and
security is threatened. Nevertheless, there is no explicit
authorization for member states to intervene.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and more than a quarter
million uprooted since Serb forces began a crackdown in February on
ethnic Albanian separatists, who constitute 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence of
Kosovo; Western nations have called on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to return the autonomy he stripped from the province in
1989.
	   The situation is becoming urgent becasue about 50,000 refugees
are roaming the hills of Kosovo with little food and shelter and
snow fell in the area for the first time last week.
	   In addition to demanding a cease-fire, the draft resolution
urges the Serbs and ethnic Albanian leadership to start negotiating
a solution to the crisis.
	   It demands Milosevic allow international monitoring in Kosovo
and the return of refugees.
	   Russia, which has opposed force in the past, said it would go
along with the resolution because it didn't specifically authorize
military intervention. Another resolution was necessary to do that,
Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov said.
	   ``The use of force is the last resort, and it could only be done
on the decision of the Security Council,'' he said.
	   China, however, still had problems with the threat of further
measures, council diplomats said.
	   Italy's foreign minister Alberto Dini, in a briefing with
reporters, questioned how any direct military action would be
carried out and stressed that the international community ``must
push diplomacy further and not despair yet.''.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
said Wednesday that Fed policy-makers understood the need to act
quickly to keep a widening global financial crisis from further
damaging the American and world economies.
	   Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, said
that there was a need to ``bring the existing instabilities to a
level of stability reasonably shortly to prevent the contagion from
really spilling over and presenting some significant difficulties
for all of us.''
	   Economists said Greenspan's comments were a strong signal that
the central bank will cut interest rates when policymakers meet
next Tuesday.
	   ``He is telling us he is going to ease at the next meeting,''
said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.

Italy, as part of EU, NATO, can help strengthen international

leadership &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Stronger international leadership is
needed to take the reins of the world's markets and to solve global
financial problems and regional conflicts, Italy's foreign minister
said Wednesday.
	   ``Such crises shed light on an improper balance between the
power of the market and the power of institutions, '' Lamberto Dini
told the U.N. General Assembly in a speech that advocated expanding
the 15-member Security Council and touted the benefits of having
the European Union and NATO assume more responsibility.
	   ``Like industrialization in its early days, globalization
produces both great progress and dangerous imbalances. Thus it
requires governance. No (one) country can govern it, however great
its political, economic and military power,'' Dini said.
	   In his speech, Dini pointed to the economic instability that
started in Asia and has gripped Russia and threatens other
developing countries, saying economic crises run much deeper in
countries with less democracy.
	   ``The market and fundamental freedoms ... are two sides of the
same coin,'' he said.
	   The EU, of which Italy is a member, can become a role model for
advancing both because its new unified currency, the Euro,
``demands new responsibilities at the international level,'' he
said.
	   Dini also emphasized the importance of expanding NATO, which
includes Italy, and giving the 16-nation alliance a bigger role in
the world. The group will soon induct three new members _ Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic.
	   ``The Atlantic Alliance is redefining strategies, missions and
memberships,'' Dini said. ``It is looking to the United Nations for
additional legitimacy to broaden the scope of its mission.''

Georges swipes through Virgin Islands; two reported missing

 &UR; With Caribbean-Hurricane &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Forcibly accustomed to
the ravages of hurricanes, Virgin Islanders this week found
themselves coping yet again _ without water, power, telephones and
even roofs over their heads.
	   Hurricane Georges slammed into St. Thomas, St. John and St.
Croix on Monday, but on Wednesday many residents still could not
pick up the phone and hear a dial tone.
	   The storm's 110-mph (180 kph) fury sank dozens of boats, smashed
wooden piers and boardwalks, and stripped the pristine islands of
much of their lush green foliage. It blew away many of the blue
tarpaulins that had served as roofs for dozens of families since
disastrous Hurricane Marilyn hit three years ago.
	   ``I cry all the time when I see my home,'' said Milda Luz
Mendez, 49, whose roof was blown off. ``This is the fourth time I'm
losing my roof in 10 years, beginning with Hurricane Hugo. I don't
know if I can take this any longer.''
	   By initial accounts, this week's damage wasn't nearly as
catastrophic as that caused by Marilyn, or Hurricane Hugo a decade
ago. Several people were injured by flying debris, one man was
hospitalized in a coma after a roof collapse and two people, both
houseboat dwellers, were reported missing.
	   Yet Georges struck another blow to a tourism-dependent economy
that has struggled since Hurricanes Marilyn and Luis paid visits in
1995 and Hurricane Bertha the next year.
	   Federal inspectors fanned out across the U.S. islands Wednesday
to come up with a preliminary damage estimate.
	   Hardest hit was St. Croix, where officials estimated nearly a
third of homes were damaged in Fredericksted, one of the island's
two main cities with a population of 5,000.
	   On Wednesday, crews removed coconut palms and other debris from
streets in a city that hardly resembled its former self.
	   The Ann E. Abrahamson pier, a familiar sight to cruise ship
visitors, was extensively damaged by a 20-foot (6-meter) storm
surge swept into jewelry stores on the streets.
	   Also in Fredericksted, a 60-foot (18-meter) wooden fisherman's
wharf was destroyed, its last planks sinking into the sea long
after the storm passed. A 15-foot (4.5-meter) boat was left sitting
squarely on King Street, and other boats were sunken at marinas.
	   In Christiansted, with a population of about 3,000, a boardwalk
tourist attraction was nearly washed away and the beach severely
eroded around the well-known Hotel on the Key.
	   Wooden staircases and windows at the pink, Danish-style
Christian Hotel were broken. The lawn of a new park was destroyed.
	   Across the three islands, some 2,400 tourists weathered out the
storm in hotels, most of them in St. Thomas, according to the
Virgin Islands Tourism Association. More than 900 residents were
sheltered during the storm, the Red Cross said.
	   As well as phone service, many residents were still without
power and water. But it was unclear how many because officials did
not have firm figures yet.
	   National Guard troops, federal marshals and police manned
roadblocks to enforce an 8 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew ``to prevent further
injuries through accidental electrocutions,'' said Gov. Roy E.
Schneider.
	   Many St. Croix residents remember the destruction caused by
Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and the rampant looting by hundreds that
came after. Thirteen people were arrested this week on looting,
curfew violations and burglary charges.
	   Luz Mendez fell victim to thieves who cleared out her house of
appliances and clothes after she fled the roofless structure.
	   ``It was the most horrible experience to see your roof lifted
off and in one second to see the open sky,'' she said through
tears. ``To make it worse these vagabonds cleaned out whatever I
had left.''

	   GENEVA (AP) _ The number of people without full-time jobs
worldwide will reach a record high of 1 billion by the end of 1998,
fueled by the Asian financial crisis, according to an International
Labor Organization report being released Thursday.
	   The turmoil in Asia will cause the number of unemployed people
around the globe to rise 10 million, to 150 million, the 258-page
study said.
	   In addition, a further 750 million to 900 million people _ 25
percent to 30 percent of the world's workers _ lack full-time jobs
or earn less than the minimum needed to live, a situation the ILO
calls ``underemployment.''
	   The study's author, ILO employment expert Rashid Amjad, forecast
``much more pressure on the global employment situation'' in future
years, but declined to be specific.
	   The ILO says governments, especially those in developing
countries, must invest more in worker training and skills fueled by
real economic demand.
	   ``The global employment situation is grim and getting grimmer,''
said Michel Hansenne, director-general of the ILO.
	   Economic growth in many parts of the world in early 1998,
expected to spur worldwide job increases, has cut unemployment and
underemployment in the United States and the European Union, the
report said.
	   More than 18 million workers are unemployed in the EU but output
and employment showed signs of picking up in mid-1998.
	   There has been an above-average jobs increase in the United
States, despite growing wage inequality and a fall in real wages.
	   But despite three decades of sustained growth in East and
Southeast Asia, the situation in the region has dramatically
deteriorated in the past year.
	   In Thailand, for example, the report said, unemployment could
rise to about 6 percent of the labor force _ almost 2 million
jobless _ in 1998 compared to 1 percent to 2 percent of the labor
force, or 400,000 to 700,000 unemployed, two years ago.
	   In China, an estimated 3.5 million workers will lose their jobs
this year and unemployment will increase 5 percent to 6 percent.
	   Poverty is likely to rise in the Russian Federation. ``The
recent turmoil in Russian financial markets, partly a response to
untenably high interest rates, threatens to replicate the earlier
experience of Indonesia,'' the report said. In Indonesia, steep
increases in unemployment are accompanied by food shortages.
	   Unemployment remains high in most Central and East European
transition economies, the study said.
	   Latin America is threatened in 1998 by a potential global
pull-back by investors in emerging markets which could push
unemployment and underemployment up.
	   The ILO estimates that 1998 unemployment is 7.9 percent in
Brazil, 11.3 percent in Venezuela, 3.4 percent in Mexico and 15.2
percent in Colombia.
	   In sub-Saharan Africa, the study said, a prolonged period of
poor growth and deteriorating labor market conditions has given way
to slightly improving employment in many countries in 1998, but
most new jobs are informal and in low-productivity agriculture.

Adams accuses Trimble of trying to rewrite Belfast agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams on
Wednesday accused the would-be leader of Northern Ireland's new
government of violating the Belfast peace agreement by demanding
IRA disarmament.
	   Adams, whose Irish Republican Army-linked party supported
April's accord on a joint Protestant-Catholic government for
Northern Ireland, said Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble
was going ``back on his word.''
	   ``The man has actually moved back to before the Good Friday
agreement. I've told Mr. Trimble that I consider this to be a very
serious development indeed,'' said Adams, who met Trimble on
Tuesday.
	   The agreement stipulated that the IRA should disarm by mid-2000,
but didn't say when the process should begin _ or explicitly link
it to other developments.
	   But Trimble, chief representative of the north's British
Protestant majority, emphasized that Protestant lawmakers would
hold Sinn Fein accountable for the IRA's inaction. He vowed to veto
Sinn Fein's involvement in a new government for Northern Ireland
unless the IRA started disarming as proof that its 14-month-old
truce was sincere.
	   ``I don't think I've toughened up my position. The agreement
involves disarmament, disbandment by paramilitary organizations. We
all know that the ending of violence was their side of the
bargain,'' Trimble said.
	   Trimble _ who began talking directly with Adams only two weeks
ago _ said the IRA's refusal to disarm ``puts a question mark''
over future meetings.
	   He was speaking at a news conference highlighting the vigilante
beatings and shootings that the IRA and outlawed pro-British groups
keep inflicting on criminal rivals.
	   A pressure group trying to get the attacks stopped, Families
Against Intimidation and Terror, said the IRA and pro-British gangs
had beaten up 66 people, shot 34 through the limbs and forced 80
people to flee their homes since April's agreement.
	   In July, Northern Ireland's new 108-member legislative Assembly
elected Trimble and moderate Catholic politician Seamus Mallon to
be the senior members of a new Executive administration. Other
members must be approved by majorities of the Protestant and
Catholic blocs in the Assembly.
	   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Sinn Fein's
acceptance of the Belfast accord meant gradual IRA disarmament was
inevitable.
	   ``Now it is a question of when. We have to get agreement on
that,'' said Ahern, who hopes Trimble will invite Sinn Fein into
the Executive next month even if the IRA makes no move.
	   Meanwhile Wednesday, police in the Irish Republic discovered a
barrel containing rifles and explosives near the border with
Northern Ireland but made no arrests.
	   The barrel had been buried near a stone wall in an area,
Hackballscross, where scores of IRA weapons caches have been
unearthed.
	   Also Wednesday, about 100 soldiers from the Highlander Regiment
boarded a flight at Belfast International Airport bound for their
Scottish home base. Another 300 soldiers are expected soon to leave
Northern Ireland, reducing troop strength in the province to
16,000.

Lukashenko attacks NATO, says he regrets giving up nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
lashed out at NATO on Wednesday and said he regretted that Belarus
jettisoned its nuclear weapons after the Soviet breakup.
	   The authoritarian president, who spent the day visiting two air
defense units and an off-limits military base, also promised that
Belarus would continue to modernize its military.
	   ``It's no secret,'' he said in remarks broadcast on Russia's NTV
television station. ``All systems that we have now _ I'll name
them; S-125 and other defense systems _ we'll be modernizing
them.''
	   The S-125 is a Soviet air defense system that is now considered
obsolete.
	   Lukashenko said he wished the previous Belarusian government had
not agreed to scrap the country's share of the Soviet nuclear
weapons stockpile, although he said he understood why the decision
was made.
	   ``The pressure from Russia and the West was incredible,'' he
said.
	   He attacked NATO for approaching Belarus' borders. Poland, which
borders Belarus to the west, is expected to become a NATO member
next year.
	   ``Already now, three powerful radar stations have been installed
on the border of Belarus in order to have control over the whole
territory, even beyond Belarus,'' Lukashenko fumed to reporters.
``In other words, slowly, slowly, this bloc is becoming more and
more impudent.''

	   In response to a question, Greenspan said he could not comment
directly on whether the Fed was ready to lower interest rates
because policy-makers have not yet met. But he stressed that his
colleagues at the Fed were aware of the seriousness of the global
financial crisis, which began 14 months ago in Asia, has now spread
to Russia and is threatening to strike Latin America next.
	   ``I think we know where we have to go,'' Greenspan said. ``We
don't underestimate the problem.''
	   One analyst took Greenspan's comments as a signal to expect an
interest rate drop.
	   ``Greenspan told us in unambiguous terms that he will be cutting
interest rates next Tuesday,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist
at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. ``He really emphasized global
economic turbulence and its impact on the U.S. economy.''

	   Greenspan's comments sparked a huge surge Wednesday on Wall
Street with the Dow Jones industrial average rising more than 180
points in late afternoon trading.
	   Greenspan said that because of the global turmoil, policy-makers
around the world have to be ``especially sensitive to the deepening
signs of global distress'' which he said had entered a ``more
virulent phase'' with the collapse last month of the Russian
economy.
	   Hopes for a cut in interest rates had been heightened before
Greenspan's appearance by remarks Tuesday from William McDonough,
president of the New York regional Fed bank. ``The balance of risk
has shifted from one of concern about inflation to one of concern
about inadequate growth,'' McDonough said.
	   Lower U.S. interest rates would help a number of countries
struggling to defend their currencies by lowering the value of the
U.S. dollar on global markets. The lower U.S. rates also would
bolster global confidence by assuring foreign businesses that the
Fed stood ready to ensure that U.S. growth would continue to serve
as an economic engine for the rest of the world.
	   Greenspan noted that labor markets in the U.S. economy remain
tight and hourly compensation is continuing to grow more rapidly.
But he said there is no evidence that inflation is getting out of
hand.
	   He also cautioned that ``looking forward, the restraining
effects of recent developments on the U.S. economy are likely to
intensify.''
	   Greenspan, repeating remarks he made in September, said the
increasing risks to the U.S. economy had prompted the Fed in August
to change its policy directive from one leaning toward increasing
interest rates to fight inflation to a neutral stance.
	   Since then, Greenspan said Wednesday, ``Deteriorating foreign
economies and their spillover to domestic markets have increased
the possibility that the slowdown in growth of the American economy
will be more than sufficient to hold inflation in check.''
	   In a Sept. 4 speech, Greenspan said: ``It is not credible that
the United States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a
world that is experiencing greatly increased stress.''
	   But last week, Greenspan sent markets in the opposite direction
when in an appearance before the House Banking Committee, he
deflated expectations of coordinated interest rate cuts among the
world's seven largest economies.

Wheat finishes mixed; corn and soybeans retreat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Wheat futures finished mixed Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybean futures retreated.
	   Wheat suffered from a choppy trading session in which market
participants had a tough time deciding whether to lift the market
on delays in planting the winter wheat crop and weather problems
elsewhere around the world, or pull back on weak demand.
	   Corn and soybeans retreated under continued harvest pressure.
Despite National Weather Service forecasts for rainfall over the
next 10 days, investors noted the harvest is proceeding well ahead
of schedule in many areas and said farmers will have ample
opportunity to get into the fields before more rain returns.
	   Wheat for December delivery was unchanged at dlrs 2.74 1-4 a
bushel; December corn fell 1 cent to dlrs 2.05 1-2 a bushel;
December oats fell 2 3-4 cents to dlrs 1.12 3-4 a bushel; November
soybeans fell 3 1-2 cents to dlrs 5.26 1-4 a bushel.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa picked on his favorite pitching staff
Wednesday, hitting home run No. 64 and pulling within one of Mark
McGwire.
	   The Chicago Cubs slugger snapped an 0-for-21 slump with a solo
shot to right field with one out in the fifth off Milwaukee rookie
Rafael Roque, who also gave up McGwire's 64th homer.
	   Sosa's 344-foot (103-meter) shot was his 11th home run off
Milwaukee pitching, his most against any team.
	   Sosa, who not gotten a hit and had struck out eight times since
hitting No. 63, a grand slam, last Wednesday in San Diego, walked
his first two times up against Roque. Then he sent a 1-0 fastball
to the opposite field, giving the Cubs a 4-0 lead.
	   Sosa's 155th RBI gave him the fourth-highest single-season total
in National League history.
	   Sosa entered the game at sold-out County Stadium two homers
behind McGwire. The St. Louis slugger hit his 65th against the
Brewers on Sunday.
	   The Cardinals faced Houston Wednesday night in St. Louis, where
McGwire has hit a record 33 home runs this season.
	   The Cubs entered the day tied with the New York Mets for the NL
wild-card berth.
	   Earlier this month, Sosa connected for Nos. 59-62 against
Milwaukee during a three-game series.
	   McGwire broke his tie with Sosa by hitting home run No. 64 in
Milwaukee on Friday night off Roque. McGwire connected for No. 65
on Sunday.

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hurricane Georges reached Cuba and
threatened the Florida Keys Wednesday after making a shambles of
much of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti in a furious
march that killed at least 39 people.
	   In Florida, up to 100,000 people were ordered to begin
evacuating the exposed Florida Keys, and cars, trucks and sport
utility vehicles streamed along the highway linking the island
chain to the Florida mainland.
	   South Florida was put under a hurricane watch and Gov. Lawton
Chiles declared a state of emergency in central and southern
Florida, allowing the state to use the National Guard, lift tolls
along evacuation routes and purchase emergency supplies.
	   The hurricane first hit the small islands of the northeast
Caribbean early Monday, killing three in St. Kitts and two in
Antigua. The U.S. Virgin Islands, which were badly battered in
recent hurricanes, suffered some damage to homes, tourist
facilities and utilities, but apparently no loss of life.
	   The effects of the storm were expected to be felt as far south
as Jamaica, where officials expected heavy rains.
	   Four people died in Puerto Rico, where the government's
insurance commissioner, Juan Garcia, estimated damages at dlrs 1
billion.
	   On Wednesday reconstruction efforts were under way in
communities like Loiza, where many homes of wood and zinc roofs
were crushed and washed away.
	   ``My sister's house is all gone. And that used to be my uncle's
house,'' said Luis Manso, pointing to a nearby pile of wood debris
as he struggled to repair his own shattered fruit and vegetable
stand ``quickly, before the thieves come.''
	   The Federal Emergency Management Agency reported that about a
third of Puerto Rico's power was expected back Wednesday, but
715,000 remained without running water. FEMA said airport damage
was minimal and the port of San Juan reported no major damage.
Coffee and plantain crops, however, were badly harmed, FEMA said.
	   At least 17 people were killed in the Dominican Republic, which
Georges hit Tuesday.
	   In the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo, looters waded
waist-deep in water, balancing televisions and air conditioners on
their heads as 110 mph (180 kph) winds toppled trees and crushed
houses. Bands of youths with machetes and pistols roamed the
streets, many of them drunk. Two of the dead were looters shot by
police enforcing a curfew.
	   From there Georges proceeded Tuesday night to Haiti, the
Dominican Republic's neighbor occupying the western third of the
island of Hispaniola.
	   In the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Georges
unleashed flash floods and killed at least 13 in collapsed
dwellings, said Yolaine Surena of the civil defense authority. She
said the government could spare only dlrs 130,000 in emergency aid.
	   Most of the deaths reportedly occurred when floodwaters
collapsed two homes in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where there
were no public shelters. Deaths also were reported in Gonaives and
the northern town of Marmelade.
	   ``We're scared a little, but we have a lot of faith,'' said
Port-au-Prince supermarket clerk Nadine Augustin. Like most people
in the Western Hemisphere's poorest country, her family had little
means to prepare for the storm.
	   Mountain erosion and a lack of maintenance have left drainage
systems in Haitian cities choked with silt and unable to alleviate
flash floods, said meteorologist Renan Jean-Louis.
	   ``Foundations give way every time the rain falls. The
environment is deteriorating ceaselessly because there is no
government enforcement of zoning regulations,'' Haitian
environmentalist Ernst Wilson said Wednesday.
	   In November 1994, tropical storm Gordon killed at least 1,000 in
Haiti's southern provinces, drowning them in torrential streams or
burying them in mudslides.
	   At 1800 GMT, Hurricane Georges had reached the southern coast of
Cuba and was moving west-northwest near 15 mph (25 kph) with
maximum sustained winds at a low hurricane-level 75 mph (120 kph),
down from 110 mph (180 kph) over Puerto Rico.

	   Hundreds of people have been killed, and over a quarter million
have fled the fighting since a Serb crackdown began in February.
	   The situation has taken on urgency because an estimated 50,000
refugees are roaming the hills of Kosovo with little food and
shelter and snow fell in the area for the first time last week.
	   The resolution _ the toughest action the council has taken to
date _ comes a day before NATO defense ministers meet in Portugal
to discuss the situation.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, in New York for the
General Assembly, said that the meeting ``is a last step in
planning, not the first step in deciding'' whether to intervene in
Kosovo.
	   The United States has asked the NATO governing body to begin
rounding up commitments from NATO countries to contribute to a
possible multinational force, two senior U.S. officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Washington has said council authorization in not needed for
military intervention.
	   The resolution demands a cease-fire and urges the Serbs and
ethnic Albanian leadership to start negotiating a solution.
	   It also demands Milosevic allow international monitoring in
Kosovo and the safe return of refugees.
	   The resolution cites Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows
for the use of force by member states if regional peace and
security is threatened. Nevertheless, there is no explicit
authorization for member states to intervene.
	   The resolution says only that ``the council would consider
further action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace
and stability in the region,'' if a political settlement isn't
reached.
	   It gives no time frame.
	   Russia, which has opposed force in the past, said it would go
along with the resolution because it didn't specifically authorize
military intervention. Another resolution was necessary to do that,
Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov said.
	   China however, still had problems with the threat of further
measures, council diplomats said.
	   Before the vote, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said the
resolution was ``sufficient'' for now, but that the council and
other countries had to wait for the next stage _ presumably
Belgrade's response to the resolution _ before addressing the issue
of intervention.
	   Vedrine was to chair a meeting later Wednesday of the Contact
Group of states to discuss implementation of the resolution.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Wednesday that Fed policy-makers understood the need to act quickly
to contain a widening global currency crisis, raising the prospects
of an immediate cut in U.S. rates. His words sparked an explosive
rally on Wall Street.
	   Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, said
that there was a need to ``bring the existing instabilities to a
level of stability reasonably shortly to prevent the contagion from
really spilling over and creating some very significant further
difficulties for all of us.''
	   Economists said Greenspan's comments were a strong signal that
the central bank will cut interest rates when policy-makers meet
next Tuesday.
	   ``He is telling us he is going to ease at the next meeting,''
said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.
	   In response to a question, Greenspan said he could not comment
directly on whether the Fed was ready to lower interest rates
because policy makers have not yet met. But he stressed that his
colleagues at the Fed were aware of the seriousness of the global
financial crisis, which began 14 months ago in Asia, has now spread
to Russia and is threatening to strike Latin America next.
	   ``I think we know where we have to go,'' Greenspan said. ``We
don't underestimate the problem.''
	   One analyst took Greenspan's comments as a signal to expect an
interest rate drop.
	   ``Greenspan told us in unambiguous terms that he will be cutting
interest rates next Tuesday,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist
at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. ``He really emphasized global
economic turbulence and its impact on the U.S. economy.''
	   Greenspan's comments sparked a huge surge on Wall Street with
the Dow Jones industrial average rising more than 200 points in
late afternoon trading.
	   Greenspan said that because of the global turmoil, policy-makers
around the world have to be ``especially sensitive to the deepening
signs of global distress'' which he said had entered a ``more
virulent phase'' with the collapse last month of the Russian
economy.
	   Hopes for a cut in interest rates had been heightened before
Greenspan's appearance by remarks Tuesday from William McDonough,
president of the New York regional Fed bank. ``The balance of risk
has shifted from one of concern about inflation to one of concern
about inadequate growth,'' McDonough said.
	   Lower U.S. interest rates would help a number of countries
struggling to defend their currencies by lowering the value of the
U.S. dollar on global markets. The lower U.S. rates also would
bolster global confidence by assuring foreign businesses that the
Fed stood ready to ensure that U.S. growth would continue to serve
as an economic engine for the rest of the world.
	   Greenspan noted that labor markets in the U.S. economy remain
tight and hourly compensation is continuing to grow more rapidly.
But he said there is no evidence that inflation is getting out of
hand.
	   He also cautioned that ``looking forward, the restraining
effects of recent developments on the U.S. economy are likely to
intensify.''
	   Greenspan, repeating remarks he made in September, said the
increasing risks to the U.S. economy had prompted the Fed in August
to change its policy directive from one leaning toward increasing
interest rates to fight inflation to a neutral stance.
	   Since then, Greenspan said Wednesday, ``Deteriorating foreign
economies and their spillover to domestic markets have increased
the possibility that the slowdown in growth of the American economy
will be more than sufficient to hold inflation in check.''
	   In a Sept. 4 speech, Greenspan said: ``It is not credible that
the United States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a
world that is experiencing greatly increased stress.''
	   But last week, Greenspan sent markets in the opposite direction
when in an appearance before the House Banking Committee, he
deflated expectations of coordinated interest rate cuts among the
world's seven largest economies.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to stave off a humanitarian crisis
in the hills of Kosovo, the Security Council demanded a cease-fire
in the Yugoslav province Wednesday and threatened further action if
fighting continues.
	   China abstained from the vote, which passed 14-0. ``We do not

	   VAGANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces drove deeper into the
heartland of the ethnic Albanian rebellion Wednesday in a defiant
show of power as world leaders edged closer to intervening to stop
the bloodshed.
	   Serb artillery boomed in the west and east of the Drenica region
of central Kosovo. Up to 20,000 civilians were believed trapped by
the fighting.
	   Thousands of Serb police, Yugoslav soldiers and armed Serb
civilians, many of them teenagers, patrolled nearly all routes into
the Drenica region Wednesday, tightening a noose on the several
hundred lightly armed rebels who built a network of trenches and
sandbag bunkers in the mountainous area.
	   The latest offensive came hours before the U.N. Security Council
voted on a resolution to demand a cease-fire in the Yugoslav
province Wednesday and threatened further action if fighting
continues.
	   China abstained from voting on the resolution, which is
militarily enforceable but doesn't explicitly authorize NATO
intervention to try to stop the Serb offensive on ethnic Albanian
separatists. It also requires the council to revisit the issue
before any U.N. authorization of force is granted.
	   The resolution was intended to increase pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to loosen his grip on Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians are fighting Serb forces for independence.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo, and the rebels
are fighting for independence from Serbia, the dominant of two
republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   Serb forces appeared intent on crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army in advance of any internationally demanded peace moves.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed that 11
ethnic Albanian civilians were killed Tuesday. Serb sources said
three police were killed and five wounded in Tuesday's fighting.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the province's main Albanian
political figure, Ibrahim Rugova, appealed again Wednesday for
world leaders to ``intervene to stop the Serbian offensive.''
	   But Serbia's president, Milan Milutinovic, said during a visit
to Kosovo that his government ``is not threatening anyone'' and was
prepared ``to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.''
	   Police prevented reporters from traveling freely through the
Drenica area Wednesday.
	   ``There are still many terrorists there today,'' said the
commander of one Serb police checkpoint near the village of
Vucitrn. ``There will be terrorists there tomorrow and there will
be terrorists there a year from now.''
	   Along the fringes of the area, evidence of conflict was
apparent. Vaganica, a small village three kilometers (1.5 miles)
inside the Drenica area was deserted Wednesday, except for dogs and
abandoned farm animals roaming through the streets.
	   Reporters could hear the thud of distant artillery, but unlike
the day before, no small arms fire.
	   A worker from UNICEF, who refused to give his name, said
refugees were trying to escape Drenica into the town of Kosovska
Mitrovica, northwest of Pristina. He said fighting in recent months
had already driven 20,000 to the homes of relatives or to cramped
quarters in local schools and mosques.
	   Another Western aid worker, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Wednesday that people in Kosovska Mitrovica suburbs already
were packed 100 to a house and any new arrivals would have to camp
in the nearby muddy open fields.
	   At a meeting with Yugoslav army commanders, Milutinovic said the
world should put pressure on Albania because it provides bases for
the ``terrorists'' instead of threatening Yugoslavia.
	   Serbia's crackdown on Kosovo has been a costly one.
	   Yugoslav national bank governor Dusan Vlatkovic was quoted as
saying that the bank had to print extra money to cover the costs of
the clashes in Kosovo. Independent economists say the turmoil costs
Yugoslavia about dlrs 1.1 million a day.
	   The country is already faced with an estimated 30 percent
monthly inflation, unemployment of nearly 50 percent and shortages
of staples like cooking oil, sugar and milk.

	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ There may be a lot more planets out there
than previously thought, according to researchers who found the
makings of planetary systems around two stars orbiting each other
in the constellation Taurus.
	   Astronomers from the National University of Mexico tuned
powerful radio telescopes on the double-star system and found to
their surprise that each star is encircled by a dense disk of
planet-forming dust and gas. The rings contain enough material to
form two sets of planets.
	   The dust rings are surprising because the stars are relatively
close, at 4 billion miles (6.5 billion kilometers) apart. Many
scientists had theorized that the gravitational tug-of-war between
stars so close together would tear apart such rings.
	   ``I'm sure the theorists are going to have to go back to the
blackboard to see whether it makes sense that both of these stars
are retaining their disks since they're so close together,'' said
Geoffrey Marcy, who heads a four-member team of San Francisco State
researchers that has discovered several planets outside the solar
system.
	   The images of the double-star system 450 light-years from Earth
were published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
	   They are the first pictures that show discernible disks of dust
and hot gas around both stars in a binary system. Each disk extends
about 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometers) from its host star.
The stars circle each other about once every 100 years.
	   To obtain the images, Luis Rodriguez of the National University
of Mexico used the Very Large Array of the National Radio Astronomy
Laboratory in New Mexico. It can detect radio wavelengths like
those emitted by cosmic dust.
	   The findings could prompt planet-searching scientists to focus
more frequently on double-star systems, which account for about 75
percent of all stars, said Robert Mathieu, a professor of astronomy
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
	   ``If there's this one case, there's probably plenty more out
there,'' he said.
	   Of the nine planets discovered outside our solar system so far,
three are in binary star systems, although those stars orbit at a
greater distances than the pair Rodriguez examined, Marcy said.
	   If the rings discovered by Rodriguez develop into planets, a
visitor to one of those far-off worlds could witness a scene
similar to that in ``Star Wars'' where Luke Skywalker watches as
two suns set on his home planet.
	   ``If you were on one of these planets, you would see a sun in
the sky and then there would be this other faint star in the sky
with its own set of planets,'' Rodriguez said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's top fugitive took a family of
four hostage and, in a live television interview Wednesday,
threatened to blow them up with a hand grenade.
	   ``I have chosen a road and there is no return,'' Sorin Matei,
27, an escaped Greek-Romanian convict, told Athens' Skai television
station in a broadcast without precedent in Greece.
	   Four hours later and holding three hostages, anti-terrorist
police stormed the apartment. Shots were heard and a few minutes
later a detonation.
	   Witnesses reportedly saw the grenade being lobbed out of a
window. At least four ambulances left the scene.
	   The operation took place when Skai anchorman Nikos Evangelatos,
who was negotiating with Matei, cut away for a commercial break.
	   Matei had let one hostage go after an hour of negotiations with
Evangelatos, but refused to release the others.

Hometown edge boosts Sampaio Correa against favored Santos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The national soccer team has
nothing on Sampaio Correa.
	   While fans reacted coolly to Brazil's game with Yugoslavia on
Wednesday in Sao Luis, tickets quickly sold out for Thursday's game
between local favorite Sampaio Correa and Santos for the semifinals
of the Conmebol Cup.
	   Sampaio Correa is a second-division club that has never reached
the final of an international tournament. It has a chance to break
that taboo against Santos.
	   The two teams tied 0-0 in the first-leg semifinal game in
Santos. The winner of Thursday's game advances to the finals
against Atletico Mineiro or Argentina's Rosario Central.
	   Sampaio Correa is relying on the home-field advantage and a
sellout crowd at Castelao stadium in Sao Luis, a historic city
1,400 miles (2,257 kms) north of Rio.
	   But Santos has the better team. The club is in second place in
the national championship and is accustomed to big games.
	   Sampaio Correa defeated America of Brazil and Quindio of
Colombia to reach the semifinals, while Santos ousted Colombia's
Caldas and Ecuador's Liga de Quito.
	   ``I feel a great strength in Santos, with lots of desire not
only for the the national title but for the Conmebol title, too,''
defender Athirson said in an interview with O Estado de Sao Paulo.
	   Santos will be at full strength except for captain Jorginho, who
will be replaced by rookie sensation Eduardo Marques.

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Sammy Sosa tied Mark McGwire for the home run
record, breaking an 0-for-21 slump Wednesday with his 64th and 65th
homers of the season.
	   The Chicago Cubs slugger, picking on his favorite pitching
staff, homered against Milwaukee in the fifth and sixth innings,
giving him 12 against the Brewers this season.
	   He hit a solo shot to right field with one out in the fifth off
rookie Rafael Roque, who also gave up McGwire's 64th homer.
	   In the sixth, with two out, he hit a 2-2 fastball 410 feet (125
meters) to straightaway center off rookie right-hander Rod
Henderson.
	   The ball bounced off the bleachers and back onto the grass,
where center fielder Marquis Grissom retrieved it and tossed it to
the infield. Shortstop Mark Loretta then rolled it to Sosa in front
of the Cubs' dugout.
	   As he did after hitting No. 64, Sosa took a quick curtain call
to chants of ``Sam-my! Sam-my!''
	   Sosa had not gotten a hit and had struck out eight times since
hitting a grand slam last Wednesday in San Diego for No. 63. He
walked his first two times up against Roque, then sent a 1-0
fastball 344 feet (103 meters) to the opposite field, giving the
Cubs a 4-0 lead.
	   His second homer made it 7-0 and gave him 11 multihomer games
this year, tying the major league record set by Detroit's Hang
Greenb/Fht( Cmsa admitted this was the worst he felt at
the plate all year.
	   ``But I have confidence in myself and I will get out of this
jam,'' he said.
	   Sosa entered the game at sold-out County Stadium two homers
behind McGwire. The St. Louis star hit his 65th against the Brewers
on Sunday.
	   The Cardinals faced Houston on Wednesday night in St. Louis,
where McGwire has hit a Busch Stadium record 33 home runs this
season.
	   The Cubs entered the day tied with the New York Mets for the NL
wild-card berth.
	   Earlier this month, Sosa connected for Nos. 59-62 against
Milwaukee during a three-game series.
	   McGwire broke his tie with Sosa by hitting home run No. 64 in
Milwaukee on Friday night off Roque. McGwire connected for No. 65
on Sunday.

Greenspan signals need for policy-makers to act quickly

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
said Thursday that Fed policy-makers understood the need to act
quickly to contain a widening global currency crisis, raising the
prospects of an immediate cut in U.S. rates. His words sparked a
257-point rally on Wall Street.
	   Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, said
that there was a need to ``bring the existing instabilities to a
level of stability reasonably shortly to prevent the contagion from
really spilling over and creating some very significant further
difficulties for all of us.''
	   Economists said Greenspan's comments were a strong signal that
the central bank will cut interest rates when policy-makers meet
next Tuesday.
	   ``He is telling us he is going to ease at the next meeting,''
said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.
	   In response to a question, Greenspan said he could not comment
directly on whether the Fed was ready to lower interest rates
because policy makers have not yet met. But he stressed that his
colleagues at the Fed were aware of the seriousness of the global
financial crisis, which began 14 months ago in Asia, has now spread
to Russia and is threatening to strike Latin America next.
	   ``I think we know where we have to go,'' Greenspan said. ``We
don't underestimate the problem.''
	   One analyst took Greenspan's comments as a signal to expect an
interest rate drop.
	   ``Greenspan told us in unambiguous terms that he will be cutting
interest rates next Tuesday,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist
at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. ``He really emphasized global
economic turbulence and its impact on the U.S. economy.''
	   Greenspan's comments sparked a huge surge on Wall Street with
the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 257.21 points, or 3.26
percent, to close at 8154.41.

U.N demands cease-fire in Kosovo, threatens further action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. comment, China saying situation on ground is
stabilizing; Trims &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to stave off a humanitarian crisis
in the hills of Kosovo, the Security Council demanded a cease-fire
in the Yugoslav province Wednesday and threatened further action if
fighting continues.
	   The resolution, which passed 14-0, is intended to increase
pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to loosen his
grip on Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting Serb forces for
independence.
	   The resolution drafted by Britain and France is militarily
enforceable, but it doesn't explicitly authorize NATO intervention
to try to stop the Serb offensive against ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   And it requires the council to revisit the issue before any U.N.
authorization of force is granted.
	   China, which traditionally opposes intervening in what it
considers internal disputes, abstained from the vote.
	   ``We do not see the situation in Kosovo as a threat to
international peace and security,'' said Chinese ambassador Qin
Huasun.
	   ``The situation in the Kosovo region is now stabilizing,'' he
said. ``There is no large scale armed conflict, still less any
escalation of the conflict.''
	   Russia, which has opposed force in the past, went along with the
resolution because it didn't specifically authorize military
intervention, Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said.
	   ``No measures of force, and no sanctions at this stage are being
introduced by the Security Council,'' he said during the council
meeting.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed, and over a quarter million
have fled the fighting since a Serb crackdown began in February.
	   The situation is becoming urgent because an estimated 50,000
refugees are roaming the hills of Kosovo with little food and
shelter and snow fell in the area for the first time last week.
	   The resolution _ the toughest action the council has taken to
date _ comes a day before NATO defense ministers meet in Portugal
to discuss the situation.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, in New York for the
General Assembly, said that the meeting ``is a last step in
planning, not the first step in deciding'' whether to intervene in
Kosovo.
	   The United States has asked the NATO governing body to begin
rounding up commitments from NATO countries to contribute to a
possible multinational force, two senior U.S. officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Washington has said council authorization is not needed for
military intervention.
	   The resolution ``sends a clear, unequivocal message to the
authorities in Belgrade that the council is demanding that they
change their behavior and live up to their responsibilities with
regard to the political and humanitarian situation in Kosovo,''
said deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, in a statement, welcomed
the resolution and took particular note that Russia voted in favor.
	   ``The resolution sends a clear signal that the international
community's patience is exhausted,'' Cook said.
	   The resolution demands a cease-fire and urges the Serbs and
ethnic Albanian leadership to start negotiating a solution.
	   It also demands Milosevic allow international monitoring in
Kosovo and the safe return of refugees.
	   The resolution cites Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows
for the use of force by member states if regional peace and
security is threatened. Nevertheless, there is no explicit
authorization for member states to intervene.
	   The resolution says only that ``the council would consider
further action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace
and stability in the region,'' if a political settlement isn't
reached.
	   It gives no time frame.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Wednesday the
resolution was ``sufficient'' for now, but that the council and
other countries had to wait for the next stage _ presumably
Belgrade's response to the resolution _ before addressing the issue
of intervention.

Report that Mossad infecting guerrillas with leukemia draws swift
</HEADLINE>
denial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A news item in the London-based Foreign Report
suggesting that Israel's secret intelligence agency infected two
Palestinian guerrillas with leukemia drew a swift denial Wednesday
from the Israeli government.
	   The item was posted on the Foreign Report's internet site
Wednesday and appears in the upcoming issue of the magazine which
hits the stands Thursday.
	   The Report said it had learned that Mossad agents had
successfully infected two aging Palestinian guerrillas who were
active in the 1960s and 1970s, with the cancer leukemia. Wadi
Haddad, who allegedly participated in hijacking as a member of a
Palestinian organization, was infected while in a hospital in the
former East Germany where he died, the Report said. The Report did
not say when Haddad died and added that the story was unconfirmed.
	   The Report named the second man as the notorious terrorist Sabri
al-Banna, better known as Abu Nidal, who is rumored to be
hospitalized with leukemia in Egypt, though the Egyptian government
has denied Nidal is in their country.
	   One hour after the Report's story received prominent coverage on
Israel TV's evening news, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's aide
issued a statement calling the story ``irresponsible.''
	   ``No such incident ever took place and the magazine is again
displaying irresponsibility when it misleads the public,'' said the
statement signed by Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky.
	   Another recent Foreign Report story said that four employees
were killed and 25 injured in accidents at a secretive biological
facility in Israel. That report was also denied by Israel.

Meryl Streep adds an accent to her repertoire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Actress Meryl Streep, an old hand at
acquiring exotic accents, had a little difficulty with the Irish
dialect for her latest film, ``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' but beer
helped, she said Wednesday.
	   She ``made it difficult'' for herself to perfect the County
Donegal brogue, ``but when I relaxed with a pint or two, it was
fine,'' she told a news conference before Wednesday's Dublin film
premiere.
	   The production was adapted from the Brian Friel play, which was
a hit in London and on Broadway .
	   Streep said she found the script ``singularly unusual in its
subject matter, subtlety, delicacy and aspiration.''
	   The actress, 49, plays a 1930s Donegal spinster _ the eldest of
five unmarried sisters in the fictitious village of Ballybeg.
	   She said she had wanted to work with the movie's director, Pat
O'Connor _ '' I've admired his work for a long time.''

Zedillo pledges government will continue to help Chiapas

<TEXT>
	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ With a message to boost spirits in
flood-ravaged Chiapas, President Ernesto Zedillo promised Wednesday
that the government will not turn away from the troubled southern
state after emergency efforts have ended.
	   Chiapas, one of the country's poorest states, also has been
caught in a 4 1/2-year-old rebel uprising and subsequent political
violence.
	   ``Chiapas, for its conditions of poverty and inequality will
continue to receive the highest priority from the federal
government,'' Zedillo said while making his sixth visit to the
flooded region. ``The attention of the federal government on
Chiapas is not new and will not fade.''
	   So far, 185 people have been confirmed dead, the president said.
Catholic Church leaders in Chiapas estimated the toll could rise to
between 400 and 500.
	   Tens of thousands of people lost their homes in the storms and
the government has begun sending in construction materials so that
they may build new ones.
	   The president said the flooding destroyed 247,100 acres (100,000
hectares) of corn, coffee, sesame and other crops and that the
government will launch a special replanting program.
	   Catholic Church leaders appealed for more food aid and suggested
that local churches take a greater role in distributing the
donations because they better understand where help is most needed.
	   Tapachula Bishop Felipe Arizmendi, who visited Mexico City on
Tuesday night, said the church and the military must work together
to help flood victims.
	   ``Fortunately, despite mutual distrust between the church and
the army that long has existed, we have developed a very close
relationship of collaboration,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, about 760 miles (1,200 kilometers) up the coast,
intense rains on Tuesday washed out roads in western Jalisco state
and cut communication links to several communities.
	   Food and blankets were being flow into the towns by helicopter,
according to the government news agency Notimex.
	   Officials in the Pacific resort of Puerto Vallarta reported dlrs
400,000 in damage. At least three homes were destroyed by raging
flood waters and dozens of others were damaged.

AC Milan, Juventus, Fiorentina qualify for third round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ German striker Oliver Bierhoff kicked in the
qualifying goal with four minutes left at San Siro stadium
Wednesday night to give AC Milan an unhoped-for third-round berth
in the Italian Cup.
	   The 3-0 home victory against second-division Torino in the
second-round, second-leg of the competition allowed the Milan
powerhouse to overturn a 0-2 first-leg deficit and advance on a 3-2
aggregate.
	   Bierhoff, who headed in three goals in the two first league
matches, carried away 35,000 partisan fans as he scored AC Milan's
third goal with a powerful right drive in the 86th minute.
	   The qualifier by the newly-signed German striker added to two
second-half goals in two minutes by Danish midfielder Thomas Helveg
and Liberian forward George Weah.
	   In the third round Milan takes on Lazio of Rome in a repeat of
last season's Italian Cup final won by the Roman team.
	   Lazio, which has been struggling in the initial league matches
despite a stellar forward line, overcame second-division Cosenza
2-0 to advance on a 4-1 aggregate.
	   A late goal by Yugoslav midfielder Dejan Stankovic added to an
own goal by Cosenza.
	   Lazio initially kept its Chilean striker Marcelo Salas on the
substitutes bench. The South American star was then fielded as
substitute of Italian World Cup hero Christian Vieri, the season's
most expensive transfer from Atletico Madrid.
	   Otherwise Uruguayan forwards Daniel Fonseca and Marcelo Zalayeta
scored two goals each in Juventus' 4-0 victory against low-ranked
Ravenna.
	   Only 583 fans, an all-time low for La Juve, watched the match at
Turin's Delle Alpi arena.
	   Juventus, the defending league champion and the current Serie A
co-leader in a tie with AC Milan and Fiorentina, advanced on a 6-0
aggregate and will play Venezia in the third round.
	   Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta and Portuguese midfielder
Rui Costa gave Fiorentina a 2-0 victory against Padova and a
third-round berth.
	   Argentine centerforward Roberto Carlos Sosa tallied two goals in
Udinese's clearcut 4-0 victory against third-division Gualdo.
Brazilian forward Amoroso and midfielder Stephan Appiah of Ghana
scored the two other goals for the team of Udine.
	   Other third-round qualifiers included Bologna, Sampdoria of
Genoa, Bari, Parma, Atalanta of Bergamo and Castel di Sangro.
	   Colombian star Faustino Asprilla scored Parma's game winner
against Genoa, for a 4-0 aggregate.
	   Castel di Sangro, a third-division team, was the most surprising
qualifier as it eliminated first-division Salernitana on a 2-0
aggregate.
	   AS Roma qualified on Tuesday, beating Chievo.
	   Inter Milan, led by Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio, is at Cesena
Thursday night in the last match of the second round.
	   Third-round, first-leg matches are scheduled on Oct. 28.

Hamas backers renew vows of revenge over slain fugitives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ About 4,000 supporters of the
radical Islamic group Hamas rallied Wednesday in memory of two of
the group's members slain by Israeli troops earlier this month.
	   ``Revenge, revenge!'' they chanted, while Palestinian police
watched from a distance but did not interfere. ``Allahu akbar _ God
is great!''
	   The demonstrators waved green Islamic flags and large pictures
of Hamas fugitives and brothers, Adel and Imad Awadallah, who were
slain Sept. 11 when Israeli troops raided their West Bank hideout.
Both were wanted for attacks on Israel.
	   The rally, staged in a Gaza City refugee camp, was the biggest
Hamas gathering in Gaza in more than a year, since the release of
Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin from Israeli jail last September.
	   Yassin, the group's founder and spiritual leader, addressed the
crowd, telling them, ``We should continue our armed struggle, our
jihad, to face the enemy by all means,'' he said. ``We will follow
our way until victory.''
	   Hamas had threatened to stage attacks and kidnap Israeli
soldiers during the two-day Jewish New Year's holiday, which ended
at sundown Tuesday without incident.
	   Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip before the
holidays in response to threats following the killing of the
Awadallah brothers, but has been gradually easing the closure and
allowing Palestinian workers to begin returning to jobs in Israel.
	   In a leaflet distributed at the rally, Hamas warned that the
danger of attacks had not passed.
	   ``The feeling of insecurity in the Israeli street will remain.
We will make them afraid, because we are going to take revenge in
spite of all challenges,'' said the leaflet, signed by Hamas'
military wing.
	   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has an uneasy relationship
with Hamas, trying to avoid open confrontation but also trying to
meet Israeli demands to crack down on militants.

Scuffles break out at headquarters of Egyptian leftist party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with shots fired &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Shots were fired Wednesday in a brawl
involving a nephew of the late President Anwar Sadat at the
headquarters of an Egyptian leftist party.
	   Egypt's official Middle East News Agency and an official of the
party's newspaper said several shots were fired during scuffles
between supporters of rival leaders of the al-Ahrar Socialist
Party.
	   MENA reported that one man was wounded in the hand. An official
of the Al-Ahrar daily, who refused to give his name, declined to
say whose supporters had opened fire or give further details.
	   No police spokesman was available late Wednesday to comment on
the shooting, but earlier police officials had told The Associated
Press that two men were slightly injured in the fistfight.
	   Police called in scores of officers to quell the fighting among
some 250 party members in the al-Ahrar offices in downtown Cairo,
the officials said.
	   The clashes began after Talaat Sadat, nephew of the former
president, stormed the party headquarters with his followers,
demanding to run in the election. Sadat had been barred from the
polls, which were triggered by the death of the party's leader last
month.
	   A leading candidate, Ragab Hamadeh, retaliated by calling in
about 200 supporters to throw Sadat out, said the police officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The al-Ahrar party, which was founded in 1975, calls for greater
political freedom, worker's rights, and the abolition of the state
of emergency, which has been in force since Sadat's assassination
in 1981.

Ineffective Ajax downed by Fortuna
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ An unusually weak Ajax performance
Wednesday saw the Amsterdam champion fortunate to escape with only
a 1-0 defeat at lowly Fortuna Sittard.
	   The win was Fortuna's first of the season while Ajax's first
defeat dropped it down to sixth with 11 points from six games.
	   Feyenoord still leads the league with 15 points from five games,
ahead of SC Heerenveen, Vitesse Arnhem and FC Twente, which all won
Wednesday and share second place on 13 points from six.
	   The Fortuna winner came from a Robert Roest penalty after Ajax
defender Mario Melchiot was caught pulling the shirt of Fortuna
star Regillio Simons after five minutes of the second half.
	   But the scoreline did not reflect the dominance of Fortuna which
forced seven or eight good chances in the first half alone.
	   The most spectacular attempt came from Mark van Bommel who
spotted Edwin van der Sar off his line and beat the Ajax keeper
from the half-way line only to see his shot go just wide.
	   But Ajax escaped further embarrassment thanks to Van der Sar,
who was repeatedly forced to make daring saves from the rampant
Fortuna forwards.
	   Heerenveen owed its 1-0 victory over FC Utrecht to a fortunate
deflection as defender Tom van Mol directed Romanian Dumitru
Mitrita's shot past his own keeper.
	   Goals from the Yugoslav duo of Marko Perovic and Dejan Curovic
gave Vitesse a 2-0 victory over RKC Waalwijk and Twente downed MVV
Maastricht 2-1.

Health workers need dlrs 40 million more to wipe out polio in 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The world may miss its goal of eradicating
polio in 2000 if health workers cannot find up to dlrs 40 million
more to fight the paralyzing disease in Africa, experts told a
congressional subcommittee Wednesday.
	   ``Until the last bastion of polio in Africa is eliminated, the
whole world is at risk,'' warned Dr. Ebrahim Samba of the World
Health Organization.
	   Wild polio has been eradicated from the Western Hemisphere since
1991, and most of Europe and the Western Pacific also is
polio-free.
	   But doctors are fighting to stamp out the last polio in other
countries, and the biggest challenge remains Africa, where war and
poverty have impeded vaccination attempts.
	   All children, even in polio-free countries like the United
States, must continue to be vaccinated until the virus is wiped out
worldwide, because infected travelers can spread polio anywhere.
	   ``It is going to be difficult to go the rest of the way,'' said
Surgeon General David Satcher. ``Are we committed to finishing this
race?''
	   The WHO estimates a budget shortfall of dlrs 30 million to dlrs
40 million next year in Africa, and hopes the United States will
lead other countries in filling that gap.
	   The United States spent dlrs 56 million on global polio
eradication this year. The House recommended spending dlrs 47
million next year, while the Senate recommended dlrs 75 million.
Lawmakers are working toward a compromise.
	   Sen. Dale Bumpers called polio eradication a good investment: In
addition to ending suffering, it would save dlrs 230 million
annually in U.S. health care once polio vaccination could cease.

Mexican officials say massacre survivor still in coma

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican prosecutors said an alleged
drug-trafficker who survived the massacre of his extended family
last week remained in a coma Wednesday, contrary to a newspaper's
report that he had awoken.
	   ``It's a total lie,'' a spokesman for the attorney general in
Baja California state said on condition of customary anonymity.
	   A report published Wednesday by the Mexico City daily Reforma
said Fermin Castro had emerged from a coma and spoken to
investigators.
	   Police believe Castro was the target of the Sept. 17 slayings,
in which 18 children, women and men died at a ranch near Ensenada,
a popular resort city 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of the U.S.
border.
	   The government news agency Notimex reported Wednesday afternoon
that Castro, who suffered a bullet wound to the head, was still in
coma at an Ensenada hospital.
	   Federal police have detained 10 people in connection with the
killings at El Sauzal ranch.
	   Investigators say the massacre may have been related to Castro's
alleged drug-trafficking activities. Relatives, however, say Castro
is a rancher with no involvement in drugs.
	   Fermin's sister, Margarita Castro Ramirez, is seeking an
injunction that would protect him from prosecution by the Attorney
General's Office, Notimex reported.

Policemen charged after death of Nigerian deportee

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's interior minister came under
severe criticism Wednesday after a Nigerian woman died following a
struggle with police trying to deport her. Two policemen were
charged with assault.
	   A few dozen demonstrators forced their way into the Belgian
senate, shouting that Interior Minister Louis Tobback was a
``murderer'' and demanding his resignation. Tobback said he would
consider stepping down only if it was proven the police force made
errors.
	   ``I will take full responsibility for what occurred,'' he said.
``What will happen over the coming days, I will decide for
myself.''
	   The government and judicial authorities are investigating
Tuesday's incident at Brussels international airport. As Semira
Adamu resisted efforts to strap her into a seat on a Togo-bound
plane, police subdued her by putting a pillow on her face.
	   As passengers looked on, the 20-year-old Adamu struggled and
lapsed into a coma. She was taken to hospital where she died hours
later of a brain hemorrhage.
	   Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed her
family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already has
three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant her
refugee status.
	   Police had tried to deport Adamu six times.
	   Politicians from the ruling center-left coalition and the
opposition called for reform of asylum procedures and many
expressed outrage that the use of a pillow to subdue recalcitrant
asylum seekers was standard practice.
	   ``The asylum policy has to be humane,'' said Senator Bert
Anciaux, chairman of the opposition ID21 party.
	   Judicial authorities interrogated three policemen who were
involved in the deportation attempt and charged two with assault
and battery without the intent to kill. They were detained for
several hours and then released.
	   At a news conference, Tobback said he regretted the incident but
insisted the police had acted legally in expelling Adamu, who had
exhausted her court appeals.
	   Nevertheless, he said, ``What happened is one of the blackest
days in my political career.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International condemned the
asylum laws.
	   ``The death of Semira is part of a series of complaints and is
the results of several new laws to get asylum in Belgium,'' said AI
spokeswoman Joelle Noel.
	   Some 4,000 people whose asylum requests were turned down by the
Belgian authorities were repatriated last year. Some 300 needed
police escorts.

Spain defeats Russia 1-0 in Camacho's first game as coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRANADA, Spain (AP) _ Spain managed to dim memories of recent
soccer disasters with a 1-0 victory in Wednesday's exhibition match
against Russia, the team's first game under new coach Jose Antonio
Camacho.
	   The partial redemption from the team's last performance, a 3-2
defeat by soccer minnow Cyprus, came in the 39th minute with a
curving left-footed goal shot from outside the box from Bittor
Alkiza.
	   Camacho had included seven changes in the squad he took to the
southern city of Granada. He put three new faces on the field,
including Alkiza.
	   The Russian squad had a tough task with the capacity stadium
cheering every chance to forget the Cyprus defeat and Spain's
embarrassing exit from the World Cup in the first round.
	   And the Russians failed to take full advantage when defender
Sergi Barjuan was sent off in the 26th minute for a bungled block
in front of the Spanish goal. A diving save from Santiago Canizares
prevented Alexander Mostovoi from successfully converting the
resulting penalty and the score remained 0-0.
	   Down to 10 men, Spain sealed the final scoreline when Alkiza
scored six minutes before the break.
	   Camacho took over from Javier Clemente after six years on the
job. Spain _ one of the world's great soccer nations _ had failed
to win a single title during Clemente's reign.
	   ``I think we have started well,'' Camacho said after the match.

Defense ministers will have to pose a credible threat of force
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES with NATO reaction to U.N. decision &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) - Tough talk and sabre-rattling over
Kosovo haven't made much of an impression on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, so NATO defense ministers meeting here Thursday
and Friday will have to ratchet things up a notch to get his
attention.
	   NATO welcomed Wednesday's U.N. Security Council resolution
demanding a cease-fire in Kosovo, a part of Serbia, which is the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Particularly appreciated,
according to one alliance official who spoke on condition of
anonymity, was ``the firm language'' of the resolution.
	   NATO sources said a number of nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, already have made committments of men and aircraft to
any future military action against Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic's massive attacks on ethnic Albanian villages in
Kosovo have continued unabated despite previous NATO threats. His
seven-month crackdown on separatists fighting for the independence
of Kosovo has claimed hundreds of lives and forced as many as
275,000 people from their homes.
	   The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking body, is
scheduled to meet Thursday morning and is expected to issue an
``activation warning'' to the military, which the official said
``moves the planning from paper to planes.''
	   ``It is a significant upping of the ante,'' he said.
	   Forceful statements from the alliance's foreign ministers at
their meeting in Luxembourg in June had no visible effect. Massive
air exercises over Albania and Macedonia frightened no one. Ground
exercises in the same region failed to impress Belgrade. And recent
word out of Washington and Bonn that alliance patience is wearing
thin have had less effect on Serb forces than a speed bump on an
Abrams tank.
	   It's not only Kosovo that seems to be falling apart. In Bosnia,
where the allies have spent billions of dollars and claimed one of
their greatest successes, a Serbian hardliner has defeated the
moderate Biljana Plavsic for the Bosnian Serb presidency, a severe
blow to Western plans.
	   All of this should give the defense ministers from the 16 NATO
nations, along with their counterparts from the three newly
selected members Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, plenty to
talk about in this sun and sand resort on Portugal's south coast.
	   NATO military planners have set out a wide range of options for
action in Kosovo. Now the generals are waiting for the word from
the political side.
	   ``We know there are at least 50,000 people camping out in
Kosovo,'' said one NATO official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``Their campfires are creating enough thermal heat to be
picked up by satellite.''
	   The Vilamoura gathering is the ministers' annual ``informal''
meeting, an occasion to sit around in relaxed setting and
brainstorm problems facing the alliance. While ministers don't
usually make decisions at these meetings, the rapidly developing
situation in the Balkans should focus their attention. The allies
could issue an ``activation warning,'' setting the military
machinery in motion and moving Kosovo preparations one step closer
to action.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said NATO should launch air
strikes against Milosevic in three to five weeks. Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel sounded just as tough: ``He must realize the
international community will move with military force if
necessary.''
	   Four months ago, passions were high at NATO and the alliance was
threatening imminent action. That passion cooled over the summer,
however, as Western capitals questioned the effectiveness of a
direct military intervention. Now, senior diplomats in the United
States and Germany and sounding the get-tough siren again.
	   ``Things are coming to a head,'' said one NATO diplomat.
	   Thursday and Friday's meeting will mark the first time that
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic participate fully in NATO
deliberations. Fourteen of the 16 existing NATO nations have voted
to ratify accession of the three new members. The Netherlands and
Turkey have yet to do so.
	   The three will be officially welcomed into the NATO fold at a
summit in Washington next April.

U.N demands cease-fire in Kosovo, threatens further action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RECAST &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to stave off a humanitarian crisis
in the hills of Kosovo, the Security Council demanded a cease-fire
in the Yugoslav province Wednesday and threatened further action if
fighting continues.
	   The resolution, which passed 14-0, is intended to increase
pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to loosen his
grip on Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting Serb forces for
independence.
	   The resolution drafted by Britain and France is militarily
enforceable, but it doesn't explicitly authorize NATO intervention
to try to stop the Serb offensive against ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   The United States has said NATO doesn't need council authority
to intervene, and NATO defense ministers were meeting Thursday in
Portugal to discuss the situation. But there were serious questions
about how any military action could successfully be carried out,
particularly over who would be targeted and how.
	   The United States, however, has asked the NATO governing body to
begin rounding up commitments from NATO countries to contribute to
a possible multinational force, two senior U.S. officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Western powers generally support returning autonomy to Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians, but steadfastly reject the campaign for
independence being waged by the Kosovo Liberation Army and the
Albanian nationals who are supplying them arms.
	   ``One can think of airstrikes, but who will you strike,''
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini asked during a briefing here
Wednesday. ``How are you going to distinguish one from another? Who
do you want to punish?''
	   China, which traditionally opposes intervening in what it
considers internal disputes, abstained from the vote.
	   ``We do not see the situation in Kosovo as a threat to
international peace and security,'' said Chinese ambassador Qin
Huasun.
	   ``The situation in the Kosovo region is now stabilizing,'' he
said. ``There is no large scale armed conflict, still less any
escalation of the conflict.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed, and over a quarter million
have fled the fighting since a Serb crackdown began in February.
	   The situation is becoming urgent because an estimated 50,000
refugees are roaming the hills of Kosovo with little food and
shelter and snow fell in the area for the first time last week.
	   The resolution demands a cease-fire and urges the Serbs and
ethnic Albanian leadership to start negotiating a solution to the
crisis.
	   It also demands Milosevic allow international monitoring in
Kosovo and the safe return of refugees.
	   Russia, which has opposed force in the past, went along with the
resolution because it didn't specifically authorize military
intervention, Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said.
	   ``No measures of force, and no sanctions at this stage are being
introduced by the Security Council,'' he said during the council
meeting.
	   Britain and the United States, however, saw the resolution as
the first step in cracking down on Milosevic.
	   The resolution ``sends a clear, unequivocal message to the
authorities in Belgrade that the council is demanding that they
change their behavior and live up to their responsibilities with
regard to the political and humanitarian situation in Kosovo,''
said Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, in a statement, welcomed
the resolution and took particular note that Russia voted in favor.
	   ``The resolution sends a clear signal that the international
community's patience is exhausted,'' Cook said.
	   The resolution cites Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows
for the use of force by member states if regional peace and
security is threatened. Nevertheless, there is no explicit
authorization for member states to intervene.
	   The resolution says only that ``the council would consider
further action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace
and stability in the region,'' if a political settlement isn't
reached.
	   It gives no time frame.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Wednesday the
resolution was ``sufficient'' for now, but that the council and
other countries had to wait for the next stage _ presumably
Belgrade's response to the resolution _ before addressing the issue
of intervention.

Russian middle class on the hunt for jobs, with little success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug to conform with digest &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The primly dressed Russians waited in a line
hundreds of people long, slowly shuffling forward, somber and
unsure of what they would find at the end.
	   They found frustrated job seekers like themselves, shoving and
elbowing each other toward small booths, hearing painful answers to
desperate questions.
	   ``How much are you paying accountants?'' ...
	   ``Well, how much experience have you got? None?'' There is an
alternative: ``We pay truck drivers 300 rubles (dlrs 19) a month.''
	   As Russia endures its latest financial crisis and companies fire
thousands of employees, the country's fledgling middle class is
joining the lines at job fairs in a desperate hunt for work _ and
finding that the middle class may no longer exist.
	   When Communism fell, many Russians found work with private firms
that paid them enough to live comfortably, travel, and buy more
luxury goods.
	   That created a middle class that could never have existed during
the Soviet Union _ when private companies were banned and western
amenities were too expensive for all but the elite.
	   But the latest economic crunch _ and Wednesday's job fair in
southern Moscow _ showed how fragile the middle class was, and how
desperate those who belonged to it are to sustain their new
lifestyles.
	   ``People are first looking at how much the job pays, and then
whether it falls within their specialty,'' said Alexander Lugovoi,
a manager with a company that reworks hard metals. ``Really,
they're looking for anything available.''
	   Most of the job offers were for work in factories, the city bus
system, or other state-owned entities that offered wages of about
1,500 rubles (dlrs 100) a month. The jobs most sought, with
companies that pay wages on time and offer chances for advancement,
are nearly nonexistent.
	   ``There's nothing for me here,'' said 40-year-old Margarita
Kolosova, an accountant who was fired earlier this summer.
``There's no demand for people of my age or specialty. If I'd known
it would be like this, I wouldn't have come.''
	   Some lined up to talk with lawyers, job counselors, and even
psychologists for advice about their mostly fruitless efforts.
	   ``You've got to have a strategy, some goal you're shooting
for,'' said one job counselor, who refused to give his name, to a
pair of job seekers having little success.
	   Others had already found a strategy for finding work: Settle for
less.
	   ``I came looking for something that would pay dlrs 500 to dlrs
1000 a month,'' said 30-year-old Artur Girsh, who lost his job when
his food import company went bankrupt at the start of the crisis.
``But if I got even half that, it would be acceptable.''
	   Still, even those willing to take lower wages said it wasn't
easy to find work that suited their experience, or their minimal
expectations.
	   ``I'm looking for construction work, something that pays around
2000 rubles (dlrs 125) a month,'' said 30-year-old Andrei Tsaryov,
who came in from the Saratov region to test his luck in Moscow's
job market. ``Back home they've been withholding my salary for half
a year. Even though I'm not having much luck, I've got to keep
looking.''

Sweden calls for nuclear weapons-free world, other initiatives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sweden and seven other nations plan to
push a resolution for a nuclear weapons-free world, the Swedish
foreign minister said Wednesday
	   ``New and forceful impetus is urgently needed to bring back the
momentum for nuclear disarmament,'' Lena Hjelm-Wallen told the U.N.
General Assembly in a prepared speech that also urged other
countries to eradicate poverty, promote human rights and democracy
and work toward disarmament and peaceful settlement of armed
conflicts.
	   Sweden was a party to the initiative several months ago that led
to a Security Council resolution deploring the nuclear testing done
in May by neighboring rivals India and Pakistan.
	   ``After a decade of great promise in the field of nuclear
non-proliferation and disarmament, the specter of nuclear weapons
is again at the center of attention,'' she said.
	   This threat comes amid economic turbulence, persistent poverty,
environmental degradation, regional conflicts and terrorism, she
said.
	   The Asian economic crisis that is spreading to other developing
economies has made poor countries poorer, she said, and poverty,
human rights, democracy and conflict are interlinked.
	   ``Empty stomachs do not provide a sustainable ground for
democracy. Individual human security and the security of the planet
must be given as much recognition as the security of states,''
Hjelm-Wallen said. ``Putting an end to poverty is imperative. Large
economic inequalities and lack of civic infrastructure create
friction between individuals, between groups, between countries.''
	   In its battle against these evils, Sweden backs the call to
eliminate the death penalty and to end the exploitation of
children. Hjelm-Wallen said a convention on child labor should be
agreed at the next International Labor Conference.
	   The treaty establishing an international war crimes court is
also a milestone in the struggle against genocide and crimes
against humanity, she said.
	   ``Sweden is committed to become a party,'' Hjelm-Wallen said.
``It is imperative to close the gap of impunity.''

Pakistan says it will adhere to nuclear test ban treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Pakistan's prime minister said Wednesday
his country would unilaterally adhere to the nuclear test ban
treaty, but called on international pressure to force rival India
to do the same.
	   Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan was ready for adherance before a
nuclear conference in September 1999 if international sanctions
were speedily lifted.
	   ``Pakistan is ... prepared to adhere to the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty before this conference,'' Sharif told world leaders at
the U.N. General Assembly session.
	   ``In this regard, we expect that the arbitrary restrictions
imposed on Pakistan by multilateral institutions will be speedily
removed,'' Sharif said.
	   ``We also expect that discriminatory sanctions against Pakistan
will be lifted,'' he said.
	   But Sharif warned that Pakistan would comply with a ban on
nuclear tests only so long as India did the same.
	   ``If India were to resume nuclear testing, Pakistan will review
its position,'' Sharif said.
	   Both India and Pakistan carried out nuclear tests last May,
drawing international sanctions and calls to sign the test ban
treaty.

Seven arrested in anti-terrorist operation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMs, updates and adds background  &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In an anti-terrorist operation before dawn
Wednesday, police arrested seven men in London but would not reveal
what they were suspected of doing.
	   The British news agency Press Association said it was understood
that the operation was aimed at associates of Osama bin Laden, the
Saudi dissident who has been linked to the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Scotland Yard provided few details, but did say the arrests were
not thought to be linked with any unsolved terrorist incident. The
police headquarters said that at this stage it could provide no
information on whether those detained were suspected of plotting
actions in Britain or abroad. There was no indication of possible
targets.
	   Scotland Yard said the arrests were the culmination of an
operation involving police Special Branch and the MI5 national
intelligence agency over a period of several weeks. The information
was passed to Scotland Yard's Anti-Terrorist Branch, which made the
arrest.
	   Scotland Yard did not identify the suspects in any way, but said
they were seized in dawn raids at addresses in northwest and west
London, and were being questioned at a London police station. An
eighth address, believed to be business premises, was also
searched.
	   A Scotland Yard spokeswoman, asked whether the British agencies
involved had been in touch with America's FBI over the arrests,
would say only that the Metropolitan Police Service ``liaises
regularly'' with international law enforcement agencies.
	   Bin Laden, a multi-millionaire Islamic fundamentalist is
suspected of using his wealth to finance the two Aug. 7 bombings of
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam that killed 258
people and injured thousands more.
	   The attacks prompted American retaliation _ missile attacks on
suspected terrorist facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan, where bin
Laden is based. The Saudi escaped injury and remains at large.
	   The FBI believes that al Qaida, an international terrorist
organization allegedly led by bin Laden, is committed to murdering
American military personnel worldwide.
	   Two men, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali and Mohamed Sadeek
Odeh, were taken to the United States last month on murder and
conspiracy charges in connection with the Nairobi bombing.
	   The FBI is seeking Haroun Fazil, from the Comoros Islands, in
connection with the bombings, and have put a reward of up to dlrs 2
million dollars on his head.

	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Forcibly accustomed to
the ravages of hurricanes, Virgin Islanders this week found
themselves coping yet again _ without water, power, telephones and
even roofs over their heads.
	   Hurricane Georges slammed into St. Thomas, St. John and St.
Croix on Monday, but on Wednesday many residents still could not
pick up the phone and hear a dial tone.
	   The storm's 110-mph (180 kph) fury sank dozens of boats, smashed
wooden piers and boardwalks, and stripped the pristine islands of
much of their lush green foliage. It blew away many of the blue
tarpaulins that had served as roofs for dozens of families since
disastrous Hurricane Marilyn hit three years ago.
	   ``I cry all the time when I see my home,'' said Milda Luz
Mendez, 49, whose roof was blown off. ``This is the fourth time I'm
losing my roof in 10 years, beginning with Hurricane Hugo. I don't
know if I can take this any longer.''
	   National guard troops and 75 U.S. marshals brought to the island
at Gov. Roy Schneider's request joined police in patrols against
looting. An 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew was in effect.
	   In St. Croix, a looter shot to death 62-year-old Orlando Orta
while burglarizing his house, said deputy police chief Novell
Francis. He also said police arrested an unspecifed number of
looters at a Christiansted business Wednesday morning.
	   By initial accounts, this week's damage wasn't nearly as
catastrophic as that caused by Marilyn, or Hurricane Hugo a decade
ago. Several people were injured by flying debris, one man was
hospitalized in a coma after a roof collapse and two people, both
houseboat dwellers, were reported missing.
	   Yet Georges struck another blow to a tourism-dependent economy
that has struggled since Hurricanes Marilyn and Luis paid visits in
1995 and Hurricane Bertha the next year.
	   Federal inspectors fanned out across the U.S. islands Wednesday
to come up with a preliminary damage estimate.
	   Hardest hit was St. Croix, where officials estimated nearly a
third of homes were damaged in Frederiksted, one of the island's
two main cities with a population of 5,000.
	   On Wednesday, crews removed coconut palms and other debris from
streets in a city that hardly resembled its former self.
	   The Ann E. Abrahamson pier, a familiar sight to cruise ship
visitors, was extensively damaged by a 20-foot (6-meter) storm
surge swept into jewelry stores on the streets.
	   Also in Frederiksted, a 60-foot (18-meter) wooden fisherman's
wharf was destroyed, its last planks sinking into the sea long
after the storm passed. A 15-foot (4.5-meter) boat was left sitting
squarely on King Street, and other boats were sunken at marinas.
	   In Christiansted and its suburbs, with a population of about
15,000, a boardwalk tourist attraction was nearly washed away and
the beach severely eroded around the well-known Hotel on the Key.
	   Wooden staircases and windows at the pink, Danish-style
Christian Hotel were broken. The lawn of a new park was destroyed.
	   Across the three islands, some 2,400 tourists weathered out the
storm in hotels, most of them in St. Thomas, according to the
Virgin Islands Tourism Association. More than 900 residents were
sheltered during the storm, the Red Cross said.
	   As well as phone service, many residents were still without
power and water. But it was unclear how many because officials did
not have firm figures yet.

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ Tough talk and saber-rattling over
Kosovo haven't made much of an impression on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, so NATO defense ministers meeting here Thursday
and Friday will have to ratchet things up a notch to get his
attention.
	   NATO welcomed Wednesday's U.N. Security Council resolution
demanding a cease-fire in Kosovo, a part of Serbia, which is the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Particularly appreciated,
according to one alliance official who spoke on condition of
anonymity, was ``the firm language'' of the resolution.
	   NATO sources said a number of nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, already have committed men and aircraft to any future
military action against Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic's massive attacks on ethnic Albanian villages in
Kosovo have continued unabated despite previous NATO threats. His
seven-month crackdown on separatists fighting for the independence
of Kosovo has claimed hundreds of lives and forced as many as
275,000 people from their homes.
	   The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking body, is
scheduled to meet Thursday morning and is expected to issue an
``activation warning'' to the military, which the official said
``moves the planning from paper to planes.''
	   ``It is a significant upping of the ante,'' he said.

Oldest ex-major league player dies at 107
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSSINING, New York (AP) _ Chet ``Red'' Hoff, the oldest former
U.S. major league baseball player who struck out Ty Cobb in his
first appearance, is dead at 107.
	   ``He still followed baseball, of course being partial to the
Yankees, and knew all the names of the players, including their
stats,'' his daughter Eve Kelley said.
	   Hoff, who died last Thursday at a nursing home in Daytona Beach,
Florida, was buried Tuesday in his birthplace of Ossining.
	   Hoff was 2-4 with a 2.49 ERA in 23 games over four years in the
majors. He signed with the New York Highlanders, who later became
the Yankees, in 1911 after an Ossining semipro team owner got him a
tryout.
	   Hoff played in the minors in Rochester, in 1914, before
returning to the majors with the St. Louis Browns the following
year.
	   After a few more years in the minors, he returned to Ossining
and played in semipro leagues on weekends. His team sometimes
played exhibition games against the inmates at Sing Sing prison,
located in the city.
	   For his 100th birthday, Hoff was interviewed by Joe Garagiola,
then a host for NBC's ``Today Show.''
	   ``The show made him somewhat of a celebrity, and people from
across the country wrote to him in hopes of obtaining his
autograph,'' said James Riley, a baseball historian.
	   In a 1993 interview with Gannett Suburban Newspapers, the former
pitcher remembered his first game in the majors. He recalled
striking out the first batter he faced, learning the next day that
it had been Cobb.

Pakistan says it will adhere to nuclear ban treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Pakistan's prime minister said Wednesday
his country would unilaterally adhere to the nuclear test ban
treaty, but warned that compliance would depend on whether rival
India resumed its tests and on the world lifting sanctions imposed
after the tests.
	   Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan was ready for adherence before a
nuclear conference in September 1999.
	   ``In this regard, we expect that the arbitrary restrictions
imposed on Pakistan by multilateral institutions will be speedily
removed,'' Sharif told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly
session.
	   ``We also expect that discriminatory sanctions against Pakistan
will be lifted,'' he said.
	   First India and then Pakistan carried out nuclear tests last
May, drawing international sanctions and calls to sign the test ban
treaty.
	   Sharif warned that Pakistan would comply with a ban on nuclear
tests only so long as India did not carry out any more tests.
	   ``If India were to resume nuclear testing, Pakistan will review
its position,'' Sharif said.
	   Pakistan and India are old enemies, having fought three wars,
including two over the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
	   Artillery duels across the Kashmir dividing line, which is
monitored by the United Nations, routinely break out between the
hostile neighbors. The last major exchange was in late July and
early August, when shelling killed more than 100 civilians on both
sides of the border.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee met with Sharif
earlier Wednesday and afterward said that his country's nuclear
policy did not depend on Pakistan.
	   ``Both countries are taking independent decisions. Pakistan is
free to decide on the CTBT, but India will decide independently,''
said Vajpayee. It was unclear whether he knew then about Sharif's
decision to sign the treaty.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he welcomed Pakistan's
decision.
	   ``The government of Pakistan is to be commended for heeding the
concern of the international community,'' he said in a statement.
	   Economic sanctions were imposed against both countries after the
tests, but India _ with its more robust economy _ has managed to
weather them better than Pakistan, which has been pushed to the
brink of economic collapse.
	   Pakistan's agreement to halt future tests should unblock
suspended international loans.
	   A joint team from the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank has been in Pakistan since earlier this month to try to put
together a package of credits and loans. Pakistan has a dlrs 32.1
billion external debt and an acute shortage of foreign currency.

Moody's lowers New Zealand's credit rating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Moody's Investor Services on
Thursday downgraded New Zealand's credit rating, a move that had
been widely expected as a result of the Asian financial crisis.
	   Moody's said the downgrade reflected New Zealand's worsening
economy conditions and continued pressure on the country's external
accounts.
	   Moody's said all Aa1 rated foreign currency bonds and notes
issued by the government had been downgraded to Aa2.
	   The effect of the downgrade is likely to be negligible, Finance
Minister Bill Birch said.
	   ``Over the last 18 months, domestic economic conditions and a
sharp deterioration in the country's external environment have led
to a marked increase in New Zealand's current account deficit,''
Moody's said in a statement.
	   Initiatives to narrow the deficit would be constrained by an
adverse and possibly worsening external environment.
	   Moody's said financial requirements resulting from the deficit
were likely to prompt a deterioration in New Zealand's external
debt profile, increasing ``the country's vulnerability to shifts in
investor confidence.''
	   Future growth prospects had also worsened.
	   ``Negative or flat exports, weak consumer confidence and delays
in business investment suggest that real GDP (gross domestic
product) will post a decline in the year to March 1999.
	   ``More importantly perhaps, the potential for healthy recovery
in subsequent years is being increasingly hampered by the ongoing
Asian crisis.''

Brewers edge Cubs; Giants stop Pirates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's early games; will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Sammy Sosa kept the pressure on Mark McGwire,
but the Chicago Cubs couldn't keep the pressure on the Mets.
	   Sosa homered twice to tie McGwire in the home run race at 65 and
give the Cubs a 7-0 lead Wednesday. They couldn't hold it, though,
and lost to the Milwaukee Brewers 8-7 when Brant Brown dropped a
fly ball that would have been the game's final out, allowing three
runs to score.
	   With the Cubs ahead 7-5, Milwaukee loaded the bases with one out
in the ninth against Rod Beck (3-3). After Marquis Grissom popped
out, Geoff Jenkins hit a fly ball to left for what looked like an
easy out.
	   Brown seemed to lose it in the sun and the ball dropped out of
his glove as all three runners scored. Several Cubs dropped to
their knees on the field and the Brewers flooded out of their
dugout. Brown appeared to be in tears when he got to his dugout.
	   Sosa, breaking an 0-for-21 slump, hit solo shots in the fifth
and sixth innings. His second homer, which put the Cubs ahead 7-0,
gave him his 11th multihomer game this season, tying the major
league record set by Detroit's Hank Greenberg in 1938.
	   Chicago, which has three games remaining, began the day tied
with New York atop the National League wild-card race. The Mets
played Montreal on Wednesday night.
 &UR; Giants 4, Pirates 1
	   In San Francisco, with four games left, the Giants still have an
outside shot of making the playoffs.
	   Joe Carter hit a go-ahead, three-run homer and Mark Gardner
allowed five hits in eight innings as San Francisco beat the
Pittsburgh Pirates 4-1 Wednesday for its third straight win.
	   The Giants began the day 2 1/2 games behind the New York Mets
and Chicago Cubs in the NL wild-card race. The Cubs blew a
seven-run lead at Milwaukee, losing 8-7. The Mets played Montreal
on Wednesday night.
	   San Francisco finishes its home schedule Thursday against the
Pirates, then goes to Colorado for a three-game series at the
Rockies.

Ineffective Ajax downed by Fortuna
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ An unusually weak Ajax performance
Wednesday saw the Amsterdam champion fortunate to escape with only
a 1-0 defeat at lowly Fortuna Sittard.
	   The win was Fortuna's first of the season while Ajax's first
defeat dropped it down to sixth with 11 points from six games.
	   Feyenoord still leads the league with 15 points from five games,
ahead of SC Heerenveen, Vitesse Arnhem and FC Twente, which all won
Wednesday and share second place on 13 points from six.
	   The Fortuna winner came from a Robert Roest penalty after Ajax
defender Mario Melchiot was caught pulling the shirt of Fortuna
star Regillio Simons after five minutes of the second half.
	   But the scoreline did not reflect the dominance of Fortuna which
forced seven or eight good chances in the first half alone.
	   The most spectacular attempt came from Mark van Bommel who
spotted Edwin van der Sar off his line and beat the Ajax keeper
from the half-way line only to see his shot go just wide.
	   But Ajax escaped further embarrassment thanks to Van der Sar,
who was repeatedly forced to make daring saves from the rampant
Fortuna forwards.
	   Heerenveen owed its 1-0 victory over FC Utrecht to a fortunate
deflection as defender Tom van Mol directed Romanian Dumitru
Mitrita's shot past his own keeper.
	   Goals from the Yugoslav duo of Marko Perovic and Dejan Curovic
gave Vitesse a 2-0 victory over RKC Waalwijk and Twente downed MVV
Maastricht 2-1.

Live on TV: fugitive takes four hostage with hand grenade

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's top fugitive took a family of
four hostage and, in a live television interview Wednesday,
threatened to blow them up with a hand grenade.
	   One hostage, a 25-year-old woman, was in critical condition and
two others were listed as serious after the four-hour ordeal that
was broadcast live from inside the family's apartment.
	   Two hours after Sorin Matei, 27, an escaped Greek-Romanian
convict released one hostage, anti-terrorist police raided the
first-floor apartment. Shots were heard and a few minutes later the
hand grenade detonated.
	   ``I have chosen a road and there is no return,'' Matei, an
escaped Greek-Romanian convict, told Athens' Skai television
station shortly before the raid.
	   After the raid, Matei and the hostages were taken to hospital in
serious condition. At least six police officers, including the
chief of the Greek police were also injured by the hand grenade.
	   The operation took place when Skai anchorman Nikos Evangelatos,
who was negotiating with Matei, cut away for a commercial break.
Other television cameras had been cleared from the area.
	   In a broadcast without precedent in Greece, Matei rambled,
negotiated, issued demands, and at one point hung up before calling
Evangelatos again.
	   Confusion grew after the raid, with authorities refusing to
provide a number for the dead and wounded for three hours.
	   It was the second time Matei had riveted Greek viewers to their
television sets.
	   On Sept. 6, he used a hand grenade to take a police officer
hostage for almost eight hours before security forces released him.
He fled in a taxi and police were unable to track him down until
Wednesday, when they located him hiding inside a multi-storied
apartment building near the capital's red light district.
	   But Matei, a drug addict, again managed to elude police, sliding
down a skylight and bursting into the family's apartment. He then
telephoned Evangelatos.
	   ``When you shoot heroin, you are both dead and alive,'' Matei
told him. He admitted that he could not think straight ``because
I'm a junkie and my head is bleeding.''
	   A former mental patient, Matei escaped from a police holding
facility last July. At the time he had already spent nearly a
decade in jail, serving sentences for attempted murder, a series of
armed robberies and thefts. He had nearly a quarter century left to
serve.
	   ``When you're looking at 50 years in jail, you don't have many
choices,'' he told Evangelatos.
	   He also allowed 25-year-old Amalia Ginaki and her mother
Soultana, 58, to make appeals over the telephone.
	   ``He has tied us all together and is clenching the hand
grenade,'' the daughter said. Except for the mother and daughter,
Matei also held hostage the daughter's 35-year-old fiancee.
	   Matei demanded a fast sports car, dlrs 500,000, a first aid kit,
``and amphetamines. I've taken so much heroin that my eyes are
closing and I could drop the grenade.''

Brazil and Yugoslavia tie 1-1 in exhibition game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO LUIS, Brazil (AP) _ In their first outing under the command
of coach Wanderley Luxemburgo, Brazil's national team tied
Yugoslavia 1-1 on Wednesday.
	   The team which had only three World Cup veterans seemed
tentative with only a single training under their belts.
	   Yugoslavia opened up the scoring when Milosevic took a long
pass, split the defense and chipped a shot over the head of goal
keeper Andre in the 7th minute.
	   But Brazil tied it up shortly after with a free kick by
Marcelinho that went past wall and into the right corner in 16th
minute.
	   Yugoslavia lost a man in the 50th minute when Grozdic was given
a red card after tackling Marcelinho from behind, but Brazil was
unable to capitalize on the one man advantage and the game ended
tied.
	   ``I think as a first test it was a good game,'' said Luxemburgo
after the match. ``Their team is very strong and very experienced.
Even with a man down they managed to secure the game.''
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil: Andre, Cafu, Antonio Carlos, Cleber, Felipe (Serginho),
Marcos Assuncao, Vampeta (Rogerio), Marcelinho (Jackson), Rivaldo
(Christian), Muller and Denilson (Alex).
	   Yugoslavia: Krajl (Zilic), Ngegus (Nadj), Savic, Djukic,
Djorovic, Stanovic (Sarac), Jokanovic, Grozdic, Petrovic (Curcic),
Milosevic (Kovacevic), Mijatovic.

Kucera trains lightly, said to be in pain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Slovakia's Karol Kucera went
through a light workout Wednesday in training for next weekend's
Davis Cup tennis match with Argentina for a berth in the 1999 World
Group.
	   Sixth-ranked Kucera, the highest ranking player among the two
teams, complained of pain in his left knee and spent the afternoon
in his hotel room, the Diarios y Noticias news agency reported.
	   The Slovak team declined to comment.
	   Number two singles player Dominik Hrabaty and the rest of the
team worked out intensely all day.
	   Team captain and coach Miloslav Mecir will probably pair up
Hrabaty and Jan Kroslak for Saturday's doubles match, DyN said.
	   On the Argentine side, number one singles player Hernan Gumy,
who is scheduled to play Kucera in Friday's singles, played a full
match with trainer Eduardo Medica.
	   Number two singles player Franco Squillari and doubles players
Luis Lobo and Lucas Arnold played briefly until forced to stop by
heavy rain.
	   All matches will be played on clay courts at the Buenos Aires
Lawn Tennis Club in the Argentine capital.

Herron hopes for payoff again in Texas Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KELLEY SHANNON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) _ Despite an inconsistent season, Tim Herron
believes his game is improving. He hopes it's in solid shape as he
defends his title in the Texas Open starting Thursday.
	   ``Overall, my golf game is getting a little better,'' Herron
said. ``I'm looking forward to this week.''
	   Certainly, Herron doesn't mind the perks of being defending
champion.
	   Along with the usual tournament honors, the 28-year-old has seen
his name carved into a large boulder at La Cantera Golf Club and
has been assigned a top-notch parking space at the course.
	   ``The coolest part,'' Herron said, ``is you'll always be a
champion here at the Texas Open.''
	   Herron closed with a 3-under 69 last year and held off Brent
Geiberger and Rick Fehr to win the Texas Open by two strokes with a
17-under 271 total amid rainy, windy conditions. It was his second
victory in as many years.
	   But that was last year, Herron quickly points out.
	   ``This year has been kind of up and down. I've had some good
tournaments, a lot of mediocre tournaments,'' said Herron,
currently 51st on the PGA Tour money list with dlrs 500,623.
	   When the dlrs 1.7 million Texas Open begins, more than 150 other
golfers also will have their sights on this year's dlrs 306,000
first prize. The 72-hole Westin-sponsored tournament runs through
Sunday.
	   Making his debut in a PGA Tour event is U.S. Amateur champion
Hank Kuehne, who said Wednesday he hopes to perform well but added
that no matter what happens he will delight in playing with the pro
golfers.
	   ``I was more nervous yesterday on the driving range than I was
at any point in the U.S. Amateur,'' Kuehne said. ``It looks a lot
different from inside the ropes, to say the least.''
	   A senior at SMU, Kuehne said in college golf he doesn't often
get to play on such well-tended greens.
	   ``I'm excited,'' he said. ``I'm ready to play. I'm driving
really good, and that's a bonus.''
	   Keeping the ball in the fairway and out of the thick rough will
be a key to playing well at La Cantera. Doused recently by rain,
the greens are firm enough but holding, some golfers said.
	   It's important to remain patient and not become frustrated with
the greens or the long, strenuous walk on the hilly course, Herron
said.
	   ``You can get into a lot of trouble out here,'' he said. ``It's
important not to get discouraged on this golf course because you
can make a triple or something, but then you can reel off like five
birdies in a row.''
	   ``I'm real comfortable on this golf course,'' Herron said.

Prince insists he's not playing dodgeball
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Prince Naseem Hamed, boxing's self-proclaimed
showman, insists he is not avoiding the big shows in the ring.
	   Hamed, criticized for the quality of some of his opponents, said
Wednesday he was not avoiding Kennedy McKinney.
	   ``I will box anybody,'' the WBO featherweight champion said at a
news conference announcing his Oct. 31 fight against Wayne
McCullough. ``The Prince doesn't dodge.''
	   Hamed (30-0, 28 knockouts) was supposed to fight McKinney in
July, but pulled out because of a hand injury. Negotiations between
promoters Frank Warren and Murad Muhammad for a fight in October
broke down.
	   ``We've been looking for a fight with McCullough for a long
time,'' said Warren, Hamed's promoter. ``Kennedy McKinney is not
the champion. We will fight him down the road. He just has to keep
fit and not get beaten.''
	   Hamed first must beat McCullough in a fight he has been looking
forward to for a long time. Two years ago, McCullough tried to
upstage Hamed at one of the Prince's fights in Ireland against
Manuel Medina.
	   ``I am going to do a demolition job on him,'' said Hamed, who
predicted a knockout in the third or fifth round.
	   McCullough is less confident and less brash than his opponent.
His only prediction is that the fight will go the distance.
	   ``I'll be ready,'' McCullough said. ``I have a good chin and I
can throw punches. I will be standing at the end.''
	   Hamed, who last fought against Wilfredo Vazquez in April, is
making his 11th title defense. He is still trained by Brendan
Ingle, despite the strain in their relationship over Ingle's role
in a book about Hamed.
	   The book includes bits of Ingle's diary, and one entry reads:
``Money has become his (Hamed's) God. He is kidding everyone. All
he wants to hear is ... praise and having yes-men around him.''
	   Hamed tried to downplay the book, saying all that mattered was
that Ingle was still his trainer. But Ingle said he would try to
capitalize on his fighter's anger.
	   ``What Nas wanted to do to me but can't because I'm too old,
he'll do to McCullough,'' Ingle said.
	   The undercard features IBF super bantamweight champion Vuyani
Bungu (35-2, 18 KOs) of South Africa against American Danny Romero
(32-2, 28 KOs). In a 12-round bout for the WBO super bantamweight
title, it will be Mexico's Marco Antonio Barerra (45-2, 33KOs)
against England's Richie Wenton (25-3, 9 KOs).

U.N. should help settle Gibraltar question, Spain says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Settling the question of who controls
Gibraltar _ a territorial dispute with Britain that has raged for
more than two centuries _ is high on Spain's agenda, the foreign
minister told the U.N. General Assembly.
	   ``During the 1997 round of negotitaions, I submitted a proposal
which would allow Spain to regain soveriegnty over Gibraltar, at
the same time maintaining all the current advantages of the
inhabitants of this territory,'' Abel Matutes said Wednesday.
	   The United Nations has played a role in many of the regional
conflicts that have erupted in the aftermath of decolonization.
	   ``With the decade for decolonization about to end, I believe it
is important to recall that the historic work performed by the
(United Nations) in this field cannot be considered complete as
long as colonial situations remain,'' Matutes said. ``Every year,
the General Assmebly renews its appeals to Spain and the United
Kingdom to continue their negotiations with a view to putting an
end to the colonial situation of Gibraltar.''
	   Gibraltar, an island at the entrance to the Mediterranean, has
bedeviled relations between Spain and Britain since the land was
ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.
	   The conservative government of Jose Maria Aznar in Madrid has
been vigorously pressing Spain's claim to sovereignty over
Gibraltar. However, the 55,000 Gibraltarians overwhelmingly oppose
becoming a part of Spain, and Britain argues that it cannot hand
over sovereignty without the consent of the colony's residents.

Financial crisis diminishing Chile's economic accomplishments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Asian financial crisis has wreaked
havoc with Chile's economic achievements, which include the
doubling of the size of its economy, reducing inflation and
unemployment, the foreign minister said Wednesday.
	   ``Despite these significant achievements, we have also had to
face, in recent months, the problems which we share with many
countries in our region, stemming from the global financial crisis
and the difficulties created in some of our main export markets,''
Jose Miguel Insulza told the U.N. General Assembly in a speech that
also touched on human rights, environmental protection and
disarmament.
	   Earlier this month, a United Nations agency announced that
economic growth in Latin America will slow down in 1998 as a result
of the financial turmoil and damage caused by the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
	   Main effects so far have been on the Latin countries' exports,
as their sales to Asia have dropped steeply, a situation worsened
by the competition of cheaper Asian exports to the developed
nations.
	   The Santiago-based Economic Commission for Latin America, or
ECLA, predicted that the region will post an average economic
growth of 3 percent this year, down from 5.3 percent in 1997.
	   Last year's good performance was coupled with the lowest
regional average inflation rate in five decades _ 10.4 percent _
and booming exports, ECLA said. Regional inflation is nearing 10.9
percent and unemployment is expected to climb, it said.
	   Inflation was mainly fueled by El Nino _ the seasonal warming of
the Pacific Ocean waters _ which triggered flooding and droughts in
many countries, with devastating effects on fishing and
agricultural activities that have sent food prices up.
	   Inflation is likely to slow down during the second half of the
year as effects on El Nino have faded. But most of the consequences
of the Asian crisis on the region are yet to be seen, according to
the report.
	   ``Obviously, no agency of the multilateral system, on its own
and using only its own methods, is in a position to bring certainty
and stability to the current crisis,'' Insulza said.
	   But ``greater participation in the world economy, if
appropriately channeled, can constitute a key element in the
economic growth and prosperity of countries.''

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hurricane Georges reached Cuba and
threatened the Florida Keys Wednesday after making a shambles of
much of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti in a furious
march that killed at least 50 people and probably many more.
	   In Florida, up to 100,000 people were ordered to begin
evacuating the exposed Florida Keys, and cars, trucks and sport
utility vehicles streamed along the highway linking the island
chain to the Florida mainland.
	   South Florida was put under a hurricane watch and Gov. Lawton
Chiles declared a state of emergency in central and southern
Florida, allowing the state to use the National Guard, lift tolls
along evacuation routes and purchase emergency supplies.
	   The Cayman Islands issued tropical storm warnings for Little
Cayman and Cayman Brac.
	   The hurricane first hit the small islands of the northeast
Caribbean early Monday, killing three in St. Kitts _ where the
government estimated damage at dlrs 445 million _ and two in
Antigua.
	   The U.S. Virgin Islands, which were badly battered in recent
hurricanes, suffered some damage to homes, tourist facilities and
utilities; on the island of St. Croix, a looter shot and killed a
man while burglarizing his home.
	   The effects of the storm were expected to be felt as far south
as Jamaica, where officials expected heavy rains.
	   Three people were killed directly by the storm in Puerto Rico,
where the government's insurance commissioner, Juan Garcia,
estimated damages at dlrs 1 billion. Another eight, most of them
elderly, died of heart attacks or asthma complications during the
storm.
	   On Wednesday reconstruction efforts were under way in
communities like Loiza, where many homes of wood and zinc roofs
were crushed and washed away.
	   ``My sister's house is all gone. And that used to be my uncle's
house,'' said Luis Manso, pointing to a nearby pile of wood debris
as he struggled to repair his own shattered fruit and vegetable
stand ``quickly, before the thieves come.''
	   The Federal Emergency Management Agency reported that about a
third of Puerto Rico's power was expected back Wednesday, but
715,000 remained without running water. FEMA said airport damage
was minimal and the port of San Juan reported no major damage.
Coffee and plantain crops, however, were badly harmed, FEMA said.
	   Seventeen were officially reported killed in the Dominican
Republic, which Georges hit Tuesday. However, the actuial toll
appears to have been much higher.
	   Reporters said that in San Cristobal, which is 20 miles )30 km &QC; 
east of Santo Domingo, the Nizao river overflowed and knocked down
a part of a school used as a shelter, killing five, and that 31
were missing. There were also unconfirmed reports that in the
capital five more people were killed by an overflowing river.	   Other media reports put the death toll at over 100. These
reports could not be confirmed, but officials planned a news
conference on the situation later Wednesday.
	   In the shanty neighborhood of La Cienega, the swollen river
invaded thousands of homes, covering some up to the roofs in fetid
water. Residents swam out to their houses to try to retrieve their
belongings, some using empty gallon water jugs tied to their arms
to help them float.
	   Earlier, looters in Santo Domingo waded waist-deep in water,
balancing televisions and air conditioners on their heads as 110
mph (180 kph) winds toppled trees and crushed houses. Bands of
youths with machetes and pistols roamed the streets, many of them
drunk. Two of the dead were looters shot by police enforcing a
curfew.
	   From the Dominican Republic Georges proceeded Tuesday night to
Haiti, occupying the western third of the island of Hispaniola.
	   In the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Georges
unleashed flash floods and killed at least 17.
	   Yolaine Surena of the civil defense authority said the
government could spare only dlrs 130,000 in emergency aid.
	   Most of the deaths reportedly occurred when floodwaters
collapsed two homes in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where there
were no public shelters. Four drowning victims were found in a
west-side suburb Wednesday afternoon. Deaths also were reported in
Gonaives and the northern town of Marmelade.
	   In November 1994, tropical storm Gordon killed at least 1,000 in
Haiti's southern provinces, drowning them in torrential streams or
burying them in mudslides.
	   At 2100 GMT, Hurricane Georges was near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and
was moving west-northwest near 14 mph (23 kph) with maximum
sustained winds at a low hurricane-level 75 mph (120 kph), down
from 110 mph (180 kph) over Puerto Rico.
	   Warnings were declared in Cuba from Sancti Spiritus province
eastward and in the central and southern Bahamas. Cuban President
Fidel Castro put his ministers on alert.
	   ``No one will be forgotten in this new battle by the Cuban
people. We are a nation that has overcome adversity with unity,''
Mexico's official Notimex news agency quoted Castro as saying.
	   The mammoth storm was on a trajectory that could send it
crashing into the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday.
	   Georges' winds dropped from 110 mph (177 kmh) Tuesday to near 75
mph (120. kph) Wednesday as it moved across the island of
Hispaniola, but were expected to strengthen over open water.
	   Georges knocked out communications with the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Henry Laskowski, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in
San Juan, said roofs were blown off and trees were felled on St.
Croix, which is part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, but there were no
reports of fatalities.
	   In Puerto Rico, residents began the sobering task of recovery.
	   ``After the storm is always the worst,'' said Paula Aponte
Figueroa, 71, as she swatted at mosquitoes, the roof of her house
ripped off by the winds. ``You've got flooding, you've got
mosquitoes and I have nowhere to go.''

Council demands cease-fire in Kosovo, threatens other measures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yugoslav reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to stave off a humanitarian crisis
in the hills of Kosovo, the Security Council demanded a cease-fire
in the Yugoslav province Wednesday and threatened further action if
fighting continues.
	   The resolution, passed 14-0 with China abstaining, was intended
to increase pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
loosen his grip on Kosovo, where the majority ethnic Albanians are
fighting Serbs for independence.
	   The British and French drafted resolution is militarily
enforceable. Nevertheless, it doesn't explicitly authorize NATO
intervention to try to stop the Serb offensive on ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   The United States has said NATO doesn't need council authority
to intervene, and NATO defense ministers were meeting Thursday to
discuss the situation. But there were serious questions about how
any military action could successfully be carried out, particularly
over who would be targeted and how.
	   Western powers generally support returning autonomy to Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians, but steadfastly reject the campaign for
independence being waged by the Kosovo Liberation Army and the
Albanian nationals who are supplying them arms.
	   ``One can think of airstrikes, but who will you strike,''
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini asked during a briefing here
Wednesday. ``How are you going to distinguish one from another? Who
do you want to punish?''
	   China said it was abstaining from the vote because the ground
conflict was essentially over _ yet another indication of the
problems surrounding potential military engagement.
	   ``There is no large-scale armed conflict, still less any
escalation of the conflict,'' said Chinese ambassador Qin Huasun.
``We do not see the situation in Kosovo as a threat to
international peace and security.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed, and over a quarter million
have fled the fighting around their homes since a Serb crackdown on
the separatists began in February.
	   The situation has taken on urgency because of the rapidly
escalating crisis confronting the people of Kosovo, an estimated
50,000 of whom are roaming the hills of Kosovo with little food and
shelter.
	   Snow fell on Kosovo for the first time last week.
	   The resolution demands a cease-fire and urges the Serbs and
ethnic Albanian leadership to start negotiating a solution to the
crisis.
	   It also demands Milosevic allow international monitoring in
Kosovo and the safe return of refugees.
	   The resolution cites Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which means
the resolution is militarily enforceable. Nevertheless, there is no
explicit authorization for member states to intervene.
	   The resolution says only that ``the council would consider
further action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace
and stability in the region,'' if a political settlement isn't
reached.
	   It gives no time frame.
	   Russia, which has religious and cultural ties to the Serbs and
has opposed force in the past, said it would go along with the
resolution because it didn't specifically authorize military
intervention. Another resolution was necessary to do that, Russian
ambassador Sergey Lavrov said.
	   ``No measures of force, and no sanctions at this stage are being
introduceed by the Security Council,'' he told the council just
before the vote.
	   Britain and the United States, however, saw the resolution as
the first step in cracking down on Milosevic.
	   The resolution ``sends a clear, unequivocal message to the
authorities in Belgrade that the council is demanding that they
change their behavior and live up to their responsibilities with
regard to the political and humanitarian situation in Kosovo,''
said deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, in a statement, welcomed
the resolution and took particular note that Russia voted in favor.
	   ``The resolution sends a clear signal that the international
community's patience is exhausted,'' Cook said.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as saying the resolution was
``groundless and counterproductive'' and that the Kosovo crisis
could not be settled ``with the use of force.
	   ``We are therefore deeply convinced that even mention of the use
of force is negative,'' Jovanovic said.
	   The resolution cites Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows
for the use of force by member states if regional peace and
security is threatened. Nevertheless, there is no explicit
authorization for member states to intervene.
	   The resolution says only that ``the council would consider
further action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace
and stability in the region,'' if a political settlement isn't
reached.
	   It gives no time frame.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Wednesday the
resolution was ``sufficient'' for now, but that the council and
other countries had to wait for the next stage _ presumably
Belgrade's response to the resolution _ before addressing the issue
of intervention.

Moody's lowers New Zealand's credit rating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Moody's Investor Services on
Thursday downgraded New Zealand's credit rating, a move that had
been widely expected as a result of the Asian financial crisis.
	   Moody's said the downgrade reflected New Zealand's worsening
economy and continued pressure on the country's external accounts.
	   Moody's said all Aa1 rated foreign currency bonds and notes
issued by the government had been downgraded to Aa2.
	   ``Over the last 18 months, domestic economic conditions and a
sharp deterioration in the country's external environment have led
to a marked increase in New Zealand's current account deficit,''
Moody's said in a statement.
	   Initiatives to narrow the deficit would be constrained by an
adverse and possibly worsening external environment.
	   Moody's said financial requirements resulting from the deficit
were likely to prompt a deterioration in New Zealand's external
debt profile, increasing ``the country's vulnerability to shifts in
investor confidence.''
	   Future growth prospects had also worsened.
	   ``Negative or flat exports, weak consumer confidence and delays
in business investment suggest that real GDP (gross domestic
product) will post a decline in the year to March 1999.
	   ``More importantly perhaps, the potential for healthy recovery
in subsequent years is being increasingly hampered by the ongoing
Asian crisis,'' Moody's said.
	   Finance Minister Bill Birch said, however, that the effect of
the downgrade was likely to be negligible.

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hurricane Georges reached Cuba and
threatened the Florida Keys Wednesday after making a shambles of
much of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti in a furious
march that killed at least 50 people and probably many more.
	   In Florida, up to 100,000 people were ordered to begin
evacuating the exposed Florida Keys, and cars, trucks and sport
utility vehicles streamed along the highway linking the island
chain to the Florida mainland.
	   South Florida was put under a hurricane watch and Gov. Lawton
Chiles declared a state of emergency in central and southern
Florida, allowing the state to use the National Guard, lift tolls
along evacuation routes and purchase emergency supplies.
	   The Cayman Islands issued tropical storm warnings for Little
Cayman and Cayman Brac.
	   The hurricane first hit the small islands of the northeast
Caribbean early Monday, killing three in St. Kitts _ where the
government estimated damage at dlrs 445 million _ and two in
Antigua.
	   The U.S. Virgin Islands, which were badly battered in recent
hurricanes, suffered some damage to homes, tourist facilities and
utilities; on the island of St. Croix, a looter shot and killed a
man while burglarizing his home.
	   The effects of the storm were expected to be felt as far south
as Jamaica, where officials expected heavy rains.
	   Three people were killed directly by the storm in Puerto Rico,
where the government's insurance commissioner, Juan Garcia,
estimated damages at dlrs 1 billion. Another eight, most of them
elderly, died of heart attacks or asthma complications during the
storm.
	   On Wednesday reconstruction efforts were under way in
communities like Loiza, where many homes of wood and zinc roofs
were crushed and washed away.
	   ``My sister's house is all gone. And that used to be my uncle's
house,'' said Luis Manso, pointing to a nearby pile of wood debris
as he struggled to repair his own shattered fruit and vegetable
stand ``quickly, before the thieves come.''
	   The Federal Emergency Management Agency reported that about a
third of Puerto Rico's power was expected back Wednesday, but
715,000 remained without running water. FEMA said airport damage
was minimal and the port of San Juan reported no major damage.
Coffee and plantain crops, however, were badly harmed, FEMA said.
	   Seventeen were officially reported killed in the Dominican
Republic, which Georges hit Tuesday. However, the actual toll
appears to have been much higher.
	   Reporters said that in San Cristobal, which is 20 miles (30
kilometers) east of Santo Domingo, the Nizao river overflowed and
knocked down a part of a school used as a shelter, killing five,
and 31 were missing. Unconfirmed media reports put the death toll
much higher, and officials planned a news conference on the
situation later Wednesday.
	   In the shanty neighborhood of La Cienega, the swollen river
invaded thousands of homes, covering some up to the roofs in fetid
water. Residents swam to their houses to try to retrieve their
belongings, some using empty water jugs tied to their arms to help
them float.
	   Earlier, looters in Santo Domingo waded waist-deep in water,
balancing televisions and air conditioners on their heads as 110
mph (180 kph) winds toppled trees and crushed houses. Bands of
youths with machetes and pistols roamed the streets, many of them
drunk. Two of the dead were looters shot by police enforcing a
curfew.
	   From the Dominican Republic Georges proceeded Tuesday night to
Haiti, occupying the western third of the island of Hispaniola.
	   In the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Georges
unleashed flash floods and killed at least 17.
	   Yolaine Surena of the civil defense authority said the
government could spare only dlrs 130,000 in emergency aid.
	   Most of the deaths reportedly occurred when floodwaters
collapsed two homes in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where there
were no public shelters. Four drowning victims were found in a
west-side suburb Wednesday afternoon. Deaths also were reported in
Gonaives and the northern town of Marmelade.
	   In November 1994, tropical storm Gordon killed at least 1,000 in
Haiti's southern provinces, drowning them in torrential streams or
burying them in mudslides.
	   At 2100 GMT, Hurricane Georges was near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and
was moving west-northwest near 14 mph (23 kph) with maximum
sustained winds at a low hurricane-level 75 mph (120 kph), down
from 110 mph (180 kph) over Puerto Rico.

Koivu on way to Montreal camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Saku Koivu agreed to a two-year contract with
the Montreal Canadiens on Wednesday.
	   Terms were not disclosed, but Koivu is believed to be in line
for about dlrs 3 million a year.
	   Koivu, 23, is scheduled to arrive at training camp Friday from
his home in Turku, Finland. The center's new deal also includes a
third year as a team option.
	   Koivu earned dlrs 750,000 last season, when he completed the
last year of a three-year contract. He became a restricted free
agent last July 1.
	   ``Saku is our franchise player, our player of the future,'' said
Canadiens general manager Rejean Houle. ``He's one of our top three
players, but he has to produce like he did two years ago _ that is
at least one point a game.''
	   Two years ago, Koivu was one of the NHL's top scorers when he
injured a knee.
	   He scored only 14 goals in the 1997-98 season when he was
sidelined by a groin injury before and after the Winter Olympics,
where he helped Finland beat Canada in the bronze-medal game.
	   Don Baizley of Winnipeg represented Koivu in contract talks with
Houle.
	   ``Both sides decided we wanted to get something done,'' Houle
said. ``We bridged the gap by talking, and talking again.''

Detailed Olympics budget to be unveiled Thursday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTHEW BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ After nine months of dissecting the 2002
Winter Games into thousands of costly tasks, the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee on Thursday will unveil the event's dlrs 1
billion-plus budget.
	   The committee's board of trustees is expected to vote on the
proposed spending package during its Oct. 8 meeting.
	   SLOC's executive board was given a preview of the 45-volume
budget plan on Wednesday. And if the reaction of those executive
board members willing to talk is any indication, the full board
will walk away impressed and overwhelmed.
	   ``Putting on the Olympics is a very large project,'' SLOC
chairman Robert Garff, a local car dealer and former state
legislator, said after Wednesday's meeting. ``I think the
(executive) board was impressed with the depth of the work by the
staff.''
	   Following earlier budget sessions with SLOC's budget committee,
Alan Layton, committee chairman and head of a construction company,
explained the scope of the project this way: ``We're not putting on
a county fair and we're not planning the Normandy invasion. But
it's a lot closer to the Normandy invasion.''
	   Indeed, staffers were described as ``light headed'' by SLOC
president and CEO Frank Joklik after enduring lengthy sessions with
consultants demanding department heads assign a dollar to every
activity leading up to and during the Olympics.
	   The Salt Lake spending plan covers 42 functions, such as medical
services or security; 200-plus projects, like the torch relay; 400
subprojects and 3,000 activities, such as tree plantings.
	   And while SLOC leaders won't divulge exact numbers until
Thursday, they have said the budget balances without additional tax
dollars. Taxpayers have already been docked dlrs 59 million to
build Olympic venues.
	   Work remains on the ski jumps at Utah Winter Sports Park, the
speedskating oval in Kearns and the cross-country and biathlon
courses at Wasatch Mountain State Park.
	   The proposed budget includes repayment of the dlrs 59 million
and sets aside a dlrs 40 million endowment to pay for site
operations after the 2002 Winter Games.
	   The first budget organizers drafted was in 1989 for dlrs 400
million and the latest revision in 1996 ranged from dlrs 920
million to dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   But Joklik said those numbers reflected loose estimates from
past Olympics without nailing down the costs of every task entailed
in putting on the Games.
	   That earlier budget predicted SLOC would reap dlrs 920 million
from television rights, corporate sponsorships and ticket sales.
The estimated value of donated goods and services ranged from dlrs
266 million to dlrs 336 million.
	   Organizers of the 1998 Winter Games in Japan said they broke
even on their dlrs 956 million budget.
	   Joklik, a retired mining executive, convinced the board to hire
Bechtel Corp. to shepherd SLOC through the creation of a so-called
bottoms-up budget.
	   The California-based engineering firm has come to the aid of
organizers of the Summer Games in Los Angeles in 1984 and in
Barcelona in 1992.
	   Joklik said that while organizers of past Olympics have also
hammered out bottoms-up budgets, none that he knows of put one
together three years before the event.
	   Bechtel consultants had told the committee during a presentation
in January that a detailed spending plan was needed to help
organizers shift from dreaming about the Games to executing plans.
	   Executive committee member Ken Bullock, the lone member who was
unimpressed by the detailed budget, said much of the information
could have been gathered and disclosed to board members soon after
Salt Lake was awarded the bid in 1995.
	   ``To wait 3 1/2 years puts us at a disadvantage,'' he said.
	   Bullock, executive director of the Utah League of Cities &AMP;
Towns, has complained for months over SLOC not releasing more
details sooner so that board members can better understand what
they are voting on in October.

Puerto Ricans rebuild after storm's wreckage

<TEXT>
	   LOIZA, Puerto Rico (AP) _ From vulnerable coastal communities to
mountain hamlets where torrents swept whole worlds away, Puerto
Ricans just tried to get through the day Wednesday, patching things
together until the real rebuilding can start.
	   One of the hardest hit areas was Loiza, a poor town on the
Atlantic coast about 15 miles (25 kilometers) east of San Juan,
where many residents live in wooden homes with zinc roofs that
proved no match for Hurricane Georges, which roared through on
Monday.
	   ``My sister's house is all gone,'' said Luis Manso, pointing to
a nearby pile of wood debris as he struggled to repair his own
shattered fruit and vegetable stand.
	   Manso's uncle's home was also destroyed, but his mother's
concrete house suffered hardly a scratch. His sister Aida's
apartment, a wooden second floor addition to the mother's
residence, was reduced to a pile of splintered boards.
	   Aida Manso said she huddled in her mother's home as the
hurricane's 110 mph (180 kph) winds blew her apartment away.
	   ``It was like a lion thundering,'' she said. ``I didn't sleep a
bit.''
	   Many here marveled at how Georges, the most powerful hurricane
to hit Puerto Rico in 70 years, made short work of homes that had
withstood even the legendary Hurricane Hugo, which wrecked parts of
the island in 1989.
	   ``I tied things down and it just didn't do any good,'' said
Noemi Canales, whose home in Loiza was left roofless. ``This was
just too much. Hugo was strong, but this was stronger.''
	   Though Wednesday's hot sun replaced clouds and rain, floods were
slow to drift away in some areas. Outside Loiza, half a dozen
horses fenced into a flooded field stood stoically, chest-deep in
water, awaiting relief.
	   At least four people died in Puerto Rico, and damage nationwide
from the storm was expected to reach well into the hundreds of
millions of dollars.
	   Coastal communities were not the only ones hurt. The winds were
even stronger in the central mountains, and rain poured off their
steep sides in tremendous torrents.
	   In the town of Canovanas on Wednesday, children splashed in the
now knee-deep river. It was a welcome change from Monday, when the
river overflowed its banks.
	   The waters overran Los Choritos restaurant, normally 10 feet (3
meters) above the riverbank, flipping over a pool table, washing
away cases of beer and whole pigs ready for traditional Sunday
roasting, and covering what little was left in a foot of gooey mud.
	   ``I don't know how we're going to clean this,'' said Mirla
Gonzalez, who runs the restaurant with her husband.
	   His face smudged with mud and sweat, her husband Carlos tried to
clean off the few bottles of beer and liquor that were left in the
shell of the business his father had spent 20 years building.
	   ``If my father were alive to see this he would have a heart
attack,'' he said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding 257 points
to the Dow, as U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan gave
the clearest signal yet that he'll fight the global economic crisis
with lower interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average surged
to 8,154 by the close, its highest finish in a month, with more
than half of the gain coming during the final hour of trading. The
gain, the fifth-biggest in points for a single session, left the
Dow more than 200 points above this year's starting point of
7,908.25, but still about 1,200 below the July 17 record of
9,337.97. Broader stock indicators also posted big gains as
Greenspan told a Senate Panel that Fed officials understood the
need to act quickly to contain the widening global crisis, fueling
hopes for an interest rate cut at next week's Fed policy meeting.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
said Wednesday that Fed policy-makers understood the need to act
quickly to contain a widening global currency crisis, raising the
prospects of an immediate cut in U.S. rates. His words sparked an
explosive rally on Wall Street. Greenspan, testifying before the
Senate Budget Committee, said that there was a need to ``bring the
existing instabilities to a level of stability reasonably shortly
to prevent the contagion from really spilling over and creating
some very significant further difficulties for all of us.''
Economists said Greenspan's comments were a strong signal that the
central bank will cut interest rates when policy-makers meet next
Tuesday. ``He is telling us he is going to ease at the next
meeting,'' said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.
Greenspan said the Fed was ready to lower interest rates but he
stressed that the Fed was aware of the seriousness of the global
financial crisis. (GREENSPAN-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will continue seeking financial assistance
from abroad while pursuing free-market reforms to combat its
economic crisis, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday.
Primakov, who has been in office for 12 days and has yet to outline
his economic program or fill several key cabinet posts, said Russia
would continue economic reforms. Many private investors have fled
Russia in recent months, and foreign banks that bought billions of
dollars of government bonds have complained that they are being
discriminated against while the government tries to bail out
Russian banks. Lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund,
are expected to delay installments on existing loans at least until
the new government details its plans for coping with the crisis.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The number of people without full-time jobs
worldwide will reach a record 1 billion by the end of the year
because of the Asian financial crisis, according to an
International Labor Organization report being released Thursday.
The number of unemployed people around the globe to rise 10
million, to 150 million, the 258-page study said. In addition, a
further 750 million to 900 million people _ 25 percent to 30
percent of the world's workers _ lack full-time jobs or earn less
than the minimum needed to live, known as underemployment. The ILO,
the United Nations' oldest agency, says developing nations in
particular must invest more in worker training and skills. Economic
growth in many parts of the world earlier this year, however, has
cut unemployment and underemployment in the United States and the
European Union, the report said. (UN-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines, the oldest
carrier in Asia, is closing its doors after last-minute
negotiations failed to persuade its largest union to accept a
recovery plan. The closure of PAL late Wednesday leaves many areas
of the 7,000-island Philippine archipelago without air service. PAL
had said it would shut down unless workers accepted the rescue
plan, which it said was necessary to recover from a series of
strikes and Asia's currency crisis. PAL is the largest Philippine
company to fail since Asia's currency crisis, which hit just as the
airline was launching a dlrs 4 billion expansion and refleeting
plan. Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said its closure should
serve as a lesson on the need for management and labor to work
harmoniously together. Slow, often-unreliable, and sometimes
dangerous ferries are the only alternative transportation among the
nation's islands. (PHILIPPINE AIRLINES)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ China's foreign minister again appealed
for his country's entry into the World Trade Organization, citing
China's efforts to stabilize the Asian economic crisis and the
opening of its markets for more business. China has been lobbying
for 12 years for entry into the WTO, the main international body
governing global trade relations and setting fair trade rules.
There is general agreement China should join the organization and
be bound by its responsibilities, but there is disagreement how.
China wants to enter as a developing country, meaning it would have
to take only gradual measures to cut barriers to imports of goods
and services. The United States, which has a big trade deficit with
China, and other major traders have refused to let China in unless
Beijing opens its markets wider. (UN-CHINA)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A mega-merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group
Inc., which could offer consumers one-stop shopping for everything
from credit cards and checking to insurance and investing, won
approval Wednesday from the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and Justice
Departments. The merger of the two New York-based companies was
first announced in April. Citicorp is the parent company of
Citibank, the world's largest issuer of credit cards with some 60
million in circulation. Travelers is an insurance, brokerage and
investment banking giant. The merged company, called Citigroup
Inc., and would continue to use Travelers trademark red umbrella as
part of its logo. With more than 100 million customers worldwide
and assets of more than dlrs 751 billion, Citigroup would be the
largest financial services firm in the United States.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Their peacekeeping operation in shambles,
South African military leaders gave their troops shoot-to-kill
orders Wednesday to suppress mutineers in Lesotho, where looters
and arsonists rampaged through the capital. Smoke plumes rose above
Maseru from arson fires set Tuesday when 600 South African soldiers
crossed the border to quell a military uprising. About 200 soldiers
from Botswana arrived Wednesday to reinforce the South Africans,
but mostly only looked on as a procession of looters carried away
booty and continued to torch buildings. Lesotho's government
requested the intervention two weeks ago amid a revolt by junior
Lesotho military officers and strikes that paralyzed Maseru. The
mutineers had apparently sided with opposition parties that claimed
elections last May _ swept by the ruling Lesotho Congress Party _
were rigged. (LESOTHO)
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A slightly weakened Hurricane
Georges blew into Cuba and threatened the Florida Keys on Wednesday
after making a shambles of much of Puerto Rico, the Dominican
Republic and Haiti. At least 39 people were believed dead and many
more were missing. In Florida, up to 100,000 people were ordered to
begin evacuating the exposed Florida Keys, and cars, trucks and
sport utility vehicles streamed along the highway linking the
island chain to the mainland. Flash floods ravaged Haiti on
Wednesday, and whipping winds tore tin roofs off homes while
floodwater overwhelmed drainage systems. Heavy rain soaked Cuba's
southeastern coast, and Cuban news reports said authorities
evacuated more than 200,000 people from eastern provinces.
(CARIBBEAN-HURRICANE)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to stave off a humanitarian crisis
in Kosovo, the Security Council demanded a cease-fire in the
Yugoslav province Wednesday and threatened further action if
fighting continues. The resolution was intended to increase
pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to loosen his
grip on Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting Serb forces for
independence. The resolution drafted by Britain and France is
militarily enforceable, but it doesn't explicitly authorize NATO
intervention to try to stop the Serb offensive against ethnic
Albanian separatists. The United States has said NATO doesn't need
council authority to intervene, and NATO defense ministers were
meeting Thursday in Portugal to discuss the situation. (UN-KOSOVO)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Pakistan's prime minister said Wednesday
his country would unilaterally adhere to the nuclear test ban
treaty, but warned that compliance would depend on whether rival
India resumed its tests. Nawaz Sharif told world leaders at the
U.N. General Assembly session that Pakistan was ready to adhere to
the pact if economic sanctions imposed after it conducted nuclear
tests in May were lifted. After India and Pakistan carried out
nuclear tests, the United States and other nations imposed economic

tough on Pakistan, which has been struggling with severe economic
woes. Sharif warned that Pakistan would comply with a ban on
nuclear tests only so long as India did not carry out any more
tests. (UN-PAKISTAN-NUCLEAR)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams on
Wednesday accused the would-be leader of Northern Ireland's new
government of violating the Belfast peace agreement by demanding
IRA disarmament. Adams, whose Irish Republican Army-linked party
supported April's accord on a joint Protestant-Catholic government
for Northern Ireland, said Ulster Unionist Party leader David
Trimble was going ``back on his word.'' The agreement stipulated
that the IRA should disarm by mid-2000, but didn't say when the
process should begin _ or explicitly link it to other developments.
But Trimble, chief representative of the north's British Protestant
majority, emphasized that Protestant lawmakers would hold Sinn Fein
accountable for the IRA's inaction. (NORTHERN IRELAND)

	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen and Billy
Joel head up the list of 15 nominees for induction next year into
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
	   McCartney is already in the hall as a member of the Beatles. If
he winds up on the inductees' list this time, it will be for his
solo work.
	   Springsteen was nominated without his old backup group, the E
Street Band, because he released his 1973 debut album ``Greetings
From Asbury Park, N.J.'' as a solo artist. Musicians are not
eligible for nomination to the hall until 25 years after the
release of their first recording.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Seiji Ozawa called in sick Wednesday on the
opening night of his 25th season as director of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.
	   His understudy Robert Shaw was scheduled to step in.
	   Ozawa, 63, is the longest-serving music director of any major
orchestra. He had just returned from Russia and was set to open the
season with a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which will
go on without him.
	   Symphony spokeswoman Bernadette Horgan said she expects Ozawa,
who had a virus and was running a fever of 103 F (39.4 C), to
recover in time for a performance Sunday on Boston Common.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hollywood star Nicole Kidman, playing five
characters in her London stage debut, won rave reviews on Wednesday
in David Hare's new play, ``The Blue Room.''
	   One minute she is opposite co-star Iain Glen playing a
politician's wife trapped in a loveless marriage, the next she's a
scantily clad prostitute whose clients include a taxi driver and an
aristocrat, both played by Glen.
	   ``The night is above all a personal triumph for Miss Kidman, an
actress who, if you ask me, is totally wasted in movies,''
Christopher Tookey wrote in The Daily Mail.
	   The actress' superstar husband, Tom Cruise, watched from
backstage Tuesday night as Kidman undertook half the roles in
Hare's free adaptation of the Austrian play ``Reigen'' _ better
known as ``La Ronde'' _ at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Actress Meryl Streep, an old hand at
acquiring exotic accents, had a little difficulty with the Irish
dialect for her latest film, ``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' but beer
helped, she said Wednesday.
	   She ``made it difficult'' for herself to perfect the County
Donegal brogue, ``but when I relaxed with a pint or two, it was
fine,'' she said before Wednesday's Dublin film premiere.
	   The production was adapted from the Brian Friel play, which was
a hit in London and on Broadway .
	   The actress, 49, plays a 1930s Donegal spinster _ the eldest of
five unmarried sisters in the fictitious village of Ballybeg.
	   She said she had long wanted to work with the movie's director,
Pat O'Connor _ '' I've admired his work for a long time.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel has
an unusual idea for who might succeed him someday: Madeleine
Albright. And he swears he's not kidding.
	   Havel said Wednesday he hasn't had a chance to discuss his
proposal with the Czech-born U.S. secretary of state, whose maiden
name is Marie Korbelova.
	   ``It occurred to me on the plane on my way back home from
America, so I did not have the chance to ask her,'' said Havel, who
returned Saturday from an official visit to the United States.
	   It was not clear what impact, if any, the president's suggestion
would have on Czech legislators who elect the president.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LWEZA, Uganda (AP) _ Princess Anne on Wednesday opened the first
center in Africa to provide holistic care for people with AIDS,
saying she expected its benefits to be widespread.
	   ``I have no doubt around Africa and in other parts of the world
thousands will benefit from this facility,'' the 48-year-old
princess said, tugging on a cord to unveil a plaque dedicating the
Mildmay Center.
	   The project is largely funded by the British government with
support from the Ugandan government and the World Bank. It is
managed by Mildmay International, a British-based Christian aid
group.
	   Anne, Queen Elizabeth II's only daughter, is on a four-country,
11-day visit to Africa, focusing on charity work. She also was
scheduled to travel to Tanzania, Kenya and Mauritius.
	   The princess also visited privately with President Yoweri
Museveni, who said Uganda's aggressive campaign to contain the
spread of AIDS is working, a government statement said.
	   At least 10 percent of Uganda's population of nearly 20 million
people is infected with the AIDS virus, and more than 500,000 have
died, according to government statistics.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Stung by reports linking his brother to drug
trafficking, former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is
demanding that five former attorneys general who served during his
administration testify on his behalf.
	   In a request presented by his lawyer, Salinas says the former
attorneys general could attest that he ``energetically fought the
production, trafficking and consumption of drugs'' during his
1988-94 presidency.
	   Salinas' unusual request, carried Wednesday by Mexican media,
followed the leak of a Swiss investigative report that claimed his
older brother, Raul, oversaw practically all drug trafficking in
Mexico during Salinas' administration.
	   Though the former president faces no criminal charges, he called
on Mexican federal prosecutors to take testimony from the former
attorneys general.
	   Analysts say the former president, believed to be living in
Ireland in self-imposed exile, is more concerned with his own

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The former president of Mexican tourism and
steel consortium Grupo Sidek _ which rocked investors when it
defaulted on debts in 1995 _ was arrested on tax evasion charges
Wednesday.
	   Prosecutors said Jose Martinez Guitron, the former president of
Sidek who stepped down in August 1996, filed false income and tax
statements on behalf of six of the firm's subsidiaries to avoid
paying more than dlrs 10 million in taxes.
	   Jose Manuel Gomez Gil, director of Sidek subsidiary Situr's
hotels division, was also arrested on the same charges, the
Attorney General's Office and the Finance Ministry said in a press
statement.
	   The two had been called to prosecutors' offices to answer
questions when they were arrested, and are being held for possible
trial by a district judge in Acapulco, a tourism resort 180 miles
(290 kilometers) south of Mexico City.
	   Sidek and affiliated companies stopped paying on their
international bonds just after the 1994 peso devaluation. Sidek is
the holding company for tourism unit Situr and steel concern Simec.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Eden Pastora, a former leader of the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels, refused a Catholic cardinal's plea
Wednesday to end his 33-day-old hunger strike.
	   Pastora is demanding the right to run for Nicaragua's presidency
in 2001. Electoral officials banned his candidacy because the
constitution prohibits any Nicaraguan who has renounced his
citizenship from seeking the office.
	   Known as ``Comandante Zero'' in the 1980s, Pastora led rebel
operations from Costa Rica, where he accepted citizenship.
	   Pastora, who returned to Nicaragua in 1990, argues that the
constitution states that Nicaraguans do not lose their citizenship
if they become citizens of another Central American country.

Hong Kong leaders seek to reassure investors about open markets
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Pressured by recession at home and the
economic collapse of several neighbors, Hong Kong wants to persuade
the world that the tiny, free-market enclave remains a good place
to do business.
	   For decades, its open markets and busy harbor brought the former
British colony a level of prosperity that made it the envy of Asia.
Now, Hong Kong _ still adjusting to its 1997 handover to China _
fears being swamped by the financial tsunami washing over Asia and
other parts of the world.
	   To make matters worse, Hong Kong's commitment to open markets
has come under question since the government spent nearly dlrs 15
billion last month to stave off attacks by speculators.
	   Next week, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang will visit
Washington and New York to attend annual meetings of the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund, and reassure investors and
business leaders that Hong Kong's markets remain free.
	   Similarly, a delegation of business, political and academic
leaders toured Washington and other cities last week to discuss
Hong Kong's economy and tell Americans the United States and Japan
must act decisively to slow the growing world financial crisis.
	   ``We feel very threatened,'' said Nellie Fong, the member of
Hong Kong's Executive Council who led the delegation to Washington,
Los Angeles and Houston. ``We depend so much on world trade.''
	   Although Hong Kong has fared better than Thailand, Indonesia and
other Asian countries, the crisis that began last year has taken a
severe toll there. Asset values have fallen 50 percent,
unemployment is at a 15- year high of nearly 5 percent and the Hong
Kong dollar has been under repeated attack from currency
speculators testing its peg to the U.S. dollar.
	   How far the crisis worsens, she said, depends on the United
States and Japan. Ms. Fong said the U.S. should lower interest
rates to ease the flow of capital in troubled economies, and help
fund the IMF so the agency can respond should another country's
economy collapse.
	   ``What is brutally clear is that whatever Hong Kong does really
makes no difference,'' Nellie Fong, a member of Hong Kong's
executive council in an interview. ``Unless the U.S. and Japan do
something, we cannot see Asia getting out of its turmoil.''
	   Hong Kong, which has successfully weathered last year's
transition from British to Chinese rule, faces a much tougher task
in dealing with the financial crisis, analysts said. Hong Kong had
years to prepare for a smooth handover, but was unprepared for the
financial crisis.
	   ``What happened subsequent to the handover was a disaster
scenario that people did not foresee,'' said Charles Morrison,
president of the East-West Center, a Honolulu think tank that
focuses on Asia. ``What happened illustrates the vulnerability of
Hong Kong: that it is a very small economy, 6 million people at the
edge of China with 1.2 billion, and that it is peculiarly dependent
on trade and its role as a financial center.''
	   The Hong Kong government's intervention in the stock market,
which consumed about 15 percent of Hong Kong's dlrs 96.5 billion in
foreign reserves, came as a shock to the international investment
community and drew criticism from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
	   The move undercut Hong Kong's reputation as one of the world's
freest economies, and raised the question of whether such action
would have been taken before last year's unification with China.
	   ``It's a different Hong Kong,'' said Greg Mastel of the Economic
Strategy Institute in Washington.
	   ``Whether these things were wise or not, we'll have to see over
time. But certainly you won't see the absolute free market that you
did before the power transfer,'' he said. ``I think it goes against
the basic instincts of Hong Kong's traditional leadership. I think
they would have gone to almost any other alternative.''
	   In a letter to Greenspan on Friday, Joseph Yam, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said Hong Kong had to take the
action to fight speculators who were trying to force down stock
prices. Had they succeeded, the market may have panicked, he said.
	   Since then, Hong Kong has taken measures to make the market less
suceptible to manipulation, Yam said.
	   ``As you know, Hong Kong is one of the freest markets in the
world, if not the freest,'' Yam wrote. ``The free market philosophy
is very much in our blood. But a free market does not mean that it
can be freely manipulated.''

Representative says peace talks will fail unless Taliban included
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Diplomatic efforts by eight countries to
end the civil conflict in Afghanistan and to defuse tensions with
neighboring Iran are futile unless the Taliban are included in the
talks, a Taliban representative said.
	   ``If there is no representative of the Islamic Emirate of
Afghanistan, the (group) will not do any result like it didn't do
any results in the past,'' Abdul Hakeem Mujahid said at a press
conference Wednesday.
	   Officials from the United States and Russia and six Afghan
neighbors _ Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan
and China _ met Monday at the United Nations in an effort to find a
solution to the regional tensions that escalated when the bodies of
several Iranian diplomats were found in Mazar-e-Sharif after the
Taliban seized the northern Afghan city.
	   The slayings prompted Tehran to mass troops on its Afghan border
and threaten military retaliation. Mujahid said Iran was trying to
destabilize his government to block potentially lucrative gas and
oil pipeline projects between the Caspian Sea and Central Asia.
	   Mujahid said Iran has no reason to invade Afghanistan, but
expressed hope that the neighbors could reconcile their differences
peacefully.
	   Witnesses have alleged that the extremist Islamic Taliban
militia killed hundreds of people belonging to ethnic minority
groups when it seized Maza-e-Sharif on Aug. 8. Mujahid denied
responsibility for the murder of Iranian diplomats or civilians.
	   The Taliban, however, have acknowledged that unidentified
soldiers acting on their own killed several Iranian diplomats.
	   Mujahid said the ``so-called'' diplomats were working to arm
opposition groups and should have been protected by the government
of Burhanuddin Rabbani, who is still recognized as the official
representative of Afghanistan at the United Nations.
	   ``We do not take responsibility for these so-called diplomats,''
Mujahid said.
	   The Taliban, which controls more than 90 percent of Afghanistan,
drove government forces from the capital of Kabul in 1996. The
Taliban have imposed harsh Islamic rules that include banning
education for girls and women.
	   The Taliban is lobbying for Afghanistan's seat at the United
Nations. Only three countries, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates, recognize the Taliban government.
	   The Taliban says Mujahid is its ambassador designate.

Malaysian police call in Anwar's wife for questioning

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police spent two hours questioning
the wife of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, whose weekend arrest
followed some of the largest protests in this country's four
decades of independence.
	   Azizah Ismail, who assumed leadership of her husband's reform
movement after his arrest, on Wednesday remained largely confined
to her house, surrounded by nearly one dozen riot police who
refused to let reporters inside.
	   In the government's drive to stifle any further challenge to
Prime Minister Mahathir's Mohamad's 17-year rule, aides to Azizah
said she was told by police she would face arrest if she publicly
addressed her husband's case.
	   Anwar, arrested Sunday, is being held under a colonial security
law that allows imprisonment without trial. He was dumped as deputy
prime minister and finance minister on Sept. 2 by Mahathir, who
called him morally unfit to lead.
	   Azizah was accompanied by two lawyers for the interrogation at
police headquarters. No details of her remarks were released and
she did not stop to speak to reporters as she drove out of the
police station.
	   ``The police have been very hard on her and on me as a
counsel,'' said one of her attorneys, Uthaya Kumar.
	   In addition to Anwar, a dozen of his associates have also been
sent to prison, to keep them from fomenting unrest. The government
has sent out numerous reminders that the reform movement's
occasional demonstrations are illegal.
	   Before answering her summons, Azizah rushed to a Kuala Lumpur
courthouse after hearing unconfirmed reports that her husband was
being brought there. Anwar faces charges ranging from disturbing
public order to sexual misconduct, including the crime of sodomy.
	   But she left dejected. Azizah and family defense attorneys have
not heard from Anwar since his arrest. They were incensed by the
stalling tactics of the police.
	   ``We don't see the need for this cat-and-mouse game. It is
common courtesy to tell the lawyers if they are going to book
him,'' said Zainul Zachariah, one of Anwar's lawyers.
	   Family members were being allowed into Anwar's home after their
identities were verified and others could go in only with a written
invitation from the household, said Mohd. Khalid, a police officer
at the scene.
	   Azizah, who has spent most of her time at home with the couple's
six children, was being investigated for allegedly making seditious
statements. She alleged that police may be planning to inject her
husband with the HIV virus while in custody.
	   Anwar, 51, has adamantly denied all the charges against him. He
says trouble started when he began questioning Mahathir's policies
and autocratic leadership.
	   Since his ouster, tens of thousands of supporters have
demonstrated at rallies throughout the country. Many are from the
conservative Islamic party he founded during his student days and
they do not believe the sexual misconduct allegations.
	   Police drove marchers away from the prime minister's residence
Sunday night in what was the first violent clash between police and
demonstrators in this Southeast Asian country in a decade.
	   Late Tuesday, the government disclosed that Anwar was being held
at Kuala Lumpur's police headquarters.

From deep inside zinc mine, physicists probe cosmic secrets

<TEXT>
	   INSIDE MOZUMI MINE, Japan (AP) _ Researcher Christopher Mauger
admits that doing cutting-edge physics from the end of a mine shaft
deep inside a mountain has its drawbacks.
	   First, there's the unsettling sight of water seeping through
fault lines that crisscross the entrance tunnel. Then there's the
lunches interrupted by the rumbling of dynamite blasts in another
section of the mine.
	   ``That certainly keeps things exciting,'' he says.
	   But to scientists around the world, the real exciting stuff has
been what the international team working out of this old zinc mine
in the Japan Alps north of Tokyo has discovered about one of the
universe's most fundamental components.
	   In June, the 120-person team from Japan, the United States and
Poland stunned their colleagues with strong evidence that subatomic
particles called neutrinos have mass.
	   To the surprise of many researchers here, the announcement was
front-page news around the world. Even U.S. President Bill Clinton
hailed the work at a commencement speech at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology the very next day.
	   ``These kind of findings have implications that are not limited
to the laboratory,'' Clinton said. ``They affect the whole of
society _ not only our economy, but also our very view of life.''
	   Heat of the moment, maybe.
	   The research at Super-Kamiokande certainly has some very broad
implications and marks a major breakthrough in a very, very
difficult game of quantum hide-and-seek.
	   Neutrinos are about as infinitesimal a thing as could be
imagined.
	   They have no electrical charge, can pass through just about
anything and, according to the standard model of particle physics,
should have no mass at all.
	   The Super-Kamiokande experiment research team has shown that
assumption may be wrong. And though the mass of the neutrino is
believed to be extremely tiny, any neutrino mass at all would have
some truly weighty implications.
	   ``If you believe in the Big Bang, a large number of neutrinos
must have been created _ about 300 in every cubic centimeter
throughout the universe,'' said Tokyo University professor Yoji
Totsuka, director of the cosmic ray observatory here.
	   Because of their sheer number, Totsuka said, even a tiny bit of
mass per particle could thus combine to account for a significant
amount of the total weight of the universe.
	   If there is enough mass in the universe, it must at some time
collapse under its own gravity, which has some wild ramifications
for such basic concepts as time and causality. If there isn't
enough mass, the universe could continue expanding forever.
	   ``Particles have the potentiality to determine the fate of the
universe,'' Totsuka said.
	   The earth is constantly showered by neutrinos raining down from
the sun, from collisions with each other particles in the
atmosphere or from the occasional explosion of a distant star. But
scientists are still unable to detect them directly.
	   At Super-Kamiokande, this problem has been resolved in a
virtuoso blend of physics and engineering.
	   Set in the heart of Mount Ikenoyama under 1 kilometer (0.6 mile)
of rock, the center of the facility is a 50,000-ton, cylindrical
tank filled with possibly the purest water in the world and lined
with 11,146 light collecting sensors.
	   Each sensor is so sensitive it can detect a single proton _ the
equivalent of being able to detect from the Earth the light of a
candle on the moon.
	   The mountain's rock barrier blocks virtually everything,
including most subatomic particles, from reaching the detectors.
But neutrinos are so minute they pass right through and enter the
tank at roughly the speed of light.
	   That is how they lose their cloak of invisibility.
	   Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light when light is
traveling through a vacuum. But when light hits the water in the
Super-Kamiokande tank, it is slowed down.
	   The tiny neutrinos keep right on going as fast as before, which
creates a Cherenkov cone, an effect something akin to the shockwave
created by a plane breaking the sound barrier.
	   Researchers, usually grad students like Mauger, of State
University of New York at Stony Brook, pull shifts watching for
these cones on a large screen in Super-Kamiokande's on-site control
room.
	   Each ring-shaped ``hit pattern'' lights up the screen in a
splash of red, orange, green and blue.
	   Fewer than a dozen neutrinos hitting the tank on the average
day. But from each particle, researchers can glean enough
information to determine its direction, how fast it was moving and
other clues to its behavior and composition.
	   Enough neutrinos had been observed since the dlrs 100 million
facility opened in April 1996 for an odd pattern to become clear _
they were oscillating, or changing type, as they moved through
space.
	   And if something oscillates, according to a widely accepted
theory, it must have mass.
	   ``Our results are very firm,'' Totsuka said. ``the response to
them has been very favorable.''
	   Still, researchers don't claim to have really figured out the
neutrino _ or the mysterious world of subatomic particles _ just
yet.
	   ``We are certainly learning more, but the more we learn the
foggier it all gets,'' Mauger said. ``Fortunately, our job isn't to
worry about all the consequences for reality. That is so much more
difficult a question.''

	   Super-Kamiokande, the world's largest and most advanced neutrino
detector, let researchers determine that neutrinos have mass _ a
question scientists had puzzled over for decades. Here are some
other cosmic coups that could be in Super-Kamiokande's future:
	   ___
	   CATCHING A NOVA _ Physicists believe that a burst of neutrinos
should be produced by the explosive death of a star, or the birth
of a black hole, and that the burst should reach Earth before light
does. Super-Kamiokande has a system in place to watch around the
clock for such a burst. ``It may happen tomorrow, or it may happen
another 150 years from now. But I'm pretty sure that we will find
the next super nova,'' says Yoji Totsuka, the facility's director.
	   ___
	   SOLAR NEUTRINO DEFICIENCY _ Scientists believe neutrinos are
formed in copious numbers as part of the process that fuels the
sun. But the amount of neutrinos observed coming from the sun is
far fewer than theory predicts. Totsuka said neutrino mass may
unlock that riddle, and expects to have an answer in as soon as two
years.
	   ___
	   SOLAR COOLING _ Super-Kamiokande is a very good monitor of solar
energy production, and long term use of the facility could shed
light on how changes in the sun are related to ice ages and other
climate fluctuations on Earth. Long-term is the key word here.
``Thirty years is not enough,'' Totsuka said. ``But it could
produce some interesting results.''

Velvet antlers gaining acceptance as folk remedy in the West
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By DAVID SHARP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SCARBOROUGH, Maine (AP) _ Velvet from growing antlers, which has
long been considered an aphrodisiac in Asia, is gaining wider
acceptance in the West as a remedy for everything from arthritis to
building bigger muscles.
	   The growing popularity is good for the Bayley Hill Elk and Deer
Farm, where antlers are harvested from 200 male red deer and elk
and account for a third of annual revenue, said Nick Richardson,
the manager.
	   Richardson hasn't tried antler capsules, but he said many who
have swear by them.
	   ``People have taken these and they feel 100 percent better,'' he
said as he showed off a dozen tagged antlers in a freezer awaiting
shipment.
	   The animals get local anesthesia before removal of their
velvet-covered antlers with a surgical saw. Minutes later, they're
outside munching hay as they recuperate. They're fully recovered in
24 hours.
	   The whole antlers, which grow back and range from 5 to 35 pounds
(2 to 16 kilograms), are dried and processed into a powder used in
the capsules.
	   Velvet antler, which has been consumed for 2,000 years in Asia,
contains protein, essential amino acids, fatty acids, lipids,
collagen and other elements, said Marion Allen, a nursing professor
at Canada's University of Alberta, where athletes are being given
the substance.
	   Anecdotal evidence suggests it helps arthritis, promotes healing
and builds muscle, she said. Others say it helps lower blood
pressure and ease symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.
	   ``It's quite fascinating. When you look at the things that are
in it, it makes sense,'' Allen said.
	   The value of antlers peaked two years ago at about dlrs 80 a
pound (dlrs 178 a kilogram). The price has since plummeted _ to
about dlrs 35 _ because of economic problems plaguing Asia,
Richardson said.
	   That's why farmers like Richardson and Butch Tobin in Aroostook
County are happy to have a growing interest in antlers from
consumers in North America.
	   The first introduction to the velvet antler phenomenon for many
Americans came recently in Sports Illustrated, which contained a
brief story about the football team at Allen's school being given
antler capsules to see if they build muscle.
	   The school will soon begin the first clinical study of the
suitability of velvet antler in treating rheumatoid arthritis, she
said.
	   The Arthritis Foundation, based in Atlanta, has little
information about the effectiveness of antlers in treating
arthritis, said Kim Sammons, a spokeswoman.
	   ``It's an unproven remedy, which means more research needs to be
done before we support the general use of deer antlers,'' she said.
``We wouldn't advocate that anyone use this.''
	   In Scarborough, farm owner Fred Bayley was so impressed by how
the antler velvet made him feel that he gave some to his lame
chocolate Labrador retriever, Richardson said.
	   The dog hopped up, ran away and was gone for half a day.
``There's no explanation other than the pills,'' Richardson said.
	   Velvet antler is not regulated by the Food and Drug
Administration, and its health benefits are not proven. Capsules
produced by Tobin's farm in Mapleton are sold at about 25 Maine
health food stores.
	   Lois Porta, who runs Lois' Natural Marketplace in Scarborough,
said the first buyers were people seeking solutions to arthritis
pain. But lately, body builders and athletes have been snapping it
up.
	   ``It is gaining a lot of popularity. We're selling a lot more of
it,'' she said. The price is dlrs 68.99 for 120 capsules.
	   For now, the antlers remain a side business at the Bayley farm,
where the males in the herd produced about three-quarters of a ton
of velvet antlers last year, Richardson said.
	   Most of the farm's revenue comes from the sale of breeder elk
and deer and meat that is increasingly popular because it's much
lower in fat and cholesterol than beef, Richardson said.
	   Tobin processes antler for his own farm and others around the
country. His operation processed a ton of antlers last year and has
produced about 10 million capsules since 1994.
	   Some athletes are skeptical, looking for more proof before they
begin ingesting antlers.
	   Dennis Greene, a weight lifter in South Portland, said he will
stick with other diet supplements and vitamins for now.
	   ``Something about antlers doesn't reach out and grab me,'' he
said.

Tokyo stocks surge, dollar higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks surged early Thursday as investors
welcomed overnight gains on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar was higher
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 254.46 points,
or 1.85 percent, to 14,044.27 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Tuesday, the index gained 192.51 points, or 1.42 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all shares listed on the
first section was up 18.45 points, or 1.76 percent, to 1,068.62.
The TOPIX rose 2.38 points, or 0.23 percent, Tuesday.
	   Japanese financial markets were closed Wednesday for a national
holiday.
	   Traders attributed the strength in Japanese stocks to overnight
gains in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York, which rose
in reaction to comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
hinting at a cut in U.S. interest rates.
	   The Dow surged to 8,154 by the close, its highest finish in a
month. More than half of the 257-point gain came during the final
hour of trading.
	   On Wednesday, Greenspan testified before the Senate Budget
Committee that Fed policymakers are fully aware of the widening
financial crisis that has spread from Asia to the rest of the
world.
	   That was the clearest signal yet that he'll fight the global
economic crisis with lower U.S. interest rates. The Fed's
policymaking committee meets next Tuesday.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar bought 135.62 yen in early
trading, up 0.48 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but below its late
New York level of 135.75 yen overnight.
	   The dollar maintained its strength against the yen because of
lingering uncertainties over a stalemate between Japanese ruling
and opposition parties over bills to rescue troubled financial
institutions, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond stood at 0.925 percent, up from Tuesday's finish of 0.900
percent, driving its price down to 107.80 yen from 108.04 yen.

No bail for bin Laden secretary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The former personal secretary of Muslim
extremist Osama bin Laden was ordered held without bail.
	   Wadih El Hage, 38, has been charged with perjury for allegedly
lying about his ties to bin Laden's terrorist organization.
	   Bin Laden is the Saudi exile wanted by U.S. authorities for
allegedly coordinating attacks on American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7 that killed 259 people, including 12 Americans,
and wounded thousands.
	   El Hage's attorney told U.S. Magistrate Judge Leonard Bernikow
on Wednesday that his client was not charged in the bombing and
would not flee the country. Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick
Fitzgerald said El Hage's ties to bin Laden and World Trade Center
bomber Mahmoud Abouhalima were reason enough to keep him held
without bail.
	   Bernikow ordered El Hage held without bail. El Hage, dressed in
a light blue prison top and dark pants, said nothing during the
hearing.
	   The same grand jury that indicted El Hage has also been
investigating whether he tried to procure chemical weapons for bin
Laden. El Hage, who was arrested last week, is charged with eight
counts of perjury and three counts of making false statements.
	   El Hage has admitted working as bin Laden's personal secretary
in the Sudan in 1994.

If it creeps or crawls, look for it at the Insectarium

	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Five-year-old Andrew Belcher was about to
eat a worm, but he dropped it on the floor before he could pop it
in his mouth.
	   ``You don't want to eat that!'' Christi Cullen warned.
	   The young museum guide fished out a new cheese-covered worm and
handed it to him.
	   ``Tastes like a cheese doodle,'' Andrew said.
	   Cheese-covered meal worms are one of many treats awaiting
brave-hearted, strong-stomached visitors to The Philadelphia
Insectarium. If it creeps, crawls, stings or bites, you'll probably
find it here.
	   Some of the specimens in the 6,000-square-foot
(560-square-meter) museum are alive in natural habitats. The rest
weren't so lucky. They're mounted on the walls.
	   Part zoo, part museum, the Insectarium has been delighting
children and grossing out their parents since 1992. It's owned and
operated by a man who has made a career of killing bugs: Steve
Kanya of Steve's Bug-Off, an exterminating company housed in the
same building.
	   Kanya opened his museum after he noticed children stopping to
look at his catches of the day _ a motley collection of rats, mice
and insects he put in the window to attract business.
	   His museum workers are old bug hands.
	   ``When I was young I was always the one out digging in the dirt
and picking up worms and saying, 'Ooh! Look at this!''' Director
Maureen Kennedy said.
	   This month, the museum is showing off insects from around the
world, including bugs that look like ordinary tree leaves and
insects so ornate that they are worn as living jewelry in Mexico.
	   Visitors are allowed to touch many of the dead bugs from Africa,
Asia and Australia.
	   The star attraction is a most unpopular visitor _ the American
cockroach. In the museum's ``Cockroach Kitchen,'' thousands live
amid linoleum and wooden cabinets in a glass display case.
	   The museum aims to teach children that insects do more than
sting, bite and annoy; they're a vital part of the ecosystem:
Termites dispose of fallen trees, millipedes stir up dirt to make
room for the plants and bees and butterflies pollinate flowers.
	   ``Without bugs the world would be very different,'' Ms. Kennedy
said. ``It'd be a lot dirtier, and probably not as pretty.''

<TEXT>
	   MOLALLA, Oregon (AP) _ A seasoned Bigfoot enthusiast, Charles
Baker knew the signs: the matted grass, the twisted branches, the
stench that set the dog off and the shrill scream that made it
silent.
	   It was late one February night, and Baker was wandering through
the woods along the lower Molalla River. He didn't see the beast.
But the 28-year-old security officer and outdoorsman believes he
had a close encounter with the creature also known as Yeti, Yayoo,
Skunk Ape or Sasquatch.
	   ``It's out there, and it's a lot more intelligent than people
realize,'' Baker said.
	   After all of these years, reports of the elusive giant continue
to trickle in from the forests of the Northwest, the foothills of
Ohio and the swamplands of Florida. And despite the persistent lack
of hard evidence, investigators continue to dog the beast, risking
savings and reputations to find proof that Bigfoot exists.
	   ``I have every confidence it will happen,'' says Ray Crowe,
founder of the Western Bigfoot Society, a Portland-based nonprofit
group that is considered the largest of its kind. ``I'm just
concerned someone else will beat us to it.''
	   Crowe estimates that 50 to 100 researchers are actively pursuing
the creature around the world, using sophisticated search tools
ranging from infrared cameras to DNA-retrieving dart guns and
seismic sensors.
	   Still, the most conclusive evidence on record is the primitive
1967 footage known as the Patterson film, which shows a blurred and
jerky image of what appears to be a large, hairy beast running
through the woods.
	   ``No one can knock that picture,'' Crowe said.
	   These days, with the technology to alter film and video easily
and realistically, bigfooters know it will take more than footage
to prove the beast exists. They need a body _ dead or alive.
	   ``That's the only way,'' Crowe says.
	   Crowe, 60, has been looking for Bigfoot since 1991, when he
began transforming the basement of his used bookstore into a
Bigfoot museum and meeting place. The society was born, quickly
growing to 250 members, and Crowe began to publish the Track Record
newsletter every month.
	   It was Crowe who took the call about some strange goings-on near
Molalla. Baker, who has hunted in the area since he was a child,
believed he had come across the spot where a Bigfoot creature had
made its bed at the base of a ridge.
	   Several months old by then, the giant footprint Baker saw
pressed into the ground was long gone. After ducking through a
thicket for a closer look, Crowe concluded that the matted grass
was more than likely made by a camper's sleeping bag. The broken
branches were clearly cut by machete.
	   Still, there was no explaining the eerie scream that echoed
through the canyon. Or the stench, which is often reported along
with a sighting: ``That sucker was ripe,'' Baker said.
	   And it wasn't the first such report in the area. In 1992, Sharon
and LeRoy Jones were camping nearby when they say they heard
something banging on the cage of their pet rabbits. They say they
then saw a Bigfoot dart back into the bushes.
	   There are dozens of accounts on the Internet:
	   _ In Portland last year, a student reported seeing a Bigfoot
while videotaping a class project near the Washington Park Zoo,
although his father believed the sighting was an excuse for losing
his new video camera.
	   _ Near Colton, southeast of Portland, in 1995, a bow hunter
sensed he was being followed, turned and saw a Sasquatch staring at
him about 25 feet (7.6 meters) away.
	   _ At a logging camp near Detroit, a small town southeast of
Salem, in 1970, a 16-year-old girl reported seeing a Bigfoot with
breasts stealing meat from the family's cooler.
	   Sightings haven't been limited to the Northwest. There is an
active Bigfoot society in Ohio, where one man recently claimed to
have videotaped a white Sasquatch. In Florida, recent reports of
the ``skunk ape'' can be found on the Internet.
	   Crowe writes up nearly all the sightings in his newsletter,
although he warns readers to keep on their ``skepticals'' and is
leery of reports that link Bigfoot with UFOs, psychic connections
and different dimensions.
	   ``You don't throw out data,'' said Crowe. ``You never know if it
will be the thing that gives you something new.''
	   The greatest problem is not weeding through the sightings, but
getting information about them in the first place. Often, people
too embarrassed to come forward or don't know whom to call, he
said.
	   Publicity had been boosting the Western Bigfoot Society's
exposure in recent years, and reports were rolling in more
frequently. But they've slowed in the last year, after the fire
marshal banned meetings larger than 10 people and Crowe decided to
shut the store down.
	   He hopes to replace it with a stand-alone Bigfoot museum, which
he plans to build along Interstate 5 as soon as the funding is
found.
	   His group still meets weekly at a north Portland restaurant,
where on a recent Tuesday a lively debate ensued about what sounds,
if any, Bigfoot makes.
	   They're a diverse bunch: an archer who once heard unidentifiable
screams on Dixie Mountain in the 1970s; an industrial pump salesman
who has taken to baiting Bigfoot with Spam in steep canyons
throughout Northwest forests.
	   And there's Peter Byrne.
	   For five years beginning in 1992, Byrne led the Bigfoot Research
Project, the most technologically advanced search for Bigfoot in
history. Funded by a dlrs 1 million grant from a benefactor who
wants anonymity, Byrne and two assistants were equipped with a
Jeep, police gear, military search equipment and a toll-free phone
number (1-800-BIG-FOOT.)
	   Dozens of volunteers were on call in case of a sighting. Two
helicopters were on standby, one equipped with infrared equipment.
Biopsy guns were readied to extract pellet-size samples of tissue
for DNA testing.
	   But the the best the searchers got was a 31-day-old report from
a policeman who believed he saw a Bigfoot walking along the Oregon
coast. Any evidence was gone by the time investigators got there.
	   The project ended last year, and Byrne is still working to drum
up more funding. In the meantime, he and the others continue the
search on their own time and money.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ Navy divers have recovered most
of the spy satellite that was destroyed in a launch accident last
month.
	   After a full month of arduous work the 61-member dive team
pulled 80 percent of the satellite from the Atlantic Ocean,
officials said. By mid-September, they also retrieved about 30
percent of the Air Force Titan 4 rocket that blew up shortly after
liftoff on Aug. 12.
	   The president of the accident investigation board, Air Force
Maj. Gen. Robert Hinson, said divers would continue searching for
debris using sonar equipment and metal detectors. The wreckage area
is located one to five miles (eight kilometers) offshore, covers
more than 20 square miles (50 square kilometers) and is between 20
feet (6 meters) and 50 feet (15 meters) deep.
	   Engineers believe the accident was caused by a momentary power
outage in the rocket's electrical system that, in turn, affected
its steering.
	   The satellite and rocket cost about dlrs 1 billion.

	   LIVERMORE, California (AP) _ Travel between any two points on
the planet would take about two hours aboard a revolutionary jet
that skips across the atmosphere, said scientists at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory.
	   The plane, called HyperSoar, would fly at Mach 10 _ 6,700 mph
(10,782 kph). Just a design at this point, the plane would be
shaped like a dagger blade and soar to 130,000 feet (39,624
meters). It would bounce along the atmosphere like a pebble skips
across water.
	   ``The average passenger will probably put up with the slight
roller coaster motion if it gets them from San Francisco to Tokyo
in less than two hours rather than 10 1-2 ,'' said Preston Carter,
the Livermore aerospace engineer who developed the design.
	   HyperSoar would use less fuel and carry twice as much as a
Boeing 747. More research is needed, Carter said. A prototype would
cost about dlrs 350 million to build.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (AP) _ Supermarket perishables change
hands so many times, it's often hard to know when they start
spoiling, but that may soon change.
	   A new type of tagging system called Vitsab was developed in
Sweden and is being marketed by Cox Technologies. Shippers would
attach the Vitsab tags _ adhesive labels or on sheaths _ to cartons
or pallets before they are sent out to stores.
	   Indicator dots on the tags change color if the time/temperature
exposure exceeds a predetermined safe period during shipping or in
storage.
	   A major supermarket chain of 1,200 stores in the Southeast has
tested the tags and plans to use them this fall on catfish filets,
Cox said. The company wouldn't identify the chain.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NORTH CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ Hurricane predictions
are more accurate than a few years ago, in part because of a new
jet that flies the outer edges of the giant storms collecting data,
a federal official said.
	   ``They can give us predictions now so much better with the
intensity of the storm that we can actually pre-position people and
resources out of harm's way but close enough to be able to
respond,'' said James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. ``Each year they get better at their predictions
and projections.''
	   The Gulfstream IV placed in service last year flies at about
45,000 feet (13,716 meters) on the edges of hurricanes, dropping
radio transmitters that send storm data back to the plane, said Lt.
Cmdr. Sean White of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
	   The information, which is key to determining the storm's course,
is used in conjunction with data gathered by P-3 hurricane hunters
flying through a storm's eye at 25,000 feet (7,620 meters).

Democrats' drive for censure aimed at shortening inquiry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Political Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The drive to strike a presidential ``plea
bargain'' is much ado about politics: It's designed to give
Democrats a safe haven from the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal this
election season and expose Republicans to charges of hijacking the
impeachment process.
	   With a heavy hand from the White House, Democratic lawmakers are
pushing for a presidential punishment short of impeachment. The
ideas include a formal censure, a fine covering the investigation's
costs and a humbling appearance before a congressional committee or
in the well of the Senate.
	   Under any such scenario, President Bill Clinton would be
guaranteed no impeachment or criminal charges. Case closed.
	   ``It is not necessary to have a long, protracted
investigation,'' said Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat,
who urged Republicans to consider alternatives to impeachment and
avoid ``a partisan circus.''
	   A senior presidential adviser, speaking on condition of
anonymity, says that under the right conditions Clinton would
except a censure and a fine and perhaps more. ``The president would
do whatever it takes to get this over with,'' said the adviser, who
discussed the issue with the president this week.
	   But there's a huge snag: Nobody, including Clinton and his
allies, expects Republicans to go along.
	   House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said the Republican-led Congress
has a constitutional duty to carefully review evidence presented by
prosecutor Kenneth Starr before passing judgment. Rejecting talk of
a deal, he said Wednesday, ``For anybody to talk about doing
anything before we finish the investigative process simply puts the
cart before the horse.''
	   His lieutenants plan to recommend a formal impeachment inquiry
as early as next week, then begin hearings after the Nov. 3 midterm
elections. The House Judiciary Committee might have power to
broaden the inquiry beyond Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky
into other matters, such as potential campaign finance abuses.
	   Republican operatives note that such a deliberative process
would keep Clinton dangling through the elections, probably helping
them expand their majorities in Congress and statehouses.
	   That's why Democrats are talking deal.
	   Their candidates are taking a beating across the country because
of the controversy.
	   Too soft on Clinton, and they're attacked by Republican
opponents. Too hard on him, and they alienate such hard-core
Democratic voters as minorities and union members.
	   Rallying around a proposed compromise would allow Democrats to
have it both ways: Support punishment of Clinton, and give him a
way to survive. Polls show that a big majority of Americans favors
censure over impeachment.
	   ``It finally puts Democrats in line with where the American
public is and what they want to hear,'' said Leon Panetta,
Clinton's former chief of staff and one of his first allies to call
for censure.
	   After the president confessed to his affair Aug. 17, surveys
conducted for the White House revealed the voters were blaming him
for extending the controversy; aides feared that Americans would
see his resignation as the quickest way to end it.
	   They needed somebody else to blame.
	   Raising the prospect of a deal _ while knowing Republicans would
reject it _ was calculated to saddle Republican lawmakers with the
responsibility for keeping the controversy alive. Just listen to
what Democrats were saying Wednesday
	   Kerry warned of a ``partisan, political, strategic'' attempt to
drag out the scandal.
	   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said it was in the
Republicans' ``narrow political interest to subject the country to
months, and quite possibly years, of highly partisan
investigations.''
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry accused Republicans of trying
to ``string this matter out forever and ever.'' From the White
House lectern, the spokesman said some Republican lawmakers want a
quick resolution but are guided by ``the jihad caucus.''
	   Led by Gingrich, Republicans denounced the White House strategy.
	   ``There's no way we can move to compromise when we're in the
middle of the process,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who
knows Clinton better than perhaps anybody else on the Judiciary
Committee. ``They are playing a cynical game _ playing on the sense
of Americans and twisting it.''
	   Whether the strategy succeeds or not, it underscores how
excruciating this ordeal has become: Bill Clinton, a man with a
rich sense of his place in history, is now positioning himself to
become only the second president of the United States to be
censured.
	   ``Look, there is pain with any of these courses of action,''
McCurry told reporters Wednesday. ``There is pain just with the
simple idea that this matter is part of the historical record of
his presidency.''
	   ___
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Ron Fournier, the AP's national political
writer, has covered Bill Clinton for more than 10 years.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Congo demanded the withdrawal of
foreign troops from its soil and accused the U.N. Security Council
of failing to act quickly to end rebel attacks in the embattled
central African nation.
	   ``In similar cases _ in Kosovo, in Bosnia and in Kuwait _ the
Security Council dealt with the situation in a prompt and real way
to restore peace there. Why was there silence from the
international community, particularly from the Security Council?,''
Congo's Foreign Minister Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe asked the
U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday.
	   He accused the Security Council of pursuing a policy of ``double
standards'' and called on the United Nations to prevail on Congo's
neighbors to sign a non-aggression pact.
	   The Congo accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of invading the
country, massacring thousands of innocent Congolese and destroying
billions of dollars in infrastructure.
	   Uganda and Rwanda deny helping the rebels but Uganda admits it
has troops in northeastern Congo to defend its security interests,
and Rwanda has reserved the right to intervene to protect itself
from Rwandan Hutu rebel attacks.
	   Several African leaders have defended their decisions to
intervene in the Congo conflict, telling heads of state that the
sprawling nation would collapse if rebels ousted President Laurent
Kabila.
	   The foreign ministers of Namibia and Zimbabwe, speaking Tuesday
at the General Assembly, urged a negotiated settlement to end the
fighting that began in August with a rebellion in the eastern Congo
and moved west toward the capital, Kinshasa.
	   The rebels were driven from western Congo after forces from
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia came to Kabila's aid. The insurgents
continue to hold a swath of territory in eastern Congo, bordering
Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.
	   France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, on Wednesday called
for a regional solution to the conflict which now involves six or
seven nations, and repeated French calls for a conference on peace
in the Great Lakes part of Africa.
	   ``It is illusory to hope for a separate settlement in each of
these states,'' involved in Congo, he said.
	   The Congo conflict was one of many global issues taking center
stage at the United Nations Wednesday.
	   The Security Council demanded a cease-fire in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo and threatened further action if fighting
continues. The resolution was approved 14-0 with China abstaining.
	   In a surprise move, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif took
an important step toward defusing the nuclear arms race in South
Asia, touched off by rival nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in
May.
	   Sharif announced in a speech to the General Assembly that
Pakistan would unilaterally adhere to the nuclear test ban treaty
if international sanctions imposed after the tests are speedily
lifted.
	   There were several suggestions on how to deal with the global
financial crisis.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said the crisis ``shed
light on the improper balance between the power of the market and
the power of institutions.''
	   He called for urgent efforts to strengthen international
leadership to build more powerful institutions that can coordinate
with governments to stabilize the global economy and guarantee
economic.
	   Pledging to maintain the stability of China's currency, Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan urged developed nations to ``shoulder their
responsibilities and take active, resolute and effective measures''
to promote Asia's economic recovery.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces seemed intent on
crushing ethnic Albanian separatists in central Kosovo despite
world leaders' demands for a cease-fire in the province.
	   Hours before the United Nations Security Council passed a
resolution calling for the fighting to stop Wednesday and
threatening further action if it did not, artillery boomed across
the central Drenica region of the Serbian province.
	   Up to 20,000 civilians had fled their homes and were believed to
be trapped by the fighting. Thousands of Serb police, Yugoslav
soldiers and armed Serb civilians, patrolled nearly all routes into
the region, tightening a noose on several hundred lightly armed
rebels who built a network of trenches and sandbag bunkers in the
mountainous area.
	   Serbia is the larger republic, which together with Montenegro
comprises what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   The resolution, which was passed 14-0 at U.N. headquarters in
New York, was intended to increase pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to loosen his grip on Kosovo, where majority
ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh described the resolution
as a clear message to Belgrade ``that the council is demanding that
they change their behavior and live up to their responsibilities.''
	   China abstained from voting on the resolution, which is
militarily enforceable but doesn't explicitly authorize NATO
intervention to try to stop the Serb offensive on ethnic Albanian
separatists. It also requires the council to revisit the issue
before any U.N. authorization of force is granted.
	   In Portugal, where NATO defense ministers were to meet Thursday,
an alliance official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
get-tough resolution opened the way for a ``significant upping of
the ante.''
	   NATO sources said a number of nations, including Germany and the
Netherlands, already have committed men and aircraft to any future
military action against Yugoslavia.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic as saying the resolution was
``groundless and counterproductive'' and that the Kosovo crisis
could not be settled ``with the use of force.
	   ``We are therefore deeply convinced that even mention of the use
of force is negative,'' Jovanovic said.
	   The main Albanian political figure, Ibrahim Rugova, has
repeatedly called for world leaders to intervene to stop the
Serbian offensive.
	   Western powers generally support returning autonomy to Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians, but steadfastly reject the campaign for
independence being waged by the Kosovo Liberation Army and the
Albanian nationals who are supplying them arms.
	   Before the vote in New York, Serbia's President Milan
Milutinovic declared at a meeting with Yugoslav army commanders
that Yugoslavia would defend its sovereignty and territorial
integrity, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
	   He added that the world should pressure Albania because it
provides bases for the ``terrorists,'' rather than threaten
Yugoslavia.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed that 11
ethnic Albanian civilians were killed Tuesday. Serb sources said
three police were killed and five wounded in Tuesday's fighting.
	   A hospital source, who refused to be identified, said Serb
policemen brought twelve injured ethnic Albanian civilians,
including four babies, into Pristina hospital late Wednesday. The
police found them in a forest in Drenica suffering shrapnel wounds.

Democrats' drive for censure aimed at shortening inquiry

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The drive to strike a presidential ``plea
bargain'' is much ado about politics: It's designed to give
Democrats a safe haven from the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal this
election season and expose Republicans to charges of hijacking the
impeachment process.
	   With a heavy hand from the White House, Democratic lawmakers are
pushing for a presidential punishment short of impeachment. The
ideas include a formal censure, a fine covering the investigation's
costs and a humbling appearance before a congressional committee or
in the well of the Senate.
	   Under any such scenario, President Bill Clinton would be
guaranteed no impeachment or criminal charges. Case closed.
	   ``It is not necessary to have a long, protracted
investigation,'' said Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat,
who urged Republicans to consider alternatives to impeachment and
avoid ``a partisan circus.''
	   A senior presidential adviser, speaking on condition of
anonymity, says that under the right conditions Clinton would
accept a censure and a fine and perhaps more. ``The president would
do whatever it takes to get this over with,'' said the adviser, who
discussed the issue with the president this week.
	   But there's a huge snag: Nobody, including Clinton and his
allies, expects Republicans to go along.
	   House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said the Republican-led Congress
has a constitutional duty to carefully review evidence presented by
prosecutor Kenneth Starr before passing judgment. Rejecting talk of
a deal, he said Wednesday, ``For anybody to talk about doing
anything before we finish the investigative process simply puts the
cart before the horse.''
	   His lieutenants plan to recommend a formal impeachment inquiry
as early as next week, then begin hearings after the Nov. 3 midterm
elections. The House Judiciary Committee might have power to
broaden the inquiry beyond Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky
into other matters, such as potential campaign finance abuses.
	   Republican operatives note that such a deliberative process
would keep Clinton dangling through the elections, probably helping
them expand their majorities in Congress and statehouses.
	   That's why Democrats are talking deal.
	   Their candidates are taking a beating across the country because
of the controversy.
	   Too soft on Clinton, and they're attacked by Republican
opponents. Too hard on him, and they alienate such hard-core
Democratic voters as minorities and union members.
	   Rallying around a proposed compromise would allow Democrats to
have it both ways: Support punishment of Clinton, and give him a
way to survive. Polls show that a big majority of Americans favors
censure over impeachment.
	   ``It finally puts Democrats in line with where the American
public is and what they want to hear,'' said Leon Panetta,
Clinton's former chief of staff and one of his first allies to call
for censure.
	   After the president confessed to his affair Aug. 17, surveys
conducted for the White House revealed the voters were blaming him
for extending the controversy; aides feared that Americans would
see his resignation as the quickest way to end it.
	   They needed somebody else to blame.
	   Raising the prospect of a deal _ while knowing Republicans would
reject it _ was calculated to saddle Republican lawmakers with the
responsibility for keeping the controversy alive. Just listen to
what Democrats were saying Wednesday.

U.N. should help settle Gibraltar question, Spain says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with British response &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Settling the question of who controls
Gibraltar _ a territorial dispute with Britain that has raged for
more than two centuries _ is high on Spain's agenda, the foreign
minister told the U.N. General Assembly.
	   ``During the 1997 round of negotitaions, I submitted a proposal
which would allow Spain to regain soveriegnty over Gibraltar, at
the same time maintaining all the current advantages of the
inhabitants of this territory,'' Abel Matutes said Wednesday.
	   The United Nations has played a role in many of the regional
conflicts that have erupted in the aftermath of decolonization.
	   ``With the decade for decolonization about to end, I believe it
is important to recall that the historic work performed by the
(United Nations) in this field cannot be considered complete as
long as colonial situations remain,'' Matutes said. ``Every year,
the General Assmebly renews its appeals to Spain and the United
Kingdom to continue their negotiations with a view to putting an
end to the colonial situation of Gibraltar.''
	   Gibraltar, an island at the entrance to the Mediterranean, has
bedeviled relations between Spain and Britain since the land was
ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.
	   The conservative government of Jose Maria Aznar in Madrid has
been vigorously pressing Spain's claim to sovereignty over
Gibraltar. However, the 55,000 Gibraltarians overwhelmingly oppose
becoming a part of Spain, and Britain argues that it cannot hand
over sovereignty without the consent of the colony's residents.
	   In response, a British deputy representative later said his
government will not allow Gibraltar's ``sovereignty to pass to
another against the freely expressed wishes'' of its citizens.
	   Only continuing direct talks with Spain is the ``means to
overcoming our differences,'' he said.

German angst over foreigners plays out in election campaigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-The Fringe &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ He's only 14 years old, a burly kid with
a violent streak. Yet, he has come to symbolize one of the
prickliest campaign issues in this year's German elections:
foreigners and what to do with them.
	   The Turkish teen-ager, who has a long history of fights,
vandalism and petty thefts, was turned into a poster child for
conservatives pushing for a crackdown on criminal foreigners.
	   Nevermind that the boy, known simply as Mehmet, was born and
raised in Munich. They want him deported to Turkey. Doesn't matter
that his law-abiding, tax-paying parents have lived and worked here
for 30 years. They should be sent back, too.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Bavarian ally, the Christian Social
Union, credits its hard line with Mehmet for helping it win state
elections in the deeply conservative state earlier this month.
	   But Mehmet's case also has resonated in the national campaign
for parliamentary elections Sunday. He represents Germany's angst
about a changing society, where 7 million foreigners live among 75
million Germans.
	   ``I don't know if other people deal with the subject of
foreigners more calmly than Germans, but in Germany there's a very
strong feeling that foreigners are strange,'' says Joachim Graffe,
head of social services in Munich. ``There's a noticeable
`us-and-them' feeling.''
	   And in times of economic uncertainty, with unemployment
stubbornly stuck above 10 percent, ``the foreigner offers a chance
for the public to vent its anger.''
	   In a Forsa survey conducted for Die Woche newspaper and released
last month, 52 percent of Germans said there are too many
foreigners in Germany, and 10 percent said they could see
themselves voting for a far-right party. Forsa surveyed 1,006
eligible voters nationwide.
	   Many Germans did turn to far-right parties in April, when the
anti-foreigner German People's Union came from nowhere to score 13
percent in a state election in eastern Germany.
	   But the issue has gone beyond extremists accusing foreigners of
stealing German jobs and milking the welfare system. Even
mainstream parties talk tough about curtailing the influx of
refugees.
	   Officials in Kohl's conservative government insist Germany is
not ``an immigration land'' and rule out proposals for dual
citizenship.
	   The challenger, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, while
supporting dual citizenship, joins calls for deporting foreigners
who commit crimes here, despite protests from his traditionally
leftist party.
	   The federal government's commissioner for foreigner affairs last
month chastised both sides for campaigning ``on the backs of
foreigners.''
	   The very public soul-searching is indicative of Germany's
struggle to define a role for foreigners who have lived here for
decades and for the waves that have come since the fall of the Iron
Curtain.
	   Many new arrivals are refugees from regional conflicts taken in
by Germany until the situation at home settles down. There are also
ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union with legal claims to
citizenship, and, many fear, criminal gangs from the former eastern
bloc.
	   Even those who have been here for generations find integration
difficult. They include Germany's 2 million Turks, many of whom
were among the ``guest workers'' invited here in the 1960s and
1970s.
	   Like Mehmet's parents. The boy's lawyer says the parents don't
consider themselves German, but Mehmet, born here, does.
	   In jail since his latest scrape with the law in July, Mehmet
gets letters from German friends, but not from his parents. They
can only write in Turkish, which he can't read.
	   The thought of being deported to Turkey, which he's only visited
for short vacations, fills him with dread.
	   ``He says very clearly: `What am I supposed to do down there?'
the lawyer, Alexander Eberth, says. ``He thinks it's OK that he
will be punished for the latest incident, but why is he to be sent
out of the country _ and not his three cohorts who did the exact
same thing?''
	   Bavarian courts have blocked the expulsion of Mehmet's parents,
but Mehmet is still in legal limbo. He goes on trial Sept. 30 on
charges of causing bodily harm stemming from the fight in July, and
his residency permit may not be renewed if convicted.
	   Even those who want to deport him, like Munich Mayor Christian
Ude, admit it's not a great solution.
	   But in extreme cases with repeat offenders, the protection of
potential future victims must come first, the mayor says. ``And our
law differentiates between those who are citizens and those who
aren't. Every country in the world does that.''

Fringe parties on the stump: Free beer for all!
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ One second, punks dance in the streets and guzzle
beer. The next, they sit grinning in German luxury cars as men in
business suits clean their windshields.
	   Reality? No. Just a TV ad from the Anarchist Slamdancing Party
of Germany, one of the many small and mostly unknown groups
campaigning for the vote in national elections taking place Sept.
27.
	   More fringe parties than ever before _ 24, up from 14 four years
ago _ are competing this year alongside the eight bigger ones that
have seats in national or state parliaments.
	   True, none of these mini-parties have a prayer of getting into
parliament. Some of them aren't even on any of the 16 state ballots
because they failed to gather the some 2,000 signatures to qualify.
	   So why bother?
	   Money is one reason the number of small parties are increasing.
	   More people are catching on to the German law that requires
state funding for any party that wins at least 0.5 percent of
regional voting. That's well below the 5 percent of the vote
required to gain seats in parliament. Even if you lose the
election, you can still get some cash.
	   Some parties are within the realm of the plausible, like the
Grey Panthers, a group of disgruntled pensioners, or the ``Pro
Deutsche mark'' party that hates the idea of losing the national
tender to the European common currency or euro.
	   Then there's the fringe of the fringe.
	   ``We are for the total re-stupidification of humanity and for
the balkanization of Germany,'' said Karl Nagel, who heads the
Hamburg-based Anarchist Slamdancing Party.
	   His party, which claims to represent ``social parasites,''
campaigns on slogans such as ``Work is (expletive)'' and ``Free
beer for all.'' The anarchists also envision ``zones'' for
workaholics, fueled by legalized ``cocaine, speed, and Ecstasy.''
	   Car freaks, animal lovers, feminists, radical environmentalists,
communists, evangelical Christians, even vote boycotters, have
dedicated political parties in Germany.
	   One right-wing party _ Citizens Movement Solidarity _ is headed
in Germany by Helga Zep-LaRouche, the wife of U.S. right-wing
extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
	   While some certainly believe in their mission statements, others
_ such as the Anarchist Slamdancers _ are running just to shake
things up a bit. They also admit they're in politics for the money.
And if they manage to leap the crucial 0.5 percent hurdle, they're
going to throw a big party with the proceeds.
	   In keeping with their campaign platform, the beer's free.

Hurricane Georges reaches Cuba; Florida Keys evacuation underway

	   HAVANA, Cuba (AP) _ Hurricane Georges moved into Cuba and
threatened the Florida Keys, leaving mounting casualties in its
wake. At least 60 people _ and possibly many more _ have been died
in the storm's furious three-day march across the Caribbean.
	   In the Cuban capital, President Fidel Castro put his Cabinet on
alert and said the country's armed forces would help get medicine,
food and other help to hurricane victims after Georges passes.
	   By late Wednesday, authorities had already evacuated 200,000
people from their homes in the country's eastern provinces.
	   At 0000 GMT Thursday, Georges was centered 30 miles (50
kilometers) north-northwest of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and was moving
west-northwest near 14 mph (23 kpm) with maximum sustained winds at
a low hurricane-level 75 mph (121 kph), down from 110 mph (177 kph)
when the storm swept over Puerto Rico.
	   Hurricane watches were in effect for the northwestern Bahamas
and parts of Florida. The Cayman Islands issued tropical storm
warnings for Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and heavy rains were
expected in Jamaica.
	   The mammoth storm was on a trajectory that could send it
crashing into the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday.
	   In Florida, up to 80,000 people were ordered to begin evacuating
the exposed Florida Keys, and cars, trucks and sport utility
vehicles streamed along the highway linking the island chain to the
Florida mainland.
	   South Florida was put under a hurricane watch and Gov. Lawton
Chiles declared a state of emergency in central and southern
Florida.
	   The hurricane first hit the small islands of the northeast
Caribbean early Monday, killing three in St. Kitts _ where the
government estimated damage at dlrs 445 million _ and two in
Antigua.
	   The U.S. Virgin Islands, which were badly battered in recent
hurricanes, suffered some damage to homes, tourist facilities and
utilities; on the island of St. Croix, a looter shot and killed a
man while burglarizing his home. There were no other fatalities,
	   The effects of the storm were expected to be felt as far south
as Jamaica, where officials expected heavy rains.
	   Three people were killed directly by the storm in Puerto Rico,
where the government's insurance commissioner, Juan Garcia,
estimated damages at dlrs 1 billion. Another eight, most of them
elderly, died of heart attacks or asthma complications during the
storm.
	   On Wednesday reconstruction efforts were under way in
communities like Loiza, where many homes of wood and zinc roofs
were crushed and washed away.
	   Seventeen were officially reported killed in the Dominican
Republic, which Georges hit Tuesday. However, the actual toll
appears to have been much higher.
	   Reporters said that in San Cristobal, 20 miles (30 kilometers)
east of Santo Domingo, the Nizao river overflowed and knocked down
a part of a school used as a shelter, leaving five dead and another
31 missing. There were also unconfirmed reports that in the capital
five more people were killed by an overflowing river.
	   Other media reports put the death toll at over 100. These
reports could not be confirmed, but officials planned a news
conference on the situation later Wednesday.
	   In the shanty neighborhood of La Cienega, the swollen river
invaded thousands of homes, covering some up to the roofs in fetid
water. Residents swam out to their houses to try to retrieve their
belongings, some using empty water jugs tied to their arms to help
them float.
	   Earlier, looters in Santo Domingo waded waist-deep in water,
balancing televisions and air conditioners on their heads as winds
toppled trees and crushed houses. Bands of youths with machetes and
pistols roamed the streets, many of them drunk. Two of the dead
were looters shot by police enforcing a curfew.
	   From the Dominican Republic Georges proceeded Tuesday night to
Haiti, occupying the western third of the island of Hispaniola.
	   In the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Georges
unleashed flash floods and killed at least 17.
	   Yolaine Surena of the civil defense authority said the
government could spare only dlrs 130,000 in emergency aid.
	   Most of the deaths reportedly occurred when floodwaters
collapsed two homes in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where there
were no public shelters. Four drowning victims were found in a
west-side suburb Wednesday afternoon. Deaths also were reported in
Gonaives and the northern town of Marmelade.
	   Warnings were declared in Cuba from Sancti Spiritus province
eastward and in the central and southern Bahamas.
	   ``No one will be forgotten in this new battle by the Cuban
people. We are a nation that has overcome adversity with unity,''
Mexico's official Notimex news agency quoted Castro as saying.

Council demands cease-fire in Kosovo, threatens other measures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council has threatened
additional action if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't
allow for the safe return of refugees and an end to hostilities in
the separatist southern province of Kosovo.
	   With China abstaining, the council approved a resolution
Wednesday that demands a cease-fire and a negotiatiated settlement
to the province's political status.
	   The resolution was intended to increase pressure on Milosevic to
loosen his grip on Kosovo, where the majority ethnic Albanians are
fighting Serbs for independence.
	   The British and French drafted resolution is militarily
enforceable. Nevertheless, it doesn't explicitly authorize NATO
intervention to try to stop the Serb offensive on ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   The United States has said NATO doesn't need council authority
to intervene, and NATO defense ministers were meeting Thursday to
discuss the situation.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said the resolution
``sends a clear, unequivocal message to the authorities in Belgrade
that the council is demanding that they change their behavior and
live up to their responsibilities.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook also welcomed the
resolution, saying it sends the message that ``the international
community's patience is exhausted.''
	   But in Belgrade, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic
said the measure was ``groundless and counterproductive'' and that
the Kosovo crisis could not be settled ``with the use of force.''
	   There were also serious questions about the logistics of any
military action, particularly over who would be targeted and how.
	   Western powers generally support returning autonomy to Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians, but steadfastly reject the campaign for
independence being waged by the Kosovo Liberation Army and the
Albanian nationals who are supplying them with arms.
	   ``One can think of airstrikes, but who will you strike,''
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini asked during a briefing here
Wednesday. ``How are you going to distinguish one from another? Who
do you want to punish?''
	   A meeting Wednesday of the foreign ministers of the so-called
Contact Group of nations _ the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy _ didn't discuss NATO airstrikes, said
the meeting's chairman, Hubert Vedrine of France.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed, and over a quarter million
have fled the fighting since a Serb crackdown on the separatists
began in February.
	   The situation has taken on urgency as winter approaches. An
estimated 50,000 people are roaming the hills of Kosovo with little
food and shelter.
	   The resolution urges the Serbs and ethnic Albanian leadership to
start negotiating a solution to the crisis and demands Milosevic
allow international monitoring in Kosovo and the safe return of
refugees.
	   The resolution says only that ``the council would consider
further action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace
and stability in the region,'' if a political settlement isn't
reached. It gives no time frame.
	   Russia, which has religious and cultural ties to the Serbs and
has opposed force in the past, said it went along with the
resolution because it didn't specifically authorize military
intervention. Another resolution was necessary to do that, Russian
ambassador Sergey Lavrov said.
	   The resolution _ the toughest action the council has taken to
date _ comes a day before NATO defense ministers were to meet in
Portugal to discuss the situation.
	   In Portugal, a NATO official speaking on condition of anonymity
said the resolution opened the way for a ``significant upping of
the ante.''
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, in New York for the
General Assembly, cautioned that ``what NATO is deciding tomorrow
is a last step in planning, not the first step in deciding''
whether to intervene.
	   The United States, however, has asked the NATO governing body to
begin rounding up commitments from NATO countries to contribute to
a possible multinational force, two senior U.S. officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

NATO slowly edges toward military action against Milosevic

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) - After months of waffling and empty
threats, NATO is edging toward using military force to get Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to stop his offensive against Kosovo
separatists.
	   On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council demanded a cease-fire in
the Yugoslav province and threatened further action if fighting
continues. The council urged both sides to start negotiating a
solution.
	   The council's resolution also demanded that Milosevic allow
international monitoring in Kosovo and the safe return of refugees.
	   The resolution gave NATO no specific orders, but reflected the
exasperation of the international community that has seen its pleas
for a peaceful solution to the crisis ignored by Milosevic.
	   On Thursday, the ambassadors of the NATO nations will meet in
special session in this southern Portuguese resort town, just ahead
of a previously scheduled gathering of NATO defense ministers.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, speaking in New York on
Wednesday, sought to tone down expectations of swift NATO action.
He called the defense ministers gathering ``a last step in
planning, not the first step in deciding'' whether to intervene.
	   The NATO ambassadors, on the strength of the U.N. resolution,
will commit their governments to making pledges of weapons and
other hardware but not to any deployment decisions yet.
	   To date, only Germany and The Netherlands have publicly said
they will contribute squadrons of jet fighters.
	   A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, welcomed
the U.N. resolution as ``a further tightening the screw. If
Milosevic disregards the demands of this resolution ... then that
is something that will be a direct challenge to the security
council.''
	   The U.N. resolution _ passed by a 14-0 vote with China
abstaining _ required the council to revisit the issue of a
military campaign before any U.N. authorization of force is
granted.
	   The resolution is aimed at increasing pressure on Milosevic to
ease up on Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians fight for independence in
a war in which hundreds of people have been killed and that has
made more than 250,000 flee their homes since February. Some 50,000
refugees are roaming the hills of Kosovo with little food and
shelter on the eve of winter.
	   Attacks by Serb forces in Kosovo have continued despite NATO
threats of retaliation. The allies have staged air and ground
exercises in Albania and Macedonia but these have not frightened
the Yugoslav leader.
	   Hampering the allies have been disagreements over whether or not
they need a formal mandate from the United Nations before stepping
in.
	   The latest U.N. resolution cited Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter,
which allows for the use of force if regional peace and security is
threatened. It did not explicitly authorize member states to
intervene in Kosovo and said ``the council would consider further
action and additional measures to maintain or restore peace and
stability in the region,'' if no political deal is reached.
	   France has been pushing hard for U.N. endorsement of any
military action. The United States believes no such mandate is
required. In Germany, Kinkel and Defense Minister Volker Ruehe _ in
the heat of a general election campaign _ have disagreed publicly
on the issue. Foreign
	   The alliance's agonizing over Kosovo is not unlike that over
Bosnia seven years ago. and even though the allies forced a peace
deal there, the news from that country has not been good.
	   In Bosnia, a Serbian hard-liner has defeated the moderate
Biljana Plavsic for the Bosnian Serb presidency.
	   NATO military planners have set out a wide range of options for
action in Kosovo, starting with air strikes at specific targets and
ending with the deployment of ground forces to enforce a peace
agreement, if any.

Congo demands pullout of foreign troops and condemns U.N. inaction

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Congo demanded the withdrawal of
foreign troops from its soil Wednesday and accused the U.N.
Security Council of failing to act quickly to end rebel attacks in
the embattled central African nation.
	   ``In similar cases _ in Kosovo, in Bosnia and in Kuwait _ the
Security Council dealt with the situation in a prompt and real way
to restore peace there. Why was there silence from the
international community, particularly from the Security Council?,''
Congo's Foreign Minister Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe asked the
U.N. General Assembly.
	   He accused the Security Council of pursuing a policy of ``double
standards'' and called on the United Nations to prevail on Congo's
neighbors to sign a non-aggression pact.
	   The Congo accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of invading the
country, massacring thousands of innocent Congolese and destroying
billions of dollars in infrastructure.
	   Uganda and Rwanda deny helping the rebels but Uganda admits it
has troops in northeastern Congo to defend its security interests,
and Rwanda has reserved the right to intervene to protect itself
from Rwandan Hutu rebel attacks.
	   Both countries angrily repeated their denials in responses
Wednesday night to Lolakombe's speech.
	   Rwanda accused the Congo of claiming it was invaded to cover up
its own mismanagement and corruption. ``It cannot wish away an
internal rebellion.'' an unidentified Rwanda official told the
General Assembly.
	   Uganda insisted it has no territorial ambitions but said its
troops army will remain in Congo until the Kinshasa government ends
cross-border raids and atrocities.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ South Africa's intervention mission
entered its third day on Thursday with shoot-to-kill orders to
suppress mutineers in Lesotho, where looters and arsonists rampaged
through the capital.
	   Smoke plumes towered over the city late Wednesday from arson
fires that have been burning since 600 South African soldiers
crossed the border Tuesday. Some 200 soldiers from Botswana joined
the intervention force Wednesday, but mostly only looked on as a
procession of looters carried booty home and continued to torch
buildings.
	   Outside Maseru, the boom of artillery and the rattle of gunfire
echoed through the hills Wednesday as intervention forces tried to
snuff out resistance at a military barracks and other key areas.
	   South African troops distributed fliers telling the 2 million
people of Lesotho (pronounced le-SOO-too) the intervention was
aimed at preventing ``anarchy'' and at creating ``a stable
environment for law and order.''
	   But facing stiff resistance that killed at least eight South
African soldiers, the intervention force announced Wednesday the
peacekeepers would use heavier weapons and would shoot to kill.
	   Seventeen more South Africans were wounded in the combat _ South
Africa's first military intervention since the end of apartheid.
President Nelson Mandela said 58 Lesotho rebels had been killed.
	   The military also said 170 mutinous Lesotho soldiers had been
captured.
	   South African military officials in Pretoria warned in a
statement Wednesday that their men would now use more firepower to
suppress the Lesotho mutineers.
	   ``Where the peace forces started out by being circumspect in
clashes, they will now shoot to kill,'' a military spokesman told
the South African Press Association.
	   ``All we know is they are shooting at us, and we are fighting
back,'' South African army spokesman Maj. Ben van Zyl said, adding
that he didn't know if the resistance came only from the mutineers
or if they had been joined by loyalist Lesotho soldiers.
	   Lesotho's government requested the intervention two weeks ago
amid a revolt by junior Lesotho military officers and strikes that
paralyzed Maseru. The mutineers had apparently sided with
opposition parties that claimed elections last May _ swept by the
ruling Lesotho Congress Party _ were rigged.
	   South African officials have stressed the intervention came
under the authority of the Southern African Development Community.
	   ``South Africa and the other SADC countries have no alternative
but to try restore order,'' Mandela said, adding negotiations with
the mutineers had failed.
	   An opposition leader, Molap Qhobela of the Basotholand Congress
Party, predicted the intervention would solve nothing.
	   ``The (South Africans) are an invading army of aggression,''
Qholeba told reporters. ``As soon as they go we are back to square
one.''
	   The South African army said eight soldiers had been killed by
Wednesday. But a senior commander and other South African soldiers
said 10 had been killed in one battle alone Tuesday at the
Makonyane barracks, northeast of Maseru.
	   Some 900 people, mostly Asians, have reportedly crossed the
border and sought asylum in neighboring South Africa. Chinese and
Indian merchants were particular targets of the looters.

Japanese passenger plane lands safely after emergency return
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese passenger plane landed safely at Tokyo's
main domestic airport Thursday following an emergency return after
its landing gear failed to function properly.
	   None of the 35 passengers and five crew members aboard Air
Nippon flight 847 bound for Miyakejima were injured in the landing,
said airline spokesman Kazutaka Orio.
	   The pilot realized the plane, a YS11, was having trouble when an
indicator signaled that the front landing gear had failed to
adequately deploy, Orio said.
	   The pilot decided not to attempt a landing on Miyakejima, an
island about 180 kilometers (114 miles) south of Tokyo, and instead
returned to Haneda International Airport which is better outfitted
to deal with emergency landings.
	   The plane flew back and landed safely with the landing gear
fully down at Haneda at 10:28 a.m. (0128 GMT), Orio said.
	   The cause of the trouble was under investigation. ANK decided to
fly the three remaining scheduled flights Thursday with a
substitute plane, Orio said.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A British Royal Navy co-pilot was missing
Thursday after his helicopter crashed into the South China Sea
during a training exercise with Singaporean forces, Singapore's
Ministry of Defense said.
	   Two Royal Navy personnel were aboard the Lynx helicopter when it
crashed late Wednesday, according to a statement from the ministry.
	   The pilot, who suffered minor bruises, was retrieved at 11:15
p.m. A search and rescue operation to locate the co-pilot continued
Thursday.
	   In the statement, the ministry said the helicopter was taking
part in a ``night encounter exercise'' involving three Singapore
missile corvettes and Britain's HMS Grafton.
	   The British vessel informed all units operating in the exercise
that communications with the helicopter were lost at 10:00 p.m.
Singapore's RSS Valour picked up a distress signal about 10 minutes
later.
	   The names of the British pilot and co-pilot were not released.

Mars Global Surveyor to tighten orbit around Mars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ The Mars Global Surveyor fired its
main rocket engine to descend toward the fringes of the Martian
atmosphere in an effort to tighten its orbit around the red planet.
	   The 14.8-second engine burn Wednesday morning was successful in
using aerobraking to slow the spacecraft's speed. Engineers are
trying to narrow the spacecraft's large elliptical orbit into a
tight circle.
	   The dlrs 250 million mission, launched in 1996, began orbiting
the planet in September 1997. It was designed to map Martian
terrain for a Martian year, equivalent to 687 Earth days.
	   It was supposed to begin mapping the surface of the planet last
March, but a problem with a solar panel in October 1997 forced a
suspension of aerobraking and a delay in the overall mission plan.
	   The rocket firing was designed to drop its altitude at the point
of closest approach from 106.5 miles (171.4 kilometers) to 79 miles
(127 kilometers). At the farthest point of its elliptical orbit,
the spacecraft is 11,083 miles (17,836 kilometers) from the planet.
	   Dips into the atmosphere should now occur every 11.6 hours, JPL
said. After five more months of aerobraking each orbit should take
less than two hours.
	   Mars is currently 213 million miles (343 million kilometers)
from Earth.

Sosa hits Nos. 64, 65 to tie MGwire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with Expos-Mets result &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Sammy Sosa couldn't really celebrate hitting
home runs Nos. 64 and 65 to tie Mark McGwire for the record. He was
too busy worrying about others.
	   Sosa's thoughts and prayers were with his countrymen Wednesday
in the hurricane-ravaged Dominican Republic and with teammate Brant
Brown, whose error might end up costing the Cubs the National
League wild-card berth.
	   Brown dropped a fly ball that would have been the game's final
out, allowing three runs to score in Milwaukee's stunning 8-7
victory over Chicago. The Brewers had trailed 7-0.
	   Fortunately for the Cubs, the Mets lost 3-0 to the Expos, and
Chicago and New York remained tied atop the wild-card standings.
	   Sosa's homers once again put him back into the home run race
when it looked like he was all but out of it. Just a day before,
even he had conceded that McGwire would probably hold the record at
the end of the season.
	   While Sosa broke out of an 0-for-21 slump with the solo homers,
his thoughts were elsewhere after the game.
	   ``What happened to Brownie today can happen to anybody who plays
this game and I think that he has a lot of support from our team,''
Sosa said. ``We haven't given up yet. We have three games to go. We
need to just forget about it today and keep going.''
	   Sosa's slump-buster came on the same day his homeland began
recovery from Hurricane Georges, which set off looting and street
violence. Seventeen people died and much of the country lost power.
	   Most of Sosa's immediate family members were in Chicago, where
they had gathered for the ``Sammy Sosa Celebration'' last weekend,
but the slugger was concerned about many relatives and friends back
home.
	   ``Right now, the news that I've been hearing is it's a disaster
down there,'' Sosa said. ``It is bad.''
	   Even though Sosa jumped back into the homer race, he stuck by
his prediction that the St. Louis Cardinals slugger will emerge as
the Home Run King because he can swing for the fences with abandon
with his team out of the playoff race.
	   ``I still have that feeling for Mark. I think that he's going to
finish right in front of me,'' Sosa said. ``For me, it don't make
no difference. I think I have another thing to think about.''
	   The playoffs.
	   But you can bet he'll be keeping an eye, too, on McGwire. The
Cardinals faced Houston on Wednesday night in St. Louis, where
McGwire has hit a Busch Stadium record 33 home runs this season.
	   The Cubs slugger, picking on his favorite pitching staff,
homered against Milwaukee in the fifth and sixth innings, giving
him 12 against the Brewers this season.
	   No. 65 gave Sosa 11 multihomer games this season, tying the
major league record set by Detroit's Hank Greenberg in 1938.
	   Sosa got his first homer of the day with one out in the fifth
off rookie left-hander Rafael Roque, who also gave up McGwire's
64th homer. After walking his first two times up against Roque,
Sosa hit a 1-0 fastball to the opposite field. Then with two outs
in the sixth, he hit a 2-2 fastball to straightaway center off
rookie right-hander Rod Henderson.

<TEXT>
	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ Two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick
Rafter will open Australia's Davis Cup World Group qualifying
tennis match against Uzbekistan on Friday against Oleg Ogorodov.
	   Ogorodov beat Rafter at the Beijing Open in 1996 and the
powerful baseliner, although ranked in the 200s, will provide a
challenge for Rafter in his first match since winning at New York.
	   Following Thursday's draw, Stoltenberg will take on Uzbekistan's
top-ranked player Vadim Koutsenko in the second singles.
	   In the doubles on Saturday, Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde
will play Ogorodov and Dmitri Tomashevich, with the reverse singles
on Sunday. (djp)

Key conservative won't back prime minister's criticism of
</HEADLINE>
Malaysia's Mahathir &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett
on Thursday refused to endorse Prime Minister John Howard's
criticism of the arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Premier Anwar
Ibrahim, which led to an official complaint from the Malaysian
government.
	   Kennett, the most outspoken conservative in the nation after
Howard, said he would not comment on Howard's statement that
Malaysia was moving to a more ``authoritarian approach'' following
Anwar's arrest, but indicated he held a different view.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday that
Howard was ``wrong, absolutely'' and should ``check the real
facts'''' before making accusations.
	   ``I'm not going to enter into that,'' Kennett told reporters.
	   ``I have my own views, and we've all got to recognize we live in
different sovereign states and different sovereign countries and no
two countries are entirely the same.''
	   His comments come just one week after he slammed The Age
newspaper for ``intolerance and lack of understanding'' after it
criticized Mahathir in an editorial, saying Australians should not
judge Malaysia too harshly.
	   ``Malaysia is trying to adjust and I don't think we should be
too harsh on them for the measures they have taken,'' Kennett said
after returning from a trip to Malaysia and Indonesia, where he met
both Mahathir and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie.
	   It was ``dangerous'' to judge other countries by Australian
standards and Australia should not dictate to its neighbors if it
valued its trade and diplomatic relationships, he said.
	   The Malaysian government on Wednesday handed a letter of protest
to Australian High Commissioner Robert Cotton over the comments by
Howard, and others from Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer and
former foreign minister Gareth Evans.

Japanese stocks rise sharply, dollar higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei morning close, midday dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rose sharply Thursday morning
on hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates to
help ease the global economic crisis. The U.S. dollar moved higher
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 379.31
points, or 2.75 percent, to 14,169.12 points at the end of the
morning session. On Tuesday, the index gained 192.51 points, or
1.42 percent.
	   The dollar bought 136.48 yen in midday trading, up 1.34 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
135.75 yen overnight.
	   Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Wednesday for a national
holiday.
	   Traders said stock prices started higher Thursday as investors
were cheered by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's signal
that U.S. interest rates may be lowered.
	   Greenspan testified Wednesday before the Senate Budget Committee
that Fed policymakers are fully aware of the widening financial
crisis that has spread from Asia to the rest of the world.
	   That was the clearest indication yet that he will fight the
crisis with lower U.S. interest rates. The Fed's policymaking
committee meets next Tuesday.
	   Following the Fed chairman's comments, the Dow Jones industrial
average surged to 8,154 at Wednesday's close, its highest finish in
a month. More than half of the 257-point gain came during the final
hour of trading.
	   Among morning gainers in Tokyo were high technology issues,
including Sony and NEC.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar held its strength
against the yen amid lingering uncertainties over a stalemate
between Japan's ruling and opposition parties over bills to rescue
troubled financial institutions, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all shares listed on the
first section was up 27.62 points, or 2.63 percent, to 1,077.79.
The TOPIX rose 2.38 points, or 0.23 percent, Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.900 percent, unchanged from Tuesday's
finish. Its price remained unchanged at 108.04 yen.

Australia takes no chances with Western Samoa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australia will field its strongest
side available against Western Samoa in the rugby union World Cup
qualifying match at Ballymore on Saturday night.
	   The Australians have qualified for next year's World Cup with
runaway victories over Fiji (66-20) and Tonga (74-0) in the two
Pacific region qualifiers.
	   But they want to beat Western Samoa to guarantee a finish at the
top of the four-nation Pacific pool, which puts them into their
preferred World Cup pool based in Ireland.
	   While the reserves did the job against Tonga in Canberra on
Tuesday night, the Wallabies decided to name a first-string side
Thursday against Samoa.
	   Tonga lies at the bottom of the qualifying ladder, losing to
Western Samoa 28-20 before the Australian match.
	   Tonga plays Fiji at Ballymore on Saturday in the first leg of a
doubleheader followed by Australia and Western Samoa.
	   The Australian team: Joe Roff, Jason Little, Daniel Herbert, Tim
Horan, Damien Smith, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan (vc), Willie
Ofahengaue, David Wilson, Matthew Cockbain, John Eales (captain),
Tom Bowman, Andrew Blades, Phil Kearns, Dan Crowley. Reserves:
Chris Whitaker, Nathan Grey, Mitch Hardy, Owen Finegan, Toutai
Kefu, Glenn Panaho, Jeremy Paul. (djp)

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ World leaders have urged Israel and the
Palestinians to continue a course of peace but are making
contingency plans if U.S. efforts to reach a settlement fail.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine told the General
Assembly's annual debate Wednesday that France supports the efforts
of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to move the peace
process forward.
	   ``But we do not wish to be left without any prospect should
those efforts unfortunately not succeed,'' he said.
	   That is why French President Jacques Chirac and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak have proposed that if the U.S. efforts
fail, ``a conference of the countries resolved to save peace''
should be convened, he said.
	   ``This concern for the future has been very well received,''
Vedrine said. ``We must not abandon the goal of responding to the
aspirations of the peoples of the region for a just and lasting
peace which respects the resolutions and agreements that have been
reached.''
	   On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses
the General Assembly. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat plans to
tell the body next week of his determination to declare a
Palestinian state by May, with or without Israel's approval.
	   Albright's spokesman James P. Rubin said that declaration
``would be a unilateral action we would oppose.''
	   Netanyahu told a news conference that interim Oslo agreements
between Israel and the Palestinians specifically rule out such
unilateral declarations, reserving statehood as an issue to be
settled between the two sides.
	   Netanyahu met Wednesday with Albright on plans for an Israeli
troop withdrawal from the West Bank, but they reached no
breakthrough.
	   In a speech Tuesday to the General Assembly, Russia's foreign
minister Igor S. Ivanov repeated Moscow's belief that a Palestinian
state ``is only in this way that the inalienable right of
Palestinians to self-determination and reliable assurance of
Israel's legitimate security interests can be realized.''
	   China's Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan on Wednesday urged all
parties in the Arab-Israeli dispute to take ``a flexible and
pragmatic position to promote constant progress of the peace
negotiations under the principle of `land for peace.'''
	   In another eagerly anticipated speech during Thursday's session,
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee was to address the
General Assembly, following a breakthrough speech by Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
	   Sharif said Wednesday that Pakistan would unilaterally adhere to
the nuclear test ban treaty, but warned that compliance would
depend on whether rival India resumed its tests and on the world
lifting sanctions imposed after the tests.
	   ``In this regard, we expect that the arbitrary restrictions
imposed on Pakistan by multilateral institutions will be speedily
removed,'' Sharif told the session.
	   ``We also expect that discriminatory sanctions against Pakistan
will be lifted,'' he said.

Japan's major airline to withdraw from U.S. hotel business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ As part of a cost-cutting program, All Nippon
Airways Co. will sell the two hotels it owns in the United States,
a company official said Thursday.
	   All Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest airline, will sell
the hotels it bought in the late 1980s to Lowe Enterprises Inc., a
San Francisco-based real estate firm, for a combined 36.4 billion
yen (dlrs 270 million), said the spokesman, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   One hotel is in Washington, D.C. with 415 rooms, and the other
with 667 rooms is in San Francisco.
	   In June, ANA announced cost-trimming measures as part of a
three-year plan to boost profits. They included cuts in hiring,
senior executives' salaries and the planned purchase of aircraft.
	   The company said earlier this year it expects to post a loss of
6 billion yen (dlrs 44.7 million) for the fiscal year ending March
1999.
	   ANA has already concluded a deal with Lowe Enterprises, with the
sale happening as early as next Tuesday, the official said.
	   ANA bought the two hotels in 1988 and 1989, about the same time
it started its first regular flights between Japan and the U.S.
mainland.

	   Fernandez, in a televised address to the nation, said 70 people
were confirmed dead and hundreds of people were missing, including
45 who disappeared when a school being used as a shelter washed
away Wednesday.
	   He asked for unity in reconstruction efforts and urged people
``to pray and ask the Almighty to help the destiny of our people.''
	   Georges pounded the Dominican Republic on Tuesday after
barreling through Puerto Rico. It struck Haiti on Wednesday, where
17 were reported killed, before moving on to Cuba and threatening

Booby trap explodes near convoy of Cambodian leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ A booby trap exploded near the convoy
of Cambodian leader Hun Sen Thursday, killing a young boy and
injuring three people, police said.
	   Hun Sen was not hurt by the blast, which police said was an
attempt on his life.
	   Hun Sen was en route to the king's residence in this
northwestern town for ceremonies to swear in a new parliament, when
a B-40 rocket exploded on the side of the road just as his car had
passed by, said deputy police commander Col. Than Chay.
	   Police said three more unexploded rockets were found by the
road, parts of what appeared to be a remote-control booby trap.
Explosive experts from the Cambodian Mine Action Center were
examining the device and searching the area.
	   Than Chay said the car carrying Hun Sen was less than 10 meters
(33 feet) away when the explosion occurred.

Chinese dissident detained; activists propose anti-corruption
</HEADLINE>
groups

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A veteran democracy activist has been detained in
southeastern China amid a nationwide clampdown on dissent, a human
rights group reported Thursday.
	   Meanwhile, dissidents in seven provinces have proposed setting
up civilian anti-corruption watchdog groups.
	   Police in the Fujian provincial capital of Fuzhou told Lin
Xinshu's family he was detained Wednesday for seven days for
violating rules requiring him to report to a local police station
three times a day, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Lin has been interrogated by police 12 times since sending an
open letter to President Jiang Zemin titled ``Without democracy, a
hopeless China,'' the Hong Kong-based group said.
	   Lin, who is in ill health, refused to report to police three
times a day, it said.
	   Elsewhere in China, the group said, dissidents in Henan,
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan and Hunan provinces had
jointly submitted an application to the Civil Affairs Ministry to
set up nongovernmental anti-corruption groups.
	   ``Corruption is a millstone on the economy, a time bomb
threatening to wreck social stability,'' the activists said in a
statement faxed to foreign news organizations.
	   The statement did not explain how the groups planned to help the
government with its effort to curb rampant corruption that has
angered many Chinese.
	   It said the group would wait for the ministry to approve their
joint application before making individual applications to local
authorities. China requires all unofficial groups to register with
the authorities, and in most cases applications are turned down.

	   Fernandez said more than half the power grid in the Dominican
Republic was destroyed by Georges' 110-mph (176-kph) winds at a
cost of dlrs 111 million. Seventy percent of the country's bridges
were damaged or destroyed, and 90 percent of its banana and other
plantations were destroyed, he said.
	   ``We have a titanic task ahead of us'' in recovering from the
catastrophe, Fernandez said.
	   Casualties from the hurricane mounted in badly battered Puerto
Rico and in Haiti, where many regions had yet to be heard from. In
all, more than 110 deaths have been blamed on the hurricane,
including four in Puerto Rico.

	   Georges made landfall in Cuba late Wednesday and was moving
west-northwest near 14 mph (23 kph).
	   Hurricane watches were in effect for the northwestern Bahamas
and parts of Florida. The Cayman Islands issued tropical storm
warnings for Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and heavy rains were
expected in Jamaica.
	   In Florida, up to 100,000 people were ordered Wednesday to begin
evacuating the exposed Florida Keys, and cars, trucks and sport
utility vehicles streamed along the highway linking the island
chain to the Florida mainland.
	   South Florida was put under a hurricane watch and Gov. Lawton
Chiles declared a state of emergency in central and southern
Florida, allowing the state to use the National Guard, lift tolls
along evacuation routes and purchase emergency supplies.
	   The hurricane first hit the small islands of the northeast
Caribbean early Monday, killing three in St. Kitts _ where the
government estimated damage at dlrs 445 million _ and two in
Antigua.
	   In Puerto Rico, the government's insurance commissioner, Juan
Garcia, estimated damages at dlrs 1 billion. Another eight people,
most of them elderly, died of heart attacks or asthma complications
during the storm.
	   The U.S. Virgin Islands, which were badly battered in recent
hurricanes, suffered some damage to homes, tourist facilities and
utilities. On the island of St. Croix, a looter shot and killed a
man while burglarizing his home.

Second Australian man arrested in international child porn ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Another Australian man has been
arrested on suspicion of being part of a worldwide child
pornography ring, police said Thursday.
	   The 35-year-old man, who was arrested in Sydney on Wednesday,
was charged with possession of child pornography and is due to
appear in Newtown Local Court on Oct. 15, they said.
	   The man is the second Australian to be arrested as part of a
worldwide investigation headed by British police and coordinated by
Interpol.
	   Police in 21 countries swooped simultaneously on Sept. 3,
arresting 50 people suspected of being members of the Wonderland
Club who had been exchanging pictures of child pornography on the
Internet.
	   A 43-year-old Perth man was arrested and charged with possession
of child pornography during that raid.

SANTO DOMINGO: his home.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   In the Dominican town of San Cristobal, 20 miles (30 kilometers)
east of Santo Domingo, the Nizao river overflowed and destroyed a
school used as a shelter, leaving dozens missing.
	   In La Cienega, the swollen river invaded thousands of homes,
covering some up to the roofs in fetid water. In Santo Domingo, two
of the dead were looters shot by police enforcing a curfew.
	   In Haiti, the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Georges
unleashed flash floods and killed at least 27. Another nine were
missing.
	   Most of the deaths reportedly occurred when floodwaters
collapsed two homes in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where there
were no public shelters. Four drowning victims were found in a
west-side suburb Wednesday afternoon. Deaths also were reported in
Gonaives and the northern town of Marmelade.
	   Yolaine Surena of the civil defense authority said the
government could spare only dlrs 130,000 in emergency aid.
	   By the time it reached Cuba, Georges had been significantly
slowed. Its maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), down from
110 mph (176 kph) over Puerto Rico, barely qualified it as a
hurricane.
	   Warnings were declared in Cuba from Sancti Spiritus province
eastward and in the central and southern Bahamas. Cuban President
Fidel Castro put his ministers on alert.
	   ``No one will be forgotten in this new battle by the Cuban
people. We are a nation that has overcome adversity with unity,''
Mexico's official Notimex news agency quoted Castro as saying.
	   The mammoth storm was on a trajectory that could send it
crashing into the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday.
