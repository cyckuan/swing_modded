<HEADLINE> No Conditions on Make-up of Peace Force in East Timor, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Monday that Indonesia could place no conditions
on the make-up of the international peace force expected to be
sent to East Timor soon.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency of Ansa, Dini, who was
speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of European Union foreign
ministers in Brussels, said the EU was preparing to place a
"temporary" embargo on the supply of arms to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said that "Indonesia cannot put any conditions on the
composition of the force," echoing a similar statement issued at
around the same time by United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
The remarks by Dini and Annan appeared to be a response to
calls in the Indonesian parliament for Jakarta to oppose the
inclusion of Australia, New Zealand, the United States and
Portugal in the force.
</P>
<P>
Dini added that "Indonesia is fully responsible for the
atrocities" committed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian parliament's defense committee said these
countries were not neutral and it would be better if the force
were made up of troops from Indonesia's Pacific neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The East Timor has been under violence since the August 30
referendum on independence, in which 78 percent of East Timorese
voted to break with Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The vote sparked a wave of violence by pro-Indonesian militia's
who went on the rampage, killing and attacking anyone they saw as
having voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
Of the EU nations, Italy, along with Britain and France, has
said it is ready to send soldiers to East Timor as part of a UN
force.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Unionists Lash out at Police Reform Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's leading
Protestant party on Monday rejected the proposals to reform the
British province's police force and said it would draw up
alternative ideas.
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour meeting, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP)
described the report by an independent commission headed by Chris
Patten as "deeply flawed and objectionable", the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read by party leader David Trimble, the
executive said "it must not be accepted as the way forward for
policing in Northern Ireland".
</P>
<P>
Trimble said a six-person working party was being set up by the
UUP to produce "alternative proposals" to the Patten report.
</P>
<P>
Trimble also brushed off reports that his leadership position
was in trouble, saying it was rock-solid.
</P>
<P>
Earlier a leading UUP parliamentarian had called for him to
resign but Trimble told reporters there had been no challenges to
his position during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Patten report recommended a sweeping overhaul of the mainly
Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in a bid to attract
recruitment from the nationalist Catholic community.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said his party "considers that the recommendations to
remove symbols associated with the United Kingdom are designed to
undermine the identification of the RUC as the Northern Ireland
element of British policing".
</P>
<P>
The council also said "the recommendations create a channel for
the involvement of terrorist organisations in policing".

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Protect Civilians in Armed Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Monday that the responsibility for the
protection of civilians in armed conflict cannot be transferred to
others and the United Nations is the only international
organization with the reach and authority to fulfil this task.
</P>
<P>
In his report on the Protection of Civilians in armed Conflict,
Annan said "Despite the adoption over the past 50 years of the
main conventions of International Humanitarian and Human Rights
Law, hardly a day goes by where we are not presented with evidence
of the intimidation, brutalization, torture and killing of
helpless civilians in situation of armed conflict."
</P>
<P>
Annan made nine recommendations as being of particular
importance to the Security Council for its consideration regarding
the protection of civilians in armed conflict. They are
</P>
<P>
-- Take steps to strengthen the Organization's capacity to plan
and deploy rapidly.
</P>
<P>
-- Establish a permanent technical review mechanism of United
Nations and regional sanctions to ascertain the probable impact of
sanctions on civilians.
</P>
<P>
-- Impose arms embargoes in situations where civilians and
protected persons are targeted by the parties to the conflict and
urge member States to enforce these embargoes in their own
national jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
-- Consider deployment in certain cases of a preventive
peacekeeping operation, or of another preventive monitoring
presence.
</P>
<P>
-- Make greater use of targeted sanctions to deter and contain
those who commit egregious violations of international
humanitarian and human rights law, as well as those parties to
conflicts which continually defy the resolutions of the Council.
</P>
<P>
-- Deploy international military observers to monitor the
situation in camps for internally displaced persons and refugees,
and if such elements are found, deploy regional or international
military forces that are prepared to take effective measures to
compel disarmament.
</P>
<P>
-- Underscore in its resolutions the imperative for civilian
populations to have unimpeded access to humanitarian assistance,
and insist that failure to comply will result in the imposition of
targeted sanctions.
</P>
<P>
-- Ensure that whenever required, peacekeeping and peace
enforcement operations are authorised and equipped to control or
close down hate media assets.
</P>
<P>
-- In the face of massive and ongoing abuses, consider the
imposition of appropriate enforcement action.

<HEADLINE> Alatas to Continue Talks with U.N. on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Talks on the
deployment of a U.N.-sponsored force for East Timor between
Indonesia and the United Nations will continue Tuesday as they
have to further discuss a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas made the statement as he
emerged from an one-hour meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and the president of the Security Council here Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The questions on the table include the composition and the
nature of the force, the role of the Indonesian military in the
next stage and others, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia would like to see this security cooperation, the
sending of a U.N. force realized as soon as possible...with no
conditionalities attached," the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said he came "open-minded" as to which countries will
participate in the mission.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the countries themselves to consider whether their
presence would or would not exacerbate the situation (in East
Timor) rather than improve the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas put the deployment of such a force as a new question as
the May 5 agreement between Indonesia, Portugal and the United
Nations provides that the U.N. mandated peace-keeping force goes
to East Timor only after the ballot result begins to be
implemented after November.
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't think all detailed technical questions can
be solved in one short talking, while expressing his willingness
to stay here "as long as it takes" for them to be solved.
</P>
<P>
Alatas arrived in New York Monday in the wake of President B.J.
Habibie's announcement Sunday that Indonesia accepted a
U.N-sponsored international force to restore security and order in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Violence has taken place in the former Portuguese colony
integrated by Indonesia in 1976 following the August 30
U.N.-organized ballot on its future, which showed voters' support
for independence instead of special autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was meeting Monday afternoon on the
dispatch of the force.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Hard Hit by Widespread Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Widespread floods caused by a
 week of torrential rains have rendered 9,195 people homeless in
upper east and northern regions of Ghana, the Ghana News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
An accompanying cholera outbreak has killed at least 48 people
in these regions, Upper East Coordinator of the National Disaster
Management Organization, Thomas Abilla, told President Jerry
Rawlings during a tour of the affected areas over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Abilla said that as a result of the floods, three dams have
burst banks, three roads have been completely destroyed and one
bridge has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The collapsed bridge has stranded several trucks transporting
imported goods from Ghana's ports to landlocked Burkina Faso and
Mali, witnesses were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Abilla said 530 acres of farm crops have also been destroyed,
while 687 houses (mostly thatched) have totally collapsed from the
floods which have affected 179 communities.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the spillways of the Bagre Dam in Burkina Faso
over the past week has further aggravated the situation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The disaster management official said that the loss caused by
the floods could run into millions of cedis (one U.S. dollar
equals some 2,540 cedis).
</P>
<P>
He added that the victims are currently being housed in schools
and called for emergency assistance to relocate them to enable
school children to resume their classes.

NAIROBI, September 13 (Xinhua) --The stocks in Kenya dropped
marginally Monday as grim prospects for the fragile economy
prompted foreign investors to flee the embattled bourse, brokers

Brokers here said the index, which has slumped 16 percent this

Kenya's economic mess caused both local and foreign investors to
abandon the market.
</P>

The brokers also urged the Kenyan government to give a tangible
plan for economic recovery to restore investors' confidence and

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Urged to Stop HIV/AIDS Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank on Monday
called on African leaders, the private sector, and society at
large to push the HIV/AIDS crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa to the
center of their national agendas in order to stop the
fastest-growing threat to development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nowhere in the world has the impact of HIV/AIDS been more
severe than in Sub-Saharan Africa, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
Globally, nearly 34 million people in the world are currently
living with HIV/AIDS. The epidemic continues to grow, as 16,000
people worldwide become newly infected with HIV each day.
</P>
<P>
According to a new World Bank Strategic Plan, "Intensifying
Action Against HIV/AIDS in Africa: Responding to a Development
Crisis," AIDS is swiftly undoing the development achievements of
the past 30 years in Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the regional level, more than 11 million Africans have
already died, and another 22 million are now living with HIV/AIDS.
That is two-thirds of all the cases on earth.
</P>
<P>
At the national level, the 21 countries with the highest HIV
prevalence in the world are all in Africa. In Zimbabwe and
Botswana, one in four adults is infected. In at least ten other
African countries, prevalence rates exceed ten percent.
</P>
<P>
At the individual level, a child born Zambia or Zimbabwe today
is more likely than not to die of AIDS. In many other African
countries, the lifetime risk of dying of AIDS is greater than one
in three.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy, the best overall measure of development, is
now declining in a host of African countries, a reversal of the
rapid progress in the years following independence. But what sets
AIDS apart from other epidemics such as malaria and other
preventable childhood diseases is its unprecedented impact on
development, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Because it kills so many adults in the prime of their lives,
it decimates the workforce, fractures and impoverishes families,
orphans millions, and shreds the fabric of communities," said
World Bank Africa Region Vice President Callisto Madavo.
</P>
<P>
The strategic action plan emphasizes that until now ignorance,
inaction, and the lack of resources have exacerbated the spread of
the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The plan has four pillars: Advocacy to position HIV/AIDS as a
central development issue and to increase and sustain an
intensified response; Increased resources and technical support
for African partners to deal with HIV/AIDS activities in all
sectors; Prevention efforts targeted at both general and specific
audiences, and activities to enhance HIV/AIDS treatment and care;
Expanded knowledge to help countries design and manage prevention,
care, and treatment programs based on epidemic trends, impact
forecasts, and identified best practices.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet in Hospital for Brain Scan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet, who is currently under house arrest in London, was taken
to hospital on Monday for a brain scan.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old general was under close observation, his
spokesman told reporters. But no further details of Pinochet's
health condition was given.
</P>
<P>
"He has gone to hospital for a brain scan. He is having further
tests. He is suffering from various ailments and needs to be
closely observed," a Reuters report quoted the spokesman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The brain scan is the latest in a series of hospital visits
made by Pinochet. He went to hospital for health check earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that he now suffers from a range of medical
problems including depression and heart difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested last October in a London hospital, where
he was recovering from a minor back surgery. He has since been
held under house arrest in a rented mansion near London.
</P>
<P>
A Spainish judge wants him be extradited to Spain to face
charges of human rights abuses in Chile during his 1973-1990 rule.
The judge said Pinochet is responsible to the deaths and
disapperances of 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's supporters argueed recently that he is too old and
frail to face extradition proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The retired general's extradition hearing is scheduled to begin
in London on September 27, though Pinochet himself is not expected
to attend.

<HEADLINE> Albright Recommends to Ease Trade with DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is recommending that President Bill Clinton
ease restrictions on trade in response to a pledge of freezing
missile test by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), the State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Albright was notified on Sunday by chief U.S. negotiator
Charles Kartman that the DPRK had taken the pledge, State
Department spokesman said. As a result Albright "is prepared to
recommend to the president that we move ahead with easing
restrictions on the trade of non-sensitive goods and investment,
certain financial transactions and transportation restrictions,"
Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
But there will be no easing of a ban on the sale of U.S.
weapons and missile-related technology as well as on U.S. foreign
and economic aid, except humanitarian assistance, Rubin said.

BUENOS AIRES, September, 13 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Foreign
Minister Guido di Tella rejected Monday that the blowing up of a
device in front of the residence of Argentine ambassador in
Paraguay had any relation with Argentina's refusal to extradite ex
General Lino Oviedo.
</P>
<P>
The device was thrown this dawn from a car into the residence
of Argentine[aambassador in Asuncion, which wasn't able to get
past the gate and exploded in the lane without causing victims,
Argentine Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay is already investigating the event.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened at a time when Argentina and Paraguay
are facing a diplomatic conflict due to Argentine government's
denial to extradite ex Paraguayan General Lino Oviedo, in exile in
Buenos Aires last March 29.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan authorities accused Oviedo of being the intellectual
author of the murder of Vice President Luis maria Argana on March
23.

LOS ANGELES, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide shipments of
two-way cable modems are expected to top 2.2 million by the end of
1999, doubling last year's shipments, according to a new data
product released Monday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Reiterates Call for Full Israeli Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa on Monday reiterated his country's demand for full
Israeli pullout from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the closing session of the two-day
Arab foreign ministers' meeting here, al-Sharaa said full Israeli
withdrawal from Golan is Syria's ultimate goal through peace talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Our position has been in place for several years and our
demands are fair and irrevocable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Syria and Israel came to a halt in
early 1996 due to disputes over the return of Golan Heights
captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
</P>
<P>
After the election of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in May,
the two neighbors have expressed willingness to resume the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa described the relations between Damascus and Cairo as
very strong, saying "No ties between two other Arab countries are
stronger than those between Syria and Egypt."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister cited constant consultations
between the two countries on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that the Egyptian-Syrian relations soured
after Syrian President Hafez al-Assad snubbed Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak's call for an Arab summit aimed at forging a common
stance on the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting between Mubarak and Saudi
Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal on Monday, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said there is no plan for a meeting between
Egyptian and Syrian presidents in the near future.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- President of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Youcef
Yousfi arrived on Monday in the Saudi Red Sea port city of Jeddah
for coordination ahead of an OPEC meeting due in Vienna later this
month.
</P>
<P>
Yousfi, who is also Algeria's Energy and Mines Minister, is
expected to hold talks with his Saudi counterpart Ali al-N'aimi on
the implementation of the OPEC output reduction agreement signed
in March.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, OPEC members began to cut their daily
production by 1.7 million barrels on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer and exporter,
had reiterated its pledge to maintain the cutbacks in Venezuela
late last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yousfi assured during his visits to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, the first two legs of his present Gulf
tour, that OPEC members will adhere to the agreement until March
2000.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a consensus among OPEC members to maintain
production cuts until next March as high crude stockpiles were
not expected to disappear before then.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are brief
economic news from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- Member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
have been warned that their heavy commitments to developing
petroleum production capabilities may trespass upon government
expenditures on education, health, social activities and other
services.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Dubai in its quarterly report has estimated that
four oil-rich Gulf states, namely, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will need to spend about 125
billion U.S. dollars till 2010 to develop 129 billion barrels of
petroleum reserves to meet anticipated demand during the said
period.
</P>
<P>
The Bank predicted that the four Gulf states will seek other
alternatives to increase oil production, including loans or
granting ownership rights of petroleum to foreign companies, the
Arabic-language Al Hayat daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines Youcef
Yousfi, who is the current chairman of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said that oil prices at
present are satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Yousfi, who arrived in Abu Dhabi Sunday on a Gulf tour,
expressed his belief that OPEC members would decide in its coming
meeting on September 22 in Vienna to maintain their commitment to
the oil production cuts agreed upon in March until March 2000.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by OPEC members to boost oil prices by reducing
production have been well-paid with the standard price of Brent
crude oil fetching 23.5 U.S.dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- The 23rd regular session of the Council of Central
Bank Governors and Arab Petroleum Establishments began its works
in Muscat, Oman, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Participants would work out a coherent and flexible economic
and banking policy that covers the diverse aspects of life, the
Arabic-language Al Hayat daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The total value of Egyptian exports during the first
six months of 1999 has reached about 5.69 billion Egyptian pounds
(1.67 billion U.S. dollars), as compared to 5.387 billion pounds
(1.58 billion dollars) during the corresponding period of 1998, up
by 5.6 percent, Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed
Gowaili was quoted Monday by the Al Ahram daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total value of imports during the period stood
at about 27.946 million Egyptian pounds (8.2 million dollars), as
compared to about 26.985 million pounds (7.9 million dollars)
during the corresponding period of 1998, up by 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- An exhibition of leather and footwear will be
held in Sharjah, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), from September 18
to 21.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 exhibitors from 22 countries and regions will
take part in the exhibition, which will be patronized by the
International Leather Council, the Arab Union for Leather
Industries and Sharjah Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The participating countries include Egypt, Syria, Sudan,
Tunisia, China, Germany, Greece, Italy, South Africa, Spain,
Switzerland and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Food Reaches Town in Hands of S. Leone Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Food supplied by the United
Nations and other international agencies has for the first time
reached the areas controlled by the rebels in northern Sierra
Leone over the weekend since the signing of the Lome agreement in
early July.
</P>
<P>
A convoy of 60 trucks carrying over 1,000 tons of food has
arrived in Makeni, a rebel stronghold in the region, and
distribution work had already begun, reports reaching here quoted
a U.N. official as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The convoy is expected to relieve the grave food shortage
tending to starve local residents and the rebels as well.
</P>
<P>
Since signing the Lome peace deal with the Sierra Leonean
government, the rebels have been surviving by stealing and looting
from local people, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the main demands that food and medicine be sent
to them immediately when some of the rebels staged a
hostage-taking drama, in which several dozens of international aid
workers were held for a few days last month.
</P>
<P>
Innocent people are dying everyday in the rebel-controlled
regions due to malnutrition and medicine shortage, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
This has become an insatiable factor for the smooth
implementation of the Lome peace agreement, hardly earned after a
nearly one decade of civil war in this west African country.

<HEADLINE> Singer Files For Bankruptcy Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. sewing machine
maker Singer said Monday it has filed for bankruptcy protection
because of its financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
Singer president and chief executive Stephen H. Goodman said
the firing Sunday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court was caused by a
lack of liquidity following a recent decline in the global sewing
machine market and the bankruptcy filing a week ago by Germany
sewing manufacturer Pfaff AG. Singer acquired Pfaff last year.
</P>
<P>
Goodman attributed Singer's failure to the global financial
turmoil that has hit emerging markets over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Singer, the world's largest consumer sewing manufacturer, is
doing business in 150 countries and regions. It was founded in the
1800s in the United States and moved its headquarters to Hong
Kong a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Trading in Singer on the New York Stock Exchange was delayed

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks Resume in Tanzanian Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A new round of talks to
end Burundi's civil war started Monday in Tanzania's northern town
Arusha without the presence of the international peace mediator
Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Judge Mark Bomani, representative of Nyerere, told Xinhua over
telephone from Arusha that delegates will pick up issues left over
during their last meeting in the town two months ago, such as
resettlement of refugees, peace, economic reconstruction, among
others.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, Tanzania's founding president and a veteran African
statesman, is in London with an undisclosed illness. But he is
expected to return to Tanzania to join in the talks soon after
medical treatment, Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks have made little progress since they began in June
last year because of mistrust between different factions over a
conflict in which more than 150,000 people have died since October
1993.
</P>
<P>
Bomani has urged delegates to work seriously so that the
negotiations for final peace deal could speed up.
</P>
<P>
Burundian government officials say this session is crucial in
the wake of a rebel attack on capital Bujumbura last month, in
which 38 civilians and 20 rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels say they are fighting the Tutsi-dominated
army to defend the rights of the country's Hutu majority.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Hashim Mbita, spokesman for Nyerere, told
reporters in Arusha Monday that "violence can never help to find
an answer."
</P>
<P>
"We wish those involved in violence to know that Burundians
have suffered enough," reports reaching here quoted Mbita as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The ongoing Arusha peace talks give a hope for Burundi to end
violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The one-week talks bring together opposition and rebel groups
and the government of President Pierre Buyoya, who took power in a
military coup in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, a rebel group CNDD-FDD, which insisted on fighting in
Burundi, has not been invited to the talks, Bomani said.

WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Monday hoped the U.N. Security Council would Rapidly authorize a
multinational peacekeeping force for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"What we have indicated is that we would like delegates in New
York to move rapidly on a fast track to pass a resolution
authorizing a multinational force to move to East Timor to provide
security and restore order," State Department spokesman James
Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is expected to meet at 4 p.m. (2000
GMT) to discuss East Timor crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States would send "hundreds" of troops to
help with transport, logistics, communications and intelligence
rather than perform a classic infantry role of restoring order.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said the United States was "considering" air drops
of food and other supplies for refugees there.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has indicated support
for humanitarian air drops "so the United States and other
countries are looking at the possibility of air drops of food and
other supplies to refugees in East Timor."

<P>
Rubin said the United States backed Australian leadership of
the peacekeeping force.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Aninat Named IMF Deputy Managing Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, the
Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
announced Monday the appointment of Eduardo Aninat, currently the
Finance Minister of Chile, as Deputy Managing Director of the IMF
to a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Aninat will succeed Alassane D. Ouattara, who left the IMF at
the end of his appointment July 31, 1999, to pursue his political
career, the IMF said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I have been impressed for many years with Dr. Aninat's grasp
of the issues affecting the international economy, as well as with
his energy and clarity of purpose in discharging his key
responsibilities as the Minister of Finance of one of the most
successful economies in the world," Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
"His first-hand knowledge of the challenges of policy-making,
particularly in a period of international financial volatility
which has also affected Chile, will be an invaluable asset for the
IMF in its role as economic policy advisor to its member
governments," Camdessus added.
</P>
<P>
Aninat, who has an M.A. and Ph.D. in economics from Harvard

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tea Prices Pick Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea prices rose by an
 average of five to eight U.S. cents per kilogram at the weekly
tea auction as the quality of tea improved, sources from the
African Tea Brokers said at southeastern port city of Mombasa
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Best Pekoe Ones were sold at 2.48 to 2.62 U.S. dollars per
kilogram from last week's 2.42 to 2.50 dollars while Best Pekoes
Fannings rose to 2.40-2.47 dollars per kilo from 2.35-2.42
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, traders there said that the quantity on offer at the
auction was down almost by half compared with the figures over the
past few weeks, due to the dry weather for the tea-growing areas
in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
They also noted the dry weather had led to better quality tea,
saying that the tea quantity might go on declining as dry
conditions continue.
</P>
<P>
African Tea Brokers said traders from Egypt, Sudan, Yemen and
other Middle East countries had showed more interest and there
were also some orders from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasts indicate that there will be no much rainfall
for October in Kenya. This will be conducive to the tea
plantations producing better quality tea.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sets Agricultural Production Targets For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is targeting to
double its staple maize production to 3.1 million tons in the next
five years in a bid to improve the country's food security, Lands
and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the country's Policy Strategies for Stimulating
Agriculture Production and Food Security for the 1999/2000 farming
season and beyond, Kangai said that increased maize production
would not only ensure adequate local supply, but also allow
exports to progressively increase from 350,000 tons to 550,000
tons annually.
</P>
<P>
"The primary policy objective for Zimbabwe, as far as maize
production is concerned, is producing white maize to satisfy
national human consumption, nutrition and food security
requirements," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, he said, wheat production is expected
to increase from 320,000 tons to 400,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that cotton production, estimated at 300,000
tons for this year, should increase to 320,000 tons during the
next season and surpass 400,000 tons over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
On tobacco, he said that production of flue-cured tobacco
should not drop below 200 million kilograms, while the country
should aim to produce up to 20 million kg of burley tobacco from
the current seven million. Tobacco is one of Zimbabwe's single
largest foreign currency earners.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy for increased production will take into account
the need to create a competitive environment for investment to
expand acreages and establishment of infrastructure," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Immediate attention needs to be put into improving yields in
the communal areas and ensuring food security, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said the policy document looked at each commodity covering
the current situation, constraints affecting production and
strategies to increase production.
</P>
<P>
Coordinated efforts in research, extension, training and
utilization could lead to better technologies and increase
production, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine Launch Final-status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EREZ CHECKPOINT (ISRAEL), September 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel and
Palestine officially launched the final-status talks in a ceremony
held here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Executive Committee of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazan,
led the Palestinian delegation to the ceremony, while the
Israeli delegation was led by Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Special Coordinator of the Middle East Peace Talks Dennis
Ross, European Union's Special Envoy to the Middle East Miguel
Moratinos and representatives from the United Nations, Russia,
China, Japan, Norway, Egypt, Jordan and Finland were also present
on the occation.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony marked the very good beginning for both sides to
build mutual trust which could be conducive to help procceed the
negotiations. Levy, who arrived at the site ahead of Abbas, warmly
greeted the later at the gate of the meeting room.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, both Abbas and Levy spoke about their
commitments to reaching a final accord that will end the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and enable Palestinians and Israelis
to be separated and live in peace.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who spoke first, said that if the two sides can not reach
a framework accord within five months, then it will be very
difficult for both sides to strike a comprehensive peace treaty
by the next September as stipulated by the newly signed peace deal
in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"The Middle East peace process has reached the last storey of
the building of peace and it is also a very arduous task facing
us. We hope the two sides to make all efforts to reach a
comprehensive agreement for realizing the lasting peace in the
region," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Levy also repeated the policy of the Israeli
government for the final-status talks, saying that the Israel's
policies on Jerusalem, borders and settlements remain the same as
before.
</P>
<P>
In return, Abbas voiced his appreciation that both sides signed
new peace deal in Egypt and the cooperative relationship between
Arafat and Barak, saying such relationships laid a solid
foundation for achieving lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the Palestinian policy towards Jerusalem,
borders, the settlements and the Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We are aspired to live within the 1967 borders as an
independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and
to achieve a just solution to the Palestinian refugee problem in
accordance with the U.N. Resolution 194 and to dismantle the
Israeli settlements in accordance with the U.N. resolution 465,"
Abbas said.
</P>
<P>
Under the newly-signed peace agreement, the two sides are to
negotiate most thorny issues such as the status of the Palestinian
entity, borders, the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian
refugees, and the future of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the final-status talks here was set by the new
peace deal, a revised Wye River Accord, signed by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak last
Sunday in Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The new peace deal stipulates that the Israelis and
Palestinians should work out a statement of principles on final
peace deal in five months and the deadline for the agreement is
September 13, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Israel has already transferred 7 percent of the West Bank land
to the Palestinians and released 200 Palestinian prisoners last
Thursday as underlined in the Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to carry out another two troop withdrawals from the
West Bank in November and January next year, besides releasing
another 150 Palestinian prisoners on October 8 as stipulated by
the deal.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the southern "safe passage" between Gaza Strip and
the West Bank is to opened on October 1, while construction
of the Gaza seaport to commerce on the same day.

<HEADLINE> General Assembly Concludes 53rd Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd General
Assembly (GA) session concluded Monday after its plenary
conference unanimously adopted a resolution on the culture of
peace, which involves all countries and regions in the pursuit of
peace.
</P>
<P>
The session was chaired by the outgoing GA president, Didier
Opertti of Uruguay, who assumed the presidence at the beginning of
the closing GA session in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, entitled "Declaration and Program of Action on
a Culture of Peace," said that the GA recognizes that peace is not
only the absence of conflict, but requires a positive, dynamic
participatory process where dialogue is encouraged and conflicts
are solved in a spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The GA also recognizes that "the end of the cold war has
widened possibilities for strengthening a culture of peace," and
expresses "deep concern about the persistence and proliferation of
violence and conflict in various parts of the world," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution recognizes "the important role that the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
continues to play in the promotion of a culture of peace."
</P>
<P>
In introducing the draft, Anwarul Chowdhury, Bangladesh's
permanent representative to the United Nations, said, "I sense
that a great interest in this document beyond the world of the
United Nations, this has a far-reaching implication in its
implementation."
</P>
<P>
"I believe this document is unique in more than one way: it is
a universal document in the real sense," he said. "This document
is action-oriented and encourage actions at all levels, that is,
the level of the individuals, the community, the nation, the
region -- all at the global or international levels."
</P>
<P>
The document also brings together various actors who pursuit
the culture of peace; they include states, international
organizations, civil societies, community leaders, parents,
teachers, professors, artists, journalists and humanitarian
workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In a way, all the people from all walks of life and all sorts
of background can contribute in the implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
On November 9, 1988, the GA president, upon the conclusion of a
debate on the culture of peace, mandated the Bangladeshi
delegation to coordinate the consultations in a bid to produce a
draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
The consultation concluded on September 2 this year after a
consensus text was reached. The draft underlined the importance of
the U.N. Charter and the primary responsibility of the United
Nations in the maintenance of world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The resolution says, "The culture of peace is a set of values,
attitudes, traditional and modes of behavior and ways of life"
based on respect for life, ending of violence and promotion and
practice of non-violence through education, dialogue and
cooperation, full respect of the principles of sovereignty,
territorial integrity and political independence of States and
non-intervention in matters which are essentially within the
domestic jurisdiction of any State.
</P>
<P>
The culture of peace also covers such fields of eradicating
poverty and illiteracy and reducing inequalities within and among
nations, promoting sustainable economic and social development,
eliminating all forms of discrimination against women, and
increasing transparency and accountability in governance.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was inspired by a GA resolution, which was
adopted on January 18, 1988 to proclaim the year 2000 as the
International Year for the Culture of Peace.
</P>
<P>
The celebration of the International Year was led by the United
Nation Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech, Opertti said, "It was doubtless the
conflict in Kosovo, which, owing to its magnitude and
consequences, was the most important international political event
of the years."
</P>
<P>
He said that the conflicts in the world, technological progress
and the unbalanced economic development, organized crime,
terrorism and environmental degradation are major challenges
facing mankind in the next century.
</P>
<P>
During its 53rd session, the General Assembly considered a
total of 170 items at 107 plenary meetings and nine informal
meetings. It adopted 309 resolutions -- 248 of them by consensus
-- and 130 decisions, he added.

<HEADLINE> Painstaking Task By Qi Deliang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Exactly six years after the
signing of the Oslo Accord for Palestinian self-rule, Israel and
the Palestinians officially launched their final-status talks at
the Erez Checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Witnessing up and downs, breakthroughs and setbacks in the
peace process, the whole world is cheered up again for the smooth
reopening of the final-status talks as mandated by the new peace
deal signed by Palestinian leader Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak last Sunday in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of
Sharm El Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The deal asks the two sides to work out a statement of
principles on the final peace deal in five months and sets the
deadline for reaching the agreement on September 13, 2000.
</P>
<P>
No doubt, the new peace deal has charted the course towards a
historic permanent peace accord between the Israelis and
Palestinians and in reality, the negotiating teams are facing a
daunting task.
</P>
<P>
Within five months, by February 15, the two sides have to
present the outlines of an accord on the nature and borders of the
Palestinian entity, the status of Jerusalem, the future of the
Jewish settlements on occupied land in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip and the fate of over 3 million Palestinian refugees,
pending a full peace accord to be reached by September 2000.
</P>
<P>
Although many Israelis and Palestinians want to settle all
those thorny issues once for all, the two sides still remain far
apart even till now over the above mentioned issues.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to establish an independent sovereign
state in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem
as the capital, while demanding the return of over 3 million
Palestinian refugees and dismantling the Jewish settlements
unwilling to remain under Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants to annex parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to
keep most of the 20,000 settlers under Israeli rule. It also says
it will never relinquish parts of Jerusalem and will not permit
the return of refugees to areas under its control.
</P>
<P>
Monday's reopening of the final-status talks is viewed as a
historical event for both Israelis and the Palestinians. But to
solve all the remaining thorny issues will be a painstaking task
for both sides to deal with.

<HEADLINE> GA President on Challenges Facing Mankind in Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing president
of the 53rd General Assembly (GA) session, Didier Opertti of
Uruguay, Monday said peace, technological progress,
globalizations, drug trafficking and organized crimes are major
challenges facing mankind in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as the president was delivering a closing
speech at the plenary session of the GA, which began Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The president, also foreign minister of Uruguay, made the
statement as the world is poised to greet a new century, "a
century which offers a glimpse of prospects both promising and
disturbing, one marked by the existence of deep-seated
contradictions which are the major challenges humankind must
meet."
</P>
<P>
He sees these contradictions in three main areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
First, "the world is continuing to move towards the full
realization of individual freedoms and the democratization of
national societies and international society," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although much remains to be done, it is surely true that never
until now have the ideals of democracy and freedom been so widely
realized," he said.
</P>
<P>
"During the 12 months since this Assembly began its fifty-third
session, violence has dominated and affected the lives of people
in many parts of the world, often taking away those lives, and so
creating a legacy of fear and bitterness in people's hearts," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, in Africa and in Asia, old and new conflicts
continue to require the international community's attention and
call with increasing urgency for the adoption of attitudes and
gestures of solidarity rooted in tolerance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The second major contradictions relate to technological
progress, the revolution in communications and transport and the
extraordinary expansion of scientific knowledge, which has enabled
humankind to reach unprecedented levels of material development,"
he said. "However, the benefits from such progress are not
distributed equitably among the various segments of humanity."
</P>
<P>
"The process of globalization does not mitigate this
contradiction," he said. "On the contrary, it is a generally
accepted conclusion that the dramatic acceleration of the
globalization process that has been taking place these past few
years, resulted from the opening of markets and the liberalization
and modernization of trade, does not prevent the intensification
of the social differences and individual societies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The third major contradiction resulted from the fact that,
while many societies have achieved a high degree of social
integration, with high levels of knowledge, culture and creative
activity, these same societies appear to be extremely vulnerable
to such dangers as drug trafficking, organized crime, terrorism
and environmental degradation," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the GA's 53rd session, "intensive negotiations were held
in determining the format and content of" the Millennium Summit,
which is scheduled to be held during the 55th GA session beginning
in September 2000.

<HEADLINE> Non Arrival of African Leaders to AIDS Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the World
Health Organization (WHO) have expressed disappointment at the
non-arrival of various heads of state to the on-going 11th
International Conference on AIDS and STDS (sexually transmitted
diseases) in Africa (ICASA).
</P>
<P>
The disappointments were expressed at a joint press conference
in Lusaka Monday by Executive Director of the Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Peter Piot and Vice-President of the
World Bank African region, Calliso Madavo and WHO regional
director for Africa Ebrahim Samba.
</P>
<P>
Taking the lead in showing disappointment on the non attendance
of the heads of state who had showed willingness to attend, Samba
said he had not yet heard any reason why all failed to attend the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The names of the heads of state and their countries were not
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed at the fact that heads of state are not with
us here," the WHO official said. "They may have their reasons for
not turning up the meeting."
</P>
<P>
The same sentiments were expressed by Piot from UNAIDS, who
said there was need to put HIV/AIDS issue on the national agenda
wherever heads of state or government gather so that they can
discuss and commit themselves to the fight of the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said about two thirds of the AIDS cases in the
world are registered in African countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to would-be steps to be taken, Piot pointed out that
there will be nothing achieved in the fight against the disease.
Hence, there is the need to have a political commitment from
governments.
</P>
<P>
In its statement released earlier at the conference, the World
Bank said that national governments must take the lead in fighting
AIDS, because there are things that only governments can do, or
make it possible for others to do.
</P>
<P>
Without these things, the struggle cannot succeed, it added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Launches Spy Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain revealed Monday it had
suspected "traitor granny" Melita Norwood of spying for the Soviet
Union for half a century but had never interviewed her in order
not to jeopardize other investigations.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw, under pressure to reveal the facts
about Norwood and a second Soviet spy unmasked by Moscow defector
Vasili Mitrokhin, said he first learned of her activities in
December 1998, BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
Straw has ordered an investigation into MI5's handling of the
spy scandal.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Straw said Norwood, an 87-year-old grandmother
at the center of a British spy scandal, had been given clearance
in 1945 to do secret work despite doubts about her communist
associations.
</P>
<P>
But four years later there were "new concerns" and she lost her
access to secrets about the development of Britain's atomic bomb
in 1949. She was vetted in 1951 and again in 1962 but refused
clearance.
</P>
<P>
In 1965 an investigation concluded she had been a spy in the
1940s but came up with no usable evidence and the then Labor Home
Secretary Frank Soskice was informed.
</P>
<P>
But Britain's MI5 counterespionage agency decided not to
interview her "because that would have revealed the Service's
knowledge which was relevant to other sensitive investigations
then underway."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the home secretary met the head of MI5, Stephen
Lander, amid growing concern that the intelligence service took no
action against former Soviet spies after it was made aware of
their existence.
</P>
<P>
Straw's statement came as two former Labor MPs were also named
as Soviet agents.
</P>
<P>
Tom Driberg and Raymond Fletcher, who are both now dead, are
the latest Cold War spies to be named from files brought to the UK
by Russian dissident Vasili Mitrokhin.
</P>
<P>
Driberg, who was MP for Barking, East London, was known by the
codename of Lepage, while Fletcher, then MP for Ilkeston,
Derbyshire, was codenamed Peter, according to the files Mitrokhin
smuggled into the UK in 1992.
</P>
<P>
A former policeman, John Symonds, has also admitted he was a
"Romeo agent," sleeping with women from foreign embassies to gain
secrets for the KGB in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office said a decision not to prosecute would have
been made not by the home secretary, but by the police and Crown
Prosecution Service -- and was probably taken because of the
amount of time that had elapsed.
</P>
<P>
The revelations came to light when a BBC team was researching
the forthcoming documentary "The Spying Game."
</P>
<P>
"The Spying Game" will be broadcast on BBC Two on September 19.
It will include an exclusive interview with KGB defector Vasili
Mitrokhin.

<HEADLINE> GA President on Lessons from Kosovo Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing president
of the 53rd session of the General Assembly (GA) Monday listed
several lessons the world should learn from the conflicts in
Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, which he described as "the most
important international political event of the year."
</P>
<P>
"It was doubtless that the conflict in Kosovo, which, owning to
its magnitude and consequences, was the most important
international political event of the year," Didier Opertti
of Uruguay said.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech at the GA plenary session, he said, "I
view it as an unfortunate coincidence that, during the year that
it fell to me to preside over the General Assembly, the
credibility and effectiveness of this body (the United Nations),
the most genuinely democratic and representative in the
international community, were put to their severest test ever."
</P>
<P>
"The conflict in Kosovo highlighted a number of issues which
must be mentioned," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the first place, it showed that the Security Council, whose
task is the preservation of peace, was prevented from doing so by
its inability to reach the necessary decisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, it must be noted that the General Assembly, which,
under the Charter,... has responsibility for the maintenance of
international peace and security, did not find itself in a
position to exercise this responsibility, not for want of a legal
framework but because the prevailing political will was not to
make use of those powers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Lastly, let us recall that the Charter of the United Nations
is built on the principle of legitimacy, which gives substance and
a raison d'etre to the international legal order," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, the main lesson to be learnt from the case of
Kosovo is that we must diligently continue to seek formulas that
offer full guarantees of respect for this principle," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be premature to draw any final conclusions regarding
the Kosovo crisis now, but what does seem to be clear is that the
crisis will affect the functioning and credibility of the United
Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Without the compulsory authorization of the Security Council,
the U.S.-led NATO waged 79-day air strikes on Yugoslavia, a
sovereign member of the U.N. family, thus seriously threatening
international peace and undermining the authority of the Charter
and the United Nations itself in the maintenance of world peace
and security.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Police Officials Censured for Failure to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian police disciplinary
board censured two top police officers Monday for dereliction of
duty over an attack on President Hosni Mubarak, the Interior
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The board ordered that 14 other Port Said police officers stand
trial for negligence in connection with the assassination attempt
on Mubarak on September 6, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The officers were accused of "negligence in providing
protection" for Mubarak during a visit to Port Said, 180
kilometers northeast of Cairo, at the northern end of the Suez
Canal.
</P>
<P>
Port Said Security Director Maj. Gen. Hassan Abdel Motteleb
Othman Jebril and Director of State Security Investigation Maj.
Gen. Abdullah Nasr will be deprived of promotion and retire next
year, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The 14 other officers, including Criminal Investigation
Director Brig. Mohammed Sallem Shalan, will stand trial in a
special police court "for negligence of duty in protecting the
president," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A knife-wielding man attacked and slightly injured Mubarak as
his motorcade passed through the city. The man was shot dead by
Mubarak's guards. Police say he was deranged.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak blamed the attack on lax security. He sacked the
intelligence chief and ordered a security review.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said an unspecified number of junior policemen and
informers will also go on trial for negligence.

<HEADLINE> Greek Banks Announce Measures to Assist Quake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek banks Monday announced a
package of measures aimed to assist the victims of last Tuesday's
earthquake which hit northwestern Athens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting of the union's board, Theodore
Karatzas, chairman of Greek banks' union, said that these measures
included supporting citizens hit by the earthquake through the
extension of mortgage, personal and consumer loans payment
timetables by six to nine months, extending all due interest
payments on business loans by six to nine months, lowering
personal, consumer and business loans' interest rates by two
percentage points until December 31, 2000 and freezing all
enforced actions for a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
Greek banks would cover the costs of separate reconstruction
projects totaling more than 3 billion drachmas (about 1 million
U.S. dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
Karatzas said that all Cypriot banks operating in Greece would
contribute in the efforts of the reconstruction of the regions
that were mostly damaged.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday's earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale
had an epicenter in the Mount Parnitha region, some 20 kilometers
northwest of Athens.
</P>
<P>
So far, 122 people have died in the earthquake, which is
estimated to cost Greece 100 billion drachmas (about 333 million
U.S. dollars).

XIAMEN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- It was a real eye-opener to
see the state-of-the-art mobile phones and automobiles on display
during the 3rd Chinese Investment Trade Fair recently in the city
of Xiamen in southeast China's coastal province of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Big names like Ericsson, Nokia, Motorola, Ford, and Kodak were
showing their latest technology and products to demonstrate their
passion about, confidence in, and commitment to the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 60 multinationals, who are expected to
become a powerful force for investment in China, according to
Guido Magnoni, a representative of the Italian Institute for
Foreign Trade's Asia Desk.
</P>
<P>
Multinationals have been playing an important role in global
economic growth and international investment and account for one-
third of the world's output value, two-third of its trade, and 30
percent of the direct investment worldwide, and are a major source
of investment for countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Combining their investment and technology with China's immense
human resources and consumer market is an important way for China
to improve its competitiveness internationally, said Hu Angang, a
young Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
More to the point, he said, it is the best way for China to
introduce overseas investment to help its big enterprises improve
and increase their presence overseas.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Maldivian President
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom arrived here on Monday for a three-day
official visit aimed at boosting ties between Maldives and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Gayoom is expected to hold talks with Kuwaiti Emir Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah on strengthening bilateral ties, the official
Kuwait news agency Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
This is Gayoom's second visit to Kuwait over nine years. Gayoom
had visited Kuwait in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Maldives, an islands nation of 298 square
kilometers and with a population of 238,000, lies to the southwest
of India in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
It was regarded as Kuwait's staunch supporter during Iraq's
invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991.
</P>
<P>
Maldives also assured on many occasions that it was following
up the issue of Kuwaiti and third country nationals allegedly
still held in captivity in Iraqi jails, and called for a quick
release of those detainees, Kuna said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the latest statistics showed that Kuwait has
extended a total of 1.137 billion dinars (around 3.785 billion
U.S. dollars) in loans to Maldives' agricultural and
transportation development projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
Recent years have seen a rapid growth in China's use of
multinationals' investment. Nearly 300 of the world's top 500
firms that are involved in manufacturing are in China and more
than 100 of them have regional headquarters in China, according to
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Multinationals invest in many areas in China, from machinery,
electronics, chemicals, building materials, automobiles, and
telecommunications to foodstuff. They are also expanding their
business from coastal areas to central and western parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Having been encouraged by the Chinese Government, they have
established nearly 200 investment companies in China as a means of
promoting their long-term development and they have 18 billion U.S.
dollars worth of investment in China.
</P>
<P>
To improve this, China will further ease restrictions on
investment companies and will cut taxes or give exemptions for
establishing research and development centers. China's effort to
improve the investment environment has been approved by
multinationals and has paid off.
</P>
<P>
Folke Ahlback, a senior vice president of Nokia Great China,
said that Nokia considers that its investment in China was
justified and sees its activities in China as an increasingly
important part of Nokia's organic growth.
</P>
<P>
Karl P. Sauvant, a team leader on the World Investment Report,
said that governments and multinationals are expected to maintain
a relationship where overseas direct investment can expand and
where the wealth-creating activities of multinationals can
contribute as much as possible to national growth and development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is expecting multinationals to
contribute to the nation's economic growth, especially in
industrial restructuring, manufacturing, employment, and taxes and
multinationals in China are being regarded as a new and powerful
force in the nation's economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Carol Bellamy Re-Appointed as UNICEF Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Carol Bellamy, current
executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund, was
re-appointed Monday by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan as head
of the agency.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said at Monday's noon briefing that
Bellamy's re-appointment will take effect on May 1, 2000, at the
conclusion of her present term.
</P>
<P>
Outlining some of her goals for a second five-year term,
Bellamy said, "Although we have many successes behind us, we have
many challenges before us. The scourge of HIV/AIDS, the damaging
consequences of conflict, and the asphyxiating effect of poverty
and debt are all growing. It is our responsibility -- for the sake
of children everywhere -- to overcome them."
</P>
<P>
In her coming term, Bellamy will devote the UNICEF to promoting
a new "global agenda for children" -- recruiting leaders in
government, civil society, academia, the media and the private
sector to commit themselves to making sure that all children
survive; that they grow up healthy in a protected environment;
that they obtain a quality basic education; and that fewer women
die during childbirth or from preventable causes.
</P>
<P>
Since her original appointment in May 1995, Bellamy has worked
to increase visibility and support for the millions of children
around the world whose lives are battered by war. She has traveled
to the war-devastated countries of Angola, Sierra Leone, Albania,
and Afghanistan, among others, to underscore every child's right
to basic protection, whatever his or her circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF operates in more than 160 countries worldwide,
helping governments and civil society provide for and protect the
health, education and general well-being of children and women. It
has an annual operating budget of roughly 1 billion U.S. dollars.

PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- France condemned Monday the

message to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Says "One Country, Two Systems" Is The Best Way To Unify China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The "one country, two systems
" policy is the most realistic and feasible way for China to be
unified, Lu Ping, the former director of the State Council's Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office, told Xinhua recently.
</P>
<P>
Since his retirement five days after the return of Hong Kong to
the motherland on July 1, 1997, Lu has been concerned with the
unification of the nation, in which he played such an active role
during his years in office.
</P>
<P>
He started that work in 1978 and witnessed the whole process of
forming the "one country, two systems" policy and putting it into
practice. It was initially designed for the Taiwan issue but was
successfully implemented to solve the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
Lu explains that the policy maintains the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the nation on the one hand while taking
into consideration the interests of parties concerned on the other
and shows a high-degree of flexibility.
</P>
<P>
"One China" is both the basis and the core and allows flexible
measures to be adopted in accordance with the real situation, he
says.
</P>
<P>
After unification under this policy, Taiwan will not have to
change its social or economic system and the Taiwanese will not
have to change their way of life. Compared with Hong Kong and
Macao, Taiwan will have more flexible policies, including keeping
its own armed forces. It can best guarantee Taiwanese compatriots'
hope of maintaining the present situation and safeguarding their
interests, Lu says.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of the long-term separation and the obstructions put up
by Taiwan authorities, some Taiwanese compatriots still can not
fully understand the "one country, two systems" concept and still
have doubts about it, but this doesn't matter, he says, as long as
they agree on the "one China" principle they will come to agree on
the "one country, two systems" idea after seeing it in Hong Kong
and Macao.
</P>
<P>
He says that when it was first suggested as a way to solve the
Hong Kong issue, many people in Hong Kong also had doubts, but
when they saw the policy fully implemented, more and more people
began to agree with and support it.
</P>
<P>
The policy is in line with the nation's interests and is not
simply for any single party or any single people, he says, and
Taiwanese compatriots will ultimately come to understand the
sincerity of the Central Government in implementing the "one
country, two systems" policy through greater understanding and
communications.
</P>
<P>
Lu says that the reunification of the motherland is an
unavoidable historical trend and that any remarks like Lee Teng-
hui's "two states" to divide the motherland will certainly be
opposed by the Chinese, including Taiwanese compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" policy is the country's basic
policy but the mainland has not said that it will give up the use
of non-peaceful means to unify the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Unifying the motherland and revitalizing the nation are the
life-long pursuits of Lu's generation, and also the will of the
Chinese people. Lu says he is confident that their hopes will be
realized.

<HEADLINE> 7 Angolans Killed in Rebel's Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Seven civilians in a truck
were killed on a highway near northern Malanje at last weekend
during an ambush launched by the Angolan rebels on a civil
vehicle, a military source said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Land Rover truck is the sixth car ambushed in the same
section of highway in less than two months, which had killed over
30 and injured about a hundred, according to the unidentified
military source.
</P>
<P>
During the attack, six passengers and one driver were shot
dead while another passenger Teresa Pedro Rebeca became the only
survivor in the incident.
</P>
<P>
According to Rebeca, the rebels of the National Union for Total
 Independence of Angola (UNITA) irrigated the bodies of the
victims with gasoline and then burned them.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, UNITA rebels continued to mine the roads with
access to fields and mounted a series of ambushes on the principal
highways, in a bid to impede the provision for the suffered in
Malanje, said the source.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that four civilians were killed and another
six injured during an attack launched almost simultaneously by the
UNITA rebels against a village called Cateque, only nine
kilometers away from the central fortress Bocoio, in the coastal
Benguela Province.
</P>
<P>
During the assault, 54 houses were reportedly burned and all
properties were robbed by the rebels. Rebel's activities will
deprive local residents of their provisions, seeds and domestic
animals, the source said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urged to Help Release Lebanese Journalist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese independent group
Monday urged French President Jacques Chirac to intervene for the
release of a Lebanese journalist arrested recently by Israel on
suspicion of dealing with Lebanese military group Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Follow-up Committee for Supporting Lebanese Detained
in Israeli Prison said in a statement that it has submitted a
memorandum to Chirac seeking his pressure on Israel to release
Kozet Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, who works at Alliwaa daily newspaper in Beirut, was
arrested early this month by Israeli troops from her house in the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
She was reported to have suffered barbaric physical and
psychological torturing which made the Israeli troops admit her
to the hospital inside the zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops out of the country.
</P>
<P>
About 130 Lebanese have been detained without trial in Khiam
prison inside the border enclave for collaborating with
Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> Some Reconciliation Fostered Between Iraq, Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A new mood of reconciliation
between Iraq and other Arab states has taken hold, the Arab League
(AL) secretary-general said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the two-day Arab foreign ministers'
meeting here, Esmat Abdel-Meguid said that while differences
remain between Iraq and the Gulf Arab states, discussions have
been "very civilized."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf chaired the
meeting, marking the first time Iraq had taken the league's chair
since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The seat rotates annually
among the 22 members.
</P>
<P>
"The Gulf crisis is a problem, but at least we have now a
beginning of trying to find an acceptable solution," Abdel-Meguid
said of the legacy of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The six Arab states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
censured Iraq on Saturday for its defiance of the United Nations
Security Council resolutions and insisted that Iraq admit the
invasion violated international law.
</P>
<P>
Asked why Iraq did not pursue reconciliation to the point of
making such an admission, al-Sahhaf said the GCC statement was an
example of public diplomacy, not real diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a matter of who will apologize to others. It is a
matter of common sense," al-Sahhaf said. "Each GCC member has its
own policy on Iraq but the common approach is gradually growing
positive."
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq trades with five GCC states - Bahrain, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, except
Kuwait. The volume of Iraqi-Saudi trade stood at 157 million
U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said the league is to send a delegation to inspect
an Israeli exhibit at Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando,
Florida of the United States to see if it depicts Jerusalem as
Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
He said the chairman of Walt Disney Co., Michael Eisner, had
called him and invited such a delegation. Previously the company
had refused access to a team from the United Arab Emirates, which
threatened a boycott of Disney products last week.
</P>
<P>
Eisner was "very apologetic and regretful. He was very keen not
to cause any harm to Arab countries or Jerusalem or the peace
process," Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Sunday that Arab
states would not accept the representation of Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the coming Israeli-Palestinian peace talks were to
settle the status of East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the
1967 Arab-Israeli War and which the Palestinians regard as their
future capital.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept anything that would predetermine something
that has to be determined through negotiations," Moussa said.

<HEADLINE> GA Considers Draft Resolution on Culture of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd General
Assembly Monday began a plenary session to consider a draft
resolution on the culture of peace, which involves all countries
and regions in pursuit of peace.
</P>
<P>
The session, also the concluding meeting of the 53rd General
Assembly, was chaired by the outgoing GA president, Didier Opertti
of Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
In introducing the draft, Anwarul Chowdhury, Bangladesh's
permanent representative to the United Nations, said, "I sense
that a great interest in this document beyond the world of the
United Nations, this has a far-reaching implication in its
implementation."
</P>
<P>
"I believe this document is unique in more than one way: it is
a universal document in the real sense," he said. "This document
is action-oriented and encourages actions at all levels, that is,
the level of the individuals, the community, the nation, the
region -- all at the global or international levels."
</P>
<P>
The document also brings together various actors who pursuit
the culture of peace; they include states, international
organizations, civil societies, community leaders, parents,
teachers, professors, artists, journalists and humanitarian
workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In a way, all the people from all walks of life and all sorts
of background can contribute in the implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
On November 9, 1988, the GA president, upon the conclusion of a
debate on the culture of peace, mandated the Bangladeshi
delegation to coordinate the consultations in a bid to produce a
draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
The consultation concluded on September 2 this year after a
consensus text was reached. The draft underlined the importance of
the U.N. Charter and the primary responsibility of the United
Nations in the maintenance of world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The draft says, "The culture of peace is a set of values,
attitudes, traditional modes of behavior and ways of life" based
on respect for life, ending of violence and promotion and practice
of non-violence through education, dialogue and cooperation, full
respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity
and political independence of states and non-intervention in
matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of
any state."
</P>
<P>
The culture of peace also covers such fields of eradicating
poverty and illiteracy and reducing inequalities within and among
nations, promoting sustainable economic and social development,
eliminating all forms of discrimination against women, and
increasing transparency and accountability in governance.
</P>
<P>
The draft was inspired by a GA resolution, which was adopted on
January 18, 1988 to proclaim the year 2000 as the International
Year for the Culture of Peace.
</P>
<P>
The celebration of the International Year was led by the
United Nation Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO).

UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council meets Monday afternoon on East Timor, the council
president announced.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting at 4:30 pm EST is expected to discuss
new developments after Indonesia's announcement to accept a
U.N.-sponsored international force in cooperation with the
country's military to restore order and security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's response, announced by Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Sunday, to a U.N. call for such a force was welcomed by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas is expected to arrive in
New York by lunch time Monday to discuss details of the deployment
of the force, said a spokesman for the Indonesian Permanent
Mission to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Alatas will meet Annan at 3:30 Monday afternoon, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, leaders of the House of Representatives at a
meeting Monday with President Habibie endorsed the government's
decision to accept the international help, and Habibie said he
fully entrusts the Council to decide which countries would join
the force after consulting with Alatas.

WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Floyd grew into
a Category 5 storm with 250 kph winds and headed toward the
Bahamas Monday, threatening the Florida coast of the United

<HEADLINE> More Protection Needed For E-Shoppers: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Commerce over the Internet
does not offer enough protection for consumers and the potential
of electronic commerce can never be realized until the loopholes
in shopping on the Internet were wiped away, the European
Commission said in a newly published report on a survey.
</P>
<P>
Many problems had been found during the E-shopping survey
conducted by Consumers International on behalf of the European
Commission, the European Union (EU)'s executive body. The
investigators ordered over 150 items from easily accessible
Internet sites, but found finally one article in 10 never arrived.
And a Briton and a Hong Kong citizen waited for five months to get
their money back.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that nearly 45 percent of the products
ordered reached their destination without acknowledgement of
receipt and nearly 25 percent of sites did not give an address or
telephone number.
</P>
<P>
Of the total products ordered, 24 percent were not clear about
the gross price, according to the six-month survey, which was
cooperated with consumer organizations from Australia, Belgium,
Britain, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Japan, Norway, Spain, Sweden
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
A federation of 245 consumer protection organizations in 111
countries, Consumers International said the finding shows
customers in shopping on the Internet are kept in the dark about
what action to take to lodge a complaint.
</P>
<P>
The survey writers called for international guidelines to be
drafted and a certification or labeling system to be set up to
allow consumers to be sure which "electronic stores" meet the
basic standards.
</P>
<P>
They also want to see an appeal mechanism set up to deal with
disputes between purchasers and all companies involved in
E-business on the Internet. It would be an easily accessible,
affordable, rapid and user-friendly system for protecting
consumers, they added.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Groups Merge After Elf Chief Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- French oil and chemical giants
Total-Fina and Elf-Aquitaine have agreed to merge on friendly
terms after the former offered to raise its buying price of Elf
stocks by nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The president and executive officer of Elf, Philippe Jaffre,
will quit his post and allow his rival, Total President Thierry
Desmarest, to lead the future group, which will be the world's
fourth largest in the field of oil and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Desmarest Monday, Jaffre said
that "there is a time to say no and there is a time to yes," and
it is time to say yes after resisting the take-over bid by Total
for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
The reaction of the stock market is believed to have played a
major role in bringing an end to the merger battle, as the market
has played mainly in favor of Total-Fina.
</P>
<P>
The two groups will immediately begin merging their companies
and teams to create the biggest French enterprise with 150,000
employees and 600 billion francs (100 billion U.S. dollars) worth
of stocks listed in stock markets of Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government welcomed the decision after the
announcement was made Monday.
</P>
<P>
Desmarest said that the merger will result in the downsizing of
2,000 jobs in three years, but will not bring about forcible
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the future merged group will also realize a
combined production figure of 1.5 billion euros (1.575 billion
U.S. dollars) in three years.
</P>
<P>
The administration councils of th two groups met Monday and
proposed to their stock-holders to allow Elf and Total to come
together "in a friendly way, on an equal footing and on the basis
of an ambitious industrial project."
</P>
<P>
Total-Fina, which launched a surprise takeover bid against Elf
on September 5, has agreed to raise its offer by 9.6 percent, or 4
billion francs (667 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the rest, the merger conditions will conform with those
presented by Total, including a total integration of the chemical
sector.
</P>
<P>
Elf, which owns a stronger chemical sector that Total, had
proposed to separate the chemicals from the future group and list
them separately in the stock market.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Could U.N. Play Bigger Role? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The 54th session of
the United Nations General Assembly convenes Tuesday with more
country leaders participating, a sign of growing expectation for
the international community at the threshold of a new century.
</P>
<P>
Yongjian Jin, under secretary-general of the U.N., announced
last week that 40 heads of state and 26 heads of government had
been on the list of speakers at the general debate scheduled to
begin a week later. The figures may change more or less, but they
represent a sharp rise over last year's, which stood at 26 and 15
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"It is a clear sign of growing expectation for the United
Nations," Jin said in an interview with Xinhua. The country
leaders want to voice their hope that the international community
will be able to play a more important role in the 21st century, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The developed and developing countries alike seem to believe
that the U.N. has played a unique and indispensable part in
maintaining world peace and security, advancing economic and
social development as well as promoting human rights. It is
commonly realized that no other international or regional
organization could have exerted the same role so far.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. and its NATO allies challenged the U.N.
status early this year by launching an intense bombing of
Yugoslavia in the wake of a "humanitarian crisis" in Kosovo. The
78-day military operation against a sovereign U.N. member state
was not authorized by the Security Council, which shoulders the
primary responsibility for maintaining peace and security
worldwide, a principle enshrined in the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
If the NATO military intervention could set a precedence
without condemnation, will the Security Council manage to exert
its rightful authority in case of crisis? The question needs to be
answered both in theory and practice.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan believes that lessons should
be drawn from the crisis handling. In his report to the new
session of the General Assembly, the U.N. chief stressed that
military intervention should seek the green light from the
Security Council; regional organizations should rather cooperate
with than compete against the U.N. in peace-keeping and peace
making missions; political will and resources from member states
are imperative to securing success.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its NATO allies may cite their new strategic
concept to argue against the conclusion, but it is hard to sell it
to the vast number of developing countries. The new concept,
masterminded by the U.S. and adopted at the April NATO summit in
Washington, allows the regional defense alliance to intervene even
militarily in case of crisis without seeking authorization from
the Security Council. This theory, coupled with the Kosovo
bombing, alerted the world to the danger of marginalizing the U.N.
in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The argument could hardly die down at the new General Assembly
session. But the deteriorating financial situation in the U.N. may
fuel doubts about the U.N.'s capability and efficiency of carrying
out its missions.
</P>
<P>
It is not a secret that the U.N. is deeply troubled by the
serious budgetary deficit over the past few years. The problem
mainly arose from unpaid arrears, which totaled more than 2
billion U.S. dollars in 1998. The U.S. unpaid dues made up
one-third of the total. Even the U.S. allies have protested
against Washington's request for reduced pay rates, but the
Capitol Hill has defied appeals from the White House and foreign
capitals. "The U.N. has been taken hostage by American domestic
politics. If the defiance continues, it will have serious
consequences for the international community," warned a Western
expert on the U.N. affairs.
</P>
<P>
It has been announced that some 160 items have been placed on
the agenda, ranging from preventive diplomacy to sustained
development, from disarmament to drug and crimes, from poverty
eradication to environmental protection. But undoubtedly the
issues of peace and security, economic and social development will
still be the focus.
</P>
<P>
The world leaders need to speak out their desires and concerns,
but it is more important to take actions to back the U.N. if they
really greatly count on it. Only firm political will and
continuous contributions from member states will enable the U.N.
to function better.

BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin met
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Auckland, New Zealand, on
September 11 and about two weeks ago, with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin in Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
These two meetings were during a summit of heads of state of
China, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, and the 7th
Informal Leadership Meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation, respectively. Jiang also paid state visits to Italy,
Switzerland, Austria, Mongolia, Thailand, Australia, and New
Zealand this year. Other senior Chinese officials also visited
dozens of countries in the America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.
</P>
<P>
All of these trips are considered important diplomatic
activities by China at the turn of the century and the epitome of
China's active and independent diplomacy of peace since the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the founding of New China five decades ago, the
country faced a perilous environment, and half a century later,
relations with major powers have improved remarkably and ties with
neighboring states and other developing countries have seen
progress.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,
China has been playing an increasingly important role in the

<P>
On October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding
of the People's Republic of China, ending a hundred years of
humiliation, and China now has diplomatic relations with more than
160 countries and engages in economic, trade, scientific,
technological, and cultural cooperation with more than 220
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
In the past five decades China has overcome difficult
international problems one by one in part thanks to its flexible
and practical strategies.
</P>
<P>
(Subtitle) Independence -- Standpoint of China's Diplomacy
</P>
<P>
Independence is the basic principle of China's foreign policy.
On the eve of the founding of the new China, Mao Zedong
exstablished the foreign policy of the new socialist China by
first severing all links with the old China's foreign policy, or "
thoroughly cleaning house", as he put it.
</P>
<P>
Even during the China-U.S.S.R. alliance in the 1950s, China
stuck to a principle of independence. In the late 1950s, Sino-
Soviet ties worsened gradually because of the latter's chauvinism,
but China firmly safeguarded the principle, stressing a principle
of equal sovereignty among socialist countries and opposing
chauvinism.
</P>
<P>
In May, 1989, after Deng Xiaoping and Mikhail Gorbachev held
talks in Beijing, the two countries normalized relations on a
basis of mutual respect for independence and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
China has the same attitude towards its relations with the
United States. The U.S. had a hostile attitude towards the People'
s Republic and imposed an embargo to try to stop its development
after the New China was founded.

<P>
The U.S. government announced that it would continue to
recognize the Kuomintang regime three days after the founding of
New China. Then, on June 25, 1950, the Korean war broke out. The U.
S. brought the war up close to the Chinese border on the Yalu
River and the U.S. 7th Fleet invaded the Taiwan Straits, posing a
serious threat to Chinese sovereignty and national security. To
combat this, the Chinese leaders made a strategic decision to
resist U.S. aggression and help the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea.
</P>
<P>
It was not until the early 1970s that China and the U.S. began
contacts after taking into consideration their respective
strategic interests. Mao Zedong told Edgar Snow, the well-known U.
S. journalist and the old friend of the Chinese people, in 1970,
that he was ready to talk to President Richard Nixon if Nixon
would come to China.
</P>
<P>
After several rounds of diplomatic discussions, Mao and Premier
Zhou Enlai mapped out their "ping pong diplomacy" when the U.S.
government showed its willingness to improve relations. President
Nixon visited China in February of 1972, marking the end of the
stalemate in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Sino-U.S. relations have had their twists and turns
but the Chinese government has stuck to the principle of
independence and has considered its long-term strategic interests
while respecting the interests of the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese government has made it clear that the
Chinese people can never accept any harm done to national
interests or interference of any kind in China's internal affairs
especially in Taiwan.

The development of China's independent foreign policy
demonstrates that Chinese leaders have started with the basic
interests of the Chinese people and the people in the rest of the
world and have made decisions in accordance with the right or
wrong of the specific affair and have never bowed their heads to
any external pressure.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign policy also reflects China's increasing
strength and important status in international affairs and a more
mature diplomacy. The independent foreign policy of peace has
withstood the test of time, especially the changing international
situation in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the bi-polar world transformed the basis of
international relations. The late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping put
forward a new strategic policy for China's diplomacy: observe
calmly, stay firmly, cope with the situation cold-headedly, keep a
low profile to lie low and get something done.
</P>
<P>
China continued to steadily develop relations with all
countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful-Coexistence.
China's firm stand and flexible approaches have allowed the
country to overcome pressure and sanctions imposed by western
countries, thereby creating a favorable environment for economic
construction.

Maintaining World Peace and Stability for Development of
Humanity
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the themes of today's world and
seeking peace and stability and promoting cooperation and
development have become the aspirations of all peace-loving
countries and people.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping said in 1985 that peace and development are the
two strategic issues worldwide and development is the core.
</P>
<P>
China, as a socialist country, should pursue a foreign policy
of peace and needs a peaceful international environment to be a
prosperous and strong country. When New China was founded, it
declared that it would strive for independence, democracy, peace,
unification and prosperity, and in diplomacy would make an effort
to safeguard peace in the world.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhou Enlai, in a meeting with an Indian delegation in
1953, put forward the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence for
the first time. The Chinese government then made it clear that
China was willing to establish normal relations with all countries
on the basis of the five principles.
</P>
<P>
From the 1950s to the 1980s, there was no tranquillity in areas
around China and a number of wars broke out like the Korean War,
the war in Viet Nam, Viet Nam's invasion of Cambodia, and the
Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. And, in self-defence,
China had to attack India, the Soviet Union, and Viet Nam during
that period of time.

LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo Albanian refugees
seeking asylum in Britain will no longer have special rights to
stay in the country, British Home Secretary Jack Straw said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Straw said that since the withdrawal in June of Serb forces
from Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians were now safe from persecution
in their homeland and their applications to stay in Britain would
be treated "on merit," Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic Albanians are now generally safe from persecution in
Kosovo and this is reflected in the new guidance to immigration
officers which comes into force today," Straw said.
</P>
<P>
"Many who sought refuge in Britain, and elsewhere, have already
returned home," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office said that of the 4,346 Kosovo Albanians who
came to Britain, mainly as part of a U.N. evacuation program, 809
had already returned home voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
It said applications for asylum from Kosovo Albanians were now
likely to be refused.
</P>
<P>
Britain has a backlog of more than 80,000 applicants for asylum
and opposition Conservatives complain the the country had become a
"soft touch" for bogus asylum seekers.

LUANDA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The 22nd Conference of the
African Inter-Parliamentary Union (AIPU) to be held in Luanda is a
good opportunity for African lawmakers to know Angola, Angola's
parliament speaker said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Angolan National Assembly Roberto de Almeida
made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the 36th session of
the AIPU Executive Committee, which is now making preparations for
the two-day African inter-parliamentary conference to be held on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Almeida, also chairman of the conference, reminded the
participants of the existence in Angola of a government of unity
and national reconciliation and an integrated parliament composed
by members of various political parties.
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, one of the parties launched war against the
legally established institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't accept that one party can have a private army,"
Almeida stressed, adding that the Angolan army has the mission of
defending the national sovereignty and guaranteeing the security
of the population.
</P>
<P>
As for the Friday meeting of the African inter-parliamentary
conference, the chairman said that the event is important for
exchanging opinions among parliaments in African countries.
</P>
<P>
Almeida also noted that Angola establishes bindings between the
central and the southern African countries.

Analysts say that this is one of the few periods when China has
been able to enjoy better relations with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Deng said in the early 1980s that it was possible that another
major world war would not occur for quite a long time and that
hopefully the world would remain peaceful and he emphasized that
China firmly took the policy of opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
This policy has benefited China's economic growth and
comprehensive strength over the past two decades and has also
contributed to global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, China has been participating in the international
disarmament process and cut its armed forces by 500,000 people in
1997 following the reduction of one million people in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, China signed several dozen
international treaties, including the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty and the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Several generations of Chinese leaders have believed that the
people of the world and the increase of the forces of peace have
to be relied on to prevent wars.
</P>
<P>
Deng said in 1987 that if the forces for peace in the world
have grown and if the Third World countries get developed a new
world war can be avoided, and, if the Third World countries,
including China, have good development in the first half of the
next century and Europe has good development, the danger of war
can fundamentally be eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Blair to Go Back to School to Learn Internet Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said in Cambridge Monday that he was going back to school to
catch up with the computer skills of his wife Cherie and three
children.
</P>
<P>
Blair, in a speech launching a government policy study on how
to boost electronic commerce in Britain, told his audience,
"Here's my confession. In many ways I am the last person to be
making this call to action," Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
"To say the least, I am no expert. To be completely blunt and
honest about it, I watch my children and indeed Cherie surfing the
net and feel a mild, not to say profound, sense of humiliation."
</P>
<P>
Blair said that like many people of his generation, he rarely
used a computer and relied on his staff. "It's a big psychological
barrier to get over," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I've decided it's no use my giving lectures to everyone else,"
he said, announcing he would sign up for a basic computer skills
course.
</P>
<P>
On Monday he started out by ordering flowers for his wife
Cherie, a highly paid barrister, over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said Blair, who normally works with a pen and paper
sitting on a sofa rather than at a desk, had yet to acquire a
computer in his office. His course will probably last half a day.
</P>
<P>
Blair announced the appointment of Alex Allan, a top civil
servant who has just returned from a posting as Britain's High
Commissioner to Australia, as the government's "e-envoy" to boost
electronic commerce.

Opposing Hegemonism, Establishing Reasonable New International
Political and Economic Order
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s when the bi-polar global
system collapsed and the Cold War ended, the international
situation has moved toward relaxation and a multi-polar system has
taken shape.
</P>
<P>
As the largest developing country in the world, China has been
an important force for maintaining world peace and stability and
has played an active role in promoting and developing that system.
</P>
<P>
From the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence of the '50s to
Mao Zedong's "three-world" theory in the '70s, from the south-to-
south cooperation of the '80s to the all-round diplomacy of the '
90s, China has shared the same basic interests of the Third World,
and those countries are now faced with the same tasks of
maintaining national independence and developing the economy.
</P>
<P>
The primary foreign policy of New China has been to consolidate
unity and cooperation with developing countries, which have grown
to be a major force in opposing imperialism, hegemonism, and power
politics, and in maintaining world peace.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the Third World is a matter of prime importance of
our times, and Third World countries have become a major force to
oppose imperialism, hegemonism and power politics, and to maintain
world peace. China places great importance on relations with these
developing countries and supports them in their economic growth
and in their efforts to promote south-to-south cooperation and to
establish a new international political and economic order.  (

<P>
In the past several years, a new form of partnership among
large countries based on common interests, consultation on an
equal footing, seeking common ground while reserving differences,
and not targeting any third party has been established.
</P>
<P>
This new type of partnership has improved China's status on the
international stage and has played an indispensable role in
shaping trends in international democratization.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia decided to develop a strategic, cooperative
partnership oriented towards the 21st century in April 1996. Since
then, China decided to establish a long-term comprehensive
partnership with France, a constructive strategic partnership with
the United States, and a comprehensive partnership with Great
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China decided to establish a long-term stable
constructive partnership with oriented to the 21st century with
the European Union, and to develop a friendly and cooperative
partnership devoted to peace and development with Japan, when
President Jiang Zemin made a state visit to that country.
</P>
<P>
China has also established various partnerships with developing
countries.

The history of contemporary international relations has shown
that the time for a few large countries to control the destiny of
other countries has passed. At the turn of the century, anyone
intending to engage in power politics will end up getting punished.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang has pointed out that the world is by no means
at peace and that there have been new developments in hegemonism
and power politics.
</P>
<P>
He said it remains a difficult task getting peace-loving
governments and people in the world to maintain basic norms of
international relations, including the five principles of
coexistence -- mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each
other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful
coexistence -- and establishing a new international political and
economic order.
</P>
<P>
The new type of foreign diplomacy with Chinese characteristics

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Destroying Cross-Straits Relations, People's Daily Says (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
major newspaper, will carry an article "Lee Teng-hui Destroying
Cross-Straits Relations" that criticizes his "two-states" remark.
</P>
<P>
Developing cross-straits relations on the basis of the "one
China" policy and pushing for peaceful reunification is in the
interest of Taiwan compatriots and benefits the development of
China, it says. But Lee is afraid of seeing this because it does
not accord with his personal interests and whenever cross-Straits
relations are developing or have the possibility of developing,
Lee Teng-hui will put obstacles in the way and make trouble, the
article adds.
</P>
<P>
His "two-states" remark is only the most recent of his evil
performances and no one can deny that the tension in cross-Straits
relations over the past decade is Lee's fault.
</P>
<P>
The article provides a series of examples: in April 1993, the
first meeting between Wang Daohan and Koo Chen-fu was held in
Singapore, a historic step forward in cross-Straits relation. But,
in June, Lee began talking about joining the United Nations. On
January 31, 1995, President Jiang Zemin gave an important speech
with his eight-point proposal for cross-Straits relations, which
was warmly welcomed and stimulated cross-Straits exchanges. Then,
Lee went to the United States to spread his separatist remarks and
caused cross-Straits relations to deteriorate.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Destroying Cross-Straits Relations, People's Daily Says (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1998, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
resumed the high-level dialogue that had been suspended for three
years. ARATS' head Wang Daohan and SEF's head Koo Chen-fu reached
a four-point consensus during Koo's trip to Shanghai and Beijing
and decided to hold political, economic, and other dialogues. Wang
planned to visit Taiwan this autumn to complete the four-point
consensus. But, again, when people on both sides of the Straits
are optimistic about the development trend, Lee made his "two-
states" remark, destroying the foundation of exchanges and
dialogues and causing a setback in cross-relations.
</P>
<P>
Cross-straits relations have been guided by the "peaceful
reunification, one country, two systems" policy and have made
remarkable progress, but all this has been hindered by Lee Teng-
hui who put all kinds of obstacles in the path of establishing
direct postal, air, and shipping links and trade ties across the
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Lee's evil efforts are futile. By June of this year, Taiwanese
investment in 42,653 projects on the mainland was worth 42.8
billion U.S. dollars and the mainland is the main goal of
Taiwanese investment. In the first half of this year, over 1.23
million Taiwanese came to the mainland for business or tourism
purposes, a 19.52 percent increase from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The article says that Lee has underestimated the Chinese
government's and the Chinese people's decision to protect China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity and it emphasizes that Lee's
separatist attempts are doomed to failure.

BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's consumer price
index (CPI) in August rose to 128.0 compared with 127.5 in July,
according to a government house press release issued on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The CPI of food and beverages in August dropped 0.1 percent due
to the lower prices of pork, vegetable, egg, vegetable oil and
aqua-animals.
</P>
<P>
The CPI of other goods rose 0.7 percent because of the higher
prices of water, electricity, petrol and alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
The CPI dropped 1.1 percent last month compared with a year
earlier. The average CPI in the first three months of this year
rose 0.5 percent compared with the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Score Biggest Rise in Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Retail sales jumped
1.2 percent in August as consumers continued their buying spree,
the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The retail sales gain in August, the biggest rise in six
months, followed a revised 1 percent July increase.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of the total economy, remains at high levels. Analysts
said that it may raise new concerns that the Federal Reserve will
have to do more in terms of boosting interest rates to slow
economic growth to a more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
Many economists have been looking for consumer spending to
slow, based on the fact that the Fed has already boosted
short-term interest rates by one-half percentage point this summer
and long-term rates, including mortgage rates, have risen even
more this year.
</P>
<P>
But the consumer sector is being supported by the lowest
unemployment rate in nearly three decades, a 4.2 percent level
that has given more workers cash to spend.
</P>
<P>
Last month's 1.2 percent jump in retail sales was the biggest
one-month gain since a 1.7 percent surge in February.
</P>
<P>
It was led by a 2.5 percent rise in auto sales, marking the
second strong month for auto dealers. Car and truck sales had
risen an even larger 2.9 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The strength in consumer spending last month was widespread
among all retail groups. Excluding the volatile auto sector,
retail sales increased 0.7 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Sales at furniture and home furnishing stores rose 0.7 percent
in August, a rebound from a 0.3 percent decline in July.
</P>
<P>
Sales at apparel and accessory stores were up 1.3 percent last
month following a 0.9 percent drop in July. Hardware and building
supply stores enjoyed a 1.1 percent rise in sales while general
merchandise stores saw sales increase by 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline sales picked up 2.1 percent. Sales at restaurants and
bars edged up a small 0.1 percent while drug stores saw a 0.9
percent sales increase.

<P>
MADRID, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes said Tuesday that he has informed the Chilean government
of Spain's refusal to go to international arbitration in the case
against former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
In an answering letter to his Chilean counterpart Juan Gabriel
Valdes, Matutes stressed Spain's stand that the Pinochet case is a
judicial affair, in which the government has no right to interfere.
</P>
<P>
Valdes wrote to Matutes on September 3, inviting the Spanish
government to "immediately start" formal negotiations so that the
Pinochet case could be solved under international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
In his reply, Matutes confirmed the government's obligation to
accept Chile's request for negotiation in line with international
practice, but stressed "it is negotiation, not arbitration."
</P>
<P>
Although raising no suggestion over the Pinochet case, Matutes
said, the Spanish government has all along made great effort to
maintain its friendly relations with Chile and other Latin
American countries.

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Guerrilla Leader Released From Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Johnny Adair, a pro-British
guerrilla commander during the Northern Irish conflict, was
released early from prison Tuesday under the Good Friday peace
accord signed in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
Adair, 34, was the former leader of the outlawed loyalist
paramilitary group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), in the
Shankill area of west Belfast, and one of the six-man ruling
council of the Ulster Defense Association.
</P>
<P>
Adair was arrested on charges of directing guerrilla activities.
He has served five years of a 16-year jail term in Maze prison.
</P>
<P>
He was the latest of 300 pro-British Protestant and republican
Roman Catholic prisoners to walk free under a controversial early
release scheme.
</P>
<P>
The early release scheme is part of the Good Friday peace
accord, the result of political talks following declaration of
cease-fire by rival extremist groups, who were engaged in violent
campaigns over the future of British rule.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, on a pre-release leave from Maze prison,
Adair was shot at a concert in Botanic Gardens in Belfast. He
blamed the republicans for the attack.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China, NZ Share Extensive, Significant Common Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
President Jiang Zemin said Tuesday China and New Zealand should
broaden common ground, enhance mutually beneficial cooperation and
work for a brighter future in their relations at the cross of the
centuries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "Though different in national conditions,
historical background and cultural tradition, China and New
Zealand share extensive and significant common interests."
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here Tuesday afternoon following a short
visit in Wellington, made the remarks at a dinner given in his
honor by New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two nations have grown steadily since
the establishment of the diplomatic relations 27 years ago, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of our two countries have frequently exchanged visits
and had meetings with each other," Jiang said, adding Shipley's
successful visit to China last July played a positive role in
promoting bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Specially mentioning time-honored bilateral friendship, Jiang
said that in the 1920s, Rewi Alley, a famous writer, educator and
social activist of New Zealand, came and worked in China for over
half a century.
</P>
<P>
Citing Alley as a symbol of China-New Zealand friendship, Jiang
noted that Alley made important contributions to China's
revolution and development.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are striving for economic development and better
livelihood for their people, Jiang said, adding, "We are both
actively expanding friendly relations and cooperation with other
countries in the world."
</P>
<P>
Both countries wish to see continued peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific and strengthened regional economic and technological
cooperation in a bid to promote common development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "With strength in different fields, our two
economies are highly complementary. As China gives priority to the
development of agriculture, energy and environmental protection,
it wishes to learn from New Zealand which has an edge in these
fields."
</P>
<P>
There will be a long-term demand for wool, timber, paper pulp
and dairy products in the Chinese market, products that New
Zealand abounds in, Jiang said, adding "there is a good foundation
and prospects for expanded exchanges and cooperation between China
and New Zealand in various fields."
</P>
<P>
Describing the South Pacific region where New Zealand is
situated as an important part of the Asia-Pacific, Jiang said that
given its geographical location and rich natural resources, it
promises tremendous potentials for development.
</P>
<P>
Over the recent years, Jiang said, South Pacific countries have
accelerated their economic development and strengthened
cooperation, and thereby scoring remarkable achievements in the
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the South Pacific Forum is playing a bigger
role in regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
As a major country in the South Pacific, Jiang went on to say,
New Zealand has significant influence in this region, and for
years, it has made vigorous efforts to promote regional peace and
development and has enhanced regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We in China appreciate all these," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
China has all along attached importance to developing friendly
relations and cooperation with South Pacific countries, Jiang said,
adding this relationship has made significant progress owing to
joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
"At the dawn of the new century, we should value the importance
of our bilateral relations from a strategic height and try to find
and expand converging points of our common interests," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that both sides should redouble efforts to tap the
potential and expand bilateral exchanges and cooperation in the
economic, trade, scientific and technological, cultural and other
fields on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"We should view and address our differences and disagreements
in the spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while
shelving differences so as to promote a steady and sound
development of bilateral ties," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed, "I am confident that as long as the two sides
make concerted efforts and take a broad and long-term view, our
friendly relations and cooperation will register new development
in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
At the dinner, Shipley described Jiang's ongoing visit as "a
new and historic occasion in the relationship" between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
"As an independently-minded global trade, we look to build
strong relations with countries that matter to us," she said,
adding "China most certainly matters."
</P>
<P>
She said, "Through such groupings as APEC and, we hope soon,
the World Trade Organization, New Zealand and China are partners
in the pursuit of development, stability and growth."
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand-China relationship is established on firm
foundations - including New Zealand's commitment to a "One China"
policy, she said.
</P>
<P>
She specially mentioned one New Zealander, Rewi Alley, who made
an outstanding contribution to the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Rewi Alley is well remembered in China, she said, adding how
happy he would have been, to see the first Chinese president visit
his hometown.

<HEADLINE> Officials Urged to Study Theory on Socialist Market Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of the ruling
Communist Party of China (CPC) has called on the country's leading
officials to study the theory about the socialist market economy
as well as new contradictions and problems in the course of
developing the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, State Vice-President and member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,
made the call during his inspection of northwest China's Gansu
Province from September 8-14.
</P>
<P>
While in Gansu, Hu inspected some key projects designed to help
poor areas and solve water shortage, and a number of large State-
owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the present rural economy, Hu said that the rural
leading officials must further emancipate their mind and take
active measures to readjust the rural economic structure, promote
farm production through science and education, and ensure the
steady growth of the rural economy and the farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the State-owned enterprises, the Chinese
leader stressed that the leadership at all levels must be improved
in promoting the reform of the State-owned businesses. All the
leading officials should be good at combining the general
guidelines of the central government with the actual situation of
the businesses in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He also visited Lanzhou University and the Lanzhou Branch of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, urging the teachers, scientists
and technicians to make greater contributions to the economic and
social development of the western region.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that the socialist market economy is new in the
history of mankind. China has experience to deal with inflation,
but has no experience to handle the issue of deflation, He said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, leading officials at all levels must step up their
study on the theory of socialist market economy and the objective
laws of the economy, he urged.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader is confident of the future development of
the underdeveloped areas like Gansu.
</P>
<P>
While the international situation is going complicated and
profound changes and China's reform has entered a crucial period,
it is of great importance to maintain stability, Hu stressed.

<HEADLINE> Britain's August Inflation Sinks to 36-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- British inflation rate fell to
1.1 percent in August, the lowest since July 1963, the Office for
National Statistics (ONS) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Underlying inflation, or RPIX, fell to 2.1 percent, the lowest
rate since October 1994, from 2.2 percent in July, said the ONS.
</P>
<P>
The fall comes less than a week after the Bank of England
raised British interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to 5.25
percent, even though RPIX was comfortably below the government's 2.
5 percent target.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the main downward effects on inflation in August
were from seasonal food, particularly potatoes, and to a lesser
extent from non-seasonal food. There was also a small downward
effect from clothing and footwear.
</P>
<P>
It added that the largest offsetting upward effect came from
motoring costs. Petrol prices rose strongly as a result of higher
crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Most economists expected this rise in oil prices will put a
floor under inflation in coming months.
</P>
<P>
Goods inflation was particularly benign in August, sinking to 0.
5 percent, its lowest since records began in 1988.

The accident occurred when a Taiwan MD-11 airliner flipped
upside down as it was landing in a tropical storm at Hong Kong
international airport on August 22. Three people were killed and
more than 200 injured in the accident.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Posts Wider to Overseas Operators (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China will introduce even
more overseas funds, technology and expertise into its postal
services so as to improve the competitiveness of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Postmaster General Liu Liqing told a press conference at the
ongoing 22nd Universal Postal Congress here today that China is to
seal two agreements on joint ventures in the express mail service

</P>
<P>
Overseas operators now control 55 percent of China's EMS market.
They are still expanding the market shares in the country.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that in order to maintain and expand the market
position of the Chinese EMS, the State Postal Bureau (SPB) has
planned to join hands with large international operators to
improve competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He said that China posts will also introduce overseas expertise
in new areas of postal services, including E-commerce.
</P>
<P>
During the 22nd Universal Postal Congress in Beijing, the SPB
signed an agreement with the Canadian post office on developing E-
commerce service. A similar agreement with Belgium is under
discussion now.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that China will focus on developing modernized postal
network and providing news services on the network in terms of
cooperation with foreign postal operators and administrations.
</P>

China and France have reaffirmed recently that they will carry
out an agreement on cooperation of postal aviation. The French
post office will use its management expertise to help turn the

</P>
<P>
Noting that the development of postal infrastructure is
unbalanced among different areas of the country, he said that
China will continue to import overseas technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The SPB placed an order of 30 million U.S. dollars worth of
postal equipment with an German company recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to turn China's postal services into a "
vigorous, efficient, competitive and profitable" business, the SPB
will continue to strengthen the profitable sectors of its
operations.
</P>
<P>
One of the sectors is savings deposit at post office. Liu said
here today that the State Council and the central bank have
already approved the establishment of a savings bank under the
post office.
</P>
<P>
An SPB official said that the savings bank will have a much
smaller scope of operation than Chinese commercial banks. It will
not have the right to issue loans. However, it may be allowed to
involve in insurance and other special operations.
</P>
<P>
Postal savings now account for over 47 percent of the total
revenue of the post office in China. By the end of 1998, the net
balance of savings deposits at the post office reached 306.5
billion yuan, accounting for six percent of the country's total
savings deposits.

following the third apartment building bombing in Russia in nine
days.

<HEADLINE> Students Clash With Police in Indonesia's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Students clashed with police
in front of Indonesian Christian University (UKI) in Jakarta,
capital of Indonesia Tuesday, and two vehicles were burned.
</P>
<P>
The clashes occurred when hundreds of students were marching
towards the Parliament building in protest against a Security Act
Law Plan which is being discussed by parliament.
</P>
<P>
The law would allow the country's president to declare a state
of danger at no clear limitation.
</P>
<P>
The law plan has been widely opposed because it would give the
president too much authority in taking security measures which
many say may lead to dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
The clashes started when police tried to blockade the students'
rally in front of UKI.
</P>
<P>
About 500 students managed to skip out of the campus, but they
were unable to continue the rally due to the tighter blockade set
up some 100 meters from the campus gate.
</P>
<P>
Tension mounted as students and police officers started
throwing stones at each other, although no major casualties were
reported. The students also threw Molotov cocktails at the police.
</P>
<P>
A military jeep and a police jeep trapped during the clashes
were burned by angry Students and local residents.

<P>
NPC Chairman Meets Foreign Guests
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress, met here today with A.M. Gleeson, chief justice
of Australian High Court.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of Sino-Australian relations, saying both
countries are in the Asia-Pacific region, and thus enjoy a broad
cooperative sphere. He said the Australian High Court and China's
Supreme People's Court (SPC) have maintained sound cooperative
relations, expressing the hope that Gleeson's current visit would
further promote cooperation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting today with Japan's Nippon Electric Co., Ltd. (NEC)
chief advisor Tadahiro Sekimoto, Li Peng expressed hope that NEC
would expand cooperation with the Chinese, saying that the
introduction of advanced technology will help.
</P>
<P>
He said he deeply appreciates Sekimoto's contribution to
bilateral ties and telecommunications cooperation between the two
countries since the 1970s, and hoped he would continue his efforts
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
To mark his outstanding contribution, the Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) has
decided to grant Sekimoto the honorary title of "people's
friendship envoy."
</P>
<P>
Li Peng also met here today with an Albanian People's Assembly
(APA) delegation led by Sabri Godo, chairman of the assembly's
Commission of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li said China and Albania enjoy traditional friendship and
growth of bilateral ties was "generally smooth".
</P>

China respects the development path chosen by Albania, he said,
adding that the increased contacts between the NPC and APA
deepened bilateral ties. He hoped the guests could better
understand China, which would promote better understanding between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Banks Hike Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 14 (Xinhua) (C Two Zimbabwean major banks,
the First Banking Corporation and the Commercial Bank have
announced increases in their minimum yearly lending rates by three
percent to 53.75 percent and 52. 5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In separate statements on Tuesday, the banks said the increases
had been caused by changes in market conditions and an upward
trend in treasury bill rates.
</P>
<P>
The commercial bank also announced that its deposit rates would
be revised upwards.
</P>
<P>
Other leading financial institution, Standard Chartered and
Stanbic recently hiked their lending rates by three percent to
52.5 percent and 51 percent per annum respectively in response to
the impact of monetary policy on market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the increases were not surprising since all
major commercial banks would increase rates to cushion themselves
against inflation.
</P>
<P>
The country's year-on-year inflation by August had risen 5.3
percentage point to an unprecedented level of 68.8 percent from
July's 63.5 percent further compounding fears that the
International Monetary Fund's 30 percent target before the end of
the year would not be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Local economists believe that inflation was expected to reach
70 percent next month before it starts to come down to at least
40 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua)-- Wu Jichuan, the head of China'
s Ministry of Information Industry (MII), told a news conference
here today that the information industry has had rapid and healthy
growth in the past eight months thanks to improved macro-
management of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that both telecommunications and the postal service
have maintained growth since last year and MII statistics show the
telecommunications industry putting 55.3 billion yuan into fixed
assets by the end of August and increasing long distance phone
circuits by 79,000 million lines.
</P>
<P>
There are now 100 million fixed telephone customers, an
increase of 14.06 million from last year and Wu attributes this to
adjusted telecommunication fees this year and cut in telephone
installation fees.
</P>
<P>
The number of mobile phone users has risen by 10.9 million this
year to 36.19 million, according to the ministry and that business
accounts for almost 50 percent of the total phone business. China
Telecom, China Unicom, and China Jitong Corp. have opened internet
protocol (IP) telephone services on a trial base in 14 cities.
</P>
<P>
The country's electronics industry has attracted 8.3 billion
yuan worth of investment in the past eight months and given
priority to computer production, cable communications, and
integrated circuit production, Wu said. In that time, the country
produced 23.62 million telephone switchboard lines and 9.63
million mobile phones, and the industry had exports worth 64.33
billion US dollars, up 12.7 percent from last year.

Bangladesh if the government failed to make substantive progress
in the pace of institutional reforms and in addressing the
country's structural problems.
</P>
<P>
The donors expressed concern at the government's eviction of
slum dwellers and sex workers earlier this year without ensuring
their rehabilitation, which they said might raise questions among
the donors about the human rights issue in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The flow of poverty alleviation fund might be affected if the
evicted slum dwellers and sex workers were not rehabilitated, they
observed.
</P>
<P>
World Bank country director Frederick T. Temple said although
the country's economic growth had been better than expected, the
government failed to make much headway with the structural reforms
necessary to unlock the private sector's economic potential.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern over the time-consuming and expensive
meeting like this and said the reform agenda should be as specific
as possible in addressing the concern. "Such meetings should only
be held if they are helpful in increasing our mutual understanding
of each others' concern and, perhaps, more importantly, in
furthering the reform agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
Resident representative of the International Monetary Fund
Ronald Hick suggested the government accelerate the reform in the
financial sector, saying that the problem in the financial sector
of the country was deep-rooted and structural reforms were
required to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
A document presented by the donors at the meeting recommended
good governance, sustainable political leadership, checking
corruption, ensuring human rights and accelerating reform programs
in the financial sector as the priority areas to achieve a stable
macro-economic growth in the country.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the donors' concern, Finance Minister Shah A.M.S.
Kibria, who is also chairman of the Bangladesh Development Forum,
said the government had been continuing its effort to ensure basic
human rights of all citizens, accusing the opposition parties of
trying to foil the government's development activities by
enforcing strikes and creating anarchy.
</P>
<P>
A handout of the Press Information Department said the finance
minister expressed satisfaction at the review meeting and hoped
that views expressed by donor representatives would help expedite
development programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
Detailed discussions were held on governance and institutional
issues, financial sector reform and micro-credit, education,
health, nutrition, HIV/AIDS, arsenic, food security, and project
implementation, the handout said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 23 donor countries and agencies attended the
mid-term review meeting, which took place nearly six months after
the "Bangladesh Development Forum Meeting" was held in Paris in
April this year.

<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Customs revenues
amounted to 103.69 billion yuan (12.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the
first eight months of this year, an all-time high, according to
the General Administration of Customs.
</P>

Of that amount, 2.13 billion yuan went to tax refunds and 101.
56 billion yuan to state coffers, a 106 percent increase from the

From January to July, Customs officers dealt with more than 7,
500 cases of smuggling and seized 3.747 billion yuan worth of

<HEADLINE> Russia Threatens to Pull Peace-keepers From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian defense
official repeated the threat Tuesday to withdraw its peace-keepers
from Kosovo if the province's tendency of secession from
Yugoslavia becomes irreversible.
</P>
<P>
"If the tendency for Kosovo's secession from Yugoslavia
becomes irreversible and the U.N. Security Council's resolution on
Kosovo is not implemented, the Federation Council (upper house of
parliament) may raise the question of whether our contingent's
further stay in the region is expedient," said Colonel General
Leonid Ivashov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry's Department
for International Military Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. resolution on Kosovo, with the exception
of the provision on the deployment of a peacekeeping contingent,
is not being implemented, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The provision on ensuring the security of all ethnic groups in
Kosovo, primarily of the non-Albanian population, is not being
fulfilled at all, Ivashov said, adding that "80 percent of the
Serbs living in Kosovo have become refugees."
</P>
<P>
He said that no decision on the return of Yugoslav security
forces to Kosovo has been taken to this day.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the borders of Kosovo remain open and Albanians
who did not live in Kosovo before, easily cross into the region.
Weapons and drugs also keep coming into Kosovo through the open
borders," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said that the Kosovo Liberation Army would not be
disarmed by the set date, September 19. The KLA has surrendered to
KFOR just about 4,000 mostly outdated pieces of firearms, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The KLA is evolving into a political force and is replacing
the local government in an attempt to govern the situation in
Kosovo," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada has followed the
European Union and the United States in suspending military sales
to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper Tuesday quoted Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy as announcing an indefinite ban on the
sales on his trip to Fiji Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ban involves export permits valued at more than 300 million
Canadian dollars (about 204 million U.S. dollars) in terms of fire-
control radar, military aircraft and components, and thermal-
imaging equipment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The ban came hours after the EU announced a suspension of four
months in all arms sales to Indonesia amid reports of violence in
East Timor since the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The United States took a similar move last Thursday, saying it
was breaking off military cooperation with Indonesia and
suspending military sales.

<P>
MOGADISHU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting once again
broke out Monday afternoon between the forces of Hussein Mohamed
Aidid and the combined militiamen of the Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA) and the Digil Salvation Army (DSA) for control of Qoryoley
town in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses contacted before the telephone lines
of the town went off the air Monday afternoon, over one hundred
infantry militiamen of the RRA and DSA forces launched the attack
from the Sinkah area, just a few kilometers north of the town,
while eight battle wagons from Hussein Aidid's side were used in
counterattacking.
</P>
<P>
There are no official casualty figures available. However,
sources from the town said at least nine people were killed and
more than a dozen others were wounded. Though both sides have
claimed victory, witnesses said none of them got the upper hand
and the shooting subsided as darkness befell last night.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families have fled the town to the neighboring
villages and towns. A businessman in Farhaneh village, about eight
kilometers East of Qoryoley town, said he believed that no single
civilian still remained in the town.
</P>
<P>
According to latest reports, the town of Qoryoley is calm
Tuesday, but the tension is still growing as the two sides
continue to strengthen their defensive positions outside the town
with Hussein Aidid's men still controlling the inner side of the
town.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes for Five Golds in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEINAN, SHAANXI, China, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China is
aiming for five weightlifting gold medals in the 2000 Olympic
Games, a top weightlifting official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have set the goal of five golds in the Olympics as our
strongwomen enjoy clear upperhands in the world," said Qian
Guangjian, secretary general of the Chinese Weightlifting
Association.
</P>
<P>
China will dispatch eight strongmen and four strongwomen for
the Sydney Olympics as the women weightlifting will make its debut
in the biggest sport gala in the world with a total of 15 golds at
stake, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
However, the competition rules only grant China four berths in
the seven categories of the women's weightlifting in the coming
Olympics, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The three-day women's competitions in the fourth Chinese City
Games were concluded here on Tuesday with 21 strongwomen breaking
17 world records 44 times.
</P>
<P>
Li Xuejiu jerked up a new national record in the 58kg class in
the women's weightlifting whereas all but one Chinese records
surpass the world marks.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Diao Weiwei, Liu Haixia and Ding Meiyuan, equalized
three best marks in the world in the 63kg, 69kg and 75kg
categories.
</P>
<P>
The City Games also witnesses a promosing environment with a
string of young strongwomen as 12 of the top three finishers in
the seven categories are under the age of eighteeen, with 58kg
runner-up Wang Li only aged at 14.
</P>
<P>
However, concerned authorities are aware of the fact that only
one national record was broken despite 17 world marks were
surpassed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Chinese strongwomen still lack competitive
capabilities in certain categories as 12 competitors failed to
surpass a single world mark in the 53kg, whereas the two-lift
national total in the 75-kg class is shy of the world mark by 2.5
kgs.

<HEADLINE> More than Half Million Tanzanians in Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 600,000
people in North Tanzania's Shinyanga Region are facing an acute
food shortage caused by a prolonged drought and lack of food
storage.
</P>
<P>
The rainfall was below expected levels between January and
August this year, leading to a deficit of 158,000 tons of grain in
the region, Shinyanga Regional Commissioner Tumainiel Kiwelu was
quoted as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 2.5 million residents in Shinyanga Region need
553,000 tons of grain in the next twelve months, but the food
available at present amounts to only 395,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"This year, the average rainfall was just 500 millimeters. This
is a serious blow to farmers as the maize crop requires rain of
between 700 to 800 millimeters to flourish," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is not easy for the government to feed the whole
population with its grain stocks and therefore measures need to be
taken to redress the situation.
</P>
<P>
As a way of curbing the food shortage, the regional

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Expected To Attain Five Pct GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is expected to
achieve a higher growth rate of 5 percent in the current fiscal if
weather conditions remain favorable and the agricultural sector
performs better, Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in a report
available here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth during 2000 is projected
as 5 percent. The agricultural sector is anticipated to maintain
the average growth rate of recent years provided weather condition
remains favorable," the Manila-based bank said in its Asian
Development Outlook Update.
</P>
<P>
The report said the country's 1998-99 GDP was revised to grow
at 4.8 percent after a bumper harvest of its winter paddy. A
previous estimate was around 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the country's food grain production might reach
21.4 million tons in 1998-99 as against 20.7 million tons in the
previous year, due to a recovery drive launched by the government.
</P>
<P>
It said that although the agricultural sector has apparently
overcome the impact of the floods, manufacturing sector growth is
estimated to have slipped to 2.8 percent from 9.2 percent of the
preceding year.
</P>
<P>
Despite a large inflow of external assistance, the foreign
exchange reserves declined to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars at the end
of 1999 from 1.7 billion U.S. dollars in the corresponding period
last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the country's budget deficit also rose to 5.3 percent
of GDP compared with 4.2 percent of GDP in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The deficit has increased due to a flood-induced fall in
revenues and an increase in public expenditure, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report forecast the country's inflation at 8 percent in the
current fiscal year from an average of 9 percent in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The report said "the greatest challenge facing the government
is to revive economic and institutional reforms to reduce
pervasive poverty."
</P>
<P>
The bank said Bangladesh could only overcome the challenge
through prudent macroeconomics management and reforms in financial
and administrative sector, and private sector development.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urged to Extend Stock Market Trading Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A former top official of the
board of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) Tuesday called on the
government to reconsider the proposal of the present PSE board to
extend the trading hours from 9:00 to 12:00 a.m. up to 3:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
In his private capacity as a legitimate broker, Harry Liu,
former chairman of the PSE board, said that there is a need to try
this system in order to give ample time for investors to think and
digest what shares of stocks to buy on the trading floors.
</P>
<P>
His reaction was aired after the Securities and Exchange
czttcocrcgvin
Commission (SEC) decided to reject the proposal of extending the
PSE trading hours, saying it will only call for more manipulations
in the equities market.
</P>
<P>
Liu discounted accusations that extension of the trading hours
will elicit more manipulations of stock prices while trading is
going on.
</P>
<P>
He said this will not happen because the PSE has its own rules
and regulations to follow in imposing sanctions against those
brokers who will engage in this illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Philippines is the only country in Asia that
limits its trading hours from 9:00 to 12:00 a.m. The neighboring
stock exchanges have made it a policy to trade well into the
afternoon hours, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He believed that approval by the SEC of the PSE board proposal
will mean more investments in the equities market.
</P>
<P>
He said that he already tried the same move when he was still
the PSE board chair but it was rejected by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he called on the PSE board to be persistent
in discussing the positive points that it could give to the
equities market once the proposal is considered by the SEC.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Promotes Telecom in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A new rural telephone service
will soon be introduced by the Nigerian government, a Nigerian
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian quoted Nigerian Minister of State for
Communication Alhaji Elewi as saying in the country's western Oyo
State at the weekend that arrangements have been concluded for the
take-off of the new scheme called " wireless/cordless local loop"
.
</P>
<P>
He said the rural telephone service, when introduced, would be
made affordable to enable rural dwellers to enjoy telephone
services in line with the present government's policy not to make
the service the exclusive right of the rich.
</P>
<P>
Elewi reiterated government's determination to make telephone
services accessible to all Nigerians at affordable cost.
</P>
<P>
While explaining the scheme's mode of operation, the minister
said like its name "wireless," the rural telephone would be
operated without telecommunications wire, yet it would be
affordable and reliable.
</P>
<P>
In line with the new policy, the minister said three new
national telephone companies would be introduced to compete with
the Nigeria Telecommunications Limited (NITEL).
</P>
<P>
He said the monopoly being enjoyed by NITEL is affecting the
people who are being exploited.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed the belief that with the new three
national carriers and NITEL, people will get better services.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Concludes Visit to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Abdullah Bin
Hussein left here Tuesday for Amman, winding up his landmark visit
to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The visit by King Abdullah, who is the first Hashemite monarch
to visit Lebanon in almost three-and-a-half decades, came
following an invitation by Lebanese President Emile Lahoud during
his visit to Jordan in May.
</P>
<P>
The king arrived here on Monday accompanied by Prime Minister
Abdel Raouf al-Rarabdeh, Speaker of House of Representatives Abdul
Hadi Al Majali, Speaker of the Senate Zeid Rifai and Foreign
Minister Abdel-Ilah al-Khatib.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay, the king held talks with Lahoud,
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Salim Hoss on
bilateral ties and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the king's visit opened new horizon in
Lebanese-Jordanian relations.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan and Lebanon cooled after Jordanian late
King Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. Lebanon
and its main power broker Syria have territorial dispute with the
Jewish state, which is occupying Syrian Golan Heights and a border
strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been following the foreign policy of Syria, which
is ostensibly stationing 350,000 troops in Lebanon to help
maintain its post-civil war stability.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan and Lebanon has been improving, especially
after Syrian President Haffez Assad attended the Hussein's funeral
in February and Abdullah made a visit to Damascus in April.

</P>
<P>
-- Senior government representatives have reportedly asked
American Jewish groups to press Walt Disney Co. not to capitulate
to Arab pressure to remove an exhibit showing Jerusalem as
Israel's capital at Disney's Epcot Center in Florida. Various Arab

political" and meant to solve specific problems in order to
strengthen Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Six years after the signing of the landmark Oslo peace
accords, negotiations on permanent settlement started Monday

<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy said at the opening ceremony that
Israel would not return to the 1967 borders, but Chief Palestinian

independent state on all the Gaza Strip and West Bank, with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UPU Head Sees Beijing Congress as Century's Most Important Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The 22nd Universal Postal
Congress (UPC) being held in Beijing is the most important event
of the world's postal sector in this century, Director of the
International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) Thomas
Leavey said here today.
</P>
<P>
The congress, scheduled for conclusion on Wednesday, has
adopted the Beijing Postal Strategy for postal services all over
the world for the next five years following discussions on the
most pressing issues facing the postal sector, Leavey told a press
conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Postal Strategy calls on postal administrations and
operators around the world to utilize advanced electronic
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Leavey said that though electronic alternatives pose a great
challenge to traditional postal business, posts can turn the
information technology into its own advantage by exploiting such
new areas as e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
"Those who think we are a dying industry should read the
Beijing Postal Strategy," he said, noting that posts will always
be a key element of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Beijing congress has set many "first" in
the history of the UPU. It is the most attended meeting, with more
than 2,300 representatives from 183 countries and 33 international
organizations participating.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the 125-year history of the UPU, the
Beijing congress decided to put the right to universal postal
services into the Acts of the UPU.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing congress attracted, also for the first time,
representatives from posts-related sectors such as private
operators, non-government organizations, manufacturers of postal
equipment and information technology industries to participate.
</P>
<P>
Liu Liqing, postmaster general of the State Postal Bureau, said
that the Beijing congress is a "milestone" in the history of UPU.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China will lead the reform and development of the
world postal sector in the next five years by assuming the
chairmanship of the UPU Council of Administration.
</P>
<P>
"We will take into consideration the interests of all countries
and try our best to do a good job," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Closer China-New Zealand Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Tuesday that it is of great importance to
strengthen the relations between China and New Zealand in the new
international and regional situation.
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon hosted in his honor by Governor-General of New
Zealand Michael Boys, Jiang Zemin said relations between China and
New Zealand have shown a good momentum of all-round development
with increasingly frequent exchanges of high-level visits, steady
growth of economic relations and trade and constantly broadened
scope of cooperation in recent years.
</P>
<P>
People-to-people contacts have become closer with the formal
launching of a tourist program that encourages Chinese citizens to
travel to New Zealand as tourists, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have stepped up dialogue and cooperation on major
international and regional issues, Jiang said, expressing China's
profound appreciation over the great contribution made by Governor-
General Michael Boys to the development of the relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin said he and Prime Minister of New Zealand Jenny
Shipley reached wide consensus on bilateral ties and international
issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
"We both agreed that our two countries should look into the
future, view and approach bilateral relations in a strategic
perspective and work together to establish a 21st-century-oriented,
all-round cooperative relationship of long-term stability and
sound development," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said New Zealand is dedicated to developing
exchanges and cooperation with Asia and has played a positive role
in maintaining peace in the world at large and the Asia-Pacific in
particular and promoting economic cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also expressed appreciation and
congratulations to New Zealand on the successful convocation of
the 7th informal meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
Michael Boys said the visit by President Jiang Zemin to New
Zealand, the first ever paid by a Chinese head of state, is a
historic one which is of great significance to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Boys said the cooperative relationship between New Zealand and
China dates back to many years ago, and now with modern
transportation and technology, China is becoming an ever-closer
neighbor, and an immensely important one to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
He said the current visit by the Chinese president offered an
unparalleled opportunity of further developing the relationship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Business and trading links are of the greatest
importance, but they must be complemented by personal contacts of
other kinds, such as through educational exchanges and tourism. It
is my profound hope that there will be strong growth in these most
valuable areas."

XI'AN, China, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The track and field
competitions started here on Tuesday without any big results in
the fourth Chinese City Games.
</P>
<P>
Yin Lili, a 20-year-old runner coached by famous Ma Junren,
clocked 32:54.61 to take the women's 10,000m title on behalf of
the Xi'an delegation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to win the gold medal no matter whom I represent
because I have displayed my capability," said Yin, who was coached
by Ma Junren for several years and borrowed by the hosts prior to
the Games.
</P>
<P>
The men's 10,000m title was taken by Gong Ke in 29:24.51.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Shang Xiutang, secretary general of the Chinese
Athletics Association, predicted "good results from the women's 1,

basis in accordance with the International Monetary Fund's Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and are referred to as the
Analytical Accounts of the Central Bank under SDDS.

dollars (83.98 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The monetary base, comprising certificates of indebtedness and

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Reluctant to Shoulder Bulk of ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Defense Minister Dupe
Adelaja expressed her country's reluctance to shoulder the bulk of
the West African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) and said pacts will
be signed on quota for each members' contributions.
</P>
<P>
Adelaja made these remarks in capital Abuja on Monday in
meeting with her Togolese counterpart Tijani Assani, the local
newspaper Vanguard reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said that Nigeria and Togo would soon sign a defense pact
and an arrangement was being worked out to ensure that not only
Nigeria would continue to shoulder the responsibility of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is contributing 80 percent of the ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
Adelaja explained that the pacts to be signed with Togo and
other West African countries were designed to ensure that "one
person's problem is the problem of the others and you cannot do
that except there is an agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian official noted that the pacts being proposed with
other countries in the sub-region would bring about a quota system
on the number of ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
"If it is eventually signed, we can rely on one another if
there is crisis within the sub-region," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, she added, there are ECOMOG troops, but it seems
as if Nigeria is the only one in charge.
</P>
<P>
Adelaja noted that "when we have this type of agreement, then
you can have proper contribution from other countries."

<HEADLINE> Howard: E.Timor Operation Could Result in Casualties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard Tuesday warned that the East Timor peacekeeping
operation would be dangerous and could result in casualties.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a danger. There could be casualties and the
Australian public should understand that," he told ABC television.
"It is a serious, dangerous operation."
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is they (the peacekeeping force) will be given
adequate legal authority to defend themselves and to take whatever
action is necessary to implement their mandate," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the deployment timing still depends on the outcome of
the U.N. Security Council meeting in New York which could take
another day or two. Troops would be ready to move 24-48 hours
after that.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that I will allow Australian forces to be
exposed to an unreasonable level of risk," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the peacekeeping force would need to establish some
kind of working relationship with the Indonesian military as there
would be some initial contact between the U.N. forces and the
Indonesians.

<HEADLINE> Pak Fails to Hand Over Indian Soldiers Due to Disagreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday failed to
hand over two Indian soldiers captured last month as planned to
the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) due to a
disagreement on the way of transfer.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman Rafiq Altaf, addressing a
press briefing here, said Pakistan wanted to hand over the
captives under the glare of media to refrain India from any
anti-Pakistan propaganda.
</P>
<P>
"We want the journalists to witness that they are safe, sound,
in good health and good shape," he said.
</P>
<P>
India, however, insisted that the handover be done quietly and
without the presence of journalists, accusing Pakistan of
utilizing the soldiers for propaganda.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC could not receive the two Indian soldiers as
scheduled, because the international organization's such
activities should be done with the consent of both parties
concerned, Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
He rejected India's accusation, saying that Pakistan offered to
release the soldiers immediately after capturing them but India
refused to receive them because it wanted to deny its attack on
Pakistan's post.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan has to be careful because India had used
soldiers and dead bodies that Pakistan handed over to it to carry
out anti-Pakistan propaganda.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistan, the two soldiers were captured in an
attack on Pakistani post in Shyok-Turtok sector across the Line of
Control by Indian troops late August.
</P>
<P>
India had denied such an attack and till only one day ago did
it agreed to the repatriation of its two soldiers through the
ICRC, said Altaf.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The president of Total-Fina oil group Thierry Desmarest has
beat his rival, president of Elf-Aquitaine Philippe Jaffre, by
making the latter accept a merger between the two oil and chemical
giants. The consumers will not necessarily benefit from the merger.
The logic of merger is engulfing all the big enterprises and one
has to ask: "Who is the next?"
</P>
<P>
-- Nearly 200 people have been killed since August 31 in the
bombing attacks in Moscow. So far it is not known whether the
attacks were made by the Chechen rebels seeking revenge, or mere
provocation against the government, or a part of the dark game of
some people on top of the Russian hierarchy who want to take
control of power.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Four days after an explosion killed 93 people in the suburb
of Moscow, a new attack killed 73 people on Monday in the Russian
metropolis. Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rouchailo accused
the Islamic rebels of Dagestan of staging the attacks and most
observers consider the Russian Caucasus as the hotbed of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
-- Israelis and Palestinians resumed Monday evening in Erez
their talks on the final status of the Palestinian territories.
The two sides apparently don't have the intention to yield on the
problem of the status of Jerusalem and frontier lines.

NAIROBI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti has said that the Kenyan government will soon introduce a

millions of children live in difficult conditions and are denied
access to food, shelter, education, medical care and security.

terminated lives among adults and children.
</P>
<P>
He said children in such circumstances are at the risk of
malnutrition, diseases and possibly death.

<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda (BOU)
said on Tuesday that it would issue the banknote with a face value
of 20,000- shilling at the end of this year instead of in two
weeks' time as some media reported.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, BOU, the country's central bank, said that
it is true that some fake 20,000-shilling banknotes have been
circulating in the country, but the bank has no evidence that
rebels and armymen as well as businessmen are involved in the
production and circulation of counterfeited banknotes.
</P>
<P>
The BOU said it will continue to provide to the public advice
and information on such counterfeits and put new currency notes
into circulation through all commercial banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
It advised the general public to work closely with security
organs and report counterfeiting activities.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Reports Rise in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Imports and exports for
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region grew 11.7 percent
on a yearly basis to reach 189 million U.S. dollars in the first
seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
This will provide a strong basis for the landlocked region to
achieve a nine-percent economic growth rate for 1999. Ningxia is
an economically less-advantaged region in the country.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities attribute the foreign trade increase in part
to the implementation of a series of preferential policies for
export-oriented enterprises with annual exports of more than eight
million yuan (about 960,000 dollars) each and foreign-funded
enterprises with annual exports of more than five million U.S.
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The incentives, especially in terms of bank loans, have been
given to firms engaged in the production of 14 key export
commodities, including coal, magnesium and carborundum.
</P>
<P>
While consolidating traditional markets such as the United
States and Japan, Ningxia is making efforts to expand into other
overseas markets.

<HEADLINE> S.Asian Human Development Report Issued in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani think tank
Tuesday launched the Report on Human Development in South Asia
1999 here, focusing on the reasons behind the human deprivation in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"The unique feature of this report is the concept of humane
governance that puts people at the center of all governance
policies, strategies, and actions," said Khadija Haq, president of
the Islamabad-based Mahbub ul Haq Human Development Center (HDC).
</P>
<P>
The center held the inaugural launch of the report in
collaboration with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The 1999 report, the third in a series on the challenges to
human development in South Asia, presents a multi-faceted picture
of the region's crisis of governance and suggests governance
reforms and implementation strategies to advance human
development.
</P>
<P>
South Asia, with nearly one-fourth of humanity, has emerged as
the most illiterate, the poorest, the most malnourished, and the
least gender-sensitive region in the world, according to the first
two reports on human development in South Asia in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 report says that South Asia has emerged as one of the
most poorly-governed regions in the world. Consequently it focuses
on what South Asia's governments and civil societies can do to
reverse these trends and bring the region back on the path of
humane and responsible development.
</P>
<P>
The HDC was set up in November 1995 in Islamabad, Pakistan, as
a policy research institute and think tank by late Dr. Mahbub ul
Haq, founder and chief architect of UNDP's Human Development
Reports.
</P>
<P>
It is committed to organizing professional research, policy
studies and seminars in the area of human development, with a
special focus on the South Asia region.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Party Daily Hails Success of APEC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese Communist
Party's daily Nhan Dan (The People) said Tuesday that the 7th
informal meeting of the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum has affirmed the region's strong
commitment to urgent regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Nhan Dan in a commentary described the informal meeting of APEC
leaders, which ended in New Zealand's Auckland on Monday, as a
successful one.
</P>
<P>
It said the Auckland declaration of the meeting affirmed APEC's
commitment to addressing urgent regional and international issues,
particularly those to be discussed in the coming round of talks by
the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is considered "a round
of talks spanning centuries."
</P>
<P>
The declaration entitled "The Auckland Challenge," adopted by
APEC leaders before the end of the meeting, also reflected the
desire of all APEC member economies to build an open, highly
competitive global eco-trade system based on mutual interests, the
daily noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Auckland forum has created favorable opportunities for
leaders of economies to establish new partnerships," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Bilateral meetings conducted on the sidelines of the summit
such as those between China and the United States, China and
Russia, Russia and the United States, and China and Japan, not
only covered bilateral relationships but also sought ways to boost
multilateral cooperation, thus contributing to obtaining APEC
goals, as well as to peace, stability, cooperation and development
in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world," it added.
</P>
<P>
However, the daily said that much remains to be done by APEC on
the path ahead which is full of both opportunities and challenges.
"APEC's achievements over the past decade and the fruitful results
of the Auckland Summit have helped strengthen a general confidence
in a strong and prosperous APEC in the future," it said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that the Vietnamese delegation headed
by Prime Minister Phan Van Khai made active contributions to the
success of the Auckland summit.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Proposes Asia-Latin America Trade Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada will explore the possibility of setting up a trade forum
between East Asia and Latin America during his coming visit to
Chile and Argentina, the Philippine government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said in a news release that Estrada
made the remarks in Auckland, New Zealand, when he held bilateral
meetings with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
They were all attending the annual Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) summit there.
</P>
<P>
The release said these talks, focusing on strengthening the
Philippines' economic ties with these countries, were part of the
country's effort to examine a possible free trade accord with
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"Since we share common historical and cultural heritage with
these countries, the Philippines intends to serve as a bridge for
developing closer linkages between East Asia and Latin America,"
the president was quoted by the release as saying.
</P>
<P>
Estrada will proceed from Auckland on September 15 to Chile and
Argentina for state visits. It will be the first time that a
Philippine president will visit these two countries.
</P>
<P>
With these visits, the president will take the lead among East
Asian nations in discussing the prospects for a trade forum with
Latin America to reinforce trade links between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Manila serves as the "natural gateway" to Asia for goods and
services from Latin America, but has yet to fully take advantage
of this as shown by the small percentage of trade with this region
as compared with the Philippines' neighbors in the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the Philippines and Argentina and Chile were
valued at 40 million U.S. dollars and 51 million dollars
respectively in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Both Share Prices, Dollar Fall in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices turned downward in
Tokyo Tuesday, dragged down by the yen's rise against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 132.07 points, or 0.74
percent, from Monday's close to end at 17,777.22.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 10.44 points or 0.68 percent to 1,
524.79.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 565.94 million
shares from 597.48 million shares Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Electronic Corp. was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
After opening higher, the Nikkei index stayed in minus
territory throughout the day, and fell to as low as 17,610.31 just
after the afternoon session started.
</P>
<P>
Share prices were lower in most business sectors, and traders
noted export-oriented technology issues were weak, hit by the yen'
s strength and the unfavorable performance in the Nasdaq index
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far exceeded
gainers 786 to 421, with 137 issues remaining unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar fell briefly to
106.00 yen, its lowest level in Tokyo since May 15, 1996,
prompting the Bank of Japan to conduct dollar-buying intervention
in the market.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m., the U.S. currency was quoted at 106.55-58 yen, down
from 106.62-65 yen at 9 a.m., and from 106.65-75 yen in New York
overnight. The dollar traded at 107.77-80 yen in Tokyo late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yen-buying was strong in Tokyo as hopes for Japan's economic
pickup were fueled by the release last Thursday for better-than-
expected Japanese gross domestic product (GDP) figures, a dealer
said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Athletics Meet Draws Big Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The world's fastest man Maurice
Greene of the United States will spearhead a strong field of world
champions and record holders at the Tokyo track and field meet
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Greene, 25, who set a world 100 meters record of 9.79 seconds
in June, will launch the final shot of the season as a heavy
favorite in the men's 100m race.
</P>
<P>
The American, however, will face a strong challenge from Jason
Gardener of Britain, seventh in Seville world championships this
August. Local hero Koji Ito, holder of the Asian record in 100m,
American Kurtis Johnson and Yin Hanzhao of China will also pose
problems for Greene.
</P>
<P>
Colin Jackson of Britain was another big star at the
international meeting, which features as many as 18 events and
some 150 athletes.
</P>
<P>
Jackson set the world 110m hurdles record of 12.91 seconds to
win the 1993 world championships and regained the title in Seville
with winning performance of 12.04.
</P>
<P>
Jackson's rivals in Tokyo will be 1999 U.S. champion Mark Crea
and his compatriot Larry Wade. Asian Games champion Chen Yanhao
of China will also pose a challenge to him.
</P>
<P>
1997 world indoor champion Kevin Little of the United States
will compete against Obadele Thompson of Barbados in the men's
200m.
</P>
<P>
American Antonio Pettigrew will race against world
championships bronze medalist Alejandro Cardenas of Mexico and
Asian Games champion Sugath Tilikaratne of Sri Lanka in the men's
400m.
</P>
<P>
Another attention-calling entry was the Susanthika Jayasinghe
of Sri Lanka, who has been struggling to regain her form in which
she emerged as the silver-medalist in 200m event at the 1997 world
championships.
</P>
<P>
Her career has been in limbo as she was caught up with the
doping charges but the world athletics ruling body IAAF is
expected to clear her.
</P>
<P>
The big absentees are pole vault world record holder Emma
George of Australia and three-time long jump world champion Ivan
Pedroso of Cuba who have pulled out with injuries.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Population Reaches 11.4 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia Tuesday released
the final results of the 1998 census which put the country's
population at 11.4 million, double the figure recorded by the last
census 36 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The last census conducted in 1962 put Cambodia's population
then at 5.7 million. The present census was conducted in March
1998.
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 enumerators and 8,350 supervisors, apart from
thousands of supervisory and supporting staff at the province,
district and commune levels, collected information by house to
house visits during the census.
</P>
<P>
The population of 11,437,656 occupies the seventh position
among the first 10 most populous countries in Southeast Asia.
Cambodia's average annual population growth rate of 2.49 percent
is relatively higher than neighboring Vietnam's 1.8 percent and
Thailand's 1.0 percent and marginally lower than Laos' 3.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the 24 provinces and municipalities, Kompong Cham is the
biggest province which has about 14 percent of the country's
population, while Pailin municipality is the smallest unit in
terms of population.
</P>
<P>
According to the census, about 84 percent of the population
live in rural areas, with urban population accounting for only
15.7 percent. The average size of normal or regular households is
5.2 persons at the national level.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has a young population with 42.8 percent in the age
group from 0 to 14. On the whole, nearly 83 percent of the
literate population aged 25 and over have not gone beyond the
primary level of education. And only about 64 percent of the
children aged between 7 and 14 attend schools. And in the urban
areas more than three-quarters of the children are attending
schools.
</P>
<P>
"There is a deficit of adult males resulting primarily from
civil war and large scale mortality during the seventies," said
Sar Kheng, deputy prime minister and co-minister of interior on
the occasion of the release of the census results.
</P>
<P>
The census also revealed that the sex ratio of the population
(number of males per hundred females) is 93.0, but for the
population aged 15 years and over is 85.2 and for the group aged
60 years and over is only 71.8.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's territory is 181,035 square kilometers with a
density of population of 64 persons per square kilometer.

<HEADLINE> WWF Study Shows Toxic Contamination in Yugoslavia Spreading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO's recent 78-day bombing
against Yugoslavia has led to toxic contamination in Yugoslavia,
the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
On publishing its expert team's analytical results confirming
evidence of damage to the environment through chemical
contamination, the WWF called for urgent clean-up of toxic
substances that continue to pollute the environment in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a recent study, the WWF expert team assessed two of the
facilities bombed in Yugoslavia: The Pancevo petrochemical complex
and the Novi Sad oil refinery, and tested the water of the Danube
River. They found that toxic pollutants, originally released in
the immediate environment of bombed facilities, are now
threatening further damage by spreading into surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the WWF, samples taken from soil and water showed
the presence of notable quantities of mercury, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, ethylene dichloride, and other highly toxic
substances including dioxin.
</P>
<P>
"These were initially released by the bombing of industrial
complexes and continue to leach from these facilities, threatening
groundwater drinking supplies and natural resources in several
countries of the area," WWF said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
It urged the international donor community to provide financial
and technical support and equipment for the urgent clean-up and
removal of contaminants in both the soil and the water.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Command Snubs Clash Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Military High Command of
Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) have rejected the report
about the August 14- 17 clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan troops
in Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by a joint committee and released last
week, blames Uganda more for the clashes which claimed hundreds
of lives, the Monitor daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In what amounted to a rejection of the report, the High
Command recommended that a panel be set up to make a broader and
fairer review of the bloody clashes.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan Vice President
Paul Kagame met in western Uganda on August 16-17 in a bid to stop
the clash from escalating.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which both sent troops to back rival
factions of the main rebel group in the DRC conflict, accused
each other of inciting the fighting.

<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China. Xinhua News Agency is
releasing about 50 stories on Chinese men and women, young and old,
to illustrate the changes that have taken place in China over the
past half century. These people will describe their lives and how
they fit into the changes in the motherland. This is the 25th
story in the series.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua)-- Attorney Zhou Liying says she
is among the first batch of Chinese who have grown rich since
China opened to the outside world in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
During her ten-year legal career, she has not only witnessed
the speedy development of China's legal system, but also fattened
her own purse.
</P>
<P>
The petite 35-year-old talked to Xinhua about her job during an
interview at the Capital Club, one of Beijing's few playgrounds
for the rich and famous in an area dotted with embassies and
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Zhou has had a steady caseload for quite some time and can be
choosy about which cases to take. Just ten years ago she was an
ordinary teacher.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, her bosses ordered her to switch from teaching finance
to economic law, saying that as the youngest teacher in Ningbo TV
University, she "should also be the most receptive to new
knowledge."
</P>
<P>
She studied in the evening and gave lectures the next morning
to students, mostly older than she.
</P>
<P>
After four years of teaching law, it occurred to her to make it
her career.
</P>
<P>
At the time she was analyzing the pros and cons of being an
attorney, then leader Deng Xiaoping announced that China needed
500,000 lawyers, and in 1979 swung open the doors to the legal
system, which had suspended for 22 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
Deng's words helped her to make the decision in an era when
changing jobs was still regarded as irresponsible. She passed the
bar exam and entered a government law office in early 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, her first job was far from rosy. "No matter how hard
you worked, the pay was set -- just 100 or 200 yuan a month," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Not only was the money bad, there was a general negative
perception of lawyers. "It was not news if a lawyer was thrown out
of court back then," she said, explaining that there were no laws
to protect the rights of lawyers, and what lawyers could
accomplish largely depended on how much information the police,
procurators and courts would give them.
</P>
<P>
"For ordinary people, lawyers are the sort of oily-tongued
people that help cover up for robbers and rapists and the like.
And there was a guy who even blurted out to me, 'A woman is a
lawyer?'"
</P>
<P>
In 1992, however, the legal profession improved markedly
because reforms enabled lawyers to charge clients individually for
cases.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Zhou resigned from her state job and opened her own
law firm specializing in financial matters. Business was so brisk
that by mid-1995 she had earned nearly one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Foreseeing tough competition in the road ahead, Zhou left her
home Ningbo, a port city in east China's Zhejiang Province, to
come to Beijing where she studied international law in the
graduate program at the China University of Political Science and
Law. In 1997, in her final year of school, she joined the
prestigious Beijing W&AMP;H Law Firm, and developed a reputation as a
tough attorney capable of handling difficult cases.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that her clients are mainly companies, factories and
government institutions. But in the past few years, more and more
private citizens have sought legal help.
</P>
<P>
"They want their wills witnessed, and sometimes a man and woman
will witness to each other's assets before tying the knot," she
said.

<P>
"The tiny minority of wealthy people want to have their own
lawyers," she concluded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she has had an increasing number of requests for
mediation services, which now make up more than half of her
workload, she said. She prefers mediating because court battles
are usually "unbearably lengthy." As a mediator, she acts as a
neutral party between two sides who try to work out their
differences without going to court, usually resolving the problem
within one or two months.
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, China had a very weak law system," she said. "
When troubles arose, people instantly thought of going to leaders
or finding connections for assistance. Now it's different. The
concept that law overrides power has been accepted as common sense
by more and more people."
</P>
<P>
She shook her head, recalling how difficult it was ten years
ago to convince anyone that the law is more influential than power.
</P>
<P>
She has handled 367 lawsuits so far and believes that "the
courts have judged cases on the basis of facts and on legal
principle." Still, there are a couple of cases she would love to
re-try.
</P>
<P>
Zhou admits that China's legal system is not yet sound and
complete, and there are still holes to close. But in the meantime,
she said, attorneys can study new laws and keep up with
developments in the legal profession.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Hangzhou Great Canal Dredged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Dredging work on the 1,800-
km-long Beijing-Hangzhou Great Canal, the longest in the world,
has been completed.
</P>
<P>
The canal can now accommodate bigger vessels and efforts have
been made to improve conditions along the canal, increase its anti-
flood capability, and upgrade water quality, a Ministry of
Communications official said.
</P>
<P>
The dredged canal will be a gift for the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the People's Republic of China, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The canal has been playing an important role in the country's
economic growth as its transport capacity is four times that of
the parallel Beijing-Shanghai railway line.
</P>
<P>
But the canal's handling capacity has been hampered by
distorted navigation routes, shallow water, and low bridges in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Meets Albanian Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met here
today with an Albanian People's Assembly (APA) delegation led by
Sabri Godo, chairman of the assembly's Commission of Foreign
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li said China and Albania enjoy traditional friendship and
growth of bilateral ties was "generally smooth".
</P>
<P>
China respects the development path chosen by Albania, he said,
adding that the increased contacts between the NPC and APA
deepened bilateral ties. He hoped the guests could better
understand China, which would promote better understanding between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the guests on China's reform and opening-up
cause. "Our experience demonstrates that the development of a
country should be based on a development pattern suitable to its
national conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Li expressed his appreciation to the "one
China" policy adopted by the Albanian government and its People's
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the international situation, he said that China
adopts an independent foreign policy of peace. "In our view, the
world should be a multi-polar globe because a multi-polar world is
safer than the single-polar world," he said. Also, he wished peace
and stability to the Balkans and other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
Godo expressed his admiration for China's rapid development
since the reform and opening-up and his congratulations on the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Even with some turns and twists, the two countries can open a new
chapter in their bilateral ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
In another development on Monday, Zeng Jianhui, chairman of the
NPC Foreign Affairs Committee, hosted working talks with the
delegation, during which the two sides exchanges views on
enhancement of inter-parliament exchanges and friendly cooperation.
Godo reiterated on that occasion that the Albania government and
its People's Assembly recognize only one China -- the People's
Republic of China. Such a stance will not have any change, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian guests arrived here on Sunday for a goodwill visit
at the invitation of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Ready to Help Indonesia on East Timor Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan said Tuesday that his country will send troops to join
the United Nations peacekeeping force in East Timor after the U.N.
Security Council and Indonesia have come to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing and ready to help our closest friend,
Indonesia, on the East Timor issue," Surin said after meeting with
President B.J. Habibie at the Merdeka Palace here.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of Thailand leading the U.N. peacekeeping
force, Surin said the issue was not discussed during his meeting
with Habibie.
</P>
<P>
He said the Thai government is offering its humanitarian
assistance in its own capacity as it is not representing any
regional organization, including the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Other ASEAN countries will separately convey their readiness to
help Indonesia, said Surin, who arrived here Tuesday after
attending the just-concluded informal leaders meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Auckland, New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Surin acted as chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee during
the APEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I came here to convey the messages of Thailand's prime
minister who led Thailand at the APEC meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
Habibie announced Sunday his readiness to accept a peacekeeping
force through the United Nations to restore peace and security in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian military spokesman Maj. Gen. Sudrajat Monday said
Indonesia preferred to have more troops from ASEAN countries,
saying that they have the capabilities to understand more
objectively the complexity of the East Timor problem.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> S. African Presidential Office to Be Entirely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki has formally moved his office from Cape Town to
Pretoria, although he will still have to fly to Cape Town when
parliament is in session, reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Previously the president alternated between two offices in Cape
Town and Pretoria, the legislative and administrative capitals of
the country.
</P>
<P>
But the government denied speculation that the move was a
prelude to a decision by the ruling African National Congress to
move parliament from Cape Town to Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Monday that the
move was the result of organizational and administrative
considerations. It was also expected to save money.
</P>
<P>
"There is no relationship whatsoever between the decision taken
on the presidency and the debate about the seat of parliament.
These are two wholly separate matters," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
While the president could determine the base of the presidency,
he said, only parliament was empowered by the constitution to
determine the seat of the national legislature.
</P>
<P>
The decision to base the presidency entirely in Pretoria was
taken because the president was not a member of parliament,
although he was entitled to speak in parliament, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president was also not obliged to be present in parliament
except when making an address of national importance or during the
debate on his budget, said Mankahlana.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki has already named Deputy President Jacob Zuma as leader
of government business in parliament, which means that Zuma will
be present in parliament and maintain the close relationship
between the presidency and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki will have to fly to Cape Town to attend cabinet meetings
when parliament is in session because all ministers are parliament
members and must attend parliament.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Appeals for Aid to 30,000 People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan opposition
United Front Tuesday launched an emergency appeal for
international aid to some 30,000 people beleaguered in the Darre
Suf valley in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Without international assistance we feel that many will perish
in the coming months," General Sayed Hussain Anwari, an opposition
commander, said in a statement released from the valley in
Samangan province.
</P>
<P>
Since a major Taliban offensive on Darre Suf in February this
year, the valley has continually come under enemy fire, which has
resulted in the killing of many innocent people, Anwari said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Taliban of indiscriminate attacks on
infrastructure in the valley which "have caused severe damage" to
the economy there.
</P>
<P>
Darre Suf is a strategically located valley with access to
northern and central Afghan provinces of Balkh, Bamiyan and
Sar-e-Pol.
</P>
<P>
The valley boasts one of Afghanistan's biggest coal mines.
Other sources of income in the valley include agricultural
products, fruits and livestock.
</P>
<P>
Anwari said the valley's population, mainly ethnic Tajiks,
Hazaras and Uzbeks, recently swelled to well over 30,000 people
following the Taliban's "atrocities" in Bamiyan and Balkh.
</P>
<P>
The opposition commander said 1,000 shops have been burnt, 100
hectares of land destroyed, 5,000 farm animals killed and 1
million fruit trees perished in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the above, we call on the international community
and humanitarian organizations to render urgently needed
assistance to the beleaguered population in the valley," he said.
</P>
<P>
Items of need include food products, clothing and medical aid,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Study Reveals How Companies Create Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Companies that achieve
attractive levels of profitability and then aggressively invest in
growth are more likely to increase shareholder value than those
focusing on restructuring alone, said a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The growth focus has been more prevalent in the United States,
where company profitability has been higher, and the restructuring
focus more prevalent in Europe, said the study.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the U.S. management consulting firm,
the Boston Consulting Group, examined "total shareholder returns"
of some 5,300 public companies, which together account for 80
percent of the total capitalization of the world's stock markets,
from the end of 1993 through the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Total shareholder return (TSR) is defined as the capital gains
plus the dividend payments relative to the share price at the
start of the period, assuming immediate reinvestment of dividends.
The median TSR for all companies in the study was 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The top ten performers in terms of TSR included six American
companies and four European companies. Dell Computers ranked
number one, with an average annual TSR of 153 percent for each of
the five years, followed by American Online, 143 percent, and the
German software company SAP, 91 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that six of the top ten companies come from
the information/communications and telecommunications sector,
which was the highest performing sector overall, followed by the
pharmaceutical and healthcare sector. Banking, retail and
insurance were also among the high-performing industries.
</P>
<P>
While overall market and economic conditions affect each
company's performance, the study found some primary means of
creating shareholder value are largely within the manager's
control. These include improvement in the company's cash-flow
margin, improvement in the productivity of the company's assets
and growth in investment.
</P>
<P>
The consulting firm said that growth has been the primary force
for increasing shareholder value in the United States. European
companies, by contrast, have largely relied on restructuring,
which results from asset productivity and cash-flow margin
improvements. Overall, profitable growth companies have created
more value than restructuring companies.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Blast Toll Rises to 112 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Monday's
apartment building blast in Moscow has reached 112, 11 of them
children, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 13 human body fragments were found, Interfax said,
quoting the press service of the Ministry for Emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Clean-up operation was continuing at the site where an eight-
story apartment building was demolished by a powerful explosion
early Monday, the third in Moscow since August 31, when a bomb
went off in an underground mall near the Kremlin. Last Wednesday,
a nine-story apartment building was also ripped apart by a blast.
</P>
<P>
One person died in the August 31 bombing and 94 people were
killed in the Wednesday blast.
</P>
<P>
In the Dagestani city of Buinaksk, an apartment blast killed 64
about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Although none of the explosions has been solved, authorities
suspect that Chechen terrorists were involved.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo on Tuesday morning reported
on the latest findings of the investigation into the explosions to
President Boris Yeltsin, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Rushailo said law enforcement bodies are concentrating their
efforts on Moscow and other big cities. Security is being
tightened in public transport as well as at strategic facilities
controlled by the Atomic Energy Ministry and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the meeting with Yeltsin that 3,800
kilograms of explosives were seized in raids following the Monday
bombing in Kashirskoye Shosse in southeast Moscow, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In an apartment block in Borisovskye Prudy Street, which is not
far from Kashirskoye Shosse, police found 16 plastic charges
complete with a 70-meter fuse, Rushailo said.
</P>
<P>
The apartment building has been evacuated and the explosives
defused, he said.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rises to 68.8 Percent in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year
inflation has risen to an unprecedented level of 68.8 percent for
August amid growing fears that the International Monetary Fund's
30 percent target before the end of the year will not be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The rate has increased by 5.3 percentage points from July's
figure, meaning that prices as measured by the all items consumer
price index increased by an average of 68.8 percent in August
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office said on Monday the rise in
inflation was mainly caused by the increases in the price of
bread, cereals, meat, drink, fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said wage pressure, fuel price increases and
electricity tariffs would make it impossible for the rate to come
down dramatically.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Mothers Give Birth to Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Meimei and Yaya, two female
giant pandas at a giant panda research center in Chengdu,
northwest China's Sichuan Province, each gave birth to twins early
this month.
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of the four cubs, there are now five baby
giant pandas at the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Center.
</P>
<P>
The twin cubs delivered by five-year-old Meimei on the night of
September 4 and in the early morning of September 5 weighed 125
grams and 128 grams. Yaya's pair, born on the night of September 9,
weighed 144 grams and 158 grams, according to Yu Jianqiu, a giant
panda specialist with the center.
</P>
<P>
Meimei is a first-time mother, and will nurse only one of the
cubs. The other is fed by employees at the center.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the more experienced Yaya, who gave birth to a cub
two years ago, is happily fussing over both of her cubs.
</P>
<P>
Both mothers and all four cubs are in good health, the center
said.
</P>
<P>
The 30-hectare center, situated in the northern suburbs of
Chengdu, is believed to be the only professional research
institute of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
There are only about 1,000 giant pandas both in captivity and
in the wild across the world, 80 percent of them in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
The survival rate of the giant panda is very low, as females
have trouble conceiving naturally.

CANBERRA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee said Tuesday that they are still committed to the anti-
doping agency which will be operational by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
IOC vice-president Dick Pound said at an Olympic sponsors

"I think we have a very high degree of agreement on establishing
the agency.
</P>
<P>
"I'm virtually certain it will be up well before the end of the
year and very much operational in time for Sydney," he added.
</P>
<P>
Australian Olympic Committee chief John Coates said last week
that the fight against doping at the Sydney Games would be

<HEADLINE> New Clearing System Improves Bank Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- An internationally advanced
capital clearing system launched by the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC) at the end of May has successfully handled
large amounts of inter-provincial capital clearing businesses,
according to a spokesman for the ICBC.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of the ICBC Yang Kaisheng said that the business
operation over the past few months has proven the new system to be
highly secure and effective in capital clearing.
</P>
<P>
The new system is an integrated application system based on the
ICBC's existing large computer network, designed to handle
external capital settlement and internal capital clearing
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that since the opening of the new system, the ICBC's
business offices handling capital settlement business in other
cities have increased from some 5,000 to more than 8,000, and
urgent capital remittance business has been extended to over 300
cities.
</P>
<P>
The new system handles businesses in batch and real time,
speeding up the transfer and settling of capital in other cities
and ensuring the arrival of capital at the targeted account within
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The new system is also able to offer network clearing services
for large enterprise groups in accordance with their special
requirements. So far the China National Petroleum Corporation, TCL
Group, Shanghai Motor Vehicle Sales Company and many other
enterprise groups have become customers.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the new system has provided customers with a
secure and fast capital clearing "expressway," pushing the ICBC's
financial services to a new level.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Consider Indonesian Objections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of Home
Affairs Syarwan Hamid said Tuesday that the United Nations should
consider objections of the Indonesian people with regard to the
formation of a U.N. peacekeeping force to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"The objections of the people of Indonesia should be considered
by the U.N. not to involving Australia in the U.N. peacekeeping
force to East Timor," Hamid told reporters at the parliament here.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated that Indonesia is to leave the
formation of the U.N. peacekeeping force up to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"But I think the U.N. will not take a risk with ignoring such
objections launched by the people of Indonesia (to exclude
Australia in the peacekeeping force)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a member of House Commission I for law, security and
foreign affairs, Yasril A. Baharuddin, insisted on Tuesday that
Australia should respect Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor
since the territory was still a part of Indonesia until the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) confirms the ballot result
which East Timorese voted to break with Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"But until then (MPR session in November) we still have
sovereignty over East Timor. We ask for Australia to honor it.
Don't interfere in our own internal problem in East Timor," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas on Monday, discussing the details of
the U.N. proposal of sending a peacekeeping force to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said his talks with Annan will continue Tuesday on a
number of issues including the composition and the nature of the
force and the role of the Indonesian army in the peacekeeping
mission.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie announced here Sunday night
that his government accepted the presence of a U.N. peacekeeping
force in cooperation with the country's military to restore order
and security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Violence has taken place since the announcement of the August
30 ballot result in East Timor by the U.N. on September 4. The
result showed over 78 percent of the total East Timorese voters
favored independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
U.N.

<HEADLINE> China Sets up First Film and TV Cartoon School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Cartoon School,
China's first school to train professional film and TV cartoonists,
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred students from the inaugural class were divided into
six groups to study caricature, cartooning and literary sketching.
</P>
<P>
Run by the Shanghai Animated Film Studio (SAFS), the school
will conduct professional exchanges with overseas animation
studios and companies.
</P>
<P>
SAFS is the only animation film studio in China. It produced a
great number popular cartoons in the 1960s and 1970s. However,
animated films have been virtually ignored by Chinese movie-goers
in recent years as a result of the big inflow of foreign-made
films.
</P>
<P>
This summer, the studio released a new film, Lotus Lantern, the
first major domestic animation film, which has been warmly
received in many Chinese cities.

<HEADLINE> EDS-National Day Special (National Day Special) China's Family Planning Policy Slows Down World Population Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Population
Fund predicts that the world population will hit six billion on
October 12 -- a historic instant that would have come three or
four years earlier had China failed to bring its population growth
under control, Chinese demographers say.
</P>
<P>
They also insist that the population control policy, or family
planning, will have to be carried out for a long time in China if
the world's most populated country wants to achieve sustainable
development in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
"Without taking effective measures to slow down the rapid
growth of population, China would have 300 million people more
than current figure of 1.248 billion, and 'World Day of Six
Billion People' would come much earlier," says Zhang Weiqing,
minister in charge of State Family Planning Commission (SFPC).
</P>
<P>
Professor Lin Fude, a researcher with the Demographic Institute
of People's University in Beijing, believes that the country would
have been more excessively burdened if those people had been born.
</P>
<P>
"The problems we face will not be simply in regard to the
supply of more food and clothing. Due to excessive consumption,
China may be overburdened by resource shortages and environmental
pollution, even the current situation has turned serious," he says.
</P>
<P>
Research shows that although annual grain output in 1996 was 90
billion kilograms more than the 1984 figure, the per capita intake
of grain in 1996 was eight kg less than 1984, which means the
growth of grain production was unable to meet the population
growth in that period.
</P>
<P>
A massive population also puts extra pressure on education,
medical care, welfare, traffic, housing, employment and other
social sectors, Prof. Lin says.

<HEADLINE> EDS-National Day Special (National Day Special) China's Family Planning Policy Slows Down World Population Growth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In contrast with the never-ending increase in the population
figure since New China was founded in 1949, the population-control
policy suffered a long-term setback until leaders implemented the
family planning strategy in the 1970s, when the population climbed
to some 900 million.
</P>
<P>
Considering the urgency of population control, the Communist
Party of China (CPC), the ruling party of the country, in 1982
announced that the family planning policy was a fundamental
national policy. The country's revised Constitution, which was
adopted in the same year, also stipulated that Chinese couples
would be obligated to follow the policy.
</P>
<P>
The family planning programs that also offer reproductive
health service are now available across the country, and have
adopted the policy that couples should marry and have a child
later in life and take steps to ensure a healthy birth.
</P>
<P>
China now keeps its birth rate at about 16 per thousand and the
population growth rate at 9.5 per thousand, both less than half of
the 1970's figures. China's population growth rate has been
approaching the level of some industrialized countries such as the
United States and Canada, according to the SFPC.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang Weiqing stresses that population control will
continue to be a challenge for China because an average of 13
million people will be increased each year until the total
population stops growing in the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
According to an SFPC plan, China will control its population
within 1.4 billion by 2010 and will continue to lower incidence of
birth defects while improving reproductive health services and
overall quality of the people. Demographers predict that China's
population will reach the peak -- between 1.44 billion and 1.52
billion -- by the year 2031.
</P>
<P>
"In order to achieve the goal of grain sufficiency and
sustainable development at that time, China should make sure that
the population-control policy remains unchanged," Prof. Lin says.

<HEADLINE> Australia Prepares for Aid Drops to East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Emergency aid drops to East
Timor will not begin before Wednesday as AusAID is finalizing its
decision on an appropriate aircraft and crew.
</P>
<P>
The government aid agency has yet to decide whether an
Australian Defense Force Hercules cargo aircraft would be used or
a privately-owned chartered aircraft, an AusAID spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"One thing we're bearing in mind is that it's a fairly risky
operation for the aircraft and crews given the lay of the land and
general security concerns," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It's fairly mountainous terrain for low-level flying and it
takes some skill to get it to the right place," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia Monday night gave in-principle permission for the
drops to go ahead in the mountains of East Timor where tens of
thousands of displaced people have taken refuge, some reportedly
surviving on roots and leaves.
</P>
<P>
AusAID is stockpiling tons of food and medical supplies in a
1,500 square-meter warehouse leased near the airport of Darwin in
northern Australia.
</P>
<P>
The first drops will comprise rice, cooking utensils, medical
kits, materials for constructing shelters and water containers,
the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Provides Water Utility Loans to Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) agreed Tuesday to lend over 170 million U.S. dollars to a
private utility to improve water distribution and wastewater
treatment services in the Philippine capital of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The project will enable Maynilad Water Services, Inc. to
provide an uninterrupted water supply to existing customers and to
expand water, sewerage and sanitation coverage to more than 90
percent of its concession area in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
This is the ADB's first assistance to a privatized water and
sewerage utility, said a report of the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Maynilad is one of the two concessionaires of the
government-owned Metropolitan Waterfronts and Sewerage System
which provides water and sewerage services to Metro Manila, Rizal
province and part of Cavite province.
</P>
<P>
The ADB assistance is part of a 350-million-dollar debt package
being raised by the water firm to meet its financing needs up to
the year 2002. Beyond that time, revenues are expected to reach
self-sustaining levels.
</P>
<P>
Other financiers include the European Bank and a syndicate of
international commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Australian Lamb Industry to Suffer Only in Short Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia's lamb industry is
expected to suffer from damaging U.S. tariffs in the short term
but to recover by 2001-2002, the country's chief commodities
forecaster said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics
(ABARE) said the U.S. tariff rate quota would make it difficult
for the industry to continue increasing lamb exports to the United
States, but the long-term prospects were good.
</P>
<P>
In July, the United States outraged Australia when it imposed
the quota after its sheep farmers complained of huge volumes of
imports damaging the industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the new restrictions, a border tax of 9 percent will be
imposed on the first 31.85 million metric tons of imported lamb
and a 40-percent tariff will be added to lamb shipments above that
level.
</P>
<P>
"The imposition of the tariff rate quota is expected to
constrain the Australian industry's ability to continue to
increase lamb exports to the U.S. market," ABARE said in its
September quarter forecast.
</P>
<P>
But competitive lamb prices and the continued commitment by the
Australian industry would mean Australian exports should grow
again beyond 2001-2002, although not at the same high rate as
experienced in recent years, it said.
</P>
<P>
ABARE also expects lamb farmers to direct more exports to other
international markets, such as the United Kingdom, where
Australian exports increased by around 17 percent in 1998-99.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Calls On Japan's NEC for Further Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li
Peng, in a meeting today with Japan's Nippon Electric Co., Ltd. (
NEC) chief advisor Tadahiro Sekimoto, expressed hope that NEC
would expand cooperation with the Chinese, saying that the
introduction of advanced technology will help.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, said he deeply appreciates Sekimoto's contribution to
bilateral ties and telecommunications cooperation between the two
countries since the 1970s, and hoped he would continue his efforts

chief advisor, has personally masterminded a series of cooperative
projects with China, among which is the Shanghai semi-conductor
CMOS chip plant.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his pleasure over the successful development of
the project, which is expected to start operation in the near
future.
</P>

The NPC chairman pointed out one of the key reasons behind the
project's success is the introduction of advanced technology,
which holds bright promise for its future.

<P>
The next century is a time for rapid scientific and
technological development, Li said, voicing the hope the NEC would
further expand its cooperation with the Chinese.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Closes Besieged Dili Compound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Tuesday
closed its besieged compound in the East Timor capital of Dili
after the evacuation of 1,300 East Timorese to Australia, a U.N.
official said.
</P>
<P>
But the world body would leave about a dozen staff at a
different location in the city, Ian Martin, head of U.N.
Assistance Mission to East Timor (UNAMET), said in Darwin,
northern Australia.
</P>
<P>
Martin arrived in Darwin on the first of at least 12 flights
out of Dili bringing out the refugees and 110 non-essential UNAMET
staff.
</P>
<P>
"With their (the refugees) arrivals here we have closed the
UNAMET compound in Dili," Martin told reporters at Darwin
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
He said 12 UNAMET personnel would remain in Dili at another
location and would continue to assess the security situation and
liaise with the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
Martin said permission for the evacuation of the refugees, who
had been living in the UNAMET compound for about a week, had been
given personally by Indonesia President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
"First I should say it was President Habibie himself who
authorized the departure of internationally displaced people,"
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"That authorization had allowed a smooth evacuation in convoys
from the compound to the airport," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations had been working for some days to get the
necessary permission to evacuate the Timorese.
</P>
<P>
Martin said he was very concerned about UNAMET security in
Dili.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions in our compound are not really tenable," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations' 80 staff have been unable to leave the
compound for the past 10 days and were not able to work
effectively.
</P>
<P>
He said it made sense to relocate them.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Kills 14 Million People in World: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 10.7 million of those killed were adults, of which 4.7
million were women.
</P>
<P>
These figures were disclosed by a summary compiled by the Joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) as of December 1998
and circulated at the on-going 11th International Conference on
AIDS and STDS (sexually transmitted diseases) in Africa (ICASA) in
Lusaka. The summary says: " More than 95 percent of all
HIV-infected people now live in the developing countries, which
has likewise experienced 95 percent of all deaths to date from
AIDS, largely among young adults." According to the UNAIDS
and the World Health Organization (WHO), the epidemic killed at
least 3.2 million children below the age of 15 since it was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone two million adults including 900,000 women died
from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Additionally 510,000 children below the age of 15 died after
acquiring HIV which leads to the disease.
</P>
<P>
The report says among 33.4 million people living with the
killer virus or AIDS are 13.8 million women and 1.2 million
children below 15 when the research was concluded last year.
</P>
<P>
"The epidemic has not been overcome anywhere. Virtually every
country in the world has seen new infections since 1998 and the
epidemic is frankly out of control in many places," the report
says.

<HEADLINE> Low-permeable Oilfield in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Jing'an Oilfield, one of
China's extremely low-permeable oil and natural gas reservoirs, is
expected to produce 1.03 million tons of crude oil in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Located in northwest China's Erdos Basin, Jing'an currently has
a proved reserve of 300 million tons of crude oil, and an annual
production capacity of 1.128 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield was discovered by Changqing Petroleum Exploration
Bureau (CPEB), a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC), after three years of exploration. The
discovery would boost Changqing's oil and gas output to a total of
six million tons this year from the 1.4 million tons ten years ago-
- the biggest improvement progress among the nation's oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Changqing bureau discovered Ansai, a 200-million-
ton extremely low-permeable oil and gas reserve, in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
An official with Changqing said the bureau has connected Jiang'
an with Ansai. So far the reserve of these two fields combined has
approached 500 million tons, and is expected to reach 600 million
by 2003.

<HEADLINE> Elephant Habitat Decreases in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the study of the biodiversity and Elephant
Conservation Trust (BECT), it needs about five square kilometers
of land to support an elephant in the wild, but the existing
protected areas for elephants in the country accounts for less
than 10 percent of the required land area.
</P>
<P>
This is the main cause for the escalation of the human-elephant
conflict in the country, the BECT said, adding that the jungle
lands as natural habitat of elephants have been massive opened by
cultivators for modern development.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the elephant population in the country
stand at 3,000. The elephants need at least 25 percent of the land
area of Sri Lanka. This is the main reason why the larger part of
the elephants' range lies outside the protected areas, the study
quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
They said Sri Lanka's wild elephant conservation efforts is
greatly dependent on this vital factor.
</P>
<P>
Elephants must have somewhere to live and ample food to eat.
Both requirements are likely to be in short supply in the years
ahead in the light of the existing demographic and development
trends, they added.
</P>
<P>
The exports warned that the Sri Lanka's elephants will
disappear from the country by the year of 2030 if measures are not
taken to save them.

<HEADLINE> Private Firms Contributes Increasingly to China Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year
marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China. China's economic successes in the past five
decades have attracted the attention of the world. Xinhua began
issuing stories on the country's economy starting August 17. This
is the 22nd.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, there has been no other place in China
quite like the city of Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang Province, a
town often in a heated dispute over whether its local economy
reflects capitalism or socialism.
</P>
<P>
However, few would deny that Wenzhou is a stronghold of China's
private economy. To date, the city has over 5,200 private firms
and nearly 200,000 self-employed operations, accounting for some
90 percent of the city's total enterprises and the same percentage
of local industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the city has become the showcase of the country's
private business development. After the founding of New China in
1949, the authorities focused on the creation of a publicly-owned
economy to the exclusion of economies of other ownerships.
</P>
<P>
Non-public economies, including private business, began to
emerge in the late 1970s when the government adopted the reform
and opening-up policies.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the newly-revised Constitution defined the non-public
sector as a supplementary element of the national economy. And
early this year, the National People's Congress, China's top
legislative body, enshrined the status and role of the private
sector in an amendment to the Constitution, calling it "an
important component of the country's socialist market economy,"
opening greater opportunities for its development.

<P>
All these measures have strongly boosted the growth of the
country's private sector. Latest statistics show that China now
has 1.2 million private firms, with total registered capital of
more than 1 trillion yuan, contributing 19 percent to the country'
s total industrial output, with its exports and revenues on a
steady rise.
</P>
<P>
Booming private business comes at a time when millions are
being laid-off from money-losing state-owned enterprises and has
accordingly become a major channel for employment. Statistics show
that the private sector now hires some 17 million people.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, for example, all
94,000 private enterprises have employed nearly 180,000 laid-off
workers over the past five years, said Huang Qifan, director of
the Shanghai Municipal Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
To survive in increasingly competitive markets, many private
businesses that were Mom-and-Pop workshops have stopped relying on
labor-intensive processing and begun to hire more competent people
to pursue development that is based on technology.
</P>
<P>
According to the Development and Research Center of the State
Council, hi-tech companies now account for 12 percent of the
country's private businesses and they have developed more than 10,
000 new products, many in line with international levels.

<P>
A major problem long-plaguing private enterprises is the lack
of an efficient funding channel -- getting start-up funds from
banks, says Liu Yonghao, a successful farmer-turned-animal feed
producer.
</P>
<P>
But things are changing for the better: China's state-owned
commercial banks are also prepared to put some private businesses
onto their credit lists, granting loans according to a firm's
profitability and management, rather than its ownership or size.
</P>
<P>
"We will give loan priority to the private firms that have
already established modern enterprise systems and are money-making,
" says Jiang Zhihua, director of the Zhejiang Branch of the
Agricultural Bank of China (ABC).
</P>
<P>
Bank managers will also look particularly favorably on the
private new industries specializing in the manufacture of
environmental, electronics, telecommunications and IT products,
says Jiang.
</P>
<P>
China's private sector is also playing a greater role in the
country's drive to invite overseas investment, as more policies
are adopted to encourage private firms to cooperate with foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, 17 private businesses attended the 3rd
China Investment and Trade Fair, which ended in Xiamen of east
China's Fujian Province on September 12 and is widely regarded as
the most important venue for Chinese businesses to absorb overseas
capital.
</P>
<P>
Fair information showed that the private participants have
attracted attention of overseas investors, and some trade
delegations from Japan and Hong Kong have contacted them.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Electricity Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua)-- China State Power Corporation
(CSPC), the country's top manager of power grids, will take a
series of steps to increase electricity usage through price
leveraging, a senior CSPC official said here today.
</P>
<P>
To encourage electricity consumption, the price of electricity
will be readjusted during peak and low-use periods, different
voltage and load levels, and rainy or dry seasons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the enterprises with high electricity use will get a
reasonable reduction in electricity fees, and the price of
electricity in the vast rural areas will be lowered, said the CSPC
official, who didn't give further details on the price cut.
</P>
<P>
At present, the CSPC is giving priority to solving the Y2K
problem in the power system in hopes of providing better service
and ensuring the electricity supply for the construction of
infrastructure facilities, technical renovation, high-tech
development, and flood prevention.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the CSPC will encourage use of electricity in
public areas, the tertiary sector and commercial departments so as
to raise the total electricity usage.
</P>
<P>
The CSPC source said that the corporation will shut down small
thermal power plants with combined generating capacity reaching 1.
8 million kw to streamline the power generating system.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the CSPC is speeding up the development of
the nationwide power grid, particularly the construction of the
Three Gorges Power Project, the world's largest dam on the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
According to CSPC statistics, China used a total 563.7 billion
kwh of electricity in the first half of this year, up 5.9 percent
over the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Labor Ministry Acts to Help Labors in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Labor and Social Welfare
Ministry of Thailand is seeking to help thousands of Thai workers
in Israel facing low payment and poor living standard, the Bangkok
Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Domdej Bunnag, the Thai ambassador to Tel Aviv, told Labor
Minister Wut Sukosol, that most of the workers are paid 650-680
baht (17.1-17.9 U.S. dollars) daily despite Israel's minimum wage
of 780 baht (20.5 dollars) per day, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the minister as saying that the Employment
Department of the ministry was planning to require job brokers
responsible to pay the affected workers equal to the amounts their
Israeli employers owed them.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Labor Ministry had responded positively to the
ambassador's call for assistance, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
About 24,000 Thais work in Israel now, mostly in agricultural,
construction and service sectors. Israel has 8,000 job vacancies
for Thai workers.
</P>
<P>
Wut urged those looking for jobs in Israel to contact
provincial employment offices to avoid cheating.

<HEADLINE> BOT May Delay Announcing Winner in Radanasin Bank Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Central bank governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul was quoted as saying
that the delay was needed because the government's legal experts
are looking into the terms of the purchase agreement.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's United Overseas Bank was widely expected to win
Thai government approval last week for its bid to take over the
64-branch bank.
</P>
<P>
Radanasin, formerly Laem Thong Bank Plc, was nationalized in
August 1998 along with a few other banks after several months of
unsuccessful attempts to recruit a foreign strategic partner.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday Britain's Standard Chartered Bank announced that it
has acquired 75 percent of the equity and full management control
of Nakornthon Bank, another nationalized bank, for 12.377 billion
baht (334.5 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thai central bank official said buyers of Radanasin, Nakornthon
and two other state-controlled banks would need to hold their 75
percent stakes for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
They said the remaining 25 percent would be retained by a
central bank unit, the Financial Institutions Development Fund,
which planned to eventually list about 10 percent of the bank
stakes in the Thai stock market.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Offers to Talk With Opposition on Transshipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina Monday reiterated her call to the opposition to
discus the transshipment issue across the table or in the
parliament and shun their unnecessary destructive politics in the
form of hartal (general strike).
</P>
<P>
She noted that her government did not sign any pact with India
on transshipment or transit. "We have only decided, in principle,
for a discussion on transshipment to carry Indian goods in our
transports," she said, adding that the present government favors
discussion to do anything good for the betterment of the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation over Radio and Television on Monday night
on the eve of her departure for New York to attend the U.N.
General Assembly session, the prime minister referred to the
opposition's demand for canceling the transshipment agreement with
India and sought to know how they were placing such a demand as
there was no such agreement on the issue as yet.
</P>
<P>
The first day of the 60-hour countrywide hartal called by the
four opposition parties led by Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
disrupted normal life and halted business and commercial
activities on Monday in the capital and elsewhere in the country.
The hartal left one dead and one hundred injured.
</P>
<P>
The hartal was called by the opposition to protesting what they
termed the police excesses on the opposition activists during
Sunday's "peaceful" sit-in demonstration in front of the
Bangladesh Secretariat and repression on the opposition activists.
</P>
<P>
The opposition staged the sit-in demonstration to protest the
government decision to provide corridor facility to India in the
name of transshipment.
</P>
<P>
The BNP-led opposition alliance on Monday threatened to
intensify their movement if the government continued its
repression of the opposition. Briefing newsmen in the evening,
BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan said that despite
repressive measures the government would not succeed in containing
the growing movement.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Will not Send Forces to East Timor: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen said Tuesday that his country will not send forces to join
the U.N. peacekeeping forces because of problems in his own
country.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister of Cambodia fully welcomes the decision of
the Government of Indonesia to accept the multi-national
peacekeeping forces of the United Nations so as to restore and
strengthen order and stability in East Timor," a statement of the
spokesman of the prime minister sent from Cuba said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen just finished his four-day official visit to Cuba and
will leave there to take part in the U.N. General Assembly in New
York.
</P>
<P>
"The Kingdom of Cambodia is truly desired to participate in
seeking for security for the East Timorese people," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
"However," the prime minister explained, "due to the economic
and social problems Cambodia is facing now and the multisector
reforms, especially that of the armed forces, which now Cambodia
is undertaking, she is of no ability to send her forces to join
the operation in East Timor."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hun Sen said that "Cambodia cherishes strong hope
that the multi-national peacekeeping forces of the United Nations
will effectively cooperate with the Indonesian Government to
quickly and successfully set up peaceful situation for the people
of East Timor."
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh, president of the National Assembly, said
Monday that if the government made a decision to send the forces,
as the president of legislative body, he would welcome that
decision.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie announced Sunday his
readiness to accept a peacekeeping force through the United
Nations to restore peace and security in East Timor.

<HEADLINE>   Asian Economy Is Expected to Grow by 5.5 pct This year: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- With its faster than expected
recovery in the first half of 1999, the Asian economy is expected
to grow by 5.5 percent in the year, the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) predicted here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This growth rate is 1.1 percent higher than the ADB predicted
in its "Asian Development Outlook 1999" which was released in
April.
</P>
<P>
In the "Asian Development Outlook 1999 Update," the
Manila-based bank said that Asia's economic recovery in the first
half of 1999 has been stronger than expected.
</P>
<P>
"Since the first quarter of 1999, economic activity in
developing Asia has picked up substantially. This trend
strengthened further in the second quarter," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that developing Asia grew by 4.8 percent in the
first quarter, compared to 1 percent in the last quarter of 1998,
and this was further reinforced by a stronger growth performance
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The recovery from the financial crisis, which started in
mid-1997, is being led by South Korea, with 4.6 percent growth in
the first quarter, 9.8 percent for the second quarter and a
forecast 8 percent for the year, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Taipei, China; Singapore; the Philippines; and Thailand follow
South Korea in that order," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the gross domestic product (GDP) in
Singapore is expected to increase by 5 percent this year, and in
the Philippines and Thailand 3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the faster than expected recovery in Asia in
the first half of the year has been fueled by an expansion in
domestic demand arising from reflationary policies and increased
global demand for semi-conductors and electronic products.
</P>
<P>
The winding down of Y2K-related demand for electronics in the
second half of 1999 is likely to be offset by a rise in domestic
demand, it said.
</P>
<P>
"This will, however, depend upon the continued progress in
corporate and financial sector reforms," the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
"Real GDP growth in developing Asia is expected to be 5.5
percent in 1999 and 2000. This is based on continued improvement
in domestic demand and sustained external demand and arising from
higher growth rate in world trade and expansion in intra-regional
trade," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to inflation in the region, the bank said that the
second quarter consumer price index inflation rate for developing
Asia was 0.4 percent, compared with 5.4 percent in the last
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is forecast to experience the most dramatic decline
in inflation, which may average about 2 percent in 1999 compared
with a peak of over 80 percent in September 1998, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
In India, it added, inflation fell to less than 2 percent, the
lowest in nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
There has been deflation in China, China's Hong Kong, South
Korea and Thailand, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said that the June figure for short-term interest
rates indicate that with a few exceptions, rates across the region
are below pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
"The fall in interest rates in the crisis-affected countries
are due to improvements in the balance of payments and the relaxed
monetary policies," it said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said that central banks are expected to keep short-term
interest rates low to keep financial sector reforms on track,
avoid further currency appreciation and raise domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
"However, the short-term prospects of a recovery in private
investment remain weak," it added.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that Asia has a large agenda for structural
reform which needs to be vigorously pursued.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring the banking and corporate sectors and making
business transactions more transparent and accountable will
increase efficiency in resource allocation, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Policy initiatives are required for raising productivity
levels and restoring international competitiveness. This alone
will put developing Asia back on the path of sustained growth
which is essential for tackling poverty in the region," it said.

<P>
CARACAS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister
Jose Vicente Rangel Monday denounced and rejected threats made by
Colombian paramilitary militias against his country.
</P>
<P>
"We look down on them," said Rangel, when he was asked to
comment on statements made by the head of the United Auto-Defenses
of Colombia, Carlos Castano. The statements were included in a
letter sent to Victor G. Ricardo, the high commissioner for peace
in the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
"We have more important things to do than respond to threats
from a group of totally unqualified people," Rangel said, adding
that the Venezuelan government "isn't dissuaded by threats."
</P>
<P>
"We're made for fighting and prepared to face any action of any
kind, with the will power Venezuelans express during times of
conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he denied that he recently met with the
heads of the guerrilla forces -- Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
"I haven't met anyone. Until now, I have not. If a meeting is
planned, I'll be happy to hold it on Venezuelan land," said Rangel.
</P>
<P>
The leader of Colombia's right-wing militias, Carlos Castano,
Sunday accused Venezuela's air force of violating Colombian
airspace to conduct raids on his forces.

their capabilities for handling crises.

hypothetically involved two neighboring countries fighting a war.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and the defense
ministers of the four Nordic nations attended the military
exercise. Observers from Russia and Baltic Sea countries were also
invited.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Deepens Commitment to Advanced Programming Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. made a
series of announcements Monday supporting the Extensible Markup
Language (XML), a technology promised to move the Internet forward
into a whole new and more powerful era of computing.
</P>
<P>
XML, the electronic-publishing language, was completed in 1998
by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and has spread through
science into industries ranging from manufacturing to medicine.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Web's current main language HTML (shorthand for
hypertext markup language), which describes the structure of a Web
page, XML allows developers to make up their own tags to describe
information content on the page.
</P>
<P>
This industry-standard technology, far more flexible than HTML,
therefore enables heterogeneous interoperability of data,
components, business processes and applications over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said in its announcements that it has actively
participated in the W3C's creation and standardization of XML, and
has delivered XML support in its products.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Internet Explorer was the first browser software to
support XML. The windows 2000 operating system is the first
operating system with integrated XML support.
</P>
<P>
The new product the company announced Monday is Windows
Distributed Internet Architecture (Windows DNA) 2000, a
comprehensive, integrated platform for building and operating
state-of-the-art distributed Web applications as well as the next
wave of Internet-based Web services.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said that XML is the key for its vision of integrated,
programmable Web services. Through the exchange of XML messages,
services can easily describe their capabilities and allow any
other service, application or device on the Internet to invoke
those capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that XML and applications based on the
language, in the first place, will promote electronic commerce.
Commerce has been conducted for centuries by exchanging
standardized documents, and XML was designed exactly for document
exchange.
</P>
<P>
It is becoming clear that universal electronic commerce will
rely heavily on a flow of agreements, expressed in millions of XML
documents pulsing around the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the XML-powered Web will be faster, friendlier and a
better place to do business.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President, NZ Prime Minister Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China is satisfied with
the overall development of its ties with New Zealand, visiting
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said during his talks with New
Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said that New Zealand-China ties are entering into a
period of smooth progress and the ongoing visit by Jiang, the
first by a Chinese head of state, will surely serve to push
bilateral ties to a new period of promotion.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the just-concluded informal meeting of leaders of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum has produced
positive results, she thanked Jiang for his important
contributions to the success of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiang congratulated Shipley on the success of the APEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders spoke highly of the smooth development of ties
between the two countries over the past 27 years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said current bilateral ties are enjoying a good momentum
and leaders of the two nations have maintained frequent contacts.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, he went on to say, Shipley paid a successful
visit to China, which served to further relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
On international and regional issues, Jiang said both sides
maintain good consultations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he noted, bilateral economic and trade
relations have developed from a purely trading relationship to a
multi-level and multifarious trade and economic cooperation in
many fields; and each country has become an important trading and
investment partner of the other.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral exchanges in the cultural, scientific,
educational and tourism fields have achieved new progress, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the New Zealand government gives priority to its
ties with Asia in its foreign policy and values development of its
ties with China.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is the first Western nation to reach agreement with
China on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Jiang said, adding China appreciates the positive efforts of the
New Zealand government in promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Although there have occurred some new changes in international
and regional situation, he said, peace and development have
remained the main theme of the times.
</P>
<P>
China and New Zealand, as two Asian-Pacific countries with
important influence, share common interests in safeguarding world
and regional peace and stability, and in maintaining regional
prosperity and development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two economies are strongly complementary to each
other and there exist good basis and broad prospects for
furthering mutually beneficial friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two countries, he continued, should view from a
historical height the overall circumstances of the bilateral ties,
and the long-term interests of the two peoples, and push bilateral
relations further.
</P>
<P>
Both sides vowed to make concerted efforts for the
establishment of a long-term, stable, smooth and all-round
relationship of cooperation geared toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Jiang's viewpoints on bilateral relations, Shipley said
her country treasures its ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Since establishment of diplomatic ties, Shipley went on to say,
leaders of the two nations have frequently exchanged visits, while
bilateral contacts and exchanges in various sectors have scored
continuous development and positive results, with which New
Zealand feels satisfied.
</P>
<P>
Shipley stated that her country hopes to further increase
mutual understanding and enhance ties with China, a large and
influential country in the world.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that her country firmly supports China's entry
into the WTO at an early date.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Shipley reiterated that her government has
always followed and will continue to stick to the one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the settlement of the Taiwan-related issue at
the APEC meeting demonstrated the New Zealand government's
determination to follow the one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for that and reiterated China'
s principled stance on this issue.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Jiang and Shipley jointly met with the press.

<HEADLINE> Watford Signs Wooter from Real Zaragoza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Watford smashed their transfer
record by signing Nordin Wooter from Real Zaragoza for 950,000
pounds on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Dutch striker, who came through the much-touted
Ajax youth system, has been capped by the Netherlands at both
under-18 and under-21 level.
</P>
<P>
Wooter's arrival at Vicarage Road almost doubles the previous
club record of 550,000 pounds paid to AC Milan in 1984 to bring
back Luther Blissett.
</P>
<P>
The Hornets will not be able to field him in the Worthington
Cup against Wigan but manager Graham Taylor hopes to receive
international clearance in time to include him for the visit of
Chelsea on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Taylor has paid money for a player since
Watford were promoted to the Premiership - the previous three
signings this summer were free transfers.
</P>
<P>
"I see Nordin as a decided asset - he is a creative, attacking
player and I'm sure most supporters will agree that is something
we have been short of since the start of this season," said Taylor.
</P>
<P>
"He can play as a winger or striker and I look forward to
working with him, and hopefully earn him a place in the full Dutch
national team."
</P>
<P>
Wooter, who was on trial with Derby this summer, said: "I am
very pleased to have signed for Watford.
</P>
<P>
"Graham Taylor has been very good to me and the players here
have made me feel really welcome and part of the squad," he added.

<HEADLINE> Neville Sidelined for Two Months by Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Gary Neville is forced to be
sidelined for two months after Manchester United boss Sir Alex
Ferguson revealed that he has torn his abductor muscle.
</P>
<P>
Neville had only just returned from a groin problem when he
sustained the injury playing for England in Poland last week.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said on Monday: "Gary Neville will be out for two
months now. It's a complete tear of his abductor and with that
kind of injury, you're talking about two months."
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, who has 10 players missing, has had some better news
as Denis Irwin has recovered from his Achilles complaint and will
be on the bench for Tuesday's Champions League opener against
Croatia Zagreb at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Mark Bosnich is also fit following his hamstring injury and is
vying with Raimond van der Gouw for the goalkeeper's jersey.
</P>
<P>
Michael Clegg will make his full European debut at full-back,
while Ferguson claims he may opt for a three-man attack with three
in midfield.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Sunset in Hunting Tribe (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tribal leader Gu has mixed emotions about the future of his
people. "We thank the government from the bottom of our hearts,
but the tribe can no longer depend on hunting alone. We have to
relocate ourselves to a modern civilization."
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, the hunters have established a wood processing
plant and a wine factory to amplify their meager income. Some have
even turned to the tourism industry, building simple hotels and
nightclubs to entertain travelers who are curious about tribal
life.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that 3,000 tourists visited the tribe last year. "At
the very beginning, we were clumsy managing all these new
businesses. But we soon learned the skills from TV and Han Chinese,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The hunters have learned to speak Han Chinese, and can
communicate with remote business partners in southern Chinese
cities with the help of newly-installed telephones, and they have
given up intermarrying for fear of genetic diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to 66-year-old Gelisk, the younger generation is
captivated by the mystique of the world outside the forest. "They
even think that computer techniques are more important than
hunting skills!"
</P>
<P>
Over the past half century, 50 people from the tribe have gone
to live in cities. Some are enrolled in universities, some are
government officials.
</P>
<P>
"If I could go out one day, I would not come back," said Dhahwa
's 30-year-old wife, whose 8-year-old daughter is learning
computer skills at a primary school.
</P>
<P>
Some people fear the younger generation will forget their
Aulukuya roots. But not Urzertu. The former tribal hunter moved to
the city and is an author. Every year he goes back to the forest.
He said that while most of his former fellow-tribesmen are looking
for city-style comfort, those who actually live outside often are
lonely.
</P>
<P>
"No one can deny the impulse to come back," he said. "You feel
happy when you watch a good TV program, and you feel happy when
you capture a roe. But these feelings of happiness are extremely
different in both instances."
</P>
<P>
To ease their homesickness and preserve the culture, the
government has helped the tribe build a museum to exhibit their
vast knowledge of the forest and hunting.
</P>
<P>
Urzertu's main job -- he calls it his true responsibility -- is
to write novels and poems to record his memories of the tribal
life, the specific colors, smells, sounds and language that
represent the "unique happiness" he once knew.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that as a lifestyle, the hunting culture is
fading into the sunset, but the sense of being a tribal hunter
will not disappear so easily.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever we go, whatever we do, we will always remember that
the forest is our home," he said.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Young Chinese Taoist Abbot Enjoys Religious Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China. Xinhua News Agency is
releasing about 50 stories on Chinese men and women, young and old,
to illustrate the changes that have taken place in China over the
past half century. These people will describe their lives and how
they fit into the changes in the motherland. This is the 24th
story in the series.
</P>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- In his some 17 years of
religious activities, Zu Zhenxuan, 32, said the communist party
and the central government have never interfered in his religious
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Zu entered into the Taoist order at age 15 after graduating
from high school in his hometown in Liaoning province. At 24, he
became one of the eight head priests in China's famous Taoist
Wudang Mountain northwest of Hubei, central China, and the chief
Wushu coach at the Wudang Martial Art House.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, he went to Tiecha Mountain, the birthplace of Taoism
in his home province in northeast China, to become an abbot.
</P>
<P>
"I traveled freely to many parts of China to preach and even
went to Malaysia, and all local governments are very supportive
and helpful," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government sincerely desires to protect temples and
monasteries on the Taoist Tiecha Mountain.
</P>
<P>
After New China was founded in 1949, the temples and facilities
on the mountain were put on the national protection list and have
been renovated many times, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, the government's reform policies have invigorated
the religious life on the mountain, where he and his over 10
colleagues freely practice their liturgical rites.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the local government set aside 10 million yuan to
start a massive restoration project there, which includes drilling
wells, building roads and refurbishing temples.
</P>
<P>
The young abbot said the project is a fine example of
government support, which he deeply appreciates.
</P>
<P>
Taoism is the only major religion that came exclusively from
Chinese roots and grew to maturity on Chinese soil. An ancient
Chinese philosophy, Taoism gradually developed into an organized
religion during the reign of Emperor Shun Di of the Eastern Han
Dynasty (125-144 A.D.). Taoists strive to become one with nature
and live in harmony with the universe.
</P>
<P>
Its believers worship supernatural beings and believe that
their particular regimen, which includes meditation, use of charms
and spells, and ascetic practices, can help them attain
immortality.
</P>
<P>
Taoist temples and monasteries are often located in picturesque
mountains.

<P>
A tribal hunter, Dhahwa, 34, never misses his target, just like
his Stone Age ancestors. But there is a difference: a 7.62-mm
military rifle has replaced the bow.
</P>
<P>
This is the first roe he has captured this year.
</P>
<P>
"You can see the number of roe, deer and bears has decreased
over the past decades. But there is good news. It seems that the
animal is coming back after the government banned lumbering last
year," he says, his eyes gleaming.
</P>
<P>
At night, Dhahwa cooks his prey over a fire in his tent by a
river, while his wife weaves a basket from birch bark. His son,
Dhawell, watches the pot, sniffing the sweet smoke. Beside them
graze their friends, reindeer Nakia and courser Ghaxi.
</P>
<P>
It's a picture that was common a thousand years ago, but the
sight is becoming rare. The Dhahwas belong to the Aulukuya Tribe,
pop. 170, the only hunting tribe left in China.
</P>
<P>
The Aulukuya have lived for countless generations in the forest
of the Daxing'an Mountains in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, some 100 kilometers from Russia. Only half a
century ago, few people knew of the tribe's existence.
</P>
<P>
Now, globalization is shattering these "living fossils" of the
human race.
</P>
<P>
"Hunting had been our main means of existence, but climate
changes and increased human activities have made the forest area
smaller and the number of wild animals less," said the tribal head,
Gu Xinjun.
</P>
<P>
He said that unlike the old days, when the hunters roamed the
forest four seasons a year, they now are required to spend five
months in permanent residences in a newly-built village at the
foot of the mountain. There they can raise reindeer and sell them
to zoos and drugstores throughout China, and the money they make
has become their main source of income.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has tried to preserve the hunting tribe'
s ancient, unique culture, issuing hunting licenses to shoot any
animal, including the black bear, which is under State protection,
and providing them with free rifles, bullets, rice and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Anthropologist Kong Fanzhi said it is critical that they be
taught how to adapt to the modern world, and that adherence to
their old-fashioned ways should not be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
According to Kong, the hunting culture might survive longer if
the government continues to prohibit other ethnic people from
hunting and bans forest lumbering in the area, but in the end, it
cannot fight the temptations of modern civilization.

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Reform "Cradle" Striving to Become Economic Powerhouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province,
dubbed the "cradle" of the country's rural reform, has increased
its efforts to become a 21st Century economic powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
"We're striving to reach the goal by modernizing agriculture,"
said Provincial Governor Wang Taihua.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that his province, located in the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River, the country's longest river, is rich
in natural resources and has gone far in developing the rural
economy over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The most noteworthy step, Wang said, was its initiation of the
1978 "household contract responsibility system," in which people
were paid for their productivity, a practice that later spread
nationwide and set the pace for the modernization of the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the province has not only solved the long-standing
food and clothing problems, but also become a major producer of
grain, edible oil and cotton.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said, Anhui has been confronted with a variety of
challenges as China moves toward a socialist market economy with
an increasing demand for high-quality and marketable goods.
</P>
<P>
He said Anhui has launched a massive campaign to revitalize the
rural economy by relying on science and technology. In the years
to come, the province will introduce more advanced crop varieties
and agrotechniques, from both home and abroad, to replace
traditional, out-of-date ones.
</P>
<P>
Information networks of agrotechniques, production, and sales
also will be established across the province.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Qingdao on Way to Get a Subway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Qingdao, a famous coastal
city in East China's Shandong Province, will soon get a subway,
today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Construction has listed the venture among its
upcoming construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Investment of the first phase of the 16.43-km-long subway
amounts to 4.053 billion yuan (488.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Qingdao has been in great need of a subway due to the city's
hilly location, which limits the amount of traffic.
</P>
<P>
The subway station was completed in December 1995 and 1.2 km of
experimental railway will be finished by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, 71 percent of the facilities needed by
the subway project will be manufactured by domestic firms, which
will reduce the construction cost to 250 million yuan (30.1
million U.S. dollars) per km.
</P>
<P>
Upon its completion, the subway will have 15 transit stations,
according to the Qingdao Underground Railway Company.

<HEADLINE> SITIC Pays Off Foreign Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- With the recent settlement of
the 134-million-U.S.dollar Singaporean floating rate notes,
Shandong International Trust and Investment Corp (SITIC has paid
off all its foreign debts over the past two years, Tuesday's China
Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The pay-off of the 392-million-U.S.dollar foreign debts was
completed against a grim financial market, sources from the SITIC
said.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy of Guangdong International Trust and Investment
Corp (GITIC) last year had a negative impact on the industry, and
the opportunities for raising funds from overseas were closed for
Chinese trust companies for some time.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, SITIC has committed itself to controlling risks and
improving project management, which allowed it to pay off all
debts on time.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the foreign debt ratio of all China's state-owned
investment firms has been kept within a reasonable range," said
Wang Huisheng, secretary-general of the Investment Association of
China.
</P>
<P>
The assets of those firms total some 300 billion yuan (36.14
billion U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that most of the foreign debts have been used in
projects of infrastructure construction, basic industries and
pillar industries. Those projects have strong social and economic
results, which lay the foundation for the timely repayment of the
debts.
</P>
<P>
As for SITIC, its lawful and risk-controlled operations have
earned it the first position in the credit rating by Moody's among
all provincial trust companies in China for three consecutive
years.

<HEADLINE> Firms and Presses Gain Import Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Culture
yesterday gave the go-ahead for 28 of the country's companies and
publishing houses to import and publish cultural, literary,
artistic and audio-visual products.
</P>
<P>
To be eligible, publishers had to undergo intense questioning
about their business practices, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
"All of these companies and publishing houses have registered
funds of over 2 million RMB yuan (240,960 USD) and a good
reputation in publishing domestic audio-visual products," said Tuo
Zuhai, a leading official in charge of the work.
</P>
<P>
They must also have no history of suspicious or illegal
business dealings, especially those involving copyright laws, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Included in the group are big business such as China Gramophone
Record Corporation, China Record and Videotape Publishing House,
China International Television Corporation, Beijing Audio-Visual
Company and Shanghai Audio-Visual Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
China Book Import and Export Corporation (CBIEC), which has
previously gained license to import books, is now allowed to
expand its business scope to import of completed audio-visual
products.
</P>
<P>
CBIEC and other 27 companies are the first batch to win the
import rights for audio-visual products, and the ministry expects
to approve more businesses in the future, according to Tuo.
</P>
<P>
"The examination and approval steps are key to carrying out the
Managerial Measures on the Import of Audio-Visual Products," he
explained. The measures were issued jointly by the Ministry of
Culture and the General Administration of Customs on April 30.
</P>
<P>
The measures have defined what type of companies and publishing
houses were entitled to importing and publishing foreign audio-
visual products, and when this right would be re-examined to avoid
disorder in the field, he said, adding that this marked a major
advance towards regulating the business.
</P>
<P>
China has around 112 companies and publishing houses engaged in
unlicensed import and publication of overseas audio-visual
products.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Optimistic of Peace in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
optimistic that no clashes would mar the month-long period leading
to the resumption of peace talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), a senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio interview, National Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado said the situation in Mindanao has normalized
following the military's successful rescue operation for a
four-year-old kidnapped girl.
</P>
<P>
"We hope there would be no more clashes to delay the peace
process," Mercado noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent agreement reached by the government and the
MILF to resume talks on October 25 would boost the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"This can be helpful for us to be able to start the process. In
the meantime, things have normalized as far as the situation in
Mindanao is concerned," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last month, government troops killed several rebels during the
rescue operation in Basilan for four-year-old girl Wilmarie
Furigay.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said this shows the
government is in control over Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Also, the president has vowed to take steps to end official
neglect of the development of Mindanao in the past decades and
transform it into the country's food basket.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The grave humanitarian
crisis in East Timor should be given the topmost priority by the
United Nations, according to a five-member Security Council
delegation Monday.
</P>
<P>
The team, which just returned from Indonesia, proposed that a
council resolution be adopted to provide a framework for deploying
a U.N.-sponsored international force to cooperate with it in
restoring security in East Timor, as accepted by Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Due to security concerns, the delegation suggested that the
United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) reduce to a minimum
or evacuate its personnel in East Timor's capital of Dili before
the arrival of an international security presence.
</P>
<P>
During its five-day stay in Indonesia, the ambassadorial
delegation led by Namibian Permanent Representative to the U.N.
Martin Andjaba, met high-ranking government officials and visited
East Timor, conveying U.N.'s concerns about the deteriorating
security conditions in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In the U.N., Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Monday U.N.
Assistant Emergency Relief Coordinator Ross Mountain as U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator for the East Timor Crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council met Monday on the dispatch of the
international force to East Timor soon after Annan met
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Pumped-Storage Power Plant in Guangdong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China's first large-scale
pumped-storage hydro-power plant, located in this provincial
capital, has had a vital role in providing emergency electricity
for accidents in power stations in Guangdong Province and
neighboring Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
At the completion of the second construction phase in 2000, the
plant will be the world's largest pumped-storage hydro-electric
power plant with a total generating capacity of 2.4 million
kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The first phase included four pumped-storage generating sets
with 1.2 million kilowatt capacity, which were put into operation
in March 1994. One pumped-storage generating set in the second
phase went into use in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Pumped-storage Power Station is part of the Daya
Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong. Its major function is to
accommodate the power systems of Hong Kong and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's economy has soared in recent years, causing the
power system to experience widely fluctuating demand. For example,
on July 29 last year, the system's peak output was 11 million
kilowatts and the lowest was 6.98 million kilowatts, and balancing
the difference caused a severe strain on the system.
</P>
<P>
Before the pumped-storage power plant opened, Guangdong's power
system consisted of thermal power generating plants. The province
had to set a limit on electricity use during power shortages and
completely halt operations of some thermal electric generating
sets, which disturbed the efficiency of operations and forced
electricity costs to rise.

<TEXT>
<P>
Compared with thermal generating sets, the pumped-storage
generators have a quick response feature which can take the
machine from startup to full operation within three minutes, and
produce electricity in a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
The sets have provided critical backup for more than 20
emergencies in the local power system in recent years, avoiding
major power outages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Hong Kong-based power company has bought the
rights to use half of the generating capacity to balance the power
supply system in the region.
</P>
<P>
The use of the pumped-storage power will help Hong Kong reduce
4.7 percent of its thermal power generating cost, according to the
company.
</P>
<P>
The plant was co-funded by Guangdong Electric Power Company,
Guangdong Nuclear Power Investment Company and the State
Development and Investment Corporation. With 400 million U.S.
dollars in loans from the French government and Asian Development
Bank, the plant imported world-class generating sets and
production equipment from overseas.
</P>
<P>
There are 88 employees at the plant, which will become self-
automated when the second phase goes into operation next year.

<HEADLINE> Security Council met on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council met Monday on East Timor with no further
announcements on the dispatch of an international peace-keeping
force to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
After two hours of closed-door consultations, council
president, Peter van Walsum of the Netherlands said council
members welcome Indonesian President B.J. Habibie's readiness to
accept the force to restore order in the territory.
</P>
<P>
That is what he can tell the press as the mandate of the force
had not been nailed down, Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
Ruling out significant differences among the 15 council members
over the mandate of the force, he said it needs fine-tuning.
</P>
<P>
The discussions followed the meeting of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas soon after
the latter's arrival in New York.
</P>
<P>
Alatas was sent by President Habibie to discuss the details of
the U.N. proposal of sending such a force.
</P>
<P>
Both Annan and Alatas agreed that the move is an important step
in restoring peace and security in East Timor and the parties
should move ahead as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The Foreign Minister raised no conditions to the deployment of
a U.N.-authorized force," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief expressed his hope that with the Foreign
Ministers of Portugal and Australia now en route to New York, "the
details will be worked out in the next 24 hours or so".
</P>
<P>
Alatas said his talks with Annan will continue Tuesday on a
number of issues including the composition and the nature of the
force and the role of the Indonesian army in the peace-keeping
mission, and that he is open-minded towards the force's make-up.

Before attending the council meeting, Chinese Permanent
Representative to the U.N. Qin Huasun said China hopes that the
international community will fully take into account the
complexity and sensibility of the East Timor issue in terms of the
composition of the peace-keeping force.

China would like to see the international community to take a
positive approach towards the concrete requests raised by
Indonesia in this regard, he said.

<P>
China welcomes Indonesia's decision to invite the international
force, seeing it a very positive development, Qin said.

Indonesia's decision is a show of its sincerity of carrying out
its commitment to keeping peace and security in East Timor during
its transition to independence, Qin said, adding that China hopes
the international action will be constructive to a quick
restoration of security in East Timor. (cv)
