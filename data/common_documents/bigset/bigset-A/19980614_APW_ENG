Red Wings 2, Capitals 1 AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Start putting the Detroit Red Wings' names on
the Stanley Cup again.
	   Barring the greatest motivational speech of coach Ron Wilson's
career and a complete turnaround by the Washington Capitals, the
Cup is going back to Hockeytown for a second straight year.
	   Sergei Fedorov made a dlrs 12 million move and scored with 4:51
to play as the Red Wings beat the Capitals 2-1 Saturday night to
take a 3-0 lead in the Stanley Cup finals.
	   Only one team in NHL history has rallied from a 3-0 deficit in
the finals to win the Stanley Cup, the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1942
against Detroit.
	   ``It can't be better than this, waiting for the fourth game,''
said Tomas Holmstrom, who staked Detroit to an early lead. ``It's
up to us. It's going to be a battle out there.''
	   The victory came exactly one year after the Red Wings'
celebration of the Stanley Cup ended with a tragic limousine
accident that left defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov and team
masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov with head injuries.
	   This Detroit club can now become the first since the Pittsburgh
Penguins in 1991 and 1992 to capture consecutive Cups by winning
Game 4 of the best-of-7 series here on Tuesday night.
	   If the Red Wings do that, they will also become the first team
to win the NHL title with consecutive sweeps in the finals since
the New York Islanders capped a string of four consecutive titles
with sweeps in 1982 and 1983.
	   Coach Scotty Bowman also would tie Toe Blake's record for
Stanley Cup titles by a coach with eight.
	   ``It's deflating,'' Washington forward Craig Berube said. ``It's
do or die Tuesday. We have to go out and leave everything on the
ice. There's nothing left to save it for.''
	   Holmstrom got the other Detroit goal 35 seconds after the
opening faceoff. Brian Bellows of the Capitals tied the game at
10:35 of the third period on a power play.
	   Fedorov's game-winner was magnificent. He took a pass off the
side boards from Doug Brown at center ice and steamed into the
Capitals' zone with only defenseman Calle Johansson between him and
goaltender Olaf Kolzig.
	   Fedorov cut inside as he reached the right faceoff circle and
then snapped a shot that beat Kolzig over his glove.
	   ``A great player made a great move,'' Wilson said.
	   Detroit goaltender Chris Osgood didn't have to make a tough stop
over the final minutes, finishing with 17 saves.
	   As the Red Wings skated off the ice, the small number of Detroit
fans in the MCI Center chanted ``Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!''
	   Wilson, who has inspired the Caps with a couple of great rah-rah
speeches in the playoffs, seemed at a loss after the game.
	   ``Detroit is working hard and good teams make their own
breaks,'' Wilson said. ``You know, we got breaks in other series
where we worked hard. You know Detroit has been persistent and they
appear to be on a mission without a doubt.''
	   Dominated most of the game by Detroit but only down a goal since
the opening 35 seconds, Washington finally tied the game midway
through the third period with Darren McCarty off for tripping.
	   Adam Oates made the key play going to the net from the left
circle. His shot hit someone in the crease and Bellows came in
quickly and ripped it past Osgood for his fifth goal of the
playoffs.
	   Getting the first goal seemingly has been one of the keys to the
Red Wings' success in the playoffs this year. They are 12-1 when
scoring first.
	   Game 3 was only 35 seconds old when Steve Yzerman broke into the
Capitals zone, fought off a back check by Esa Tikkanen and got off
a shot while crashing into Kolzig. The puck came out of the pileup
and Holmstrom, fighting off a check by Todd Krygier, pushed it into
the open net.
	   Holmstrom, who had 22 points in 57 regular-season games, now has
18 (seven goals, 11 assists) in 21 playoffs contests. He has a goal
and three assists in this series.
	   It was the third straight one-goal loss for the Capitals, who
have managed to stay in this series because Kolzig has been
outstanding in net.
	   ``Experience has made a huge difference,'' Yzerman said. ``We've
been through a lot this season, good and bad.''
	   Detroit dominated the first Stanley Cup finals game in the
nation's capital, but Kolzig stopped almost everything, making 32
saves, including 12 in the first period as the Red Wings outshot
Washington 12-1.
	   The only other club to have just one shot in a period since 1968
was the Red Wings against New Jersey in 1995.
	   When Washington finally got going in the second period, Osgood,
the supposed weak link in the Red Wings' lineup, was outstanding.
	   He made a sliding stop on a power-play shot by Bellows in close,
stopped Peter Bondra on a great setup in front by Richard Zednik
and then made a snapping glove save on Bondra late in the period.

De La Hoya stops Charpentier in third round AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) _ Oscar's night was a short one, and the
Texas fans couldn't have been happier.
	   Fighting before a frenzied crowd of some 50,000, Oscar De La
Hoya put on a brief but brutally efficient show by stopping Patrick
Charpentier of France in the third round to retain his WBC
welterweight title fight.
	   De La Hoya of Mexico knocked down Charpentier three times in the
final round, with referee Laurence Cole stopping the bout at 1:56
of the third round after the challenger went down sitting on the
canvas from a final right hand.
	   ``Everything worked perfect,'' De La Hoya said. ``I took my
time. I was a real professional out there.''
	   It was the fourth title defense for De La Hoya, whose Oscar's
Night promotion drew one of the biggest U.S. boxing crowds since
Muhammad Ali beat Leon Spinks before 63,350 in the Superdome in New
Orleans 20 years ago.
	   And it didn't figure to last long after De La Hoya came out from
the opening bell throwing a stinging left jab that pushed back
Charpentier's head. De La Hoya knocked Charpentier down 53 seconds
into the third round with a left hook, put him down again 37
seconds later with a left uppercut and then finished him with the
right hand.
	   ``I thought I was better than ever,'' De La Hoya said. ``I had
no problems out there. After I hurt him I knew the knockdown was
coming.''
	   The fans who screamed De La Hoya's name as he entered the ring
dressed in a Mexican cowboy outfit and sombrero had barely settled
into their seats and the fight was over. But they still screamed
for him as he thanked them from the ring.
	   ``I thank the city of El Paso for giving me the strength and
opportunity to fight here before all these beautiful fans,'' De La
Hoya told the crowd.
	   Charpentier, the top-ranked WBC challenger, had never won a
fight outside his native France and found himself cast as the role
of the villain before a city that spent a week going wild with
anticipation over the fight.
	   Still, he fought gamely in the first few rounds, although he
took far more shots than he landed. De La Hoya was efficient and
calm as he stalked the challenger around the ring, digging left
hooks to the body and pushing his head back with the left jab.
	   After the second round, Charpentier turned to go back to his
corner and seemed to breathe a huge sigh of relief.
	   It wasn't to last long, however, as De La Hoya caught him with a
left hook in the next round that put Charpentier down. He got up at
the count of five but De La Hoya put him down quickly with a
perfect left uppercut.
	   Charpentier got up once more, only to take the final right hand
that put him down a third time.
	   ``He was hurt,'' referee Laurence Cole said. ``He was definitely
dazed.''
	   Charpentier had little to say as he sat on his stool as the
crowd erupted in delight when the fight was finally stopped.
	   ``I'm OK,'' he said. ``It was the head shots.''
	   De La Hoya, who fought five times in 1997, hadn't fought for six
months after injuring his left hand in training. But the hand did
not bother him against Charpentier.
	   ``If you hurt this guy you can take your time and take him
apart,'' trainer Gil Clancy told De La Hoya between rounds.
	   That's exactly what De La Hoya did, efficiently taking the 20-1
underdog apart.
	   De La Hoya, who weighed the class limit of 147 pounds (66.7
kilos), earned dlrs 4 million for the fight while Charpentier, 146
(66.2 kilos) , was paid dlrs 600,000.
	   On the undercard, Mexico's Cesar Bazan won a split decision over
Stevie Johnston to win the WBC lightweight title. Bazan, the
top-ranked challenger, used his six-inch height advantage to keep
Johnston away and take the fight by a 115-113 margin on two cards.
A third judge had Johnston ahead 116-112.
	   It was the first loss for Johnston in a 25-fight professional
career. He was defending the title for the fourth time.

Sound Bites: Audio reviews ``Songbird'' (Blix Street) _ Eva Cassidy 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   ``Songbird'' reveals a voice as sweet and pure, as powerful and
soulful as any in popular music, as well as a gift for a broad
diversity of styles, from gentle folk to swinging jazz-gospel. That
Eva Cassidy died of cancer at age 33 makes the story more
compelling, but ``Songbird,'' a compilation of earlier work, can
stand on its own greatness.
	   The album opens with a gorgeous ``Fields of Gold,'' featuring
Cassidy's aching, sad voice and delicate guitars. It closes with
what may be the best version of ``Over the Rainbow'' ever recorded.
It's certainly the most moving I have ever heard.
	   The songs in between reveal Cassidy as unclassifiable. She
swings on the traditional ``Wade in the Water,'' turns Pete
Seeger's ``Oh, Had I a Golden Thread'' into a piece of blissful
gospel, makes the folk song ``Wayfaring Stranger'' swing. She
covers Curtis Mayfield and Harold Arlen, Sting and Johnny Mercer,
and does them each proud.
	   ``Songbird'' is an astonishing album, full of wonderful singing
that only sounds better with repeated listening. It is well worth
seeking out.
	   _ By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Receiver'' (Compass) _ Farmer Not So John
	   It took a while, but eventually this second disc from the oddly
named Farmer Not So John took over my life. Maybe the opening song,
``Paperthin,'' is so giddily addictive it was hard to focus on the
rest of ``Receiver.''
	   ``Paperthin,'' despite its criminal overtones, is a sweetly
bouncy song full of all the possibilities of a summer evening in a
convertible with your sweetheart.
	   But things turn dark from there, as lap steel, guitars, mandolin
and what the liner notes call a ``weird looping device thingy''
combine to give ``Receiver'' a foreboding feeling, as if that
convertible were headed into a nasty line of thunderheads. The
weary ``For You I Will Pretend,'' the desperate ``Undertow'' and
the rumbling ``Consigned to Oblivion,'' which sounds like a cross
between Blue Rodeo and middle-period REM, are among the standout
tracks.
	   Despite the instrumentation, Farmer Not So John is not really an
alternative country band. It's one of those impossible-to-classify
bands, the kind that the small minds of so many radio programmers
cannot make room for and therefore cannot add to their play lists,
which is a real shame, because ``Receiver'' is one excellent album.
	   _ By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Make Some Noise'' (ARK21) _ Liquid Soul
	   Liquid Soul's second album is a mesmerizing collection of songs
that will move you, groove you and funkify your soul. The wicked
rhythm section and blazing hot horns combine to make this a nonstop
dance-a-thon. ``Make Some Noise'' holds together even better than
Liquid Soul's debut album, and doesn't so much mix jazz, old-style
funk and hip-hop as render the differences among them meaningless.
``Make Some Noise'' is irresistible.
	   _ By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Ophelia'' (Elektra) _ Natalie Merchant
	   Where's the passion? Where's the fire? Certainly not in Natalie
Merchant's new album, ``Ophelia.'' Cool competence is the order of
the day here, and that's the best that can be said of this
disappointing album from the former lead singer of 10,000 Maniacs.
	   _ By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``From the Choirgirl Hotel'' (Atlantic) _ Tori Amos
	   Tori Amos has never suffered from an under-supply of passion.
Maybe someday she will harness it along with her considerable
talent and put out a truly great album. ``From the Choirgirl
Hotel'' is not it.
	   The album suffers from the same excesses as other Amos albums,
including grandiosity and lyrics that mistake obscurity for
meaning, but her many devoted fans will see these as pluses rather
than minuses. A few of the songs actually make sense, even to
non-Toriphiles, with the deliciously funky ``Raspberry Swirl''
among the more accessible songs she's put out.
	   _ By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Elemental'' (CMC International) _ The Fixx
	   Old British modern rockers never retire _ they just cut their
hair and go acoustic.
	   Such is the latest method of The Fixx on ``Elemental,'' their
first original album in seven years. It has really been 15 years
since this band mattered, but they're on the mark once again.
	   The good stuff comes early with some memorable guitar hooks on
``Two Different Views,'' ``Going Without'' and best of all, ``Happy
Landings.''
	   Lead singer Cy Curnin displays excellent vocals as he examines
what is undoubtedly the peak-and-valley popularity of the band's
past.
	   The Fixx's signature great guitars hold the songs together well.
	   The band's long hiatus after hitting it big in the 1980s with
``One Thing Leads to Another'' and ``Saved by Zero'' is over.
Driven by sound musicianship, The Fixx comes off as fresh as ever.
	   _ By Ron Harris, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Nothing Lasts'' (Yikes Records) _ Cypher 7
	   Prepare to be unsettled by the sounds of Cypher 7. ``Nothing
Lasts'' could be interpreted as many things, but familiar isn't one
of them.
	   The lilting, digital dynamics on the band's double-CD are
described as ambient dub music, ``created and encoded'' by Jeff
Bova and Alex Haas. In layman's terms that means the boys don't
sing, play traditional musical instruments and are intent on
lulling listeners into submission with remixed digital sounds.
	   The sedate nature of Cypher 7's melodies blend Himalayan monk
chants, slow-dripping bass beats and other sound scraps. The
listener is pleasurably swept up in an array of aural snippets,
snatched from street life and patched onto a low backbeat.
	   The songs have a post-apocalyptic feel to them, conjuring images
of city ruins in a state of slow decay. ``Message Important''
layers a digitized melody over messages from the French resistance
announcing the end of World War II. If you're in the mood for
something out of the ordinary, and good, this is it.
	   _ By Ron Harris, Associated Press Writer.

At the Movies: 'Six Days, Seven Nights' AP Arts Editor 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: movie opened Friday
By DOLORES BARCLAY
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Robin Monroe is taking a much needed break from
her high-powered, stressful job as a magazine editor. She's off to
the South Pacific for a little romance with her nerdy fiance Frank.
Things get turned around, though, when a last-minute assignment
forces her to leave the tiny island where she's nestled with Frank
and fly to Tahiti for a shoot.
	   That's the setup for newfound romance in Ivan Reitman's castaway
comedy, ``Six Days, Seven Nights.'' It's a likable but lame romp
that further showcases the savvy comedic talents of Ann Heche, who
was such a delight in ``Wag the Dog.''
	   Robin (Heche) leaves the disappointed Frank (David Schwimmer) at
the hotel to sip fluffy drinks with little umbrellas while she
flies to Tahiti with Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford), a gruff,
burned-out pilot whose raggedy plane seems held together by nothing
more than faith.
	   A ferocious electrical storm forces them to crash-land on a
remote island. With the radio down, Robin, the stereotypical
sophisticated city girl, pulls out her cell phone to call for help.
It doesn't work, of course, as the smirking Quinn knows.
	   So the duo sets out to explore the island and figure out a way
to find help or at least an escape. They scramble up rocks, fall
through crevices and otherwise pummel their bodies but remain, in
true Hollywood style, fit and fresh. Finally, they paddle the
plane's inflatable raft around the island and spot a yacht at sea.
But their hopes for rescue are dashed when they see pirates in
another boat killing the yacht's occupants.
	   Meanwhile, the search team Frank has organized figures Robin and
Quinn to be dead, and Frank goes about the business of mourning his
fiancee. But not for long. He seeks comfort with Quinn's beautiful
and sexy companion, Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors).
	   Needless to say, there's a tidy wrap-up to the story and, since
it's a comedy, you can count on a happy ending.
	   Heche adds a breath of fresh air to Michael Browning's very
tired script. She's smart, sassy and a modern-day Carole Lombard.
She's also the perfect foil for the hard-case Ford. Theirs is a
balance much in the vein of Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart
in ``The African Queen'' or Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable in
``It Happened One Night.'' Unfortunately, Heche and Ford are
saddled with a weak script, fairly dumb dialogue and predictable
action.
	   The plot is so poorly constructed that it comes as a surprise
when Robin and Quinn fall into each other's arms because there
hasn't been any buildup or suggestion. The filmmakers are almost
saying: ``Hey, you got a pretty girl and a cute guy on a beach _
what else are they gonna do?''
	   And the characters are straight out of Central Casting, right
down to the vastly uninteresting Frank and the salacious Angelica.
	   But Heche and Ford are worth a watch, and the lush beauty of
Kauai, Hawaii, where the film was shot, is enticing.
	   ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' is a Touchstone Pictures release
produced by Reitman, Wallis Nicita and Roger Birnbaum. It is rated
PG-13 for some adult situations.

RETRANSMITTING for all needing

<TEXT>
	   GYMPIE, Australia (AP) _ Bashing Asians and Aboriginals and
boosting protectionism, Pauline Hanson's campaign swept through
rural Queensland like a bush fire. Her party was not likely to win
outright _ but there was no denying she dominated the state
elections.
	   No matter which party wins government after the closely
contested election _ vote-counting may go on for days _ Hanson's
One Nation party has the most reason for celebrating.
	   For the first time since the White Australia policy was
abolished in 1973, an Australian political party that appeals to a
belief racial superiority is firmly established as a viable
alternative to the mainstream parties.
	   Hanson published a book last year that said Aborigines were
cannibals that ate their woman and children. She describes Asian
neighborhoods as crime and drug-ridden ghettos. She has called for
a cutoff of Asian immigration to keep Australia from being
``swamped by Asians.''
	   But she broadened her appeal beyond these fringe positions by
tapping into Australians' insecurity about their jobs and future,
which many fear are at the mercy of impersonal international
economic forces.
	   One Nation outperformed expectations, scooping up 23 percent
statewide and more than 40 percent in at least a dozen districts.
In 34 districts, it ran first or second, beating one or both major
parties.
	   Hanson, who holds an independent seat in the national
parliament, was not even on the ballot.
	   Conservative Prime Minister John Howard now faces a similar
challenge from Hanson's forces when he calls a federal election, by
March 1999 at the latest.
	   Warning Howard of the battle to come, Hanson said Saturday: ``I
don't think it's hit them yet; I don't think they have a clue.''
	   Hanson's forces cut so deeply into the conservative vote in
Queensland that it has probably kept both major parties from
winning a parliamentary majority, resulting in a hung Parliament in
which One Nation holds the balance of power.
	   Howard fears that if he goes to an early national election, One
Nation is likely to win enough seats in the closely divided
national Senate to hold the balance of power there, blocking
passage of any legislation not to its liking.
	   From that position, One Nation could veto Howard's planned
privatization of the Telstra national telephone company, or his tax
reform that would include a new goods and services tax of 10 or 15
percent.
	   His best strategy now is to wait as long as he can before
calling the election and hope for a lucky break.
	   But the longer he waits, the harder the Australian economy will
be hit by the Asian economic crisis, which is just beginning to
ripple here. Howard will become even more vulnerable on economic
issues.
	   Hanson, in the run-up to the Queensland election, broadened her
appeal by latching onto the potent issue of the dislocation of
Australian workers by global economic forces; both Labor and
Howard's Liberal Party have worked since the 1980s to abolish
tariffs and protectionism that once sheltered Australian jobs and
industries.
	   The former fish-and-chips shop owner, more in touch with the
economic suffering of rural Queenslanders than her opponents,
understood the depth of this outrage and used it effectively in
Saturday's state election.
	   Howard's government, which has not displayed much political
skill lately, will have to run a masterful federal election
campaign to avoid the same damage that Hanson inflicted in
Queensland.

Lame, stray Thai dog gets ticket to San Diego 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thanks to a 16-year-old American girl,
a stray, dying mongrel not only got first class medical treatment
but also a temporary home in San Diego, Thai newspapers reported
Sunday.
	   The canine tale began last December when high school student
Mina Sharpe, who lives in Taiwan where her parents teach, found the
severely injured dog and its four malnourished puppies near a
seaside resort while on vacation in Thailand.
	   Rejecting suggestions the dog be put out of its misery, Sharpe,
who plans to study veterinary science, paid the animal's intensive
care bill before returning to Taiwan.
	   Frustrated by Taiwan's quarantine regulations, the Sharpe family
decided to send the dog to San Diego, where Mina's grandmother will
care for it before a permanent home is found.
	   Fitted with a special prosthetic device which reduces pressure
on its injured spinal cord, the dog departed for California on
Saturday, the Bangkok Post said.
	   The Bangkok hospital has found homes for the puppies.
	   The Post and other Newspapers described the story as miraculous
given the plight of most strays in Thailand.
	   In Bangkok alone, more than 50,000 are rounded up each year and
kept in a compound for three days. If nobody claims the dogs for
either ownership or adoption, they are destroyed.

Japan found to have used poison gas in World War II: report 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS 2nd graf reference to one officer, sted several
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese troops were found to have used poison gas
against Chinese military forces during World War II, a Japanese
newspaper reported Sunday, citing government documents on war
crimes trials held in China.
	   The Japanese Foreign Ministry documents released Saturday
include reports on a postwar Chinese court verdict which found a
Japanese military officer guilty of ordering the use of poison gas
on a northern China battlefield in May of 1942, the Mainichi
newspaper reported.
	   The reports detail the outcome of a war crimes trial held in
communist China from 1946 to 1949, the paper said.
	   Japan has said its wartime army manufactured and stored poison
gas in China, but it has not acknowledged that any chemical weapons
were actually used. China has said Japan used poison gas 2,900
times during World War II, killing thousands Chinese soldiers and
civilians.
	   As a signatory of last year's Chemical Weapons Convention treaty
banning chemical weapons, Japan has agreed to clean up stockpiles
of poison gas which were abandoned in China by the former Imperial
Japanese Army.

Spirited bidders snap up art seized from failed finance firms 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Paintings and other art objects once
displayed in elegant offices were snapped up this weekend in
Thailand at an auction of assets of collapsed financial firms, Thai
media reported Sunday.
	   The three-day auction of more than 1,000 items, which ended
Sunday, was expected to bring in more than an initial estimate of
30 million baht (dlrs 697,000).
	   The paintings, sculptures and other art-related objects were
seized by Thailand's Financial Restructuring Authority, a
government agency set up to liquidate the assets of 56 finance
companies which were shut down last year.
	   The closings were required by the International Monetary Fund as
part of its dlrs 17.2 billion bailout program for the depressed
Thai economy. The proceeds of the auction will go to pay the debts
of the failed companies.
	   ``The going prices have been very high, much higher than I
expected,'' an art gallery owner, Hongjorn Samae-ngamjaroen, was
quoted as saying by the Bangkok Post.
	   An untitled painting of a lotus pond by the late Thawee
Nandakwang was sold for 2.8 million baht (dlrs 65,000), way above
its starting bid of 400,000 baht (dlrs 9,300).
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai donated two of his sketches to the
auction, which was handled by Christies, the British auction house.
It was held at Bangkok's Queen Sirikit Natoinal Convention Center.

Constitutional Council to reconvene Monday to elect president 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Overcoming a series of deadlocks,
Cambodia's Constitutional Council was scheduled to convene Monday
to elect a president, a member of the body said.
	   Council member Prak Sok said the meeting will be chaired by Pung
Peng Cheng, one of three members appointed to the body by Cambodian
King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   He said the king's two other appointees _ veteran politicians
Son Sann and Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum _ were unlikely to attend the
meeting.
	   The two appear to be boycotting the session in protest against
the composition of the body. Six of the nine members are supporters
of Premier Hun Sen, Cambodia's key power broker.
	   Charged with determining the constitutionality of all laws, the
council would be called on to resolve disputes arising from
controversial electoral and political party regulations.
	   Its inaugural meeting had been stalled twice, prompting a
surprise visit by Hun Sen to King Sihanouk last week.
	   Details of the meeting weren't available, but the two were said
to have discussed ways to break the stalemate. Officials have
warned that elections scheduled for July 26 could be compromised if
the council is perceived as being too politicized.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party will be battling the royalist
FUNCINPEC party led by the king's son Prince Norodom Ranarridh in
the general election.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Residents in eastern Lebanon voted Sunday
in municipal elections that pit the president against his son in
the region's biggest town, where they are backing rival tickets.
	   About 4,000 Lebanese soldiers, backed by armor, were deployed in
the Bekaa Valley, the last region to vote in the four-stage
municipal elections held over the past four weeks.
	   Polls opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and are expected to close at 5
p.m. (1400gmt). Bekaa has 434,000 eligible voters who will choose
some 1,879 city council posts.
	   What distinguishes Sunday's round of elections from the previous
ones in Mount Lebanon, northern Lebanon, Beirut and southern
Lebanon is the absence of sectarian competition.
	   While the earlier stages focused on Muslim versus Christian
races, eastern Lebanon will only have ``Shiites against Shiites and
Christians against Christians,'' as a headline in the Christian
newspaper, Nidaa al-Watan, put it.
	   In Zahle, 37 kilometers (23 miles) east of Beirut, the election
has become a tussle within the president's own family.
	   President Elias Hrawi, his younger son Roy, and his nephew
Khalil Hrawi, a member of parliament, have endorsed a slate of
candidates for the 21-seat council in the family's hometown.
	   But George Hrawi, the president's elder son, has backed the
ticket of his father's arch-foe, Elie Skaff.
	   Skaff, a legislator, and President Hrawi are long-time rivals
for the leadership of Zahle's mostly Greek Catholic community.
	   George Hrawi, who shied away from politics until recently, says
he does not agree with his father's policies.
	   ``Let's put an end to the nine-year hijacking of Zahle's
decision-making,'' Skaff told a mass rally in a clear reference to
Hrawi's nine years in office.
	   On Saturday, Skaff accused the authorities of exerting
``pressure'' on voters in favor of his rivals.
	   Some newspapers have said the Zahle race could have a bearing on
the president's political future as Hrawi, whose extended term
expires in November, may seek another period in office.
	   A fierce race also is expected in the valley's second biggest
city, Baalbek, where the two rival Shiite Muslim parties, Hezbollah
and Amal, are vying for control of the 21-seat municipal council.
	   The pro-Syrian Amal has joined forces with a coalition of
Syrian-backed leftist parties in a bid to defeat the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah.
	   The elections, the first municipal polls for 35 years, are
widely seen as bolstering democracy after the 1975-90 civil war.

Government to calm nerves as Hanson takes conservative votes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ORANGE, Australia (AP) _ As vote counting resumed Sunday in
Australia's Queensland state election, a party in the governing
coalition urged members not to panic after gains by rival One
Nation party led by right-wing populist Pauline Hanson.
	   Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, who leads the
ruling coalition's junior party, the Nationals, told a meeting of
party faithful that there will be no policy reversals or
panic-induced steps in the wake of the Queensland poll.
	   Around 80 percent of the primary vote had been counted by early
Sunday, but final results may still be 10 days away.
	   The Nationals, a rural-based conservative party, were widely
expected to be the party hardest hit in the Queensland poll, as
voters deserted in droves to Hanson's One Nation party.
	   Delegates to a meeting of the Nationals' New South Wales branch
said Sunday the party must now adopt Hanson-like policies or face a
drubbing in the national elections.
	   One Nation has won at least nine electoral districts and has a
chance of capturing 10 more in the 89-seat Queensland Parliament
after attracting between 23 percent and 25 percent of the vote in
Saturday's poll.
	   The victory is not enough to bring a One Nation-led government
to power, but party members will hold sway over a conservative
government which is expected to need their support to continue
ruling.
	   The Labor opposition may still win enough seats to wrest power
from the conservative coalition, however.
	   One Nation's success, just 15 months months after Hanson
launched the party, represents the emergence of a new political
force in Australia. It is also a bad omen for Prime Minister John
Howard, who must call an election before March 1999.
	   Howard is believed to fear that One Nation may win enough seats
in the closely divided national Senate to hold the balance of power
there, blocking passage of any legislation not to the party's
liking.
	   Hanson advocates economic protectionism, a halt to immigration
and the abolition of welfare payments to Aborigines.
	   Observers say One Nation's success is attributable to voter
anger and resentment about government reforms including reducing
tariff protection for farmers and ranchers, privatization of
government instrumentalities and the toughening up of gun ownership
laws.

India says peace efforts ignored, Pakistan criticizes sanctions sanctions. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous and UPDATES with Pakistan criticizing
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India has lashed out at industrialized
nations for imposing antinuclear sanctions and ignoring its peace
efforts, while neighboring rival Pakistan warned that sanctions
cannot undo what has been done in the nuclear arena.
	   In the wake of a nuclear tests carried out in South Asia, New
Delhi said it has moved to stabilize the region. It cited its
announcement of a moratorium on further tests, a no-first-use
agreement proposal, and an offer to hold peace talks with Pakistan.
	   ``These gestures reflect both our desire to further the cause of
global disarmament and nonproliferation as well as our dedication
to promoting peace and stability in the region,'' said a statement
released Saturday by India's foreign ministry.
	   But the world's eight leading industrialized nations, known as
the Group of Eight or G-8, fear the consequences of the move by
India and Pakistan to join the nuclear weapons club. As a result,
they have agreed to impose economic sanctions on both countries.
	   India detonated what it said were five nuclear tests on May 11
and 13. Pakistan followed with a claim of six tests two weeks
later.
	   Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf told reporters
Saturday that ``the policy to punish in order to push the (nuclear)
nonproliferation agenda will not succeed.''
	   Instead, Altaf said the international community should move
quickly to draw up a blueprint to resolve the 51-year dispute over
the Kashmir region that has been the flash point of two of three
wars between India and Pakistan.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week,
Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Gohar Ayub, warned that a fourth
conflagration on the Asian subcontinent would escalate into a
nuclear war.
	   Calling India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party
government ``trigger happy,'' Ayub said, ``where such threats are
being made by Hindu fundamentalists, you can expect a nuclear
launch and a nuclear escalation.''
	   On Friday, the two countries clashed over whose plans for peace
talks should prevail, a dispute similar to arguing over the shape
of the conference table that shows how far India and Pakistan have
to go to normalize relations.
	   At a meeting in London Friday, Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States agreed to postpone all
development loans to India and Pakistan, two of the poorest
countries in the world.
	   Money from the industrialized world that helps meet ``basic
human needs'' was exempted from the U.S.-led sanctions.
	   India has already seen more than dlrs 1 billion in loans delayed
because of its tests.
	   ``It is a matter of regret that the G-8 Foreign Minister's Joint
Communique has ... repeated unrealistic prescriptions couched in
the language of pressure,'' India said.
	   The G-8 urged India and Pakistan to halt further tests, refrain
from building nuclear weapons, and resume a dialogue ``without
delay'' to address the root causes of tensions in the region.
	   It also urged both countries to avoid threatening military
movements, discourage terrorist activity and develop new
confidence-building measures.
	   ``Coercive and intrusive prescriptions are not only ill-advised
but also counterproductive,'' the Indian foreign ministry statement
said.
	   India reiterated its call for dialogue with Pakistan but
repeated that it would stand for no outside mediation in such
talks.
	   Pakistan wants outside involvement on the Kashmir issue,
believing it is at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks with its much
larger and more powerful neighbor.

Palestinian arrested after stabbing attempt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A young Palestinian with a knife in his hand
was arrested Sunday in a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem after he
entered a girls' school and tried to stab one of the students,
police said.
	   A taxi driver who saw the incident fired some shots into the air
with a pistol and the young man ran off. Passersby chased him and
overpowered him, police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said.
	   The suspect, a resident of Bethlehem, slipped into a
technological school in the Romema district of west Jerusalem while
the security guard was temporarily absent from the gate, Ben-Ruby
said.
	   The suspect, who seemed to be mentally disturbed, kept mumbling
that he wanted to stab Jews, Ben-Ruby said.

Mahathir warns foreign investors against meddling in politics 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad on Sunday warned foreign investors against meddling in his
country's politics.
	   Malaysia welcomes investment from overseas, but will oppose any
effort by foreigners to use economic clout to influence domestic
politics, Mahathir told a gathering of nearly 2,000 people at Kuala
Lumpur's Independence Square.
	   ``We do no want foreign investors to come to gain benefits only
for themselves and even (be) prepared to play a role in determining
the leadership and other issues,'' Mahathir said.
	   ``We are capable of managing our country politically.''
	   Most of those who attended the rally were supporters from the 13
components of the ruling Barisan National coalition. It was staged
ahead of a general assembly of Mahathir's United Malays National
Organization that is slated to begin Friday.
	   In his speech, Mahathir urged Malaysians to contribute to a
national fund to help the cash-strapped government bolster
reserves. He also thanked companies which promote the use of
Made-in-Malaysia products.
	   Mahathir reiterated his belief that free trade can undermine
national sovereignty.
	   ``God Willing, we will manage our economy so that we will remain
free and our independence will not be affected,'' he said.
	   In addition, the Malaysian leader exhorted his countrymen to
guard against racial discord in times of economic turmoil.
	   Tension between the country's three main ethnic groups _ Malays,
Chinese and Indians _ remains subdued despite the economic
downturn. But attacks on the Chinese community in neighboring
Indonesia in recent weeks has stirred concern that trouble may
break out in Malaysia as well.
	   To demonstrate a commitment to fiscal austerity, Mahathir and
his wife arrived at the rally in a 650 cc Kancil car, the smallest
automobile made by the national car maker, Proton. Many other party
leaders came in imported limousines, however.

Palestinian arrested after stabbing attempt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A young Palestinian with a knife in his hand
was arrested Sunday in a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem after he
entered a girls' school and tried to stab one of the students,
police said.
	   A taxi driver who saw the incident fired some shots into the air
with a pistol and the young man ran off. Passersby chased him and
overpowered him, police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said.
	   The suspect, a resident of Bethlehem, slipped into a
technological school in the Romema district of west Jerusalem while
the security guard was temporarily absent from the gate, Ben-Ruby
said.
	   The suspect, who seemed to be mentally disturbed, kept mumbling
that he wanted to stab Jews, Ben-Ruby said.

England coach sees positives in two losses 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ By process of often painful
elimination, England rugby union coach Clive Woodward says he's
found a team that will give powerful New Zealand a run for its
money.
	   ``I believe we have 15 players who will give this All Black team
a big shove in the test match,'' Woodward said Sunday after his
side's 18-10 loss Saturday to New Zealand A.
	   ``If we were a bit more street-wise _ we were more so in the
first half than in the second _ we could have won the game.''
	   New Zealand A, effectively a New Zealand second 15, took England
on in their own forward game, dominated and inflicted a second
defeat on the side following their cruel introduction to southern
hemisphere rugby across the Tasman a week ago.
	   However, Saturday's loss at Rugby Park in atrocious conditions
was a significant improvement on last week's record 76-0 test
defeat by Australia.
	   England made a dramatic turnaround in a week.
	   Their loose forwards were not caught in the breakdowns all the
time, players got to their feet quickly and tackled soundly, and
the pack managed some continuity.
	   England's next tour match is against the New Zealand Academy in
Invercargill on Tuesday. New Zealand and England play the first
test on June 20 in Dunedin. (djp)

Friend of Rabin's killer convicted as accessory 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A young woman who was a friend of Yitzhak
Rabin's murderer was convicted Sunday of knowing of the killer's
intention and failing to inform the police.
	   Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, was a friend of Yigal Amir, who boasted
to her that he was planning to assassinate the prime minister, in
order to stop the peace process and the handing over of land to the
Palestinians.
	   Amir is serving a life sentence for the November 1995 murder.
	   Har-Shefi pleaded not guilty. She said she did not believe that
Amir really intended to do it. She told the Tel Aviv Magistrates
Court that she thought he was just trying to impress her.
	   Sentence will be handed down at a later date. Har-Shefi faces a
maximum on two years in prison.
	   However Judge Mira Litzky said Amir told her repeatedly that he
intended to kill Rabin, she could not be certain he was bluffing
and she was obliged by law to inform the police.
	   Har-Shefi was acquitted of a second charge of helping Amir to
obtain arms. The prosecution said she informed Amir of the location
of the armory in the West Bank settlement of Bet-El where she
lived, and gave him the name of another settler who could teach him
how to assemble a bomb.

Rise of Australian right-wing seen hurting relations with Asia 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Australia-Queensland-Election
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Political leaders in Australia warned
Sunday the success of Pauline Hanson's right-wing One Nation party
in this weekend's Queensland state election will hurt Australia's
reputation in Asia.
	   Hanson, who claims Australia is in danger of being ``swamped''
by Asians, advocates an end to immigration and has called for an
end to welfare benefits for Aborigines. She also opposes foreign
companies owning property in Australia.
	   The official tally of the Queensland election was not expected
for several days as vote counting continues.
	   But the One Nation party has won at least nine electoral
districts and has a chance of capturing 10 more in the 89-seat
Queensland Parliament after attracting between 23 percent and 25
percent of the vote in Saturday's poll.
	   Shane Stone, the conservative Chief Minister of the Northern
Territory, said One Nation's success will send a signal to Asia
that Hanson's views are shared by most Australians.
	   ``With this success firmly in her grasp, the focus will be on
her and that will have a devastating effect on (Asia's) view of
Australia,'' Stone said in Darwin.
	   ``There will be a huge question mark over the commitment of
Australia to the region.''
	   In Melbourne, Victoria state Labor opposition leader John Brumby
said One Nation's success will cause lasting damage to Australia's
trading partnerships.
	   ``It is no secret that the result of this election was being
watched by our trading partners in Asia and Europe and right around
the world and in that sense it's extremely damaging ... it's a
disastrous result,'' Brumby said.
	   Queensland Tourism, Small Business and Industry Minister Bruce
Davidson said a hung parliament _ where a conservative coalition
retains power, but only with the support of One Nation candidates _
would create business uncertainty and deter investment in the
state.
	   Australian businesses in Asia have already begun to prepare for
a backlash, saying One Nation's success will reinforce stereotypes
of Australians as racists.
	   Steven McCormack, international relations officer for Chiway
Corp., which promotes Australian educational courses throughout
China, said Hanson's reputation had strengthened a widespread
belief that Australians do not like Chinese.
	   ``(Chinese people) won't hear that Pauline Hanson is just a
minority party, they will just hear that Australians don't like
Chinese and that perception which already exists will be
reinforced,'' McCormack told The Australian Associated Press in
Beijing.
	   Hanson has already received wide coverage in the Asian press.
	   Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper ran a full-page
feature article on Hanson on the eve of the election, describing
the Queensland poll as a test of how seriously Australians took
``her racist vision.''
	   The article suggested there would be an immeasurable impact on
Australia's image if the election result meant ``legitimizing the
backward, primitive and dark forces which drive Ms. Hanson and One
Nation.''

Suharto denies amassing fortune, says legal adviser 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Indonesia
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former Indonesian President Suharto
has denied allegations he amassed a fortune during his 32 years in
power, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The Republika newspaper quoted Suharto's newly appointed legal
adviser, Johanes Jacob, as saying the 77-year-old former autocrat
would welcome any lawful investigation into his affairs.
	   But, the paper said, Suharto's advisor said that any demands of
the ex-president must be made through proper legal channels.
	   Suharto resigned last month after riots and other protests
erupted amid the Southeast Asian country's worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   Critics have said the Suharto family amassed wealth from huge
business empires which were built by abusing its influence. Many
want Suharto himself put on trial to face corruption charges and
some have urged the government to seize his assets, estimated to
total between dlrs 20 billion and dlrs 40 billion.
	   However, Suharto's legal advisor said he has provided documents
to the government which show there was no wrongdoing by the former
leader or his family. The papers were sent to Indonesia's
attorney-general, who is carrying out a broad inquiry into the
allegations of corruption during Suharto's rule.
	   In a separate interview published Sunday by the Media Indonesia
newspaper, Jacob said he had been appointed to lead Suharto's legal
team even though he was not an accredited lawyer.
	   Suharto's eldest daughter Tutut has reportedly confirmed her
father has appointed Jacob to defend him.
	   The newspaper Kompas quoted her as denying earlier reports that
Suharto had engaged a team of foreign lawyers to protect him from
allegations of wrongdoing.
	   President B.J. Habibie, a longtime friend who served as a
Cabinet minister and vice president before replacing Suharto, has
warned Indonesians not to seek unlawful retribution against the
former leader.

Bulldogs, St. Kilda maintain edge 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Football League
powerhouses Western Bulldogs and St. Kilda continued their one-two
domination of Australian Rules football with easy victories Sunday.
	   The Bulldogs rolled to their 10th victory in 12 matches with an
18.14 (122) to 15.6 (96) win over Fremantle, while St. Kilda easily
handled Collingwood 17.15 (117) to 11.16 (82).
	   The results left the Bulldogs in top spot on the ladder with 40
points while St. Kilda, with a 9-3 record, is in second with 36
points.
	   From there, it's eight points down to six teams that share third
place on 28 with 7-5 records _ West Coast, the Sydney Swans,
Geelong, Richmond, North Melbourne and Melbourne.
	   In two other matches Sunday, Richmond beat North Melbourne 19.13
(127) to 14.8 (92) and the Brisbane Lions drew 18.15 (123) with
Port Adelaide.
	   On Saturday, a strong last quarter from Adelaide midfielder Mark
Ricciuto in his return from injury led his side to a two-point win
over Essendon. The Crows scored four consecutive behinds to win
15.18 (108) to 15.16 (106).
	   Geelong, finalists for six of the past seven years, moved into
the top eight for the first time this season after beating
Melbourne 22.9 (141) to 7.4 (46). Geelong kicked the first 15 goals
of the match.
	   Carlton beat Sydney 14.16 (100) to 11.8 (74), the Swans' third
loss in a row.
	   On Friday, the West Coast Eagles held Hawthorn scoreless for the
first 20 minutes of the fourth quarter to beat the Hawks 19.9 (123)
to 17.6 (108). The teams were level after three quarters. (djp)

Government tries to calm nerves as Hanson takes conservative votes Precede ORANGE 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment from prime minister
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Stung by the success of right-wing
populist Pauline Hanson in a state election, Australia's
conservative government on Sunday played down her chances of
gaining similar support nationally and urged its coalition members
not to panic.
	   ``Irrespective of the outcome it would be foolish for the
coalition ... to ignore the very strong showing of (Hanson's party)
One Nation,'' Prime Minister John Howard said.
	   ``There are clear lessons to be learned from the result. These
include the genuine sense of vulnerability felt by many Australians
during times of economic and social change.''
	   But ``it is always an error to fully translate a state election
result to the federal arena'' and it was no reason for the
government to abandon or modify its policies, including taxation
reform and Aboriginal native title legislation, Howard said.
	   A national election is due within a year.
	   Hanson advocates economic protectionism, a halt to immigration
and the abolition of welfare payments to Aborigines.
	   In its first election test since its creation 15 months ago, One
Nation has won up to 25 percent of the vote in the Queensland
election, mostly at the expense of ruling conservative coalition
parties.
	   Observers say One Nation's success is attributable to voter
anger and resentment about government reforms including reducing
tariff protection for farmers and ranchers, privatization of
government agencies and the toughening of gun ownership laws.
	   One Nation has won at least nine electoral districts and has a
chance of capturing 10 more in the 89-seat Queensland Parliament.
Around 80 percent of the primary vote had been counted Sunday, but
final results may still be 10 days away.
	   The victory is not enough to bring a One Nation-led government
to power, but party members will hold sway over a conservative
government that is expected to need their support to continue
ruling.
	   The Labor opposition may still win enough seats to wrest power
from the conservative coalition, however.
	   Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, who leads the
ruling coalition's junior party, the Nationals, told a meeting of
party faithful in Orange, New South Wales state, that there will be
some policy ``fine tuning,'' but no reversals or panic-induced
steps in the wake of the Queensland poll.
	   The Nationals, a rural-based conservative party, were widely
expected to be the party hardest hit in the Queensland poll, as
voters deserted in droves to Hanson's One Nation party.
	   Delegates to a meeting of the Nationals' New South Wales branch
said Sunday the party must now adopt Hanson-like policies or face a
drubbing in the national elections.
	   Prime Minister Howard is believed to fear that One Nation may
win enough seats in the closely divided national Senate to hold the
balance of power there, blocking passage of any legislation not to
the party's liking.

Iraq says it is hard to satisfy U.N. arms monitors 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Sunday complained that chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler's demands for disarmament are only
designed to prolong economic sanctions on Iraq indefinitely.
	   Butler, who arrived in Baghdad Thursday, presented Iraq with him
a list of steps the government must take to back its claim that it
has dismantled all weapons of mass destruction and other illegal
weapons program. Until that happens, the sanctions will stay in
place.
	   Butler ``has put an impregnable wall on the path of ending the
unfair embargo,'' Sami Saadoun, head of Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz's office, wrote in a front-page article in Babil. The
newspaper, Iraq's most influential, is owned by President Saddam
Hussein's eldest son, Odai.
	   Butler ``has left little hope for us to reach the end of the
tunnel,'' said the article. Saadoun has been a regular participant
in previous Iraq-U.N. disarmament talks.
	   The article is a sign of Iraqi frustration at being presented
with another list of demands even after seven years of inspections.
	   In the list of demands, which he has described as ``a road
map,'' Butler is asking Iraq to hand over information on long-range
missiles, prove it has scrapped biological and chemical warheads,
and fully account for its production of VX nerve gas and germ
warfare weapons.
	   Butler held two rounds of talks with Aziz Saturday, and a third
one on Sunday. A lower-level technical team grouping weapons
inspectors from both sides also met. No details of the talks were
available.
	   The Babil article said that during Saturday's meeting Butler and
his team focused on ``minute details which are impossible to deal
with.'' It did not elaborate.
	   ``This pursuit shows that Butler is implementing a U.S. and
British demand to keep sanctions in place the longest time possible
... the thing Iraq cannot accept,'' it said. The sanctions were
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Officials of the delegations said progress was made Saturday in
proving Iraq's claims that it destroyed and buried its biological
and chemical missile warheads. No details were available.

Hanson's rise may hurt Australia's relations with Asia, leaders warn

Eds: UPDATES with quote from Victorian premier
With BC-Australia-Queensland-Election
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Political leaders on both sides warned
Sunday that the success of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party in the
Queensland state election will hurt Australia's reputation
overseas.
	   Hanson advocates an end to immigration, claims Australia is in
danger of being ``swamped'' by Asians, and has called for an end to
welfare benefits specifically targeting Aborigines. She also
opposes foreign companies owning property in Australia.
	   One Nation won at least nine electoral districts and has a
chance of capturing 10 more in the 89-seat Queensland Parliament
after attracting between 23 percent and 25 percent of the vote in
Saturday's poll. Counting is continuing and the final outcome won't
be known for days.
	   ``The sort of message this sends out about Australia to the rest
of the world is all going to be bad news, and it doesn't matter
where you go in the world over the next few weeks, the news about
Australia will be bad,'' said Jeff Kennett, premier of Victoria
state.
	   ``It will be that Australia ... has in some way become less
tolerant than it was in the past, is less tolerant of its major
trading nations.''

Friend of Rabin killer convicted of failing to inform police 
</HEADLINE>
By DANNY BEN-TAL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Isral (AP) _ A young woman who was a friend of former
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's murderer was convicted Sunday of
knowing of the killer's intentions and failing to inform the
police.
	   Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, was a friend of Yigal Amir, who boasted
to her that he was planning to assassinate Rabin in order to stop
the peace process and the handing over of land to the Palestinians.
	   Amir is serving a life sentence for the November 1995 murder.
Har-Shefi, who pleaded not guilty, could face up to two years in
prison. Her lawyer said an appeal was planned.
	   Har-Shefi told the Tel Aviv Magistrates Court she did not
believe Amir really intended to kill Rabin. She said she thought he
was trying to impress her.
	   However, Judge Mira Litsky said there were contradictions in
Har-Shefi's testimony and it was clear she was aware of Amir's
intention to kill Rabin.
	   ``She took him seriously, not as a liar indulging in
fantasies,'' she said.
	   The judge noted that on the night of Rabin's murder, when Israel
radio reported that the killer was from Amir's hometown, Herzliya,
Har-Shefi immediately telephoned him.
	   Har-Shefi testified that Amir, a right-wing extremist, told her
religious precepts permitted him to kill Rabin because the prime
minister's plans to hand over territory to the Palestinians
threatened the security of Jews.
	   Rabin was shot dead at a peace rally in Tel Aviv.
	   Har-Shefi showed no emotion as the 110-page verdict was read.
She sat sketching on a pad, rarely looking up, then refused to
answer questions from the large crowd of reporters.
	   Har-Shefi was acquitted of a second charge of aiding and
abetting Amir in his efforts to obtain arms illegally.
	   The prosecution said she informed Amir of the location of the
armory in the West Bank settlement of Beit-El where she lived and
gave him the name of another settler who could teach him how to
assemble a bomb.
	   Sentencing was scheduled for Sept. 15.

English, Marseille fans clash; four arrested 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Several dozen English World Cup fans
clashed with a group of Marseille youths overnight, injuring at
least one police officer and prompting the arrests of four people,
officials said Sunday.
	   The clash broke out when the Marseille youths began harassing
about 200 English soccer fans outside the Le Quai bar on the
Canebiere, the city's main avenue.
	   Several dozen English fans showered the youths with bottles, and
police intervened to halt the clash. One policeman was injured and
hospitalized, and four people were arrested, authorities said.
	   The clash came ahead of Monday's match in Marseille between
England and Tunisia. About 1,000 of the expected 9,000 English fans
have already arrived in the city.

Egypt to mediate between Eritrea and Ethiopia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will try to
arrange a cease-fire between Eritrea and Ethiopia in an attempt to
find a peaceful solution to their border conflict, Eritrea's
foreign minister said Sunday.
	   ``President Mubarak has assured us that he will do his best (to)
try to contact the other party (Ethiopia), and try to bring both
parties to a cease-fire and peaceful solution,'' the minister,
Haile Woldetensae, told reporters after meeting Mubarak here.
	   He said Eritrea welcomes Mubarak's initiative.
	   On Friday, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin met with
Mubarak in Cairo and said his country will not negotiate as long as
Eritrea occupies Ethiopian lands.
	   The United States and Rwanda are also trying to resolve the
conflict but have made no progress.
	   Border war between the two Horn of Africa countries broke out
May 6 when Ethiopia accused Eritrea of occupying a swath of land
along their border. The two sides differ over where Italy, the
former colonial power, drew the border.

Financial markets worried by One Nation election support 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Australia-Queensland-Election
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The success of Australia's One Nation
party in the Queensland state election could lead to falls on
financial markets if it is repeated nationally, economists warned
Sunday.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson's nationalistic economic ideas
would drive investors away even without formal policy changes,
Citibank economists Stephen Koukoulas and Annette Beacher said in a
report.
	   ``If support for One Nation in Queensland is matched in other
states, concerns about the shape of the federal Parliament after
the next federal election will warrant bearishness for the
Australian dollar, bonds and stocks,'' the report said. A federal
election in due by March 1999.
	   The general thrust of the One Nation economic platform is
greater industry protection, subsidies, foreign aid cuts, import
bans, severe curtailing of foreign investment and lower
immigration, the report said.
	   In its first electoral test since being created 15 months ago,
One Nation has attracted between 22 and 25 percent of the
Queensland vote, which should give it between nine and 12 seats in
the state's Parliament.
	   Commonwealth Bank of Australia managing director David Murray
warned Sunday that the success of One Nation in Queensland may put
pressure on the Australian dollar and interest rates.
	   Bankers Trust Australia international strategist Dirk Morris
said One Nation's strong showing in the state election will be ``a
major shock'' to the financial markets and foreign investors.

Qantas cuts services to Asia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Qantas Airways Ltd. said Sunday it will
cancel its services to Vietnam and cut the number of flights to
Tokyo because of falling demand blamed on the Asian economic
crisis.
	   The Australian airline said that in August, it would suspend one
of its twice-weekly Sydney-to-Tokyo flights, and both of its weekly
flights to Vietnam.
	   Its five flights a week from Sydney and Cairns to Fukuoka,
Japan, will be suspended in October, spokesman Geoff Dixon said.
	   Extra services will be added to the United States, Singapore,
New Zealand and Bali, he said.
	   Dixon said the changes reflected the impact of the Asian
economic situation, which had already led many other airlines to
curtail their operations in the region.
	   ``We will monitor the situation closely with a view to
reintroducing services when demand begins to strengthen,'' he said.

Eds: UPDATES with bout over; De La Hoya quote
By EDUARDO MONTES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) _ When a party lasts a week, you'd think it
would eventually run out of steam.
	   But with a guest of honor like Oscar De La Hoya and an
invitation list that appeared to include an entire city, El Paso
seemed like it would never stop celebrating.
	   Some 50,000 people packed the Sun Bowl on Saturday night to
watch De La Hoya successfully defend his WBC welterweight title
against No. 1 challenger Patrick Charpentier.
	   ``I thank the city of El Paso for giving me the strength, the
opportunity to fight here (and) for all these wonderful, beautiful
fans,'' De La Hoya said. ``I promise you one more thing _ that I
will be back.''
	   To a person, excited fans agreed this was the city's biggest
event in years.
	   ``The Cowboys were a big deal and the Rolling Stones, but this
is definitely bigger,'' said Millie Garcia, one of hundreds of
women who turned out to get a glimpse of De La Hoya.
	   The Dallas Cowboys have scrimmaged twice in the Sun Bowl, once
before a sellout crowd, and the Rolling Stones have also filled the
stadium in recent years. De La Hoya's fight topped them all when it
came to excitement.
	   Unlike the other one-day events, De La Hoya's trip to El Paso
kicked off a week-long frenzy that seemed to consume most of the
city, or at least the city's women.
	   Hundreds showed up to greet De La Hoya at the airport Tuesday.
Hundreds more crashed a ``secret'' workout Wednesday apparently
discovered by some young girls who followed De La Hoya's tour bus
through the city.
	   On Saturday, the Sun Bowl field disappeared under lights,
cameras and a voluminous tent shielding a party for some of the
city's notables, among others.
	   There was also unexpected excitement as wind gusting over 25 mph
buffeting the scaffolding supporting the lights over the ring. As
the metal bars swayed, security officials cleared ringside seats
and an undercard fight was delayed for about 20 minutes until the
scaffold could be secured.
	   Amidst all this, the boxing match seemed almost incidental.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ZAHLE, Lebanon (AP) _ Residents in eastern Lebanon voted Sunday
in municipal elections that pit the Christian president against his
son in the region's biggest town, where they are backing rival
tickets.
	   About 4,000 soldiers, backed by armor, were deployed in the
Bekaa, the last region to vote in the four-stage municipal
elections, which are being held for the first time in 35 years.
	   Polls opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and are expected to close at 5
p.m. (1400 GMT). The Bekaa has 434,000 eligible voters who will
choose some 1,879 city and town council posts.
	   What distinguishes Sunday's round of elections from the previous
ones held in the past four weeks in Mount Lebanon, northern
Lebanon, Beirut and southern Lebanon is the absence of sectarian
competition. The other elections focused on Muslim versus Christian
races.
	   But in eastern Lebanon, Christian are fighting Christian in
Zahle, the site of the presidential family contest, and Shiites
against Shiites in Baalbek where another fierce race is underway.
	   President Elias Hrawi, his younger son Roy, and his nephew
Khalil Hrawi, a member of parliament, backed a slate of candidates
for the 21-seat council in the family's hometown of Zahle, Bekaa's
provincial capital.
	   But George Hrawi, the president's elder son, has endorsed the
ticket of his father's arch-foe, Elie Skaff.
	   Skaff, a legislator, and President Hrawi are long-time rivals
for the leadership of Zahle, Lebanon's largest Christian town,
which is predominantly Greek Catholic.
	   George Hrawi, who shied away from politics until recently, says
he does not agree with his father's policies.
	   ``Let's put an end to the nine-year hijacking of Zahle's
decision-making,'' Skaff told a rally in a clear reference to
Hrawi's nine years in office.
	   On Saturday, Skaff accused the authorities of exerting
``pressure'' on voters and claimed the presidential palace was
directing the election campaign against him.
	   But after voting in his hometown Sunday, the president denied
the accusations. ``The state is not a party,'' Hrawi told
reporters. ``I will be the first to congratulate whoever wins,'' he
added.
	   Some newspapers have said the Zahle race could have a bearing on
the president's political future as Hrawi, whose extended term
expires in November, may seek another period in office.
	   In Baalbek, Bekaa Valley's second biggest city, two rival Shiite
Muslim parties, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian
Amal, are vying for control of the 21-seat municipal council.
	   Baalbek, home to ancient Roman ruins that makes it the nation's
prime tourist attraction, became infamous during the 1975-90 civil
war for being the hotbed of Shiite extremists who kidnapped
Westerners.

Newcastle holds lead amid concerns over star player 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Newcastle Knights shrugged off a
drug controversy involving one of its star players Sunday to beat
Canterbury 12-4 and maintain its lead in the National Rugby League
competition.
	   On Friday, published reports said international Robbie O'Davis
had recorded elevated levels of a naturally occurring hormone and
will undergo further drug testing. O'Davis could face a two-year
ban under the NRL's revamped penalty code.
	   On Sunday, the Knights won for the 12th time in 14 matches for
24 points to hold a one-point lead over surprise first-year team
Melbourne Storm in the 20-team league.
	   Parramatta and St. George, which edged North Queensland 16-14
Sunday, are level on 22 points in third place, followed by Sydney
City on 20 points. North Queensland trailed 16-0 at halftime.
	   In other matches Sunday, the Gold Coast beat last-place South
Sydney 16-14, North Sydney defeated Canberra 34-22 and Balmain beat
Illawarra 38-16.
	   On Saturday, the Western Suburbs beat Auckland 18-16 only a week
after being thrashed by North Queensland.
	   ``We've been pretty awful in recent weeks,'' said Magpies coach
Tom Raudonikis said. ``But we worked hard all week and performances
like this are really going to count for a lot.''
	   Brisbane, level with North Sydney in sixth place, scored a 44-4
win over a depleted Penrith. The Broncos ran in eight tries to nil
in winning just their second game in the six weeks.
	   Melbourne ignored Adelaide's upset win over St. George last week
to surge away with a 24-4 victory over the Rams.
	   The Storm led 18-0 at halftime as Scott Hill scored twice in the
first half after captain Glenn Lazarus won the toss and decided to
run into the strong wind.
	   Parramatta squeaked to a 17-14 win over Manly after nearly
blowing a 17-2 lead.
	   On Friday, Sydney City rallied from a 12-6 deficit at the half
as skipper Brad Fittler and center Ivan Cleary scored second-half
tries to beat Cronulla 18-14. (djp)

Libyan opposition group claims attack on Gadhafi 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Libyan Islamic opposition group claimed
responsibility for an alleged attack on Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, the Al-Hayat newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The Libyan government had denied such an attack, which travelers
from Libya said took place on June 1 and slightly injured Gadhafi
besides killing his female bodyguard.
	   The Al-Hayat quoted Abdullah Ahmed, the spokesman of the Islamic
Martyrs Movement, as saying that its guerrillas carried out the
attack on the night of May 31-June 1 in the Sidi Khalifa area, 30
Kilometers (19 miles) east of Benghazi in eastern Libya.
	   At least four bodyguards were killed when the group's gunmen
ambushed Gadhafi's motorcade and exchanged gunfire for 10 minutes,
Ahmed was quoted as saying by Al-Hayat, a respected Arab daily.
	   Eastern Benghazi's al-Jabal al-Akhdar region is a mountainous
area whose caves offer numerous hideouts to Islamic militants
trying to depose Gadhafi. The Islamic Martyrs Movement is known for
its influence in that area.
	   Ahmed was quoted as saying that Gadhafi was wounded during the
shootout. Libyans arriving in Egypt said Thursday Gadhafi was
injured in the elbow.
	   The alleged attack happened when Gadhafi was on his way to Egypt
for an official visit, the travelers said. The London-based Liberty
for the Muslim World, a human rights group which monitors Libyan
affairs, also reported the attack but said it had no details.
	   The official Libyan news agency, however, denied the attack and
described the reports as ``a flood of lies and cheap allegations.''
	   Gadhafi was scheduled to visit Egypt for nine days beginning
June 2, but the trip was postponed to June 5. No explanation was
given and even the second visit was postponed.

Rain wipes out play Sunday; organizers unsure what to do 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SLALEY, England (AP) _ Overnight rain forced organizers to
cancel play Sunday in the water-logged European Grand Prix, leaving
sponsors and officials to figure out what to do with the
650,000-pound (dlrs 1.06 million) event.
	   Just under 50 players managed to wade through 36 holes with
Englishmen Barry Lane and Andrew Sherborne sharing the lead when
play was washed out Saturday.
	   Organizers may try finishing Monday, although forecasts call for
more rain. There are also suggestions play might be completed later
this season.
	   Downpours have been almost non-stop since Thursday when all play
was rained out.
	   On Friday, only half of the 156-man field managed to play 18
holes on a course shortened from par-72 to par-69 because of
drenched tees and fairways.
	   Saturday was no better.
	   Fighting off all-day showers, the remainder of the field sloshed
through their 18 holes _ and 47 others got in a second 18 before a
deluge ended the day.
	   Sherborne and Lane each shot 2-under 67s in the first round and
had matching 68s in the second for 3-under 135. Jamie Spence and
Gary Evans, also Englishmen, were tied at 136.
	   England's Mark Davis, who shot a first-round 64 to lead the
field, had a 4-over 73 in the second to fall two strokes off the
pace.

Australia urges global community to push peace process 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
on Sunday urged the international community to push the Middle East
peace process forward.
	   Australia is disappointed that efforts to secure lasting peace
between Israel and the Palestinians have deadlocked, Downer told
reporters after a meeting with President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Downer arrived Friday on a three-day trip to Egypt. He earlier
visited Israel and Palestinian areas.
	   ``It is important for the international community to push the
peace process,'' he said.
	   Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians stalled in March
1997 when Israel began building a Jewish settlement in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.

World Cup: Hoddle wonders how to use Owen; Tunisians ready to surprise 
</HEADLINE>
By MORLEY MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France _ England coach Glenn Hoddle, known for doing
the unexpected in his playing days, is prepared to gamble on the
precocious talents of 18-year-old Liverpool striker Michael Owen
for Monday's opening World Cup game against Tunisia.
	   Hoddle is keeping his starting 11 secret. But there have been
enough hints that Owen figures very much in his plans, either in
preference to Alan Shearer's strike partner Teddy Sheringham or as
a substitute.
	   Owen, who became England's youngest goal scorer when he netted
against Morocco last month, has impressed Hoddle with his
qualities, particularly his stunning pace.
	   ``Michael's temperament is smashing, way above his years,''
Hoddle said of the teen-age prodigy.
	   ``He is a really exciting prospect. If he starts, he can cause
people problems and influence a game. We must find out if he can do
that at World Cup level. And if he comes off the bench, he's a
diverse option to everything else we have in the squad, an extra
dimension.''
	   Owen has no self-doubts. ``I feel I am ready and, if I play
against Tunisia, I think I'll score,'' the youngster said.
	   It is England's 10th World Cup appearance, having won the crown
in 1966, while Tunisia's only previous experience was in 1974.
Their other Group G rivals are Colombia and Romania.
	   England has not conceded a goal in its last four internationals
apart from in a penalty shootout against Belgium. That means
Tunisia will face a defence that appears sound, especially with
tough-tackling midfielders Paul Ince and David Batty shoring up the
rear guard.
	   But the North Africans have a wily campaigner in their Polish
manager Henryk Kasperczyk, who played in the Polish team which
eliminated England in the qualifying stages of the 1974 World Cup.
	   ``I've put England out of the World Cup once. Why shouldn't I
help do it again,'' Kasperczyk said.
	   Tunisia showed its potential with a decisive 4-0 victory over
Wales in a June 6 friendly, although it was against a
below-strength Welsh team.
	   But there were impressive performances by the long-haired
midfielder Sirajeddine Chihi, Brazilian-born Jose Clayton and
attacking defender Khaled Badra, who scored two goals.
	   ``We have a group of young, strong, ambitious players who have
been tested on the field in the 1996 African Nations Cup and the
Atlanta Olympics,'' said assistant coach Ali el-Selm. In the ANC
competition, the team went all the way to the finals before losing
to host South Africa.
	   ``We are here to show the new strength of Tunisian and Arab
football.''
	   With 460,000 Tunisians living in France, English fans are
expected to be heavily outnumbered in the 60,000 capacity Stade
Velodrome.

Thai workers in Taiwan told to curb their drinking 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A reputation for heavy drinking and rowdy
behavior has made Thai contract workers unpopular with Taiwanese
employers, and authorities are telling them to get on the wagon,
the state news agency reported Sunday.
	   With employers increasingly wary about hiring them, the number
of Thais employed in Taiwan has fallen to 130,000 from a high of
155,000 in 1996, the Central News Agency said.
	   Taiwanese agencies, which collect fat job-finding fees from Thai
workers, have teamed up with Thai government representatives in a
campaign to get workers to abstain or at least curb their alcohol
intake, CNA said. Taiwanese radio stations that broadcast in Thai
have been enlisted in the program, CNA said.
	   Thais work on many of Taiwan's major infrastructure projects and
in other construction and factory jobs. Off-hours leisure tends
toward group drinking sessions, and numerous bars and karaoke
parlors cater to Thai customers with staff who speak Thai.
	   Thais are being replaced with workers from other Asian
countries, the news agency said. The rest of Taiwan's 246,000
foreign contract workers are mostly Filipinos, whose organized
leisure tends to revolve around the Catholic Church.
	   Thai government representatives in Taiwan are especially
concerned because the decline comes at a time of growing
unemployment at home due to the Asian economic crisis, CNA said.
Thai officials say more than 2 million Thais are now jobless, and
remittances from overseas workers are a crucial source of foreign
exchange.

<TEXT>
	   ZAHLE, Lebanon (AP) _ Residents in eastern Lebanon voted Sunday
in municipal elections that pit the Christian president against his
son in the region's biggest town, where they are backing rival
tickets.
	   About 4,000 soldiers, backed by armor, were deployed in the
Bekaa, the last region to vote in the four-stage municipal
elections, which are being held for the first time in 35 years.
	   Polls opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and are expected to close at 5
p.m. (1400 GMT). The Bekaa has 434,000 eligible voters who will
choose some 1,879 city and town council posts.
	   What distinguishes Sunday's round of elections from the previous
ones held in the past four weeks in Mount Lebanon, northern
Lebanon, Beirut and southern Lebanon is the absence of sectarian
competition. The other elections focused on Muslim versus Christian
races.
	   But in eastern Lebanon, Christian are fighting Christian in
Zahle, the site of the presidential family contest, and Shiites
against Shiites in Baalbek where another fierce race is underway.
	   President Elias Hrawi, his younger son Roy, and his nephew
Khalil Hrawi, a member of parliament, backed a slate of candidates
for the 21-seat council in the family's hometown of Zahle, Bekaa's
provincial capital.
	   But George Hrawi, the president's elder son, has endorsed the
ticket of his father's arch-foe, Elie Skaff.
	   Skaff, a legislator, and President Hrawi are longtime rivals for
the leadership of Zahle, Lebanon's largest Christian town, which is
predominantly Greek Catholic.
	   George Hrawi, who shied away from politics until recently, says
he does not agree with his father's policies.
	   ``Let's put an end to the nine-year hijacking of Zahle's
decision-making,'' Skaff told a rally in a clear reference to
Hrawi's nine years in office.
	   On Saturday, Skaff accused the authorities of exerting
``pressure'' on voters and claimed the presidential palace was
directing the election campaign against him.
	   But after voting in his hometown Sunday, the president denied
the accusations. ``The state is not a party,'' Hrawi told
reporters. ``I will be the first to congratulate whoever wins,'' he
added.
	   Some newspapers have said the Zahle race could have a bearing on
the president's political future as Hrawi, whose extended term
expires in November, may seek another period in office.
	   In Baalbek, Bekaa Valley's second biggest city, two rival Shiite
Muslim parties, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian
Amal, are vying for control of the 21-seat municipal council.
	   Baalbek, home to ancient Roman ruins that makes it Lebanon's
prime tourist attraction, became infamous during the 1975-90 civil
war for being the hotbed of Shiite extremists who kidnapped
Westerners.

Iraq says it is hard to satisfy U.N. arms monitors 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq complained Sunday that the chief U.N.
weapons inspector's demands for disarmament are designed to prolong
indefinitely economic sanctions on Iraq.
	   Richard Butler, who arrived Thursday in Baghdad, presented a
list of steps that Iraq must take to prove its claim that it has
dismantled all weapons of mass destruction and other illegal
weapons programs. Until that happens, the sanctions will stay in
place.
	   Butler ``has put an impregnable wall on the path of ending the
unfair embargo,'' Sami Saadoun, head of Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz's office, wrote in a front-page article in Babil. The
newspaper, Iraq's most influential, is owned by President Saddam
Hussein's eldest son, Odai.
	   Butler ``has left little hope for us to reach the end of the
tunnel,'' said the article. Saadoun has been a regular participant
in previous Iraq-U.N. disarmament talks.
	   The article is a sign of Iraqi frustration at being presented
with another list of demands even after seven years of inspections.
	   In the list of demands, which he has described as ``a road
map,'' Butler is asking Iraq to hand over information on long-range
missiles, prove it has scrapped biological and chemical warheads,
and fully account for its production of VX nerve gas and germ
warfare weapons.
	   Butler held two rounds of talks Saturday with Aziz, and a third
one on Sunday. A lower-level technical team grouping weapons
inspectors from both sides also met. No details of the talks were
available.
	   The Babil article said that during Saturday's meeting Butler and
his team focused on ``minute details which are impossible to deal
with.'' It did not elaborate.
	   ``This pursuit shows that Butler is implementing a U.S. and
British demand to keep sanctions in place the longest time possible
... the thing Iraq cannot accept,'' it said. The sanctions were
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Officials of the delegations said progress was made Saturday in
proving Iraq's claims that it destroyed and buried its biological
and chemical missile warheads. No details were available.

Egypt to mediate between Eritrea and Ethiopia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will try to
arrange a cease-fire between Eritrea and Ethiopia in an attempt to
find a peaceful solution to their border conflict, Eritrea's
foreign minister said Sunday.
	   ``President Mubarak has assured us that he will do his best (to)
try to contact the other party (Ethiopia), and try to bring both
parties to a cease-fire and peaceful solution,'' the minister,
Haile Woldetensae, told reporters after meeting Mubarak here.
	   He said Eritrea welcomes Mubarak's initiative.
	   On Friday, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin met with
Mubarak in Cairo and said his country will not negotiate as long as
Eritrea occupies Ethiopian lands.
	   The United States and Rwanda are also trying to resolve the
conflict but have made no progress.
	   Border war between the two Horn of Africa countries broke out
May 6 when Ethiopia accused Eritrea of occupying a swath of land
along their border. The two sides differ over where Italy, the
former colonial power, drew the border.

Surge of violent youth crimes shakes Taiwan

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ For almost a week, four teen-age boys took
turns raping a 15-year-old captive, beating her and torturing her
with electric shocks. Their girlfriends watched, or sat in front of
the TV in the next room.
	   When she finally died and the teens were arrested, the junior
high-school dropout who led the gang said the victim deserved what
she got for stealing a pager and being ``a pain.''
	   Taiwanese youth long were viewed as deferential bookworms, model
strivers who worked hard in school and grew up to help build the
island into an increasingly vibrant and affluent society.
	   However, vicious juvenile crimes like the killing of the girl
has Taiwan increasingly afraid of its own children. A new
stereotype is emerging _ that of the sneering, remorseless young
tough.
	   Some outraged Taiwanese are demanding the death penalty for
minors. But others want to focus instead on the emotional health of
young people and are pushing legal reforms that could straighten
out young offenders early with counseling and better schooling.
	   More than any previous crime, the February murder of the
15-year-old girl in Chutung, a small city two hours south of
Taipei, shook Taiwan. The defendants in the case face up to 20
years in prison if convicted.
	   But there is no shortage of such cases, including a 15-year-old
dropout who stabbed her former classmate 86 times in a jealous fit
and a group of teens who tried to bury a high school classmate
alive.
	   Police say 409 juveniles were arrested for murder in 1997. In
Japan, with more than five times the population and its own
worrying problem of increasing juvenile crime, the figure was only
97.
	   Critics say rapid transformation from a society of farming
villages to urban consumerism has left Taiwan ill equipped to deal
with emotionally troubled youths.
	   Although Taiwanese society traditionally allows emotional
displays, it frowns on talking about them, says Hsieh Chi-tah, a
legislator and former judge.
	   ``Taiwanese parents take care of material needs for their
children, but rarely consider their emotional needs,'' Hsieh said.
	   Violent young criminals tend to come from poorer, and often
single-parent, families in which life is a struggle and education
an afterthought.
	   Schools concentrate on pushing students to the next level. Those
who fall behind languish in dull classes until they graduate or
drop out. In 1996, 45 percent of arrested juveniles had dropped out
after junior high school and 17 percent had only a primary
education.
	   Lee Yuan-tseh, a top academic, said school reform is essential.
``One more well-run school means one less prison built,'' he said.
	   Hsieh Fen-fen, commander of the Taipei police department's
juvenile branch, said teens' inability to communicate frustration
plus constant exposure to sex and violence in comics, video games
and TV can lead to random, vicious crime.
	   ``Kids slowly get used to gore and sex in the media,'' she said.
``Then, they feel an escalating need for thrills. They want the
real thing.''
	   Closing down video parlors and imposing a midnight curfew on
minors already has reduced juvenile crime in Taipei by 33 percent,
she said. Police hope such moves will stop anti-social behavior
before it turns violent.
	   ``It's like a competition to see who can be meaner,'' said a
girl at a suburban Taipei police station who identified herself
only by her surname, Liu.
	   She was in a group of bleach-haired dropouts in designer
knockoffs arrested for beating a 15-year-old girl unconscious, then
riding their bikes over her. They did it because they ``couldn't
stand her personality,'' Liu said.
	   Under the current system, juvenile offenders can expect little
more than brief meetings with an overworked probation officer, a
lecture or time in a prison-like reform school.
	   Waiting for a brief probation interview at Taipei district
court, a 20-year-old woman said kids choose their own path at
school. ``So if you're not motivated, you just do what you want,''
she said.
	   On probation for assaulting another girl when she was 16, the
woman said things might have been different if someone had ``been
there'' for her.

villages to urban consumerism has left Taiwan ill equipped to deal
with emotionally troubled youths.
	   Although Taiwanese society traditionally allows emotional
displays, it frowns on talking about them, says Hsieh Chi-tah, a
legislator and former judge.
	   ``Taiwanese parents take care of material needs for their
children, but rarely consider their emotional needs,'' Hsieh said.
	   Violent young criminals tend to come from poorer, and often
single-parent, families in which life is a struggle and education
an afterthought.
	   Schools concentrate on pushing students to the next level. Those
who fall behind languish in dull classes until they graduate or
drop out. In 1996, 45 percent of arrested juveniles had dropped out
after junior high school and 17 percent had only a primary
education.
	   Lee Yuan-tseh, a top academic, said school reform is essential.
``One more well-run school means one less prison built,'' he said.
	   Hsieh Fen-fen, commander of the Taipei police department's
juvenile branch, said teens' inability to communicate frustration
plus constant exposure to sex and violence in comics, video games
and TV can lead to random, vicious crime.
	   ``Kids slowly get used to gore and sex in the media,'' she said.
``Then, they feel an escalating need for thrills. They want the
real thing.''
	   Closing down video parlors and imposing a midnight curfew on
minors already has reduced juvenile crime in Taipei by 33 percent,
she said. Police hope such moves will stop anti-social behavior
before it turns violent.
	   ``It's like a competition to see who can be meaner,'' said a
girl at a suburban Taipei police station who identified herself
only by her surname, Liu.
	   She was in a group of bleach-haired dropouts in designer
knockoffs arrested for beating a 15-year-old girl unconscious, then
riding their bikes over her. They did it because they ``couldn't
stand her personality,'' Liu said.
	   Under the current system, juvenile offenders can expect little
more than brief meetings with an overworked probation officer, a
lecture or time in a prison-like reform school.
	   Waiting for a brief probation interview at Taipei district
court, a 20-year-old woman said kids choose their own path at
school. ``So if you're not motivated, you just do what you want,''
she said.
	   On probation for assaulting another girl when she was 16, the
woman said things might have been different if someone had ``been
there'' for her.

World Cup: Germans secretive about starters; U.S. emphasizing defense 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The German game plan is known: put the Americans
under pressure for 90 minutes, force them into making mistakes and
score goals off those mistakes. And stifle Claudio Reyna.
	   What is not known is which 11 Germans will execute that plan. Or
rather which 10, since goalkeeper Andreas Koepke is the only one
certain.
	   Coach Berti Vogts has revealed nothing about his intended lineup
and has said hardly more about his tactics.
	   The Germans play the only way they know how: put the opponent
under pressure from the start, keep it on for 90 minutes and use
the rival's mistakes to create goals.
	   But Vogts has kept the media and his players guessing about the
lineup that will take on the United States at Parc des Princes on
Monday.
	   ``It is not important who plays, it's important that those who
play, play well,'' Vogts said.
	   U.S. coach Steve Sampson appears ready to start a
defensive-oriented lineup, based on defender-midfielder Mike Burns,
defender Thomas Dooley and goalkeeper Kasey Keller.
	   The U.S. offensive punch is largely dependent on Reyna, a
midfielder who's the team playmaker. He scored four goals this
season for VfL Wolfsburg of Germany's Bundesliga.
	   Sampson uses 3-6-1 formation in which the Americans start three
defenders, six midfielders and a lone forward. It's perfectly
suited to +Reyna+'s passing skills.
	   Vogts considers the United States a physical, fit team, but
fitness is also one of Vogts' obsessions and one of the German
strengths. ``The fittest team will win the World Cup,'' Vogts said.
	   The Germans have been working hard on their fitness. With an
average age of 29.7 years, they are one of the oldest teams.
	   Germany, reigning European champion which is seeking its fourth
World Cup title, is one of the last major teams to go into action.
	   ``The lads are on fire,'' said Thomas Haessler, the pint-sized
midfielder who is one of Germany's most creative players. ``It's
time to get going.''
	   Haessler may be on fire, but the biggest question mark hangs
over his head.
	   If Vogts decides to go with a more offensive setup, Haessler
will get to play. If not, he'll probably sit on the bench. What
speaks for Haessler is that he's usually the best feeder for
Juergen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff, the likely starting
forwards.
	   Vogts, who has complained that his team concedes too many goals
(nine in 10 qualifying games), may want to shore up his defense
against the speedy Americans, who rely on counter-attacks.
	   ``It would be foolish to underestimate any team,'' said
assistant coach Rainer Bonhof, whose job was to scout the Americans
during their tuneup games and who saw them beat Austria 3-0 in
Vienna in April.
	   ``It's a team that bases its game on counter-attacks and speed.
They are very fit. The top man is Claudio Reyna. He is the midfield
director, he's the head of the team,'' Bonhof said.
	   ``We won't have anyone shadowing him all the time, but when he
has the ball he'll be put under considerable pressure,'' Bonhof
said.

Singapore authorities bust two World Cup gambling syndicates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore police snared two gambling syndicates
that were taking bets on World Cup soccer matches last week, a
Sunday newspaper reported.
	   Authorities arrested 15 people from the betting syndicates last
Wednesday, the first day of the World Cup. Conservative estimates
of the total bets on a single match indicate a minimum of 100,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 58,000), and possibly much more, The Sunday
Times said.
	   The action was coordinated with Hong Kong authorities, who
conducted simultaneous raids. Various syndicates in both countries
were operating closely together.
	   The Chinese territory's anti-corruption agency said Friday that
30 people, including Hong Kong soccer players and a police officer,
had been arrested Wednesday for alleged illegal gambling and
possible match-fixing.
	   The Sunday Times said fax machines, mobile phones and various
documentation were seized in the Singapore raids, staged close to
midnight. One group was operating in suites at a five-star downtown
hotel, and another in a public housing apartment.
	   No reason was given for the story not appearing until four days
after the police action. News of the Singapore arrests was reported
in Hong Kong as early as Friday.
	   Illegal gambling on soccer remains a huge business in Asia, with
transactions reaching millions annually and occasional reports of
global match-fixing coordinated from the region.

Ramos going to Senegal to receive U.N. peace award 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Fidel Ramos will go to
Senegal to receive a U.N. peace award on his last foreign trip
before his term ends this month, officials said Sunday.
	   Ramos, the Philippines' most traveled president, will leave
Monday with a small government entourage for the four-day visit, a
government statement said.
	   He will receive the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization peace award in Dakar on Wednesday for his role in
forging a peace accord with the Moro National Liberation Front,
once the Philippines' largest Muslim separatist rebel group.
	   The accord was signed in 1996, ending a quarter-century uprising
that killed about 120,000 people.
	   Ramos will share the award, a 5 million peso (dlrs 125,000)
prize and a gold medal, with Nur Misuari, a former Philippine
university professor who had led the MNLF.
	   The annual UNESCO award has been bestowed since 1991 to people
who have played major roles in promoting peace. Previous winners
included former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Former Prime Ministers
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres of Israel and South African
President Nelson Mandela.
	   Ramos will fly to Paris, where he will be picked up by a private
jet of Senegal President Abdou Diouf.
	   Since becoming president in 1992, Ramos has journeyed to more
than 40 countries on 35 foreign trips in an aggressive quest for
investment. Officials said his trips have generated about dlrs 20
billion worth of business for the Philippines.
	   Ramos' single six-year term ends June 30 and he has designated
President-elect Joseph Estrada to oversee the country while he is
away.

Libyan opposition group claims attack on Gadhafi 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Libyan Islamic opposition group claimed
responsibility for an alleged attack on Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, the Al-Hayat newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The Libyan government had denied such an attack, which travelers
from Libya said took place on June 1, slightly injuring Gadhafi and
killing a female bodyguard.
	   The Al-Hayat quoted Abdullah Ahmed, spokesman of the Islamic
Martyrs Movement, as saying that its guerrillas carried out the
attack on the night of May 31-June 1 in the Sidi Khalifa area, 30
kilometers (20 miles) east of Benghazi in eastern Libya.
	   At least four bodyguards were killed when the group's gunmen
ambushed Gadhafi's motorcade and exchanged gunfire for 10 minutes,
Ahmed was quoted as saying by Al-Hayat, a respected Arab daily.
	   Eastern Benghazi's al-Jabal al-Akhdar region is a mountainous
area whose caves offer numerous hideouts to Islamic militants
trying to depose Gadhafi. The Islamic Martyrs Movement is known for
its influence in that area.
	   Ahmed was quoted as saying that Gadhafi was wounded during the
shootout. Libyans arriving in Egypt said Thursday that Gadhafi was
shot in the elbow.
	   The alleged attack happened when Gadhafi was on his way to Egypt
for an official visit, the travelers said. The London-based Liberty
for the Muslim World, a human rights group which monitors Libyan
affairs, also reported the attack but said it had no details.
	   The official Libyan news agency, however, denied the attack and
described the reports as ``a flood of lies and cheap allegations.''
	   Gadhafi was scheduled to visit Egypt for nine days beginning
June 2, but the trip was postponed to June 5. No explanation was
given and even the second visit was postponed.

U.S. Reform Jews criticized for joint prayers at Western Wall 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos JRL101-3
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ About 200 men and women Reform Jews from the
United States prayed together at Jerusalem's Western Wall Sunday,
drawing criticism from ultra-Orthodox Jews who adhere to separation
of the sexes during worship.
	   But the event, held behind police barriers, was peaceful _
unlike in recent weeks, when men and women praying together were
pelted with garbage by ultra-Orthodox Jews.
	   At the 2,000 year-old Western Wall _ Judaism's holiest site, a
remnant of the Second Temple _ there are separate prayer areas for
men and women, in accordance with Orthodox Jewish practice.
	   The overwhelming majority of American Jews belong to streams of
Judaism not formally recognized by Israel's officially Orthodox
religious establishment.
	   At Sunday's event, the Reform group was not permitted to enter
the regular prayer area close to the Wall because it had announced
plans for the men and women to pray together.
	   Some black-coated ultra-Orthodox Jews remonstrated with the
Reform Jews afterward, but there was no violence.
	   ``We think there should be a section of the Wall set aside for
egalitarian (both-genders) worship,'' Rabbi Eric Yoffie, a U.S.
Reform Jewish leader. ``We don't think non-Orthodox worshippers
should have to appeal for police protection to come and pray at a
site which belongs to the entire Jewish people.''
	   Yoffie is president of the New York-based Union of American
Hebrew Congregations.

North Korean food crisis not over, officials say 
</HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Hungry North Korea has mobilized children to help
plant crops, but the nation's food shortages will continue even if
the harvest is good, U.N. officials said Sunday.
	   The harvest's success will depend largely on how much rain the
famine-threatened country gets in the coming, usually wet, months.
Last year, severe drought wrecked crops, compounding a food crisis
caused by years of economic decay and bad weather in 1995 and 1996.
	   ``This is a very critical period,'' said Abdur Rashid, a U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization official who led a four-member
team that spent 11 days inspecting crops and the food situation in
North Korea.
	   Maize planting and 85 percent of rice planting has finished, and
``the crops appear to be in a satisfactory condition,'' Rashid said
at a news conference in Beijing.
	   ``Even the primary school children were mobilized to assist,''
he said.
	   But even with rains and a good harvest, ``there will still be a
sizable shortfall,'' he added. ``The food crisis is not over.''
	   The next two months, before harvesting, are of particular
concern because public food rations have run out in many areas, the
U.N. team said.
	   They said the health of children targeted for food aid has
improved, but that lack of food has left adults vulnerable to
disease, with people sickened by dirty water and cakes made of
weeds and herbs that provide little nutrition but are eaten to help
stave off hunger pangs.
	   People ``are not dying of hunger. What they are doing is dying
from diseases ... that they would otherwise recover from,'' said
Douglas Coutts, the U.N. World Food Program's representative in
North Korea.
	   Coutts said the WFP has received just 250,000 tons of the
600,000 tons of food it appealed for this year.
	   Foreign governments, which last year offered North Korea more
food than the WFP appealed for, are now questioning whether the
country is willing to take steps to solve its problems and wean
itself from outside aid, he said.
	   ``There will have to be key changes in the agricultural sector
as well as in other sectors too,'' Coutts said. Until then,
emergency aid is ``buying time for the government to take the
responsibility and do what they have to do.''

World Cup: Colombia and Romania meet in key game 
</HEADLINE>
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) - Colombia has an old score to settle with
Romania. And Romania has to score to keep its chances intact for
advancing into the knockout second round.
	   The prediction: a furious game in which both teams will play the
attack card by all means in their Group G opener Monday.
	   A victory over Romania not only would put Colombia en route to
the second round in a group that includes England and Tunisia, but
would also avenge its 3-1 defeat in the inaugural game of USA '94.
	   ``We have to win,'' coach Hernan Dario Gomez said. ``We dream of
avenging our failure of 1994, and to achieve that we have to beat
Romania.''
	   England is a strong favorite to win the group, and Colombia
hopes a win over Romania would lift it to second place and allow it
to advance to the next round, something it failed to achieve four
years ago.
	   Adolfo Valencia, a veteran of the team that lost in the United
States, is even more categorical. ``There is an unpaid debt,'' said
the flashy forward of Italy's Parma.
	   On their part, the Romanians also see the game as crucial in
their efforts to reach the second round. A defeat will make it
unlikely they could do that.
	   ``There is just one way for us: victory. But it will be
extremely difficult,'' said Adalbert Kassai, general secretary of
the Romanian Football Federation.
	   Complicating the Romanians' plans is that several of their key
players are injured, affecting particularly the backline.
	   Already without Atletico Madrid's Daniel Prodan, who was left
out due to knee surgery, another mainstay of the defense, Tibor
Selymes of Anderlecht, has a sprained left ankle and is unlikely to
play in the opener.
	   ``I'm still dissatisfied with the weaknesses of our defense,''
coach Anghel Iordanescu said.
	   Replacing Selymes will be 26-year-old Liviu Ciubotariu of
National Bucharest of the Romanian first division.
	   ``Colombia is a technical team and the fate of the game is open
to both sides,'' Iordanescu said.
	   Sources close to the team said striker Adrian Ilie of Valencia,
who missed two warmups last week after bruising a calf in training,
was declared fit by the Romanian doctor.
	   In its two warmup games gainst French local teams, Romania left
no doubts that the only thing on the players' mind is offense.
	   With defender Dan Petrescu of Chelsea making devastating runs
down the left wing, midfielder Gheorghe Hagi dilligently supported
both offense and defense.
	   In addition, 25-year-old Viorel Moldovan of Coventry City played
much like a battering ram, trying to split open the sparring
partners' defense with attacks in force and target kicks from
outside the box.
	   While the Romanians canceled a press conference Sunday and
declared their practice closed to the media, the Colombians were
less secretive, allowing reporters to watch their last preparations
before the Monday game.
	   ``Our players are very well,'' Gomez said. He said he focused on
improving defense, ``because we have been weak at that. But I also
worked on the psychological part.''
	   Gomez recommended his players exercise caution.
	   ``We have to make sure we don't play (the Romanians') running
game. We'll play our slow game, we'll try to control the ball, and
if we're able to fine tune our shooting, we'll be evenly matched.''

McGuire wins fifth Japan title in Suntory Ladies Open 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KOBE, Japan (AP) _ Marnie McGuire shot her second straight
even-par 72 Sunday and won the Suntory Ladies by three strokes, her
fifth victory on the Japan tour.
	   The 29-year-old New Zealander, who led by four shots overnight,
birdied the par-3 13th but bogeyed the par-4 final hole en route to
a 5-under 283 total.
	   The victory, her first since the 1996 Mitsubishi Cup, was worth
9 million yen (dlrs 63,400) from a purse of 50 million yen (dlrs
352,000).
	   ``It's unbelievable. I'm very excited and very happy,'' said
McGuire, who had led since Thursday's opening round. She said the
victory was ``very unexpected'' because it followed a six-week
vacation in New Zealand.
	   ``When I got here, I had no expectations on how I was going to
do. So I just went out there and played one shot at a time,'' she
said.
	   Her victories since joining the Japan LPGA Tour in 1992 include
the 1994 Nasu Ogawa Ladies, the Daikin Orchid Ladies and the Goyo
Kensetsu Ladies in 1995, and the Mitsubishi Cup in April 1996.
	   Yuri Kawanami shot a 69 and finished second at 286.
	   Kaori Harada, who leads the earnings list so far with two
victories this season, also shot a 69 and shared third at 288 with
Aki Nakano, who shot a 73.

English fans clash with police ; four arrested

Eds: UPDATES with police now saying car accident touched off clash
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Police deployed reinforcements Sunday
after hundreds of English fans in town for a World Cup match
clashed with officers in the Old Port district overnight, officials
said.
	   The violence broke out shortly before midnight Saturday, when a
motorist who was blocked for several minutes by dancing English
fans tried to push his way through, police said. His car struck and
slightly injured an English fan, setting off the melee.
	   About 200 English fans showered police and their vehicles with
bottles and cans, sending at least one gendarme to the hospital
with a head injury. Four English fans were arrested.
	   Police said earlier that the clash on the Canebiere, the city's
main avenue, broke out between English and Marseille youths.
	   The incident came ahead of a match Monday between England and
Tunisia, a game authorities consider a security risk. About 10,000
British fans were expected to attend, and thousands more were in
town looking for tickets.
	   As a result of the overnight clash, authorities stepped up
security early, with about 1,600 uniformed or plainclothed city
police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS national police
patrolling the city.

Iranian Soccer players hold religious mourning on eve of World Cup match code

<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) - Instead of getting a full night's
sleep before their big World Cup match with Yugoslavia on Sunday,
the Iranian team held a lengthy religious mourning ceremony in
which players beat their chests and wept for the death of a 7th
century Shiite Muslim saint.
	   Iranian reporters who were invited to join the ceremony at the
old chateau where the team is housed under tight security, said the
ritual began with the traditional eulogy. Players wept as a
religious teacher recounted the death of the Shiites' Imam Hussein
on the plains of Karbala in modern day Iraq.
	   The three-hour ceremony ended just before midnight when the
lights were turned off as is the custom, and players beat their
chests in a sign of grief.
	   Hussein's death is the most important event in the Shiite
calendar.
	   Coach Jalal Talebi was displeased that players had to attend the
three-hour ceremony instead of getting a good night's sleep, said
the reporters who attended. They said the event was held at the
insistence of the Iranian Embassy in Paris.
	   Iran's state-run radio reported the ceremony, saying that an
embassy official read a good-luck message to the players from
Iran's President Mohammad Khatami.
	   In group F, Iran will meet the United States next, followed by a
match against Germany.
	   Given the nearly 20 years of hostility between the governments
of Iran and the United States, the June 21 game is the one all
Iranians are looking at.
	   Khatami has been trying to engineer a rapprochement with the
United States ever since he became president last August. But his
powerful hard-line opponents want no warming of ties.
	   In Iran, 20 hard-line legislators have written to Khatami,
urging him to order players not to exchange T-shirts with the
Americans after their match.
	   ``The dignity of the people of Iran and the values of the
Islamic revolution, as well as the honor of Iranian football will
be soiled,'' if T-shirts are exchanged, the legislators said in a
letter published in Iranian newspapers.
	   Millions of soccer-mad Iranians danced in the streets when their
team clinched the last World Cup berth. Security forces in Iran
lost all control of the crowds, in which some women threw off the
Islamic dresses they must wear by law, and fans drank illegal
alcohol in the streets.
	   The government was so alarmed that it has taken measures to
prevent a similar outburst.
	   Community centers in Iran that were due to show the matches live
on big-screen televisions have been instructed not to do so.
	   State-run television will show the matches live, but with a
10-second delay. That is so scenes of women who may be dressed
immodestly according to Iranian standards can be cut.
	   During the last World Cup in the United States, every time the
camera showed the crowds, with women dressed in light summer
clothes, Iranian fans saw scenes of another match, where crowds
were dressed for winter.

Construction will halt as workers strike Monday, union says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Construction workers around Australia
will strike for 24 hours Monday to protest claimed erosion of pay
and working conditions, their union said Sunday.
	   The strike, which defies a judge's ruling, may escalate into
months of disruption, union leaders said.
	   More than 150,000 union members will strike from the first shift
Monday, said Alex Bukarica, assistant national secretary of the
Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.
	   Last week, Australian Industrial Relations Commissioner Ron
Jones ordered workers not to strike in protest against what the
union says is an attempt by employers to toughen working
conditions.
	   The Masters Builders of Australia said the strike may cost the
building industry millions of dollars and has labeled it illegal.
	   The union said the success of talks planned for later this week
depends on whether employers will abandon their insistence on
changing work hours and inclement weather provisions.
	   ``Employers are pursuing an ideologically driven log of claims
in relation to our awards and seeking to whittle away a number of
fundamental work conditions,'' Bukarica said.
	   ``If they want to continue to see ongoing disruption in an
industry that is performing fairly well and builders and developers
doing well, that is their prerogative.''
	   Industrial action may last weeks or months, he said.
	   A builders' spokesman said there was no chance employers' groups
would abandon support for the proposed changes the union opposes.

Precede BEIRUT President and son back rival sides in east Lebanon local polls

<TEXT>
	   ZAHLE, Lebanon (AP) _ Residents in eastern Lebanon voted Sunday
in municipal elections that pit the Christian president against his
son in the region's biggest town, where they are backing rival
tickets.
	   About 4,000 soldiers, backed by armor, were deployed in the
Bekaa, the last region to vote in the four-stage municipal
elections, which are being held for the first time in 35 years.
	   Polls opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and are expected to close at 5
p.m. (1400 GMT). The Bekaa has 434,000 eligible voters who will
choose some 1,879 city and town council posts.
	   What distinguishes Sunday's round of elections from the previous
ones held in the past four weeks in Mount Lebanon, northern
Lebanon, Beirut and southern Lebanon is the absence of sectarian
competition. The other elections focused on Muslim versus Christian
races.
	   But in eastern Lebanon, Christian are fighting Christian in
Zahle, the site of the presidential family contest, and Shiites
against Shiites in Baalbek where another fierce race is underway.
	   President Elias Hrawi, his younger son Roy, and his nephew
Khalil Hrawi, a member of parliament, backed a slate of candidates
for the 21-seat council in the family's hometown of Zahle, Bekaa's
provincial capital.
	   But George Hrawi, the president's elder son, has endorsed the
ticket of his father's arch-foe, Elie Skaff.
	   Skaff, a legislator, and President Hrawi are longtime rivals for
the leadership of Zahle, Lebanon's largest Christian town, which is
predominantly Greek Catholic.
	   George Hrawi, who shied away from politics until recently, says
he does not agree with his father's policies.
	   ``Let's put an end to the nine-year hijacking of Zahle's
decision-making,'' Skaff told a rally in a clear reference to
Hrawi's nine years in office.
	   On Saturday, Skaff accused the authorities of exerting
``pressure'' on voters and claimed the presidential palace was
directing the election campaign against him.
	   But after voting in his hometown Sunday, the president denied
the accusations. ``The state is not a party,'' Hrawi told
reporters. ``I will be the first to congratulate whoever wins,'' he
added.
	   Some newspapers have said the Zahle race could have a bearing on
the president's political future as Hrawi, whose extended term
expires in November, may seek another period in office.
	   In Baalbek, Bekaa Valley's second biggest city, two rival Shiite
Muslim parties, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian
Amal, are vying for control of the 21-seat municipal council.
	   Baalbek, home to ancient Roman ruins that makes it Lebanon's
prime tourist attraction, became infamous during the 1975-90 civil
war for being the hotbed of Shiite extremists who kidnapped
Westerners.

Close down Louise Woodward's legal defense fund now, says founder 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Days after the mother of former British au pair
Louise Woodward denied forging a bill to get money from her
daughter's legal defense fund, one of the fund's founders has
called for it to be closed down.
	   Jean Jones said Louise's mother Sue regarded the money in the
fund as her own.
	   Mrs. Jones, who has left the fund's organizing committee, said
at first Mrs. Woodward's sole concern was for her daughter,
convicted last fall of the second-degree murder of 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen.
	   But in an interview with Sky TV, Mrs. Jones said Mrs. Woodward's
primary concern ``became money _ the money became God. And I find
it so sad and yet so sickening that something so good should turn
into something like this,'' she said. A judge later reduced the
verdict to manslaughter and sentenced Ms. Woodward, 20, to the 279
days she had served in prison since her arrest.
	   Mrs. Jones said that when she told Mrs. Woodward that a lawyer
had been hired to run the trust, Mrs. Woodward replied that she
would return from the United States to ``sort out the money.''
	   ``I said `Well, it's not for you to sort the money out because
the solicitor has said it's not your money - it was set up ... to
help people like the Woodwards to look after their kids when they
get in trouble.'''
	   ``And Susan said `Jean, I am the Woodwards and that money is
ours.'''
	   Soon afterward, Mrs. Jones said, Mrs. Woodward changed the
fund's lawyers.
	   ``When I found that out I knew then that there was nothing left
that I could do. It was over,'' she said.
	   ``She (Mrs. Woodward) rode roughshod over everybody. She was the
most ungracious person I have ever met in my life. No matter how
much kindness people have shown her, she just seemed to push them
to one side and it was horrendous watching it.''
	   She added, ``I believe the fund should be stopped. God bless all
the people that helped and worked so hard.''
	   There was no immediate comment from Mrs. Woodward. But Woodward
family friend Sandra McCabe said Mrs. Jones was angry because she
had wanted to remain a signatory on the fund's checks and have the
Woodwards come to her for money.
	   ``We didn't want an Oliver Twist situation with Sue and Gary
Woodward having to go with a begging bowl every time they needed
money, so we decided to put it in a proper trust,'' she said.
	   And the fund's trustees backed Mrs. Woodward this week when she
denied forging a housing bill to get money from the fund.
	   Dan Sharp, whose British-born wife, attorney Elaine Whitfield
Sharp, was fired by Ms. Woodward recently, described the
9,500-pound (dlrs15,400) bill as a sham. The invoice purportedly
covered several months of lodging for Mrs. Woodward at the Sharps'
home in Marblehead, northeast of Boston. Sharp said the Woodwards
stayed there for free.
	   Sue and Gary Woodward stayed at the lawyer's house while their
daughter was on trial. After her release from prison last November,
Ms. Woodward stayed at the Sharps' home until about two months ago.
	   The Woodwards' lawyers and trustees of the fund denied any
wrongdoing.
	   Ms. Woodward has to stay in Massachusetts until the state
Supreme Judicial Court rules on appeals by prosecutors and the
defense.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ International aid agencies postponed
delivery of the first load of humanitarian aid to ethnic Albanian
refugees from Kosovo in northern Albania for security reasons,
officials said Sunday.
	   Both the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and World Food
Program, said they were waiting until Monday to move the tons of
food and non-food items that arrived on Saturday, fearing lax
weekend police controls on Albania's poor roads.
	   The aid is to be distributed to the up to 13,000 Kosovo
Albanians who fled fighting in the Serbian province of Kosovo in
southern Yugoslavia, crossing the border into northern Albanian.
	   Makiko Shinohara, a spokeswoman for UNHCR said the tents, Jerry
cans, mattresses, blankets and other non-food items airlifted from
Sarajevo were being temporarily stored in warehouses in Tirana.
	   Aid likely will be transported from the capital to the north of
the country by a combination of trucks and American NATO
helicopters.

Rwandan army integrates Hutus to defeat rebels 
</HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GISENYI, Rwanda (AP) _ The first time Ephraim Niyenzima joined
the Rwandan army, it was dominated by his fellow Hutus. He's back
in uniform now _ but to fight against Hutus.
	   The 30-year-old Niyenzima was among 140 Hutu former soldiers who
rejoined the Rwandan military at a northwestern camp last week as
part of a new government move aginst Hutu rebels.
	   Niyenzima was unsure of how other Hutus would react when they
see him in the uniform of an army now dominated by the Tutsi ethnic
group.
	   ``When my people see me in the army, I think they will trust me
instead of infiltrators,'' Niyenzima said, using the official term
for Hutu rebels.
	   Thousands of people are thought to have been killed in Hutu
rebel attacks and army reprisals since Tutsi fighters won power in
July 1994 to end the Hutu-organized genocide of more than 500,000
Tutsis earlier that year.
	   After four years of battling rebels with mixed success, the
integration of former Hutu soldiers in the Tutsi-led Rwandan
Patriotic Army is a new method the authorities hope will help them
turn the largely Hutu population against the attackers.
	   ``I used to fight against the Tutsis,'' said newly recruited
Staff Sergeant Gerard Nkurunziza,, 28. ``After I came back from the
refugee camps in Congo, I realized this is a new Rwanda and we have
an enemy in common.''
	   So far, the Tutsi-led army has integrated up to 3,000 former
soldiers in a program that envisages an 19,000-strong army with at
least 10,000 Hutus, army sources said.
	   The former soldiers and militiamen, some of them responsible for
the slaughter, fled to neighboring Congo until November 1996, when
they slipped back into Rwanda hidden among more than 1 million
refugees.
	   Army sources said most of the remaining rebel bases in Congo had
been destroyed in operations with the Congolese and Ugandan troops,
and that bulk of the rebel force was now inside Rwanda, where it
was easier to control.
	   The rebels are still mobilizing support among Hutus, often
killing those who refuse money, food or shelter. In the border town
of Gisenyi, 110 kilometers (65 miles) northwest of capital Kigali,
a shadowy rebel group calling itself the Rwanda Liberation Army, or
Alir, has warned in a newspaper that fighting will soon spread to
other parts of the country.
	   Last week, the group claimed responsibility for an attack on a
camp for displaced Tutsis at Kinihira, 20 kilometers (10 miles)
south of Gisenyi. The army said it had repelled the attack.
	   The army and Rwandan exiles familiar with the situation say the
rebels have poor lines of communication and their leaders often act
like warlords in isolated attacks. However, arms and ammunition are
still believed to be reaching them from neighboring countries.

Army experts defuse U.S.-made bomb at construction site 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese military experts on Sunday defused a
one-ton U.S.-made bomb found at a construction site in Osaka 53
years after the end of World War II, officials said.
	   About 4,300 residents were evacuated from homes with 300 meters
(330 yards) of the site, and a suspension of train and subway
service in the area for one hour and 40 minutes affected another
20,000 people, officials said.
	   Kazumitsu Kurio, a spokesman of the Self-Defense Forces, said
four bomb experts needed 51 minutes to defuse the bomb at the site
in Osaka, Japan's second largest city, about 410 kilometers (255
miles) west of Tokyo.
	   Construction workers found the bomb, 180 centimeters (6 feet)
long and 60 centimeters (2 feet) in diameter, 3.6 meters (12 feet)
underground on May 12, Kurio said.
	   He said an arsenal of the former Imperial Japanese Army had been
located at the site.
	   Kurio said the bomb was believed to have been dropped by U.S.
bombers in the closing days of World War II.

Close down Louise Woodward's legal defense fund now, says founder 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in graf 14 with chairman says fund cannot be closed
down; pickup graf 15 pvs
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Days after the mother of former British au pair
Louise Woodward denied forging a bill to get money from her
daughter's legal defense fund, one of the fund's founders has
called for it to be closed down.
	   Jean Jones said Louise's mother Sue regarded the money in the
fund as her own.
	   Mrs. Jones, who has left the fund's organizing committee, said
at first Mrs. Woodward's sole concern was for her daughter,
convicted last fall of the second-degree murder of 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen.
	   But in an interview with Sky TV, Mrs. Jones said Mrs. Woodward's
primary concern ``became money _ the money became God. And I find
it so sad and yet so sickening that something so good should turn
into something like this,'' she said. A judge later reduced the
verdict to manslaughter and sentenced Ms. Woodward, 20, to the 279
days she had served in prison since her arrest.
	   Mrs. Jones said that when she told Mrs. Woodward that a lawyer
had been hired to run the trust, Mrs. Woodward replied that she
would return from the United States to ``sort out the money.''
	   ``I said `Well, it's not for you to sort the money out because
the solicitor has said it's not your money - it was set up ... to
help people like the Woodwards to look after their kids when they
get in trouble.'''
	   ``And Susan said `Jean, I am the Woodwards and that money is
ours.'''
	   Soon afterward, Mrs. Jones said, Mrs. Woodward changed the
fund's lawyers.
	   ``When I found that out I knew then that there was nothing left
that I could do. It was over,'' she said.
	   ``She (Mrs. Woodward) rode roughshod over everybody. She was the
most ungracious person I have ever met in my life. No matter how
much kindness people have shown her, she just seemed to push them
to one side and it was horrendous watching it.''
	   She added, ``I believe the fund should be stopped. God bless all
the people that helped and worked so hard.''
	   There was no immediate comment from Mrs. Woodward. But Woodward
family friend Sandra McCabe said Mrs. Jones was angry because she
had wanted to remain a signatory on the fund's checks and have the
Woodwards come to her for money.
	   ``We didn't want an Oliver Twist situation with Sue and Gary
Woodward having to go with a begging bowl every time they needed
money, so we decided to put it in a proper trust,'' she said.
	   The Rev. Ken Davey, chairman of the fund's trustees, said it was
not possible to close down the fund. ``There is still money in the
fund .. and we have the responsibility to to distribute that money
in accordance with the wishes of the people who gave it,'' he told
Sky.
	   And trustees backed Mrs. Woodward this week when she denied
forging a housing bill to get money from the fund.

Majority of Singapore stocks now priced under a dollar 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ After a year of severe losses in Asia's
financial crisis, Singapore's stock market is now composed
primarily of penny stocks, according to a Sunday newspaper.
	   No fewer than 235 issues listed on the Stock Exchange of
Singapore are now under one Singapore dollar (57 U.S. cents),
representing about 60 percent of all SES stocks, The Sunday Times
reported.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index hit a 9 1/2-year
low last Wednesday before recovering moderately and closing Friday
at 1,091.49 points. That's 45 percent below its level of 1,981.28
last July 1, at the start of the regional crisis.
	   The number of penny stocks on Singapore's exchange has increased
from about 197 during a particularly bad episode in January, when
the index dropped to 1,073.47.
	   Easyknit International, a Hong Kong dollar-denominated stock, is
now the cheapest Singapore stock at 2 Hong Kong cents (1/4 U.S.
cent). The newspaper noted that 1,000 shares in the company now
cost 4.40 Singapore dollars (dlrs 2.50), less than the cost of
refreshments served at the company's annual general meeting, which
a shareholder is entitled to attend.
	   But despite the bargain basement prices, many investors are wary
of buying now since Asia's financial turmoil looks likely to
continue and perhaps intensify, the paper said.
	   It said some analysts are predicting that the benchmark index
will sink to a low of 600 to 800 points, when prices across the
board will be even cheaper and some stocks may disappear completely
as companies go bankrupt.

Violence clouds fourth day of teacher protests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Riot police used tear gas to disperse
striking teachers from outside an examination center in central
Athens on Sunday on the fourth day of violent protests.
	   Although no injuries were reported, teachers smashed several
cars and shop windows, firebombed one vehicle and threw rocks at
police. Eight arrests were made.
	   The teachers were protesting new examinations introduced for
candidates seeking appointments at state-run schools. They say
their university degrees should be the only qualification
necessary.
	   Under the previous system, teachers had to wait years for a
state job. But graduates who had been promised jobs several years
ago are being required to take the new exam.
	   At least three policemen and several protesters have been
injured since teachers took the streets on Thursday, and dozens
have been arrested.
	   Although protesters tried to prevent candidates from entering
examination halls, local media in Athens reported that two-thirds
of the candidates had managed to take the exam under police
protection.
	   Traffic was snarled for four hours by roadblocks and protesters
shut down Athens' lone subway line until mid-day.
	   In major cities throughout the country, protesters marched on
examination centers, calling for the resignation of the education
minister and the cancellation of the exam.
	   The teachers union announced it would challenge the exam in
court, and called a 24-hour strike for Monday.

Nissim Aloni, leading Israeli author and playwright, dead at 72 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Author and playwright Nissim Aloni, hailed for
his keen observation of Israeli foibles, has died at age 72 after
suffering a stroke.
	   Tributes poured in Sunday from all over Israel for Aloni, who
died Saturday night in a Tel Aviv hospital.
	   ``In his plays and stories he combined light and color, drama
and comedy, song and laughter,'' said Yitzhak Levy, Israel's
minister for education and culture.
	   In his play ``Most Cruel the King,'' which had its premiere in
1953, Aloni was the first to break with the literary realism of the
post-independence generation of Israeli playwrights. He had a sharp
ear for the dialect and manners of the myriad ethnic groups in
Israel's mainly immigrant society.
	   Winner of the prestigious Israel Prize in 1996, Aloni had an
audience far larger than the theater-going public because he was
also a leading writer of comedy skits and monologues for radio and
the popular music hall.
	   Among his plays were ``The Emperor's New Clothes,'' (1961),
``The American Princess,'' (1963), ``The Revolution and the
Chicken,'' (1964), ``The Bride and the Butterfly Hunter,'' (1967),
``Napoleon, Dead or Alive,'' (1970) and ``The Gypsies of Jaffa,''
(1971).
	   He was also a major translator of foreign-language works into
Hebrew. His translations of Shakespeare's ``The Merry Wives of
Windsor,'' Moliere's ``Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,'' and ``Le Malade
Imaginaire'' became standards of the Israeli stage.
	   A collection of his short stories, ``The Owl,'' was published in
1975.
	   Aloni's funeral was held Sunday in Tel Aviv. A widower, he was
survived by his brother, retired judge Shaul Aloni.

Eritrea, Ethiopia pressed to stop air raids 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos ASM101-103

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea and Ethiopia were urged to stop
air raids on each other's territory as a first step towards ending
their deadly border conflict, an Italian envoy said Sunday.
	   Underscoring the urgency of his peace mission, Rino Serri said,
``The friendship between these two countries is fundamental for the
stabilization of the entire area of the Horn of Africa and of the
entire continent.''
	   Italy, the former colonial power in Eritrea, is seeking to calm
more than a month of violence, first by brokering a deal for no
more air raids, said Serri, an undersecretary of state.
	   Serri met for 1 1/2 hours with President Isaias Afwerki late
Saturday before flying Sunday to the Ethiopian capital of Addis
Ababa.
	   ``A cessation of air raids is a partial aspect of a cessation of
hostilities, and that's what we want,'' said Isaias' spokesman
Yemane Gebremeskel. There was no immediate comment from the
Ethiopians.
	   Although no skirmishes were reported this weekend, hundreds have
died in tank and artillery battles on three fronts since early May.
	   Warplanes' bombs have killed at least 48 civilians in two
attacks on northern Ethiopia, and four people in two attacks on a
military-civilian airport on the outskirts of Asmara.
	   Commercial flights to Asmara have been halted since June 5 when
two warplanes bombed the airport. Ships have hovered off the coast,
fearing the Ethiopians would bomb the port of Massawa as they did
during Eritrea's 30-year war for independence.
	   Eritrea has complained bitterly to international officials about
the effective air and sea blockade.
	   Five African leaders appointed by the Organization of African
Unity were tentatively scheduled begin efforts to foster peace this
week.
	   Meanwhile, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will try to arrange
a ceasefire between Eritrea and Ethiopia, Eritrean foreign minister
Haile Woldensae said Sunday in Cairo.
	   On the surface, at least, the dispute centers on more than a
half-dozen disputed patches of land, the largest of which is the
400-square-kilometer (160-square-mile) Yirga triangle.
	   But Serri said without elaborating that land ``may not be even
the most important issue.''
	   Businessmen say the root causes of the conflict are economic.
Relationship between the former allies worsened in November when
Eritrea introduced its own currency, setting off a trade spat that
has hurt both economies, reducing cross-border trade to a trickle.
	   So far, multiple efforts have failed to overcome an impasse:
Ethiopia continues to insist Eritrea withdraw its troops from
disputed areas before peace talks can begin. Eritrea refuses,
claiming the disputed territory based on boundaries drawn by Italy
when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   ``When you disagree on a point, it is pointless to keep talking
about the point on which you disagree,'' Serri said.
	   In a bid to break the deadlock, Italy will attempt to broaden
the scope of peace talks to include issues of common interest such
as trade, telecommunications and transportation, Serri said.
	   ``In order to go beyond this stage of conflict we should look
forward to broader horizons,'' he said.
	   The Eritreans gained formal independence from Ethiopia in 1993
after helping rebels end 17 years of Marxist rule in Ethiopia.

U.S. Reform Jews criticized for joint prayers at Western Wall 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ About 200 Reform Jews, both men and women from
the United States, prayed together Sunday at Jerusalem's Western
Wall, drawing criticism from ultra-Orthodox Jews who adhere to
separation of the sexes during worship.
	   But the event, held behind police barriers, was peaceful _
unlike in recent weeks, when men and women praying together were
pelted with garbage by ultra-Orthodox Jews.
	   The 2,000 year-old Western Wall is Judaism's holiest site, a
remnant of the Second Temple. There are separate prayer areas for
men and women, in accordance with Orthodox Jewish practice.
	   The overwhelming majority of American Jews belong to streams of
Judaism not formally recognized by Israel's officially Orthodox
religious establishment.
	   At Sunday's event, the Reform group was not permitted to enter
the regular prayer area close to the Wall because it had announced
plans for the men and women to pray together.
	   ``We think there should be a section of the Wall set aside for
egalitarian worship,'' said Rabbi Eric Yoffie, a U.S. Reform Jewish
leader. ``We don't think non-Orthodox worshippers should have to
appeal for police protection to come and pray at a site which
belongs to the entire Jewish people.''
	   Yoffie is president of the New York-based Union of American
Hebrew Congregations.

Malaysian motor vehicle sales expected to slump by 68 percent this year 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian dealers expect the Asian
financial crisis to cut their motor vehicle sales to 130,000 this
year, down 68 percent from last year's record 404,837, a newspaper
said Sunday.
	   The Sun said that for this year's first five months, statistics
of the Malaysian Motor Traders Association show passenger vehicle
sales of 31,768, down 73 percent from 117,836 in January-May last
year.
	   ``We earlier thought the downturn would only last one or two
years. But now we don't know,'' the Sun quoted association
chairwoman Aishah Ahmad as saying.
	   Consumers are finding it difficult to obtain credit, she said.
	   She added that because of the Malaysian currency's decline in
value, ``consumers can expect prices of vehicles to go up by
another 50-60 percent when stocks which were brought in before the
currency depreciation are completely depleted.''

English fans clash with police ceremony 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with fan violence in Marseille, Iran mourning
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The first violence to involve English fans exploded
with the World Cup four days old Sunday, detracting from a so far
successful competition with plenty of goals and goalmouth thrills
and spills.
	   After an English supporter was injured by a car in the Old Port
district of Marseille, some 200 fans showered police and their
vehicles with bottles and cans, sending at least one gendarme to
the hospital with a head injury. Four English fans were arrested.
	   The incident happened with several hundred English fans already
in town for Monday's game against Tunisia with around 9,000
expected to show up for the match and many more arriving without
tickets.
	   As a result of the overnight clash, authorities stepped up
security early, with about 1,600 uniformed or plainclothed city
police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS national police
patrolling the city.
	   At the same time English fans were skirmishing with police,
Iranian players were holding a religious mourning ceremony ahead of
Sunday's game against Yugoslavia at Saint-Etienne.
	   In a three-hour ceremony at a time when the players could have
been getting a good night's sleep before the game, they were
beating their chests and also wept for the death of a 7th century
Shiite Muslim saint.
	   On the field, two goals in five minutes completed Nigeria's
second rally from a one-goal deficit and lifted the Super Eagles'
to a 3-2 victory over perennial European power Spain on Saturday in
a match which featured a goal that will be shown in video replays
for years.

Officials say 931 dead in India's cyclone; residents dispute figure 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Rescue workers found 97 corpses Sunday on
an island off the western coast, raising to 931 the death toll in
the cyclone that pounded Gujarat state this week.
	   The bodies apparently were washed on to the island after
cyclone, which hit land Tuesday, packing winds of 120 kph (75 mph)
and whipping up 20-foot (7-meter) waves.
	   ``The bodies were spotted in aerial surveys and workers were
then sent to search the island,'' said Pramod Mishra, a top
government official by telephone from Gandhinagar, 465 kilometers
(290 miles) north of Bombay.
	   Aid workers and residents have disputed the official figures,
saying hundreds of people were swept away when a tidal wave hit the
area. Thousands of people were working in salt farms dotting the
coast, aid workers said.
	   Sunday's newspapers highlighted complaints of residents that the
administration has provided little or no relief in many places,
forcing people to depend on voluntary agencies or fend for
themselves.
	   The reports also said the local administration did not warn
people about the intensity of the cyclone in many towns and
villages along the coast that ultimately were affected. Politicians
and bureaucrats, the reports said, were passing the buck, blaming
the weather office for inadequate warnings. The weather office has
denied the accusations.
	   Only 160 bodies could be identified of 697 bodies of salt
workers or port employees found at Kandla, 530 kilometers (330
miles) northwest of Bombay.
	   At least 315 persons have been listed as missing in a report
compiled Sunday by soldiers and government officials after meetings
with salt factory contractors.
	   The missing persons list could overlap with the bodies recovered
since less than a quarter of bodies could be identified, said
Mishra.
	   Aid workers said few salt manufacturers kept records of
laborers. Newspapers have reported that contractors eager to rake
in more profits kept workers in the dark about the approaching
cyclone. Most of the workers were illiterate and too poor to own
even a radio. A fierce summer with temperatures reaching 48 Celsius
(118 Fahrenheit) helped evaporate the sea water so quickly that
workers barely had enough time to rake in the salt.
	   Sunday, mass cremations of unclaimed bodies continued for the
third consecutive day because government officials feared an
epidemic outbreak.
	   Survivors crowded into relief camps set up near Kandla, but aid
workers said many more were on the streets.
	   ``There are hundreds of people on the streets without shelter.
Local newspapers are full of news of the police falling ill with
cholera. The situation is frightening,'' said aid worker Teja, who
uses only one name, by telephone from a village near Kandla.
	   Government officials denied an epidemic outbreak and said all
precautions were being taken.

Nissim Aloni, leading Israeli author and playwright, dead at 72 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Author and playwright Nissim Aloni, hailed for
his keen observation of Israeli foibles, has died at age 72 after
suffering a stroke.
	   Tributes poured in Sunday from all over Israel for Aloni, who
died Saturday night in a Tel Aviv hospital.
	   ``In his plays and stories he combined light and color, drama
and comedy, song and laughter,'' said Yitzhak Levy, Israel's
minister for education and culture.
	   In his play ``Most Cruel the King,'' which had its premiere in
1953, Aloni was the first to break with the literary realism of the
post-independence generation of Israeli playwrights. He had a sharp
ear for the dialect and manners of the myriad ethnic groups in
Israel's mainly immigrant society.
	   Winner of the prestigious Israel Prize in 1996, Aloni had an
audience far larger than the theatergoing public because he was
also a leading writer of comedy skits and monologues for radio and
the popular music hall.
	   Among his plays were ``The Emperor's New Clothes,'' (1961),
``The American Princess,'' (1963), ``The Revolution and the
Chicken,'' (1964), ``The Bride and the Butterfly Hunter,'' (1967),
``Napoleon, Dead or Alive,'' (1970) and ``The Gypsies of Jaffa,''
(1971).
	   He was also a major translator of foreign-language works into
Hebrew. His translations of Shakespeare's ``The Merry Wives of
Windsor,'' Moliere's ``Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,'' and ``Le Malade
Imaginaire'' became standards of the Israeli stage.
	   A collection of his short stories, ``The Owl,'' was published in
1975.
	   Aloni's funeral was held Sunday in Tel Aviv. A widower, he was
survived by his brother, retired judge Shaul Aloni.

Dissident appeals for welcoming rally for Clinton 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A recently released Chinese dissident has asked
for police permission to hold a public rally to welcome U.S.
President Bill Clinton when he visits Shanghai later this month, a
dissident monitoring group said Sunday.
	   Clinton is expected to spend two days in the fast-developing
financial city after his late June summit meeting in Beijing with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   In a letter to the city's police chief, Shanghai dissident Han
Lifa asked that ordinary city residents be allowed to rally to
welcome Clinton's arrival, the Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Han, freed in April after serving three years in a labor camp
for democracy activism, argued that China's constitution allows
freedom of assembly, the Hong Kong-based group said. Han sent the
letter last Wednesday but as of Saturday had not received a reply,
the group added.
	   Police permission for public rallies is rarely, if ever,
granted, and is even less likely during Clinton's carefully
scripted visit, the first by a U.S. president since China's
military violently quelled student-led protests centered on
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
	   Already, police have interrogated and threatened three
dissidents who urged Clinton to press Chinese leaders on human
rights during his visit, the Information Center said Saturday.
	   Groups of police, in one case as many as seven officers, went to
the homes of Leng Wanbao, Tang Yuanjuan and Li Wei in the northeast
industrial city of Changchun on Friday, the group said.

Bank Strike to continue for sixth week 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Workers at the nation's fourth-largest
bank announced plans to continue striking for a sixth week despite
an apparent easing of tensions last week, local media reported
Sunday.
	   Ionian Bank employees walked off the job May 8 to protest the
government's plan to privatize the bank, touching off a firestorm
of criticism against the government's economic austerity plan.
	   Three court rulings have declared the strike illegal, and
Ionian's management has filed a fourth suit.
	   Although umbrella trade unions have refused to call more strikes
on behalf of the bank's employees, Ionian workers have called a
24-hour strike for Monday.
	   Shareholders are expected to authorize the sale of the bank at a
meeting Friday.
	   Union leaders have demanded the sale be canceled, but are
negotiating the terms of the privatization in order to maintain
their jobs and long-standing social security benefits.
	   Ionian's sale is critical for the success of the government's
privatization program and its effort to restructure the banking
sector ahead of Greece's targeted participation in the European
economic and monetary union by 2001.

Chinese companies to continue listing on overseas stock markets 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will continue to support listings of its
state companies overseas despite bearishness in Asian markets
brought on by the region's financial crisis, the country's top
stock market regulator was quoted Sunday as saying.
	   ``The crisis has brought us both challenges and opportunities,''
Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, said in an interview with the official China Daily's
weekly business edition.
	   Zhou said the commission this year will pick a fifth and sixth
batch of companies eligible for stock listings on overseas markets.
	   Selection will focus on large state companies with good profits
and development potential. Most candidates will target Hong Kong,
said Zhou, even though that market has been unsettled by the
territory's troubled economy.
	   The newspaper report did not say how many companies have listed
overseas, nor mention those that plan to in the near future.

Guinea-Bissau rebels deny claims they're beaten, fighting intensifies 
</HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal _ Refuting government claims that they had been
routed, rebel soldiers in Guinea-Bissau on Sunday continued to wage
fierce battles with loyalist troops a week after launching their
coup attempt, according to reports.
	   A rebel spokesman described as ``pure propaganda'' the
government's claim, made on state radio Saturday, that the
renegades had been dislodged from their stronghold in a military
garrison in the capital Bissau, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
reported.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes reportedly was speaking on a private radio
station seized by the rebels after they mutinied.
	   He said the mutineers were ready to allow emergency food aid to
be flown into Bissau's international airport, located near the
garrison, which they also control, the report said.
	   A Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that embassy
staff in Bissau were holed up in the building due to the fighting
outside.
	   The situation was ``still very serious'' he said.
	   Fighting between the rebels and government forces of this
coastal west African country, backed by troops from neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, has centered on the garrison in
the suburb of Bra.
	   The military complex, covering several hectares (acres) and
surrounded by high walls, occupies a strategic defensive position
in the city.
	   The two sides were Sunday pounding each other's positions with
rockets, mortars and artillery, according to Lusa.
	   The Portuguese ambassador in Bissau said on Portuguese state
television RTP that the French and Russian embassies had taken
direct hits.
	   Francisco Henriques said the Russian compound, where eight staff
were working, was the hardest hit. Its generator and water supply
were knocked out, he said.
	   There was no information on the number of casualties in the
fighting. International phone lines to the former Portuguese colony
were not working.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who gained renown as a guerilla fighter in the war against
Portuguese rule from 1961 to 1974.
	   Mane was made chief of the armed forces after independence but
was fired in January amid allegations of smuggling arms to
separatists in Senegal and formally stepped down a week ago.
	   Mane has accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption
and called on him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.

Friend of Rabin killer convicted; failed to tell police of intent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with reax from Leah Rabin
By DANNY BEN-TAL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Isral (AP) _ A young woman who was a friend of Yitzhak
Rabin's killer was convicted Sunday of failing to inform the police
of what she knew to be his murderous intentions.
	   Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, could face up to two years in prison.
Her lawyer said an appeal is planned.
	   Rabin's widow, Leah, expressed relief over the conviction,
calling it a ``ray of light in the darkness surrounding us.''
	   Har-Shefi was a friend of Yigal Amir, who boasted to her that he
was planning to assassinate the prime minister in order to stop the
peace process and the handing over of land to the Palestinians.
Amir is serving a life sentence for the November 1995 murder.
	   Har-Shefi pleaded innocent, telling the Tel Aviv Magistrates
Court she did not believe Amir really intended to kill Rabin and
that she thought Amir was just trying to impress her.
	   However, Judge Mira Litsky said there were contradictions in
Har-Shefi's testimony and that it was clear that she was aware of
Amir's intention.
	   ``She took him seriously, not as a liar indulging in
fantasies,'' she said.
	   The judge noted that on the night of Rabin's murder, when Israel
radio reported that the killer was from Amir's home town, Herzliya,
Har-Shefi immediately telephoned him.
	   Har-Shefi testified the Amir, a right-wing extremist, told her
that religious precepts permitted him to kill Rabin because the
prime minister's plans to hand over territory to the Palestinians
threatened the security of Jews.
	   Rabin was shot dead at a peace rally in Tel Aviv.
	   Leah Rabin said the Har-Shefi case pointed up the climate of
right-wing fury, including violent denunciations of Rabin, at the
time of the killing.
	   ``When they march carrying a coffin as a metaphor, will there
not be one fool who wants to fulfill the metaphor and put into the
coffin the `traitor, murderer and killer of Zionism?''' she said on
Israel radio.
	   Har-Shefi showed no emotion as the verdict was read out. Wearing
a long purple dress with high neckline and long sleeves, she sat
sketching on a pad, rarely looking up.
	   She refused to answer questions from the large crowd of
reporters.
	   Har-Shefi was acquitted of a second charge of aiding and
abetting Amir in his efforts to obtain arms illegally. The
prosecution said she informed Amir of the location of the armory in
the West Bank settlement of Beit-El where she lived, and gave him
the name of another settler who could teach him how to assemble a
bomb.
	   Sentencing is to take place Sept. 15.

Eric Tabarly, best-known French sailor

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Eric Tabarly, France's best-known yachtsman who
criss-crossed oceans to win numerous solo titles, has died in a
final battle at sea, officials confirmed Sunday. He was 66.
	   Missing since Saturday after falling off his century-old
sailboat the Pen Duick near the coast of Wales, Tabarly was
declared dead Sunday morning by officials in the Brittany port of
Brest and in a tribute by President Jacques Chirac.
	   Searches by sea and air failed to turn up the famous navigator,
who shot to fame in 1964 when he won England's Transat solo race
across the Atlantic and inspired sailors across France.
	   ``Despite the last searches that seemed in vain, I didn't dare
believe the demise of Eric Tabarly,'' Chirac said. ``It's with
great sadness and much emotion that I give in to the evidence.''
	   Tabarly ``left his mark on several generations of sailors,''
Chirac said.
	   Born July 24, 1931 in the western city of Nantes, Tabarly
learned to love sailing from his father, a businessman and sailing
enthusiast.
	   His life with the Pen Duick, meaning ``blackheaded tomtit'' in
Breton, began in 1938 when his father bought the 15-meter (50-foot)
sailboat built in Ireland in 1898.
	   Tabarly joined the navy in 1953 to save the Pen Duick, learning
how to restore the boat from the keel-up.
	   ``Without me, it would just be a boat; without it, my life would
probably be different,'' Tabarly wrote in his memoirs.
	   Tabarly was a 33-year-old naval officer when he won the Trasat
in June 1964 aboard the Pen Duick II, a 13.6 meter (45-foot) ketch.
He finished the 5,390-kms (3,350-mile) Plymouth to Newport race in
27 days.
	   Among other races, Tabarly went on to win the Morgan Cup in
1967, the Gotland Round, Channel Race and the Fasnet in 1967.
	   He won the transpacific solo race in the Pen Duick V, a
11,000-km (6,800-mile) race in 39 days in 1969 and won the Los
Angeles-Tahiti race in 1972. Aboard the Pen Duick VI, he won the
Plymouth-Newport race in 23 days and 20 hours in 1976.
	   Tabary was survived by his wife, Jaqueline, and his 14-year-old
daughter Marie.
	   Funeral arrangements were pending.

Violence, vote-rigging investigated in local elections 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Police on Sunday were investigating
reports of violence and vote fraud in local elections that were
dominated by Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party.
	   Saturday's elections for 7,729 ward chiefs and 3,725 town
counselors attracted a record number of candidates, and competition
was fierce.
	   Local political machines allegedly attacked rival candidates,
bought votes, and took advantage of legal loopholes to register in
their districts supporters who reside elsewhere, news reports said.
In some districts, the numbers voting were more than double the
number of actual residents, the reports said.
	   The Nationalists won 45 percent of seats outright, with
independents, many allied to the party, taking 51 percent. The main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party increased its take
significantly, but still won just 2.7 percent of seats.
	   Despite major opposition gains, the Nationalists remain dominant
in elections at the very lowest level, where they rely heavily on
community networks that are often riddled with crime and
corruption.
	   Local governments in many areas have increased ward chiefs'
powers and budgets recently in hopes of improving service to
residents. Ward chiefs are the lowest level elected officials
responsible for individual city neighborhoods or villages.
	   The positions are also desired because they are vital in
organizing electoral support for politicians at higher levels.
Saturday's elections were considered a warmup for December's
elections for legislators and the mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung,
Taiwan two biggest cities.
	   A special police task force investigating electoral crime has
forced vote buying underground, but it is still believed to be
common.
	   Two winning candidates were held in detention Saturday night in
central Chiayi city and county on suspicion of ordering beatings
and buying votes, police said.
	   Numerous similar allegations are being investigated, they said.
	   A police detective was surrounded by a crowd of more than 100
people in central Changhua County when he attempted to remove
vote-buying evidence from a ward chief candidate's campaign office,
the United Daily News reported. The candidate and a campaign aide
were being sought for questioning over the incident, the report
said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea and Ethiopia were urged to stop
air raids on each other's territory as a first step towards ending
their deadly border conflict, an Italian envoy said Sunday.
Underscoring the urgency of his peace mission, Rino Serri said,
``The friendship between these two countries is fundamental for the
stabilization of the entire area of the Horn of Africa and of the
entire continent.'' Italy, the former colonial power in Eritrea, is
seeking to calm more than a month of violence, first by brokering a
deal for no more air raids, said Serri, an undersecretary of state.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Stung by the success of right-wing
populist Pauline Hanson in a state election, Australia's
conservative government on Sunday played down her chances of
gaining similar support nationally and urged its coalition members
not to panic. ``Irrespective of the outcome it would be foolish for
the coalition ... to ignore the very strong showing of (Hanson's
party) One Nation,'' Prime Minister John Howard said. ``There are
clear lessons to be learned from the result. These include the
genuine sense of vulnerability felt by many Australians during
times of economic and social change.'' A national election is due
within a year. (Australia-Queensland Election)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A young woman who was a friend of former
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's murderer was convicted Sunday of

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Libyan Islamic opposition group claimed
responsibility for an alleged attack on Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, the Al-Hayat newspaper reported Sunday. The Libyan
government had denied such an attack, which travelers from Libya
said took place on June 1, slightly injuring Gadhafi and killing a
female bodyguard. The Al-Hayat quoted Abdullah Ahmed, spokesman of
the Islamic Martyrs Movement, as saying that its guerrillas carried
out the attack on the night of May 31-June 1 in the Sidi Khalifa
area, 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of Benghazi in eastern Libya.
At least four bodyguards were killed when the group's gunmen
ambushed Gadhafi's motorcade, Ahmed was quoted as saying by
Al-Hayat, a respected Arab daily. (Libya-Gadhafi)

Nigerian junta leader meets parties, possibly prisoner's wife 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ In a sign that tensions may be easing in
Nigeria, its new military ruler huddled overnight with party
leaders amid reports that he also met with a wife of the No. 1
political prisoner.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar consulted until early Sunday with
officials of the five official parties and the national electoral
commission at the presidential villa in the capital, Abuja.
	   An official statement said the meeting fulfilled a pledge that
Abubakar made last Tuesday, when he was sworn in as head of
Africa's most populous nation after the death of dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha and vowed to continue a transition to civilian rule.
	   In his swearing-in speech, Abubakar had said he would meet with
relevant government agencies as a first step in charting a course
for the oil-rich yet impoverished West African country.
	   He has yet to say how he planned to meet an Oct. 1 deadline for
a switch to a civilian government, angering opposition leaders who
have demanded details as proof of his sincerity.
	   State radio said the session discussed various aspects of the
transition program ``with frankness and without rancor.''
	   ``It is time to reflect, cooperate and combat the ever-present
threats of instability,'' Abubakar told officials called to the
fortress-like villa Saturday evening. ``The vicious cycle of
threats of instability, with its attendant disruptions, should not
be allowed to persist.''
	   Abubakar has come under fire for using soldiers and riot police
Friday to quell attempts at pro-democracy demonstrations.
Fifty-five people were arrested, though all are believed to have
been released.
	   The protests were originally intended to mark the fifth
anniversary of annulled 1993 presidential elections, but took on
added significance as the first test of the new regime.
	   Dissidents are watching to see if Abubakar goes ahead with Aug.
1 presidential elections, and more importantly, who will be allowed
to run. Abacha had blatantly manipulated the system so that he was
the only candidate nominated by all of Nigeria's political parties.
	   Brushing aside criticisms, Abubakar urged Nigerians looking for
political change to ``examine issues critically, dispassionately,
leaving no room for the casting of aspersions or the apportioning
of blame on any person or group.''
	   A Lagos newspaper, meanwhile, reported Sunday that Abubakar also
had met with one of the wives of Moshood Abiola, the imprisoned
businessman who is believed to have won the 1993 elections.
	   If true, the meeting could indicate an easing of tension between
Nigeria's junta and its legion of opponents, for whom Abiola is the
central figure.
	   Doyin Abiola met with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar sometime late
last week in Abuja, ThisDay reported. An intermediary was sent to
her just hours after Abubakar took power. The report could not be
independently confirmed and the Abiola family could not be reached
for comment.
	   Moshood Abiola, a billionaire, defiantly declared himself
president after the government suddenly declared the election
results invalid. He was charged with treason and has been in prison
ever since.
	   Freedom for Abiola _ and his eventual ascension to the
presidency _ has become the main rallying cry for Nigeria's
opposition.
	   Another one of Abiola's many wives, Kudirat, was killed in an
assassination-style slaying in 1996. She was an outspoken critic of
Abacha, who took power in a 1993 coup.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The latest prominent victim of Turkey's
tough laws on free speech and media is an Istanbul correspondent
for a French newspaper has been ordered to start serving a
seven-month prison term on Tuesday.
	   For Turkey's courts, Ragip Duran's interview with a Kurdish
rebel leader constituted making separatist propaganda.
	   ``I think this is an injustice and that I am not guilty,''
Duran, 43, told Turkish daily Milliyet in an interview published
Sunday. ``You cannot commit a crime by writing.''
	   Duran, who in the past worked for the BBC and Agence
France-Press and is a lecturer at Istanbul's Galatasaray
University, was convicted in December 1994, and an appeals court
upheld that conviction in October.
	   The charges stem from an 1994 article published in the now
defunct pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur Gundem, which described rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan as a ``philosopher and moralist.''
	   Despite frequent international criticism, Turkey, waging a war
against the autonomy-seeking rebels in the southeast, continues to
use a broad 1991 anti-terrorism law that prohibits acts and words
deemed to be separatist propaganda, against journalists or writers.
The war has claimed some 37,000 lives since 1984.
	   Dozens of journalists and intellectuals are serving prison terms
for their writings or outspokenness, including Esber Yagmurdereli,
a blind lawyer-turned-human rights activist who returned to jail
this month after refusing to seek a pardon on health reasons.
	   The New-York based Committee to Protect Journalists has urged
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz to look into legal ways that would
rescind Duran's prison term.
	   Last week police seized hundreds of copies of a pro-Kurdish
paper for printing statements by Ocalan.

Fearing backlash, Iranian journalists cancel U.S. trip 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A group of Iranian journalists canceled a
trip to the United States, apparently for fear of angering the
hard-liners in the ruling clergy, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The eight journalists, including chief editors of Iran's main
papers, were to leave for Washington D.C. this week to attend a
June 17 seminar at the Middle East Institute on ``Iran, America and
Middle East Affairs,'' Farda newspaper said.
	   But they decided not to go because the trip became
``politicized,'' Farda said.
	   The journalists had been granted an interview with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, which apparently put them in
a difficult position: they didn't want to upset the hard-liners or
refuse to see Albright.
	   The journalists could not be immediately reached for comment.
	   ``The trip was politicized after the revelation that (Albright)
would hold an interview with Iranian press delegation. And this
fact served as one of the reasons for the cancellation of the
trip,'' Farda quoted Issaa Saharkhiz, the director-general of
domestic press in the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, as
saying. He did not elaborate.
	   The journalists had also planned a trip to the offices of The
Washington Post, The Washington Times, The New York Times, the
Council of American Moslems, and the Nation of Islam, the paper
said.
	   Besides, they had scheduled meetings with several Congressmen
and officials of the White House and the State Department.
	   The United States severed ties with Iran after revolutionary
militants overthrew the U.S.-backed shah and stormed the American
Embassy in Tehran in 1979. They held 52 Americans hostage for 444
days.
	   But moderate President Mohammad Khatami who took office in
August has called for exchanges of scholars, artists, writers and
tourists between Iran and the United States.
	   However, Iran's powerful hard-liners still refer to the United
States as ``The Great Satan'' and shun even cultural exchanges
between Tehran and Washington.
	   Meanwhile, Washington accuses Tehran of sponsoring international
terrorism, trying to undermine the Middle East peace process and
working on developing weapons of mass destruction.

Solana: no option is excluded in settling Kosovo crisis 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photo
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said
Sunday that NATO does not exclude the use of its air power to help
stop violence in Kosovo and pave the way for negotiations that
should bring a lasting settlement of the crisis.
	   ``NATO will not stand idly by. We will not allow a repeat of the
situation of 1991 in Bosnia,'' Solana told the 26th International
Congress of the Association of European Journalists in Warsaw. The
two-day meeting winds up on Sunday.
	   He said the Western military alliance, which invited Poland to
join in April next year, is ready to use its military force to back
up international diplomatic efforts towards solving the crisis in
the troubled Yugoslav province.
	   ``We will study and prepare for a wide range of military
options, including a possible use of NATO air power,'' Solana said.
	   A NATO exercise, using air forces, that opens on Monday over
Albania and Macedonia is intended to ``demonstrate NATO's ability
to project power rapidly into the region,'' he said.
	   ``No option at this stage is excluded,'' Solana said. ``NATO
will play its role to help stabilize the region, and encourage
negotiated settlement that respects existing international
boundaries.''
	   Solana stressed that on the threshold of the 21st century ``Our
continent cannot find lasting peace and stability if the Balkans
remain volatile.''
	   More than 300 people have died in recent months and dozens
missing since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic stepped up his
offensive with troops and police against ethnic Albanians, who make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population and want independence.

Returning from U.S., President Kim pledges faster reforms 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung returned home
Sunday from a nine-day visit to the United States, determined to
accelerate reforms to attract badly needed foreign investment for
South Korea's battered economy.
	   ``My visit has achieved more than I expected,'' Kim told an
airport news conference. ``Outside conditions for our economic
recovery have thus been laid down. What remains to be done is
accelerating domestic reforms.''
	   Financial help was the primary goal of Kim's trip, his first
since taking office in February. He said he was convinced in the
United States that South Korea has to reform its inefficient
economy to woo foreign investment.
	   Kim said U.S. support for South Korea shown by President Bill
Clinton, congressional leaders and the media was greater than he
had anticipated, making him feel a bigger burden to push reforms
more aggressively.
	   Meeting Kim at the White House, Clinton promised to ``do all I
can do'' to help South Korea overcome its worst economic crisis
ever. Outright U.S. help, ordered by Clinton, included dlrs 2
billion made available in soft loans for South Korean imports of
U.S. goods.
	   The U.S.-controlled World Bank also promised to provide dlrs 2
billion in loans to South Korea within this year.
	   Kim said such ``overwhelming'' U.S. support has convinced him
that there would be no new financial crisis similar to the one that
forced South Korea to turn to international help to bail out its
economy late last year.
	   But he said many U.S. businesses showed disappointment at what
they considered a slow pace in South Korean reforms, particularly
affecting the country's bloated, family-controlled conglomerates,
or chaebol.
	   Many South Korean conglomerates have collapsed or are teetering
on the brink of bankruptcy under mounds of debts to banks. One
government estimated put such bad bank loans at 100 trillion won
(dlrs 71 billion), or one-fifth of South Korea's gross national
product.
	   A typical chaebol is controlled by a single family and has 40 to
50 cross-funded subsidiaries, making everything from computer chips
to cars and ships. As a group, the conglomerates have become so
powerful they have defied efforts of past governments to break them
up.
	   South Korea promised to liquidate financially troubled banks and
companies when it agreed to a record dlrs 58 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund in December to defuse its foreign debt
crisis.
	   Kim said a series of economic reforms, including a more flexible
labor market, have improved the investment climate for foreign
capital but U.S. and other foreign investors are still wary of
becoming involved in South Korea, seeing it as financially
unstable.
	   To restore investor confidence, South Korea has to clean up
troubled banks and companies and make their bookkeeping more
transparent, Kim said.
	   Government-controlled city banks are currently compiling a list
of companies so deeply in debt they are no longer viable, planning
to shut them down by calling in their old loans and refusing to
provide new ones.
	   Kim said the list would be announced next week. He earlier had
ordered banks to include subsidiaries of the conglomerates in the
list of companies that will be forced to close in a few months.

Mubarak, Arafat discuss U.S. proposal on West Bank 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat discussed Sunday a U.S. proposal for Israeli
troops withdrawal from the West Bank to restart the Middle East
peace process.
	   Mubarak will raise the subject with Arab leaders within the next
few days, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said without
elaborating.
	   Israeli-Palestinian talks are deadlocked over Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to accept a U.S mediation
proposal that calls for Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have agreed.
	   ``The Palestinian stance is that it's over, because the Israeli
side is only moving now in an attempt ... to go around with the
elements of the U.S. proposal,'' Moussa said. ``This is what the
Palestinians don't accept.''
	   Moussa described Israel's decision to arm settlers as a ``call
for violence and the use of violence. When Israeli extremists are
supported militarily, you cannot blame the other side if they want
to defend themselves.''
	   Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have failed to
make any progress since March 1997 when Israel began building 6,500
housing units for Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Arafat, who did not speak to reporters, arrived in Cairo early
Sunday and was to leave later in the day.

NATO prepares for show of force in Balkans 
</HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO warplanes from across Europe
converged on an airbase in northern Italy Sunday to prepare for a
show of power over Albania and Macedonia that allied leaders hope
will convince Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to back down in
Kosovo.
	   About 40 aircraft operating from Aviano air base north of Venice
and from an American amphibious task force in the Adriatic Sea are
scheduled to conduct exercises, code-named Determined Falcon, from
early Monday morning until about midday, U.S. Navy officials said.
	   The NATO action, ordered by allied defense ministers Thursday,
comes as the death toll in the Serbian province of Kosovo continues
to rise in the face of a government offensive to put down a
rebellion by the Kosovo Liberation Army and rebel attacks on
Serbian forces.
	   More than 300 people have died as the Serb-led Yugoslav
government tries to suppress the increasingly radical independence
movement among Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
the province's population.
	   The Western allies oppose independence for the province, but
they also want to stop Milosevic's brutal attempts to suppress
dissent.
	   The great fear is that if the two sides aren't brought to the
negotiating table, the Kosovo fighting will spill over Yugoslavia's
borders and ignite a wider Balkan war.
	   Albanian Defense Minister Luan Hajdaraga said in an interview
last week he is convinced Milosevic wants ``to dominate the
situation by military means.'' The danger is, he said, that ``those
means can spread to Albania.''
	   Hajdaraga said 15,000 refugees have already flooded from Kosovo
into northern Albania, putting enormous strains on his government.
	   NATO also has ordered its military planners to study a range of
options for even tougher action, including direct military
intervention in Yugoslavia with air strikes and use of ground
forces. NATO insists, however, that it is only studying its options
to be ready for any political decisions.
	   Countries sending aircraft for the exercises include the United
States, France, Britain, Spain, Turkey, Denmark, the Netherlands
and Belgium.
	   A senior military official traveling in Europe with U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said a three-ship Marine amphibious force
led by the USS Wasp was en route to the Adriatic to participate in
the exercise. The contingent includes the amphibious assault ship
USS Trenton and the dock landing ship USS Portland, which had been
on port visits in Turkey.
	   The Wasp, an amphibious helicopter assault ship, is outfitted
with five Harrier jump-jets Harriers which are expected to join the
exercises.
	   The official said the United States also will supply Air Force
F-16 fighters, KC-135 tankers and EA-6B airborne early warning
planes.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the alliance continues
to support a political solution to the Kosovo problem, one that
both gives an ``enhanced status'' to Kosovo, but also ``preserves
the territorial integrity'' of Yugoslavia.
	   ``NATO also remains determined to contribute to efforts
promoting stability and security in neighboring countries, with
particular emphasis on Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia,'' he said.

No progress reported in freeing kidnapped envoy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The kidnappers of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya have yet to make demands for his
release and security forces have made no progress in their search
for the abducted official, a news agency reported Sunday.
	   Valentin Vlasov was kidnapped at gunpoint May 1. No one has
claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.
	   Chechen security forces and special investigative teams have
turned up no leads despite round-the-clock searches, and Vlasov's
fate remains unknown, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Shamil Basayev, the guerrilla commander turned deputy premier of
Chechnya, called for security forces to be allowed to carry out
searches for hostages without warrants.
	   ``We know sometimes where and how keeps some for other hostage,
but while agreements are being reached and search warrants are
being issued, criminals transfer him to another place,'' ITAR-Tass
quoted Basayev as saying.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions, usually for ransom, since the region's
two-year war for independence from Russia ended in 1996.
	   In the southern Russian city of Budyonnovsk, former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin participated in a commemoration
ceremony for victims of an attack on the city three years ago led
by Basayev.
	   Dozens of rebels under Basayev's command set cars on fire,
stormed police headquarters, gunned down civilians and seized
hundreds of hostages in the Budyonnovsk on June 14, 1995. About 140
people died.
	   The rebels demanded an end to the war in Chechnya, which lasted
another 14 months.
	   Chernomyrdin, who negotiated by telephone with Basayev to end
the crisis, also took part in a rally in front of police
headquarters, where 18 officers were killed in a clash with the
rebels.

Albanians report new police attacks in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian forces launched about 500
grenades into villages in western Kosovo in what appears to be
another crackdown on armed ethnic Albanian secessionists, Albanian
sources said.
	   Serb police brought a reinforcement of about 40 armored vehicles
and 15 tanks into the Decani area near the border with Albania,
according to the Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian
leaders. The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The Decani region has seen some of the worst fighting in past
weeks causing thousands of its mostly Albanian population to flee
across the border into Albania. Police have blocked all the roads
in the region, where the armed ethnic Albanian militants of the
Kosovo Liberation Army control most of the villages.
	   The attacks appeared as another government effort to crackdown
on the KLA, who are fighting to secede from Serbia and now control
some 40 percent of the province where ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9 to 1.
	   A source close to Serb police in the province said the militants
opened fire on a police patrol Saturday in southwestern Kosovo,
killing one policemen and injuring another.
	   More than 300 people have died on both sides since the crisis in
Kosovo escalated earlier this year, prompting the West to warn
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic he must change his hardline
policy in the region or face the threat of force.
	   NATO warplanes were convening at an airbase in northern Italy
Sunday in preparation for simulated air attacks in Albania and
Macedonia planned for Monday to try to persuade Milosevic to halt
military action in Kosovo.
	   Speaking in Poland Sunday, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
said the alliance does not exclude the use of its air power to help
bring stability to the region.
	   ``No option at this stage is excluded,'' Solana told
journalists.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 in an attempt
to suppress the Albanian independence movement. But since Serbs
launched a bloody crackdown in the region earlier this year, the
KLA has grown stronger and more popular among the ethnic Albanians.

World Cup: French file complaint in ticket scandal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French organizers said Sunday they had filed a
complaint against agents and tour operators allegedly involved in
the World Cup ticket scandal.
	   None of the groups involved in the filing were identified, but
Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the organizing committee, said the
panel was adamant about prosecuting anyone who sold bogus tickets.
	   ``We are going to court and an investigation will be carried
out,'' he said.
	   Thousands of fans from around the world have been left without
tickets they had been promised or paid for. French prosecutors said
Saturday they would investigate criminal charges against businesses
and individuals involved in ticket fraud.
	   Meanwhile, FIFA officially cleared Colombia's soccer federation
of any wrongdoing in dealing in World Cup tickets for the
month-long, 64-match tournament that ends July 12.
	   ``Without foundation,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said when
asked if any evidence against Colombia had been found in the
two-day investigation.
	   FIFA, the world soccer body, said Friday it was investigating an
unidentified South American country for ticket improprieties.
French reports said it was Colombia, although Colombian officials
said they were in the clear.
	   On Saturday, Cooper said a preliminary investigation ``tends to
indicate this federation is innocent.''
	   For more than a year, World Cup organizers have defended their
ticket-distribution plan against criticism that it was unfairly
weighted toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.7 million
tickets printed, almost 1.5 million were earmarked for interests in
the host country, with the rest distributed through tightly
licensed channels.
	   Soccer federations worldwide and commercial sponsors of the
World Cup received almost 1.2 million tickets to distribute through
their own channels, leaving only 138,000 for the general public.
	   Fans were told to deal with 17 approved agencies worldwide to
get those tickets. But officials said many fans arrived in France
to discover tickets they thought would be waiting for them came
from unlicensed brokers and tour operators, especially in Japan,
where some 12,000 fans were left ticketless.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.

Shaky Kafelnikov fights nerves to win Gerry Weber Open 
</HEADLINE>
By ROY KAMMERER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ A shaky Yevgeny Kafelnikov Sunday wasted
three match points but hung on against Magnus Larsson to capture
the Gerry Weber Open in straight sets.
	   Kafelnikov, needing a title to build up his dented confidence
for Wimbledon, beat the unseeded Swede, 6-4, 6-4 to capture the
dlrs 875,000 grass event for the second straight year.
	   For the former French Open winner, the title was his 16th but
first since winning the Guardian Direct Cup in February.
	   ``I've always been too nervous in decisive moments to win,''
said Kafelnikov. ``But winning was the best preparation for
Wimbledon.''
	   Kafelnikov threatened to blowout Larsson, a former top 10 player
making a comeback from a lingering virus. Attacking the net, the
world No. 7 swept the first set in 33 minutes and jumped to a 5-1
lead in the second.
	   ``I think I had no chance, he put too much pressure on me. To
his credit, he made me look bad,'' said Larsson, ranked 51st.
	   But the second-seeded Kafelnikov double faulted to let Larsson
close to 5-3 and allowed two match points to slip away in the next
game.
	   After the second one, a forehand that sailed long, the nervous
Russian shook his fists at the sky, blaming the error on the sound
of an overhead jet.
	   ``The whole situation was ticklish,'' said Kafelnikov. ``First
came the break, then he broke back and I lost my concentration
again.'
	   Kafelnikov fell behind 0-30 in the next game, with his lead
melted to 5-4. But the Russian then recovered his poise although a
third match point slipped away when his hard volley narrowly missed
the line.
	   Kafelnikov took home dlrs 122,000 for the title, while Larsson
earned 72,400 and will move back into the top 40.
	   Larsson, now healthy again, had reached the final without
dropping a set.
	   ``I hope I can reach the top 10 again,'' he said. ``If I'm
healthy and happy, I know I can.''

Low turnout for local test of reborn Christian Democrats 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TRIESTE, Italy (AP) _ Low turnout was reported Sunday in a
regional election being watched as a first test of strength for a
centrist movement trying to replace the defunct Christian Democrat
party.
	   Polling stations in the northeastern region of Friuli Venezia
Giulia, where nearly 1.1 million people were eligible to vote, were
scheduled to close late Sunday, and first results were expected on
Monday.
	   The election is the latest in a series of staggered local voting
nationwide over the last few weeks.
	   The Christian Democrats, Italy's dominant party after World War
II, were brought down by corruption scandals in the early '90s.
	   Many of its politicians went on to form a half-dozen minor
parties. On Sunday, the small parties were running together for the
first time in a coalition called the Popular Reformer Center.
	   In other recent local voting, the center-right coaltion led by
Silvio Berlusconi, the media tycoon and former premier, defeated
most of the mayoral candidates backed by Premier Romano Prodi's
center-left.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Eric Tabarly, France's best-known yachtsman who
criss-crossed oceans to win numerous solo titles, has died in a
final battle at sea, officials confirmed Sunday. He was 66.
	   Missing since late Friday night after falling off his
century-old sailboat the Pen Duick near the coast of Wales, Tabarly
was declared dead Sunday morning by officials in the Brittany port
of Brest and in a tribute by President Jacques Chirac.
	   Searches by sea and air failed to turn up the famous navigator,
who shot to fame in 1964 when he won England's Transat solo race
across the Atlantic and inspired sailors across France.
	   ``Despite the last searches that seemed in vain, I didn't dare
believe the demise of Eric Tabarly,'' Chirac said. ``It's with
great sadness and much emotion that I give in to the evidence.''
	   Tabarly ``left his mark on several generations of sailors,''
Chirac said.
	   Patrick Tabarly said his brother ``didn't put luck on his side''
by failing to carry a radio transmitter or wear a life jacket. ``It
was his style of life that he liked, and he died in full form.''
	   French naval planes continued the search for Tabarly's body
Sunday, with British helicopters standing ready if there was a
sighting, French naval rescue officials said.

Americans planning donor conference for Palestinians 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The United States is working to organize a
conference to collect billions of dollars in aid for the
cash-strapped Palestinian Authority, a top U.S. official said
Sunday.
	   Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat spoke during a visit to
the West Bank town of Nablus, where he viewed the Palestinian stock
exchange. He is scheduled to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Monday.
	   After the start of the peace process, Washington hosted a 1993
conference to raise funds for the Palestinians. Countries as poor
as India and as rich as Japan pitched in, pledging dlrs 3 billion
over five years.
	   Now Palestinian Authority officials are lobbying for a new
package to fund infrastructure projects. The 1998 Palestinian
budget of dlrs 1.8 billion is 50 percent dependent on foreign aid.
	   ``We are already beginning to think about the next five-year
program,'' Eizenstat, who is on his third visit to the region since
October, told reporters.
	   Eizenstat pointed to the fact that the Palestinian economy has
degenerated rather than improved since the signing of the 1993 Oslo
peace accords.
	   ``The Oslo agreements were supposed to produce hope, but the
economic circumstances are instead delivering despair, and this can
erode the constituency for peace,'' he said.
	   He said he was talking with Israel about ways to help improve
the flow of workers and goods in and out of the Palestinian lands.
	   Palestinians need permission to work within Israel, and Israel
also bars Palestinian vehicles from entering. Export delays for
Palestinian goods often lead to huge economic losses.
	   Eizenstat called Palestinian prosperity ``a win-win situation''
for both Palestinians and Israel.
	   ``Poverty and deprivation are a breeding ground for
instability,'' he said.
	   Eizenstat is scheduled to meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Monday.

Flood alert in southwestern Poland, water recedes in other regions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A flood alert was called Sunday in the
southwestern cities of Opole and Kedzierzyn-Kozle following heavy
rains, but water receded in regions flooded a day earlier.
	   In the Opole area the Oder river rose dangerously close to alarm
level but ``the current level of water is not a threat to anyone,''
Mieczyslaw Matuszewski of the regional flood committee told the
state news agency PAP.
	   In the southern regions of Tarnow and Bielsko-Biala firefighters
were still pumping water from flooded basements and filling holes
in dikes after local streams overflowed on Saturday. Some roads and
farmland remained under water, but the rain stopped and rivers were
back in their beds, PAP said.
	   The regions are still recovering from floods last July that
killed 55 people and caused nearly dlrs 3 billion in damage.

Kia Motors to close plants temporarily 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Bankrupt Kia Motors Corp. on Sunday
ordered its plants locked for 10 days as negotiations with striking
workers failed to make progress.
	   Kia's 20,000-member labor union said, however, that its members
would continue to go to their work places to picket and shout
slogans.
	   ``The closure of the plants is a prelude to layoffs. We will
keep fighting until our fair demands are accepted,'' said Shin
Tae-sup, a labor union spokesman.
	   Kia Motors, once the nation's second largest automaker, is in
court receivership after going bankrupt last July under the weight
of dlrs 1 billion in bank loans.
	   The government, Kia's largest stockholder with a 30 percent
stake, said late last month that it would announce a schedule in
late June to sell the car maker at auction.
	   Kia workers then walked off their jobs, demanding that the
company pay overdue wages and guarantee job security after the
auction. Kia workers have been paid only half of their wages since
last July.
	   Kia management rejected the union's demands, saying that even
companies in good financial condition are cutting wages amid the
worst financial crisis ever.
	   So far, U.S. car maker Ford Motor Co. and three South Korean
conglomerates _ Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung _ have expressed
interest in buying Kia, which produced about 780,000 cars last
year.
	   Ford has a 16.9 percent stake in Kia. The remaining Kia shares
are owned by thousands of small investors, including Kia employees.

</HEADLINE>
Eds: WILL lead after final
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Organizers hoping to see names like Pete Sampras
or Greg Rusedski in the final Sunday of the Queen's Club tournament
got instead unseeded finalists and two of the least-known players
on the ATP Tour.
	   Top-seeded Sampras was upset by Mark Woodforde, No. 2 Rusedski
pulled out with an injury, and No. 3 Patrick Rafter was stopped by
Draper in a Wimbledon warmup drenched all week with rain and
upsets.
	   Draper, a 24-year Australian, had not won consecutive matches
all season, slowed by injuries and inconsistency. With an ATP
ranking of 108, he was playing in only his second ATP final. In his
other, he lost in Adelaide in 1997 to countryman Tood Woodbridge.
	   Tieleman, 25, was even less known, although he defeated No. 7
seed Tim Henman of Britain en route to the final.
	   The Belgian-born Italian was playing in his first-ever ATP
final, never having been further than the quarterfinals in an ATP
Tour event.
	   Entering the the Draper match, all of his main-draw victories on
the ATP Tour had come on grass. He had 12 victories on that surface
but was 0-3 on clay and 0-5 on hardcourts.
	   He entered the tournament ranked No. 253 but would move up to
120 with a victory and 130 with a loss.

Albanians report new police attacks in Kosovo Albanian killed, restores dropped time element. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Updates with grenades launched in Drenica region, ethnic
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian forces launched about 500
grenades into villages in western Kosovo Sunday in what appears to
be another crackdown on armed ethnic Albanian secessionists,
Albanian sources said.
	   Serb police brought a reinforcement of about 40 armored vehicles
and 15 tanks into the Decani area near the border with Albania,
according to the Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian
leaders. The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The Decani region has seen some of the worst fighting in past
weeks causing thousands of its mostly Albanian population to flee
across the border into Albania. Police have blocked all the roads
in the region, where the armed ethnic Albanian militants of the
Kosovo Liberation Army control most of the villages.
	   The attacks appeared as another government effort to crackdown
on the KLA, who are fighting to secede from Serbia and now control
some 40 percent of the province where ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9 to 1.
	   The Kosovo Information Center also reported Serb forces launched
grenades against the village of Lausa northwest of Pristina in the
Drenica region, where the crackdowns began earlier this year.
	   In a separate incident, a source close to Serb police in the
province said the militants opened fire on a police patrol Saturday
in southwestern Kosovo, killing one policemen and injuring another.
	   Also Saturday, a Yugoslav army soldier killed an ethnic
Albanian, Mefail Fejzulahu, while he was picking mushrooms near a
military base, southeast of Pristina in a region where so far there
has been no fighting. Fejzulahu reportedly came to close to the
base, the Kosovo Information Center said.

<TEXT>
	   SAPPORO, Japan (AP) _ Toru Suzuki birdied the last two holes
Sunday for his third straight 3-under-par 69 and won the Sapporo
Tokyu Open by two strokes.
	   Suzuki claimed his first victory in two years and his fourth
overall with a 16-under 272 total.
	   American David Ishii, winless since his 14th victory on the
Japan tour in 1994, fired a 68 for 274.
	   Suzuki earned 18 million yen (dlrs 126,000) from a purse of 100
million yen (dlrs 704,000).
	   Ishii, winner of the 1990 Hawaiian Open, had only one bogey in
the four-day tournament. On Friday, he reached the green in two
shots and two-putted on the 210-yard (191-meter) par-3 17th hole.
	   Ishii's previous best finish this season had been a 21st place.
	   Carlos Franco of Paraguay, leader in the first two rounds, shot
a 70 for 275.
	   Franco, with two victories so far this season, leads the
earnings list with 61.99 million yen (dlrs 436,500).

Jetliners land at new airport in final test runs 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Boeing 777-300 of Cathay Pacific Airways and
two other jetliners landed at Hong Kong's new airport Sunday in the
final trials before it opens July 6.
	   Cathay Pacific said the 777-300 was used in the test landing at
the U.S. dlrs 20.1 billion airport on outlying Chek Lap Kok island
because it is the world's longest commercial aircraft.
	   Two Hong Kong-based Dragonair Airbus A-320's also touched down
at the airport in the last of a series of operational trials
conducted by Hong Kong's Airport Authority.
	   The planes carried no passengers.
	   About 15,000 people, many of them playing the role of
passengers, also tested the check-in systems. Many of them were
taken to the airport aboard the new airport train.
	   The construction of Chek Lap Kok airport required the flattening
of an islet and the pushing back of the sea to accommodate two
runways. A 1.38-kilometer (4,475-foot)-long suspension bridge and a
railway link the airport to the city.
	   The new airport, built to operate round the clock, will be able
to handle 35 million passengers a year. Eventually, capacity will
rise to 87 million passengers a year.
	   Hong Kong's present Kaitak airport, on the urban Kowloon
Peninsula, handles 30 million passengers a year.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other officials will attend
the opening ceremony for the airport, the government said.
	   Hong Kong Radio quoted Clinton Leeks, an official of the airport
authority, as saying it was not yet known if U.S President Bill
Clinton would fly into the airport on July 2 when he visits Hong
Kong after a tour of China.

Taiwanese aborigines search for cultural links 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Elders of Taiwan's indigenous Saisiyat
tribe left Sunday for the Philippines to search for cultural links
with a tribe of pygmies on Luzon Island.
	   Elders told a pre-departure news conference they believe the
Aeta, who are considered the Philippines' earliest residents, may
be the legendary ``short people'' who taught their ancestors to
farm, sing and dance.
	   Saisiyat traditional music retains elements borrowed from the
legendary tribe that can be compared with the Aeta tradition, they
said.
	   They plan to visit a group of Aeta living in a rain forest in
Zambales province, north of Manila near Subic Bay.
	   According to Saisiyat legend, friendship between the groups was
strained by pygmy harassment of Saisiyat women. Enraged Saisiyat
men then threw their former benefactors into a gorge after luring
them to a feast, the legend says.
	   Every two years, the Saisiyat hold an elaborate ceremony meant
to appease the souls of the murdered pygmies.
	   The Saisiyat, who number just a few thousand, are among nine
major indigenous groups that scholars believe migrated to Taiwan
from Southeast Asia and southern China 12,000-15,000 years ago.
	   No evidence has been found to confirm the tribal legend, but
archaeologists have produced evidence of a Taiwanese culture that
predates that of the existing tribes.

World Cup: Maldini irritated by Baggio-Del Piero debate 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Coach Cesare Maldini, annoyed with the
mounting nationwide attention given to the Baggio-Del Piero saga,
on Sunday criticized Premier Romano Prodi and called for more
concentration on Italy's next World Cup match against Cameroon.
	   ``I mean no offense, but as far as I know our premier is an
expert on bikes,'' Maldini said at Italy's training camp.
	   Prodi is known as a bike enthusiast. But like most Italians,
he's been fascinated by the possibility that the two imaginative
strikers could start together in Wednesday's second match of Group
B at Montpellier.
	   Italian sports analysts have suggested that World Cup veteran
Roberto Baggio, taken to France as a substitute for Alessandro Del
Piero, should be kept on the starting team now that the younger
star has recovered from a thigh strain and is ready to take his
place back.
	   Baggio was a key to Italy's 2-2 draw against Chile last
Thursday, in the absence of Del Piero. The 31-year-old veteran
forward, who recently signed with Inter Milan and will team with
Brazilian star Ronaldo next season, earned and converted a late
penalty at Bordeaux.
	   Others favor a possible rotation of the two forwards during the
next match, in a replay of the shared role between Sandro Mazzola
and Gianni Rivera at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico which touched off
controversy and divided the country.
	   ``I can understand that the fantasy of Italians is focused on
Del Piero and Baggio, who are two great players. But we must not
forget the other 20 players of the roster, who are also important
for going on in the competition,'' Maldini said.
	   ``We must focus on Cameroon, which is very strong athletically
and fields several players with experience in European Leagues and
Japan,'' Maldini said.
	   The African team held Austria to a 1-1 draw in its first World
Cup match.
	   ``Cameroon's new coach (Claude Le Roy) has greatly improved the
tactical quality. It's a dangerous team, and we must win to qualify
for the next round,'' the coach added.
	   In brief training games at Senlis Maldini has been testing Del
Piero and Baggio in an attacking trident including Christian Vieri
in a more offensive version of the traditional 4-4-2 tactic.
	   However the coach quickly explained it was part of experiments
intended to have quick alternatives if they may be needed during
the next matches.
	   After Cameroon, Italy takes on Austria at Saint-Denis, outside
Paris.
	   ``We are working, making tests. By Wednesday everything will be
clear in my mind. It already is, actually,'' Maldini said without
elaborating.
	   Del Piero, 23, who was injured in the May 20 Champions Cup final
between Juventus and Real Madrid and has not been playing a match
since then, said he was ready to play Cameroon _ and to accept
Maldini's decisions.
	   ``Certainly I can play along with Roberto in a more offensive
team ... It's up to Maldini to take the decision,'' del Piero said.
``I don't think he can tell me to play 45 minutes and Roberto to
play the other 45 ... sincerely, I don't know if I can play the
full 90 minutes.''

Guinea-Bissau rebels deny they're beaten as fighting intensifies 
</HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fierce fighting between rebel soldiers
and government troops in Guninea-Bissau continued Sunday as the
insurgents denied government reports they had been crushed,
according to reports.
	   Fighting between the rebels and government forces of the coastal
west African country has centered on the garrison in the suburb of
Bra.
	   The military complex, covering several hectares (acres) and
surrounded by high walls, occupies a strategic defensive position.
	   The two sides pounded each other's positions Sunday with
rockets, mortars and artillery, according to the Portuguese news
agency Lusa.
	   A rebel spokesman described as ``pure propaganda'' the
government's claim, made on state radio Saturday, that the
renegades had been dislodged from the garrison, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes reportedly was speaking on a private radio
station seized by the rebels after they launched a coup attempt
last week.
	   He said the mutineers were ready to allow emergency food aid to
be flown into Bissau's nearby international airport, which they
also control, the report said.
	   A defense ministry spokesman for Portugal, Guinea-Bissau's
former colonial ruler, told The Associated Press that embassy staff
in Bissau were holed up in the building due to the fighting
outside.
	   The situation was ``still very serious'' he said, on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The Portuguese ambassador in Bissau said on Portuguese state
television RTP that the French and Russian embassies had taken
direct hits.
	   Francisco Henriques said the Russian compound, where eight staff
were working, was the hardest hit. Its generator and water supply
were knocked out, he said.
	   There was no information on the number of casualties in the
fighting. International phone lines to the former Portuguese colony
were not working.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who gained renown as a guerilla fighter in the war against
Portuguese rule from 1961 to 1974.
	   Mane was fired in January amid allegations of smuggling arms to
separatists in Senegal and formally stepped down a week ago.

World Cup: Containing Chilean offense not enough, Austria's coach says 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARGAUX, France (AP) _ Austria faces a tough choice as it plans
strategy against Chile, its next World Cup soccer opponent. Should
it concentrate on containing the the South Americans' dynamic
offense, or on getting some goals of its own?
	   Both, says Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska.
	   Striker Marcelo Salas accounted for both goals Thursday in
Chile's surprising draw against group favorite Italy. He and fellow
attacker Ivan Zamorano pose real dangers to Austria with their
speed and ability to control the ball in the air.
	   But Prohaska said Sunday that checking Salas and Zamorano is
only half the task facing his squad.
	   ``It's not enough to contain them,'' he said. ``Even if we do
that we still haven't gotten any goals.''
	   Austria, which notched an uninspiring 1-1 draw against Cameroon
in its first match on Thursday, is clearly the underdog against the
South Americans on Wednesday.
	   Part of the Austrians' hopes rest on striker Anton Polster, who
plays for Cologne in the first German league, and who scored
against Cameroon.
	   But he, and many other likely starters against Chile, are slowed
by age. Polster, for instance, is 34, compared to Salas, 23.
	   Prohaska acknowledged that running is not his squad's main
strength, but said that did not mean the Austrians were not capable
of fast soccer.
	   ``You don't have to run quickly to play quickly,'' he said.
``Slow players can also play a fast game, they just have to play
the ball quickly.''
	   Defender Peter Schoettel, who will likely mark one or the other
Chilean attackers, described both as ``world-class players.''
	   ``Their strength lies not only in the air, with headers,'' he
said. ``They're generally strong and fast.''
	   Practice on Sunday saw Schoettel, Prohaska and other likely
starters play against a backup team for more than an hour. The
final score was 5-3 for Prohaska and company.
	   Not practicing was defender Wolfgang Feiersinger, who came away
from the Cameroon match with a bruised calf. But team members said
he should be fit against Chile.
	   Reserve goal keeper Wolfgang Knaller also was not dressed
because of a cold.

World Cup: briefs with Del Piero, Maldini remarks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero, whose co-existence
with Roberto Baggio on Italy's World Cup team has become a
nationwide issue, said Sunday he was similar to his former Juventus
teammate ``in the shoe size and height.''
	   About the differences, the 23-year-old striker said ``he's
married, I'm not.''
	   He also denied any personal rivalry with Baggio and criticized
some media for alleging he did not celebrate Baggio's equalizer
against Chile.
	   ``I was very pleased, as everyone and I congratulated Roberto
for scoring the penalty in a very difficult situation.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, Italy (AP) _ Coach Cesare Maldini said he was not
worried by reports that Cameroon's witch-doctors are trying to cast
a bad evil on Italy in view of Wednesday's Group-B match in
Montpellier.
	   ``It's a subject I don't know, thus I'm not worried,'' said
Maldini, who admitted of being superstitious.
	   When one of his players kicks a penalty Maldini uses to turn his
back to the field. He did it last Thursday, when Roberto Baggio
converted a penalty for Italy's 2-2 late equalizer against Chile.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Nigeria's 3-2 upset victory against Spain
was no surprise to Italian coach Cesare Maldini.
	   ``Nigeria is a very strong team. I knew it from the Olympics. It
can be a floating mine in this World Cup, and sink other big
teams,'' he said.
	   About Spain Maldini said ``it started well and was penalized by
its goalie (on Nigeria's second goal).

Ramos acknowledges poverty, other ills still trouble Philippines 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Outgoing President Fidel Ramos
acknowledged Sunday that massive poverty, social injustice, crime
and other social ills that he tried to combat still trouble the
Philippines.
	   Although economic reforms during Ramos' administration helped
the Philippines recover from more than a decade of stagnation, more
than 30 percent of the 70 million Filipinos remain below the
poverty line.
	   Crime also remained a major concern under Ramos.
	   Addressing war veterans, Ramos said Filipinos should use their
hard-won freedom from foreign colonialists as an inspiration in
battling the nation's current problems.
	   ``This fight continues,'' Ramos said. ``There are still mass
poverty, social injustice, environmental abuse, crime and political
violence to be defeated on our shores.''
	   The occasion was the anniversary of a major battle in the
northern Philippines, in which hundreds of Filipino guerrillas
defeated Japanese Imperial Army troops on June 14, 1945.
	   In last Friday's celebration of the Philippine centennial of
independence from Spanish colonial rule, he made a similar call on
Filipinos to help extricate the country from economic difficulties
triggered by Asia's financial crisis.
	   The Philippines was a Spanish possession from 1565 to 1898 but
subsequently came under brutal U.S. and Japanese rule.
	   Ramos' single six-year term ends June 30. He will be succeeded
by Joseph Estrada, a former movie actor despised by many
businessmen due to his poor knowledge of the economy.

European summit helps Welsh capital shed ugly duckling image With EU-Summit

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ These are stirring times for the capital
of Wales.
	   After decades of decline, Cardiff hosts a European Union summit
Monday and Tuesday and will show off its metamorphosis from dowdy
provincial town to revitalized capital on the verge of limited home
rule after centuries of rule from England.
	   The EU shindig brings together presidents and prime ministers
from the 15 EU nations. Queen Elizabeth II and South African
President Nelson Mandela will also show up, along with over 1,000
ministers, aides and advisors and up to 3,000 journalists.
	   ``The summit will be Wales' biggest political event in living
memory,'' wrote Neil Jones, business editor of the Welsh daily, The
Western Mail.
	   He added the summit will ``dispel the outmoded image which still
lingers in in parts of Europe that (Wales) is a land blighted by
slag heaps and bad housing and inhabited by women in black pointy
hats.''
	   Cardiff has lived in the shadow not only of London, but also of
Edinburgh. While tourists flock to the elegant Scottish capital
they tended to ignore drab Cardiff en route to the beauty of the
Pembrokeshire coast or the rugged Welsh highlands.
	   Cardiffians hope the summit will help their city of 300,000 shed
its ugly duckling tag by showcasing recently-renovated Victorian
docklands, turn-of-the-century civic buildings and the eccentric
architecture of Cardiff Castle.
	   ``The summit ... will put Cardiff firmly on the European map,''
says Russell Goodway, leader of Cardiff County Council.
	   Cardiff's heyday came 100 years ago. Coal from Welsh valleys was
shipped from its harbor to power the steam engines of the world. By
the 1980s, the once-mighty mining industry was burnt out and
Cardiff an industrial wasteland.
	   Since then, an aggressive drive to attract foreign business has
put Wales and its capital back on their feet.
	   With just 5 percent of the British population, Wales has
attracted more than 20 percent of inward investment over the past
10 years - much of it from the United States, Japan and South
Korea. British Prime Minister Tony Blair was able to invite his
fellow EU leaders to ``Europe's fastest growing capital.''
	   The European summit _ Cyngor Ewropeaidd, in the Welsh language
spoken by 20 percent of the 2.7 million Welsh _ will held in the
neo-classical City Hall. Its white-stone facade and marble statues
of local heroes are agleam after a 2-million pound (dlrs 3.18
million) facelift.
	   Helmut Kohl, Jacques Chirac and the others will lunch in the
Welsh national museum surrounded by both French Impressionist
paintings and an exhibition highlighting Wales as a magnet for
hi-tech investment.
	   Cardiff welcomes the leaders with street parties, festivals of
Celtic culture, fireworks and concerts ranging from local rock
favorites the Stereophonics to al fresco opera.
	   The city's renowned brewers are serving a special ``summit ale''
while lesser-known Welsh vintners refresh summiteers with wines
from the Vale of Glamorgan.
	   But not everybody is toasting the euro-party.
	   Before the summit began, a motley collection of demonstrators
paraded through town to support causes ranging from ending the U.S.
embargo on Cuba, to getting Britain out of the EU.
	   Cardiff's days in the limelight won't end after the summit.
	   Next year the city hosts the World Rugby Championship in a
71,000-seat stadium currently under construction. And next May, the
opening of the Welsh National Assembly will restore a degree of
self rule to the ancient principality conquered by the English 700
years ago.

Albanians report new police attacks in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian forces launched about 500
grenades into villages in western Kosovo on Sunday in what appeared
to be another crackdown on armed ethnic Albanians in the separatist
province, Albanian sources said.
	   Serb police brought a reinforcement of about 40 armored vehicles
and 15 tanks into the Decani area near the Albanian border,
according to the Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the
ethnic Albanian leaders. The report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   The Decani region has seen some of the worst fighting in recent
weeks, causing thousands of its mostly ethnic Albanian population
to flee across the border into Albania. Police have blocked all the
roads in the region, where the armed ethnic Albanian militants of
the Kosovo Liberation Army control most of the villages.
	   The attacks appeared to be another government effort to
crackdown on the KLA, which is fighting to secede from Serbia and
now claim control of about 40 percent of the province where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   The Kosovo Information Center also reported Serb forces launched
grenades against the village of Lausa northwest of Pristina in the
Drenica region, where the crackdowns began earlier this year.
	   In a separate incident, a source close to Serb police in the
province said the militants opened fire on a police patrol Saturday
in southwestern Kosovo, killing one policemen and injuring another.
	   Also Saturday, a Yugoslav army soldier killed an ethnic
Albanian, Mefail Fejzulahu, while he was picking mushrooms near a
military base, southeast of Pristina in a region where there had
been no fighting. Fejzulahu reportedly came too close to the base,
the Kosovo Information Center said.
	   More than 300 people have died on both sides since the crisis in
Kosovo escalated earlier this year, prompting the West to warn
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic he must change his hard-line
policy in the region or face the threat of force.
	   The Yugoslav federation comprises Serbia and Montenegro.
	   NATO warplanes were convening at an airbase in northern Italy on
Sunday in preparation for simulated air attacks in Albania and
Macedonia planned for Monday. The drills were meant to persuade
Milosevic to halt his crackdown.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in Poland on Sunday
that the alliance does not exclude the use of its air power to help
bring stability to the region.
	   ``No option at this stage is excluded,'' Solana told
journalists.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 in an attempt
to suppress the Albanian independence movement. But since Serbs
launched a bloody crackdown in the region earlier this year, the
KLA has grown stronger and more popular among the ethnic Albanians.

Fighters beat Hawks 7-1 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yukio Tanaka hit a tie-breaking home run in the
three-run sixth inning against starter Brian Williams as the
Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham Fighters beat the Fukuoka
Daiei Hawks 7-1 at Fukuoka Dome Sunday.
	   Hiroshi Numata (3-0) limited the Hawks to one hit over eight
innings and reliever Erik Shullstrom, formerly with Minnesota
Twins, gave up one hit in the ninth.
	   Tanaka has 14 homers and leads the league.
	   Williams, who gave up four hits, eight walks and five runs over
6 1/3 innings, took the loss. He is 1-3.
	   The victory widened the Fighters' lead over the second-place
Fighters to 2 1/2 games.
	   At Osaka Dome, Tuffy Rhodes drove in a run with a grounder in
the fifth inning and singled home two runs in the seventh as the
Kintetsu Buffaloes blanked the Seibu Lions 5-0.
	   The Buffaloes extended their winning streak to three, and the
Lions suffered their third straight defeat.
	   The Buffaloes' Hiroshi Takamura pitched a two-hit shutout for
his third victory against four defeats.
	   Rhodes formerly played for the Boston Red Sox.
	   A scheduled game between the Chiba Lotte Marines and the Orix
BlueWave at Chiba was rained out.
	   In the Central League, Kouta Soejima hit a tie-breaking
three-run home run in the four-run eighth inning as the Yakult
Swallows beat the front-running Yomiuri Giants 6-2 at Tokyo Dome.
	   Soejima has six homers.
	   Two other scheduled games were rained out.

Iran newspaper publisher released on bail 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The publisher of a liberal Iranian newspaper
charged with unethical reporting was released on bail Sunday, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   But soon after Mohammad Mahdavi Khorrami, publisher of the
Gozaresh-e-Ruz daily was released, its chief editor, Mohammed
Aqazadeh, was summoned to court, the agency said. It did not say
why.
	   Khorrami was arrested Wednesday after ignoring a court summons.
	   IRNA said Mahdavi Khorrami was once convicted of slander when he
managed the weekly, Gozaresh-e-Hafteh or ``Weekly Report.'' He was
given a six-month suspended sentence and banned from publishing for
one year. It did not say when he published the weekly.
	   Gozaresh-e-Ruz, or ``Day's Report,'' stopped publication last
week after the government Press Supervisory Board charged it with
violating press ethics. The Justice Ministry is reviewing the
complaint against Gozaresh-e-Ruz, and the case will go to court
when the investigation is completed, judiciary spokesman Saeed
Nobari said.
	   The action against the publisher of Gozaresh-e-Ruz is seen as a
setback for the press freedom that has been allowed by moderate
President Mohammad Khatami since he took office in August.
	   The reforms introduced by Khatami are said to enjoy the support
of most Iranians. But conservative elements in the government,
particularly in the judiciary, are opposed to his policies and have
been intensifying their offensive against liberal papers.
	   The Farsi-language newspaper started publishing only last month
and on its third day printed a front-page color picture of a
teenage boy with a teenage girl wearing a head scarf. The caption
read: ``Friendship Under Fear.''
	   Iran's strict Islamic code prohibits dating.
	   The Culture Ministry warned the newspaper to ``respect the press
Law and the society's ethical and religious standards,'' the
English-language Iran News said.
	   Iran's Constitution forbids the media from ``propagating
destructive and anti-Islamic attitudes.''
	   One of Iran's most popular newspapers, Jameah or ``Society,''
had its license revoked Wednesday and its editor was convicted of
defamation. The paper is continuing publication and has said it
will appeal the sentence.

Eds: Contains items on Bahrain, Lebanon and Jordan
<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Fledgling airline Qatar Airways has
applied to operate two daily flights to neighboring Bahrain, the
local Travel &AMP; Tourism News reported Sunday.
	   The airline's application followed the Qatari government's
recent recognition of Qatar Airways as the country's flag carrier,
the newsletter said.
	   Until now, Bahrain-based Gulf Air was considered the national
carrier of its owner states, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and United Arab
Emirates.
	   If Bahrain approves Qatar Airways flights, it would be a sign of
easing of relations between the two countries. The two tiny Gulf
states have for years nursed a territorial dispute that erupted
into a military clash in the mid-1980s.
	   The newsletter said Bahrain's government is considering Qatar
Airway's application and is likely to approve it.
	   ``Qatar could make things very difficult for Gulf Air if their
application is rejected,'' TTN said, and noted that Qatar Airways'
application rekindled speculation that Dubai's Emirates Airline may
also wants to fly to Bahrain.
	   Qatar Airways is the latest airline in the region, launched four
years ago in January 1994.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's economy improved in the first
quarter of 1998 and the budget deficit dropped but debt continued
to rise, a leading bank says.
	   In its quarterly report, Fransabank said the budget deficit to
spending ratio dropped to around 31.4 percent, compared to the
forecast level of 42 percent and the actual 55.3 percent for the
first quarter of 1997 as a result of spending cuts and increased
revenues.
	   But the bank said the net public debt grew by 4 percent in the
first quarter of this year to reach dlrs 15 billion.
	   However, the growth of Lebanon's net public debt was slower than
last year's.
	   The growth of the debt on year-to-year basis ending March 1998
was nearly 32.6 percent, compared with 38.8 percent for 1997, the
report said.
	   ``Rising level of debt raise the specter of a `debt trap,'
whereby amounts of new debt are contracted to service existing
debt,'' said the Fransabank report.
	   Most of Lebanon's debt is owed locally, with dlrs 2.5 billion
borrowed abroad.
	   The government has recently launched dlrs 1 billion in foreign
bonds and plans another similar issue to replace some of the local
debt with foreign debt, which comes at lower interest rates and
long-term maturity offers.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) - Fruit and vegetable exports increased by 4
percent to 82.8 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 116.6 million) last
year over 1997, the state-owned Agricultural Marketing Organization
said in a report released Sunday.
	   The report attributed the increase to unspecified new Gulf Arab
markets for Jordanian agricultural produce.
	   It said the United Arab Emirates followed by Kuwait topped a
list of eight Arab countries importing Jordanian produce, which
included potatoes, tomatoes, onions, cabbage, celery, oranges,
lemon, bananas and apples.
	   Unnamed non-Arab markets in eastern Europe accounted for 1.3
percent of the total exports last year, the report added.
 &UR; ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ More people are flying with Jordan's flag
carrier because of the moderate fares it offers to various
destinations and its improved punctuality in flight times.
	   A Royal Jordanian report obtained Sunday said around 500,000
passengers flew aboard the airline, filling up 60.2 percent of the
seats _ 3.5 percent more than the same period in 1997.
	   The report said the increase was due to discount rates offered
to Asian, European and American destinations and ``increased
alertness to the punctuality of flight times.''
 &UR; ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Lebanese Embassy here plans to launch a
commercial center to promote exports to Jordan and enhance economic
relations between the two countries, an embassy official said
Sunday.
	   Embassy spokeswoman Claude Hajal told The Associated Press the
center will exhibit samples of Lebanese foodstuffs, cosmetics,
catalogs and company brochures.
	   ``The center is a promotion for products and services offered by
Lebanese firms,'' she said, adding the center will begin operations
on July 1.

EDS: LEADS with tournament abandoned; adds quotes; corrects to 43
<TEXT>
	   SLALEY, England (AP) _ Overnight rain forced organizers Sunday
to abandon the water-logged European Grand Prix, leaving players
with no paycheck and sponsors without an event.
	   ``Because we didn't complete 36 holes we do not have a result,''
said tournament director Mike Stewart. ``The tournament is now
completely null and void for the year.''
	   ``The event organizers will look at insurances and see if any
payment can be made the players,'' he said after calling off the
650,000-pound (dlrs 1.06 million) event.
	   Stewart quickly quashed speculation the event might be played
later in the year.
	   ``It is not an option because it would be very difficult for the
various different groups involved,'' he said.
	   ``While it might be relatively easy for ourselves and the
players, it would not be easy for television, the hotel, sponsors
and the course.''
	   Just 43 players managed to wade through 36 holes with Englishmen
Barry Lane and Andrew Sherborne sharing the lead when play was
washed out Saturday. One-hundred-six other players failed to finish
36 holes.
	   Rain has been almost constant at the northeast England course
since Thursday when all play was washed out.
	   On Friday, only half of the field managed to play 18 holes on a
Slaley Hall course shortened from par-72 to par-69 because of
drenched tees and fairways.
	   Saturday was no better.
	   Fighting off all-day showers, the remainder of the field sloshed
through their 18 holes _ and 43 others got in a second 18 before a
deluge ended the day.
	   Sherborne and Lane each shot 2-under 67s in the first round and
had matching 68s in the second for 3-under 135. Jamie Spence and
Gary Evans, also Englishmen, were tied at 136.
	   England's Mark Davis, who shot a first-round 64 to lead the
field, had a 4-over 73 in the second to fall two strokes off the
pace.

New formula for interest rates being studied, prime minister says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
who favors lower interest rates to help spur economic recovery,
says the government is studying a new formula for rates, the
national news agency reported Sunday.
	   Mahathir said he could not go into details as the issue was
sensitive. He was speaking to reporters after chairing a supreme
council meeting of the National Front, which governs Malaysia, the
Bernama news agency said.
	   Traders have been complaining about the high interest rates
charged by banks and financial institutions, but the central bank _
Bank Negara _ has said this was needed to prevent an outflow of
money that could undercut the ringgit.
	   Referring to his recent interview with Time magazine, Mahathir
said, ``Freedom of the press means they can say anything they like
but we cannot say anything we like. The interview lasted an hour,
but only a small extract of what I said was printed and most of it
sounded very negative.
	   ``When you try to compress an answer into a sentence, you may be
sending the wrong message. But I have no right to demand to have my
full answer printed in the magazine because that is the freedom of
the press,'' he added.
	   ``Freedom means you can suppress news which you don't want,
especially news about people so unpopular like myself,'' he said.

NATO prepares for show of force in Balkans 
</HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO warplanes from across Europe
converged on an airbase in northern Italy on Sunday to prepare for
a show of power that allied leaders hope will convince Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to cease his crackdown on the
separatist province of Kosovo.
	   About 40 aircraft operating from Aviano air base north of Venice
and from an American amphibious task force in the Adriatic Sea are
scheduled to conduct exercises over Albania and Macedonia from
early Monday morning until midday, U.S. Navy officials said.
	   The NATO action, code-named Determined Falcon, comes as the
death toll in the Serbian province of Kosovo continues to rise.
	   More than 300 people have died as the Serb-led government of the
Yugoslav federation tries to suppress the increasingly radical
independence movement among Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who make up
90 percent of the province's population.
	   The Western allies oppose independence for the province, but
they also want to stop Milosevic's brutal attempts to suppress
dissent.
	   The great fear is that if the two sides aren't brought to the
negotiating table, the Kosovo fighting will spill over Yugoslavia's
borders and ignite a wider Balkan war.
	   Albanian Defense Minister Luan Hajdaraga said in an interview
last week he is convinced Milosevic wants ``to dominate the
situation by military means.'' The danger is, he said, that ``those
means can spread to Albania.''
	   Hajdaraga said 15,000 refugees have already flooded from Kosovo
into northern Albania, putting enormous strains on his government.
	   NATO also has ordered its military planners to study a range of
options for even tougher action, including direct military
intervention in Yugoslavia with air strikes and use of ground
forces. NATO insists, however, that it is only studying its options
to be ready for any political decisions.
	   Countries sending aircraft for the exercises include the United
States, France, Britain, Spain, Turkey, Denmark, the Netherlands
and Belgium.
	   A senior military official traveling in Europe with U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said a three-ship Marine amphibious force
was en route to the Adriatic to participate in the exercise.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the alliance continues
to support a political solution to the Kosovo problem, one that
both gives an ``enhanced status'' to Kosovo, but also ``preserves
the territorial integrity'' of Yugoslavia.
	   ``NATO also remains determined to contribute to efforts
promoting stability and security in neighboring countries, with
particular emphasis on Albania and the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia,'' he said.

Guinea-Bissau rebels deny claims they're beaten, fighting intensifies fleeing fighting 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES, RECASTS with reports of 200 refugees drowned while
By BARRY HATTON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fierce fighting between rebel soldiers
and government troops in Guinea-Bissau continued Sunday as the
insurgents denied government claims that they had been crushed,
according to reports.
	   The two sides were pounding each other's positions in the
capital Bissau with rockets, mortars and artillery, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported.
	   With the fighting intensifying, thousands of people were
desperately seeking an escape route, and the first reports emerged
Sunday that 200 people had drowned as they fled Bissau by boat two
days before.
	   The refugees were on their way to the Bissagos archipelago, 48
kilometers (30 miles) off the coast of this west African country,
Lusa said.
	   There was no reliable information on the number of casualties in
the fighting. International phone lines to the former Portuguese
colony were not working.
	   Fighting between the rebels and government forces, backed by
reinforcements from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea,
has centered on a garrison in the suburb of Bra where the mutineers
have been holed up since launching their coup attempt a week ago.
	   The military complex, covering several hectares (acres) and
surrounded by high walls, occupies a strategic defensive position
in Bissau.
	   A rebel spokesman described as ``pure propaganda'' the
government's claim, made on state radio Saturday, that the
renegades had been dislodged from their stronghold, Lusa reported.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes reportedly was speaking on a private radio
station seized by the rebels after they mutinied.
	   He said the mutineers were ready to allow emergency food aid to
be flown into the capital's international airport, located near the
garrison, which they also control, the report said.
	   A Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that embassy
staff in Bissau were holed up in the building due to the fighting
outside.
	   The situation was ``still very serious'' he said.
	   The Portuguese ambassador in Bissau said on Portuguese state
television RTP that the French and Russian embassies had taken
direct hits.
	   Francisco Henriques said the Russian compound, where eight staff
were working, was the hardest hit. Its generator and water supply
were knocked out, he said.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who gained renown as a guerilla fighter in the war against
Portuguese rule from 1961 to 1974. He was fired in January amid
allegations of smuggling arms to separatists in Senegal and
formally stepped down a week ago.
	   Mane has accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption
and called on him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.
	   President of Gambia Yahya Jammeh offered to mediate in the
conflict, Lusa reported Sunday.
	   Mane is originally from Gambia, and the rebels had previously
suggested talks on Gambian soil.

World Cup: Batistuta strikes as Argentina leads 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta punished a Japanese
error to give Argentina a 1-0 half time league against the World
Cup debutant Sunday.
	   The Fiorentina striker ran clear to chip the ball past
Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi in the 28th minute after Japanese midfielder
Hiroshi Nanami had lost possession in his own area.
	   It was a cruel goal for the World Cup first-timers to concede
after a promising opening in which they created the better chances.
	   Japan's first ever shot in the World Cup finals came after only
two minutes but Motohiro Yamaguchi's 30-meter (yard) drive was
several meters wide.
	   In the 13th minute the debutants got closer when Hiroshi Nanami
floated the ball forward into the Argentina area and Naoki Soma got
clear of Javier Zanetti. Soma climbed well to meet the pass but
headed too high with only goalkeeper Carlos Roa to beat.
	   Batistuta had a free kick blocked and Juan Veron's follow up
shot flew just over and then the period of Argentina pressure
brought success in the 28th minute.
	   A through ball should have been cleared by Nanami just inside
the Japanese area but he lost possession and played the ball into
Batistuta's path. The striker known as ``Batigol'' had the simple
task of prodding the ball past the advancing 'keeper into the net.
	   It was almost 2-0 in the 37th minute when Batistuta flicked a
long-range header against the post, Lopez dived to head the rebound
goalwards from eight meters but 'keeper Kawaguchi recovered to
save.
	   Argentina _ Carlos Roa; Roberto Ayala, Roberto Sensini, Javier
Zanetti, Nelson Vivas; Matias Almeyda, Diego Simeone, Juan Veron,
Ariel Ortega; Claudio Lopez, Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Japan _ Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi; Akira Narahashi, Masami Ihara,
Eisuke Nakanishi, Yutaka Akita, Naoki Soma; Hiroshi Nanami,
Hidetoshi Nakata, Motohiro Yamaguchi; Shoji Jo, Masashi Nakayama.
	   Referee _ Mario Van Der Ende, Holland.

Maradona cancels trip to France as television commentator 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, (AP) _ Argentine soccer star Diego
Armando Maradona announced Sunday that he will not fly to France,
at least for the time being, because he was ``depressed'' by his
court sentence for a 1994 shooting incident.
	   Maradona was scheduled to be a television commentator for the
local news multimediae America, covering the Argentine soccer
selection's performance in the France98 World Soccer Cup.
	   ``I feel very depressed and not inclined to take a decision on
covering the World Cup as a TV commentator, at least for the time
being'', Maradona told the local radio station La Red.
	   But he did not elaborate on whether he could fly to France
later.
	   Last Friday, Maradona received a 34-month suspended sentence for
a 1994 shooting incident involving four journalists. He was
convicted of assault with an air rifle.
	   Judge Dante Pietrafesa authorized Maradona to leave the country
so he could comply with his journalistic assignment.

Suharto denies amassing fortune, says legal adviser 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS, ADDS background on Habibie position
By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ With the new president, his old friend
B.J. Habibie, unwilling to shield him from corruption allegations,
former Indonesian leader Suharto has reportedly denied amassing
billions of dollars during his 32 years in power.
	   The newspaper Republika on Sunday quoted Suharto's newly
appointed legal adviser, Johanes Jacob, as saying the 77-year-old
former autocrat would welcome any lawful investigation into his
affairs.
	   Suharto resigned last month after riots and other protests
erupted amid the Southeast Asian country's worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   Critics have said the Suharto family raked in wealth from huge
business empires it built by abusing its influence. Many want
Suharto himself tried on corruption charges and some have urged the
government to seize his assets, which some estimate at between dlrs
20 billion and dlrs 40 billion.
	   However, Suharto's legal adviser said he has provided documents
to the government that show there was no wrongdoing by the former
leader or his family.
	   The papers were sent to Indonesia's attorney general, who is
carrying out a broad inquiry into the allegations of corruption
during Suharto's rule.
	   Jacob said of Suharto: ``He said, `I have nothing. So don't
worry.'''
	   Habibie, a friend of Suharto for 49 years who served as a
Cabinet minister and vice president, ordered the investigation soon
after he replaced Suharto as head of state three weeks ago.
	   He has repeatedly warned Indonesians not to seek unlawful
retribution against the former leader.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press on the weekend,
Habibie made it clear that he would not intercede on Suharto's
behalf if a lawful inquiry found any wrongdoing.
	   ``He may defend himself. But I am not his lawyer, I am the
lawyer of the people ... for the poorest and the weakest,'' Habibie
said.
	   He stressed that investigations should be carried out within the
legal process and with respect for human rights enjoyed by all
Indonesian citizens.
	   Habibie said his relations with Suharto remain ``very good'' and
he hoped to carry on the friendship after he retires.
	   ``But his problem that he is facing with his family is his
problem. OK. And he has the right to defend that,'' Habibie said.
	   ``He has the right, as anybody in this country (has), to enjoy
the value of human rights as well as the presumption of
innocence.''
	   In a separate interview published Sunday by the newspaper Media
Indonesia, Jacob said he had been appointed to lead Suharto's legal
team even though he was not an accredited lawyer.
	   Suharto's eldest daughter, Tutut, has reportedly confirmed that
her father has appointed Jacob to defend him.
	   The newspaper Kompas quoted her as denying earlier reports that
Suharto had engaged a team of foreign lawyers to fight corruption
allegations.

Americans planning donor conference for Palestinians 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The United States is working to organize a
conference to collect billions of dollars in aid for the
cash-strapped Palestinian Authority, a top U.S. official said
Sunday.
	   Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat spoke during a visit to
the West Bank town of Nablus, where he viewed the Palestinian stock
exchange. He is scheduled to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Monday.
	   After the start of the peace process, Washington hosted a 1993
conference to raise funds for the Palestinians. Countries as poor
as India and as rich as Japan pitched in, pledging dlrs 3 billion
over five years.
	   Now Palestinian Authority officials are lobbying for a new
package to fund infrastructure projects. The 1998 Palestinian
budget of dlrs 1.8 billion is 50 percent dependent on foreign aid.
	   ``We are already beginning to think about the next five-year
program,'' Eizenstat, who is on his third visit to the region since
October, told reporters.
	   Eizenstat pointed to the fact that the Palestinian economy has
degenerated rather than improved since the signing of the 1993 Oslo
peace accords.
	   Eizenstat called Palestinian prosperity ``a win-win situation''
for both Palestinians and Israel.
	   ``Poverty and deprivation are a breeding ground for
instability,'' he said.

U.N. conference aims to end differences over international criminal court 
</HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Fifty years ago, out of the blood and ashes of World
War II, the idea of an international tribunal to try crimes such as
genocide was born. The world's nations are now closer than they've
ever been, but the long march is far from over.
	   On Monday, a United Nations conference on the final shape of the
court begins. If it succeeds, the world will have its first
permanent tribunal for the most grievous offenses: genocide, war
crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   But success is far from certain.
	   ``This is crunch time,'' David Scheffer, the head of the U.S.
delegation, said in a pre-conference briefing.
	   For the next 4 1/2 weeks, envoys from more than 180 countries
will try to resolve the very profound differences that stand in the
way. At their elbows _ and murmuring in their ears _ will be
hundreds of human rights lobbyists.
	   The draft treaty delegates will haggle over still has hundreds
of blank spots. But the biggest battle of all will be over who
controls the court. Will it be the U.N. Security Council, will it
be the prosecutors, or will a compromise emerge?
	   The United States is a major player, the 800-pound gorilla at
the conference. It _ along with fellow military powers Russia,
China and France _ wants the council to maintain ultimate control.
	   On the other side are a coalition of more than 50 countries and
hundreds of human rights groups who want a court independent of
political bodies like the council.
	   ``The stakes here are very, very high,'' Richard Dicker, a Human
Rights Watch lawyer attending the conference, said on the eve of
the conference.
	   In theory, the court would step in only when national
governments are unable or unwilling to do so. Unlike the World
Court in the Hague, which handles disputes between states, it would
try individuals.
	   The idea for a world criminal court was inspired by the
Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes tribunals set up after World War II,
but it lay fallow for decades in the chill of the Cold War.
	   A new round of horrors in the mid-90s _ ethnic cleansing in
Yugoslavia and genocide in Rwanda _ gave the idea new life, both
inside and outside the United Nations.
	   Although the United States has been one of the court's main
backers, human rights groups say its proposals could cripple the
court and create loopholes any nation could use to wiggle out of
prosecution.
	   To protect American troops abroad, the United States wants the
Security Council to have ultimate say. Since the United States has
a veto on the council, this would effectively give it a veto over
the court.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday wished for the
success of a U.N. conference trying to set up a permament tribunal
for crimes such as genocide.
	   The month-long meeting begins Monday in Rome.
	   John Paul, noting that such a tribunal would judge crimes which
``offend humanity,'' said he hoped that the conference would be
inspired ``by the desire to adequately safeguard fundamental and
inalienable human rights.''
	   ``In assuring the active contribution of the Holy See to the
work of this relevant conference, I offer a most fervent wish to
all participants so that (the conference) will constitute a
historic moment on the path of mutual comprehension among
peoples,'' John Paul said during his weekly appearance to the
public in St. Peter's Square.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat discussed Sunday a U.S. proposal for an
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank to restart the Middle
East peace process.
	   Mubarak will raise the subject with Arab leaders within the next
few days, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said.
	   Israeli-Palestinian talks are deadlocked over Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to accept a U.S mediation
proposal that reportedly calls for Israel to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have agreed to the plan.
	   Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have failed to
make any progress since March 1997 when Israel began building 6,500
housing units for Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Arafat, who did not speak to reporters, arrived in Cairo early
Sunday and was to leave later in the day.

Chechnya threatens to shut part of oil pipeline 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya will shut part of a pipeline carrying
Caspian Sea oil unless Russia honors all agreements signed since
the end of their two-year war, Acting Prime Minister Shamil Basayev
said Sunday.
	   A pipeline carrying oil from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan,
runs through Chechnya before reaching the Russian port of
Novorossiisk on the Black Sea.
	   Basayev said Chechnya will close its section of the pipeline at
the end of June unless Russia honors ``all treaties and agreements
signed since the end of the war,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Basayev did not specify what agreements Russia has breached, but
noted it has not paid for maintenance and security for the
pipeline.
	   Russia withdrew its troops from Chechnya in the fall of 1996 and
signed a peace treaty with the southern Muslim republic in 1997,
but relations between the two remain tense.
	   The treaty left open the issue of Chechnya's political status,
and Moscow says the republic will remain part of Russia. Chechnya
views itself as an independent state and has been trying to assert
its sovereignty.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A mild earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of
5.6 shook Tokyo and nearby areas Sunday night, but there were no
immediate reports of damage or casualties.
	   The quake, strong enough to rattle windows, hit at 10:23 p.m.
(1317 GMT). The Central Meteorological agency said the quake was
centered about 50 kilometers (30 miles) under the sea off Chiba, a
city 30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Tokyo.
	   The agency said no tidal waves were expected.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Some rain on Sunday did not discourage
skiers from enjoying genuine Austrian snow brought to Warsaw's Old
Town as diplomatic luggage to highlight a weekend festival of
Tirolian culture.
	   A 9-meter (29.7 feet) slope built near the Renaissance Royal
Castle was covered with snow brought directly from the Otztaler
glacier in the Tirol region of the Alp mountains. Anyone can ski
down it, as all necessary equipment can be rented on the spot.
	   When Polish customs officers requested duty and import tax on
the snow, the Austrian Embassy declared it as diplomatic luggage,
exempt from the fees.
	   The slope includes an artificial stone wall for climbers.
	   Other highlights of the weekend festival are regional
orchestras, souvenirs and food to advertise the attractions of
Tirol to prospective Polish tourists.

Egyptian police detain 17 Muslim activists 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police have detained 17 people accused of
trying to revive the Muslim militant Jihad group that was behind
the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat, officials said
Sunday.
	   They said the men, including Mohammed Midhat Zohni _ a leader of
the group _ had been recruiting young high school and university
students in a bid to revive the movement which was largely crushed
following Sadat's assassination.
	   The men were also accused of possessing weapons, plotting to
burn down video stores and robbing jewelry and money exchange
shops, said the police officials, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   None of those arrested have been charged. They were arrested
over the past week.
	   Muslim militants launched a campaign of violence in 1992 in a
bid to topple Egypt's secular government and replace it with strict
Islamic rule. More than 1,200 people have died in the violence
since then, mostly militants and police.

Fearing backlash, Iranian journalists cancel U.S. trip 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A group of Iranian journalists canceled a
trip to the United States, apparently for fear of angering the
hard-liners in the ruling clergy, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The eight journalists, including chief editors of Iran's main
papers, were to leave for Washington D.C. this week to attend a
June 17 seminar at the Middle East Institute on ``Iran, America and
Middle East Affairs,'' Farda newspaper said.
	   But they decided not to go because the trip became
``politicized,'' Farda reported.
	   The journalists had been granted an interview with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, which apparently put them in
the difficult position of trying not to upset the hard-liners while
not declining the audience with Albright.
	   The journalists could not be immediately reached for comment.
	   ``The trip was politicized after the revelation that (Albright)
would hold an interview with Iranian press delegation. And this
fact served as one of the reasons for the cancellation of the
trip,'' Farda quoted Issaa Saharkhiz, the director-general of
domestic press in the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, as
saying. He did not elaborate.
	   The journalists had also planned trips to several newspapers and
Muslim groups as well as meetings with congressional and White
House officials, the paper said.
	   The United States severed ties with Iran after revolutionary
militants overthrew the U.S.-backed shah and stormed the American
Embassy in Tehran in 1979. They held 52 Americans hostage for 444
days.
	   Moderate President Mohammad Khatami who took office in August
has called for cultural exchanges between the countries, but Iran's
powerful hard-liners shun even those unofficial ties.

Solana: no option is excluded in settling Kosovo crisis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said
Sunday the alliance does not exclude the use of its air power to
help stop violence in Yugoslavia's separatist province of Kosovo
and pave the way for negotiations.
	   ``NATO will not stand idly by. We will not allow a repeat of the
situation of 1991 in Bosnia,'' Solana told the 26th International
Congress of the Association of European Journalists in Warsaw. The
two-day meeting winds up on Sunday.
	   He said the Western military alliance is ready to use its
military force to back up international diplomatic efforts towards
solving the crisis.
	   ``We will study and prepare for a wide range of military
options, including a possible use of NATO air power,'' Solana said.
	   A NATO air exercise scheduled for Monday over Albania and
Macedonia is intended to ``demonstrate NATO's ability to project
power rapidly into the region,'' he said.
	   ``No option at this stage is excluded,'' Solana said. ``NATO
will play its role to help stabilize the region, and encourage
negotiated settlement that respects existing international
boundaries.''
	   More than 300 people have died in recent months and dozens
missing since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic stepped up his
offensive against ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.

Gunmen abduct eight former rebels supporting peace accord 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Gunmen kidnapped eight former rebels
preparing for a rally in support of a peace accord that ended a
22-year separatist war in the southeastern hills of Bangladesh, an
official said Sunday.
	   Security forces went to the dense forests after the men were
abducted Saturday in Rangamati district, 215 kilometers (135 miles)
southeast of the capital Dhaka, said area administrator Shah Alam.
	   No one claimed responsibility, but Gautam Chakma, a leader of
Hill Tracts People's Solidarity Organization, which signed the
December 1997 peace accord, blamed a small section of militant
tribespeople opposing the agreement.
	   Two groups _ the Hill Tracts Students Council and the Hill
Tracts Women Federation _ have rejected the accord, saying it falls
short of granting full autonomy.
	   The government allows a council representing the numerous tribes
to administer the dense forests in the hills, but can fire the
group if it works against national interest. Opposition politicians
say the accord will encourage separatism.

Iranian oil minister in Gulf tour to lobby for oil cuts for Oman.

Eds: UPDATES with Emirates oil minister comments, Zangeneh leaving
<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Iranian Oil Minister
Bijan Namdar Zangeneh arrived here Sunday to lobby the Emirates to
cut oil production in an attempt to boost prices.
	   Zangeneh was greeted at the airport by his Emirates counterpart,
Obaid bin Saif al-Nasseri, current president of the 11-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the official
Emirates News Agency said.
	   The two held talks on ways to improve oil prices, the agency
said.
	   It quoted al-Nasseri as saying the Emirates would announce its
oil cuts after consultations with oil ministers from the Gulf
Cooperation Council, OPEC and non-OPEC countries.
	   ``We might announce our oil production cuts during the next OPEC
meeting,'' the agency quoted Zangeneh as saying.
	   Oil ministers from the GCC, a six-nation political and economic
alliance of Gulf Arab nations, will meet in Saudi Arabia on
Tuesday.
	   The next OPEC meeting is scheduled for June 24, in Vienna.
	   Zangeneh, who visited Kuwait and Qatar Saturday, said his
country was willing to make additional oil production cuts to
salvage plummeting prices provided other countries did the same.
	   He left Sunday for Oman.
	   Iran, OPEC's second largest producer, last week pledged a
100,000 barrel daily cutback starting July 1. In March, it agreed
to cut back 140,000 barrels per day.
	   Despite promised cutbacks by a number of oil producers, which
should remove some 570,000 barrels of oil from the market by July
1, prices reached a four month low this week, with the OPEC crude
basket going below dlrs 11 a barrel.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The kidnappers of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya have yet to make demands for his
release and security forces have made no progress in their search
for the abducted official, a news agency reported Sunday.
	   Valentin Vlasov was kidnapped at gunpoint May 1. No one has
claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.
	   Chechen security forces and investigative teams have turned up
no leads despite round-the-clock searches, and Vlasov's fate
remains unknown, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Shamil Basayev, the guerrilla commander turned deputy premier of
Chechnya, called for security forces to be allowed to carry out
searches for hostages without warrants.
	   ``We know sometimes where and who keeps some or other hostage,
but while agreements are being reached and search warrants are
being issued, criminals transfer him to another place,'' ITAR-Tass
quoted Basayev as saying.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions, usually for ransom, since the region's
two-year war for independence from Russia ended in 1996.
	   In the southern Russian city of Budyonnovsk, former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin participated in a commemoration
ceremony for victims of an attack led by Basayev three years ago.
	   Dozens of rebels set cars on fire, stormed police headquarters,
gunned down civilians and seized hundreds of hostages in
Budyonnovsk on June 14, 1995. About 140 people died.
	   The rebels demanded an end to the war in Chechnya, which lasted
another 14 months.
	   Chernomyrdin, who negotiated by telephone with Basayev to end
the crisis, also took part in a rally in front of police
headquarters, where 18 officers were killed in a clash with the
rebels.
	   Basayev also said Sunday that an Islamic ``peacekeeping
brigade'' was being formed to ``deal with the problems of
Muslims.''
	   He gave no details, except to say such a force was necessary
``because the United Nations is rotten to the core and deserves a
place in the dustbin of history,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.

Iran newspaper publisher released on bail 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The publisher of a liberal Iranian newspaper
charged with unethical reporting was released on bail Sunday, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   But soon after Mohammad Mahdavi Khorrami was released, the chief
editor of the Gozaresh-e-Ruz daily was summoned to court, the
agency said. It did not say why.
	   Mahdavi Khorrami, publisher of the newspaper, was arrested
Wednesday after ignoring a court summons.
	   Gozaresh-e-Ruz, or ``Day's Report,'' stopped publication last
week after the government Press Supervisory Board charged it with
violating press ethics by printing a picture of a teen-age girl and
a teen-age boy together.
	   Iran's strict Islamic code prohibits dating.
	   IRNA said Mahdavi Khorrami was once convicted of slander when he
managed the weekly, Gozaresh-e-Hafteh or ``Weekly Report.''
	   The Justice Ministry is reviewing the complaint against
Gozaresh-e-Ruz, and the case will go to court when the
investigation is completed, judiciary spokesman Saeed Nobari said.
	   The action against the publisher of Gozaresh-e-Ruz is seen as a
setback for the press freedom that has been allowed by moderate
President Mohammad Khatami since he took office in August.
Conservative elements in the government, particularly in the
judiciary, are opposed to his policies and have been intensifying
their offensive against liberal papers.

European summit helps Welsh capital shed ugly duckling image With EU-Summit 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL AMES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ These are stirring times for the capital
of Wales.
	   After decades of decline, Cardiff hosts a European Union summit
Monday and Tuesday and will show off its metamorphosis from dowdy
provincial town to revitalized capital on the verge of limited home
rule after centuries of rule from England.
	   The EU summit brings together presidents and prime ministers
from the 15 EU nations. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and South
African President Nelson Mandela will also show up, along with over
1,000 ministers, aides and advisors and up to 3,000 journalists.
	   ``The summit will be Wales' biggest political event in living
memory,'' wrote Neil Jones, business editor of the Welsh daily, The
Western Mail.
	   He added the summit will ``dispel the outmoded image which still
lingers in parts of Europe that (Wales) is a land blighted by slag
heaps and bad housing and inhabited by women in black pointy
hats.''
	   Cardiff has lived in the shadow not only of London, but also of
Edinburgh. While tourists flock to the elegant Scottish capital
they tend to ignore drab Cardiff.
	   Cardiffians hope the summit will help their city of 300,000 shed
its ugly duckling tag by showcasing recently-renovated Victorian
docklands, turn-of-the-century civic buildings and the eccentric
architecture of Cardiff Castle.
	   ``The summit ... will put Cardiff firmly on the European map,''
says Russell Goodway, leader of Cardiff County Council.
	   Cardiff's heyday came 100 years ago, when coal from Welsh
valleys was shipped from its harbor to power the steam engines of
the world. By the 1980s, the once-mighty mining industry was burnt
out and Cardiff an industrial wasteland.
	   Since then, an aggressive drive to attract foreign business has
put Wales and its capital back on their feet.
	   With just 5 percent of the British population, Wales, with a
population of 2.7 million, has attracted more than 20 percent of
foreign investment over the past 10 years.
	   The European summit will be held in the neo-classical City Hall.
Its white stone facade and marble statues of local heroes are
shining after a 2 million pound (dlrs 3.2 million) facelift.
	   Helmut Kohl, Jacques Chirac and the others will lunch in the
Welsh national museum surrounded by both French Impressionist
paintings and an exhibition highlighting Wales as a magnet for
hi-tech investment.
	   Cardiff welcomes the leaders with street parties, festivals of
Celtic culture, fireworks and concerts.
	   The city's renowned brewers are even serving a special ``summit
ale.''
	   Cardiff's days in the limelight won't end after the summit.
	   Next year the city hosts the World Rugby Championship in a
71,000-seat stadium currently under construction. And next May, the
opening of the Welsh National Assembly will restore a degree of
self rule to the ancient principality conquered by the English 700
years ago.

U.N. conference aims to end differences over international criminal court weight 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: SUBS 7th graf, The United etc, to give metric conversion for
By CANDICE HUGHES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Fifty years ago, out of the blood and ashes of World
War II, the idea of an international tribunal to try crimes such as
genocide was born. The world's nations are now closer than they've
ever been, but the long march is far from over.
	   On Monday, a United Nations conference on the final shape of the
court begins. If it succeeds, the world will have its first
permanent tribunal for the most grievous offenses: genocide, war
crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   But success is far from certain.
	   ``This is crunch time,'' David Scheffer, the head of the U.S.
delegation, said in a pre-conference briefing.
	   For the next 4 1/2 weeks, envoys from more than 180 countries
will try to resolve the very profound differences that stand in the
way. At their elbows _ and murmuring in their ears _ will be
hundreds of human rights lobbyists.
	   The draft treaty delegates will haggle over still has hundreds
of blank spots. But the biggest battle of all will be over who
controls the court. Will it be the U.N. Security Council, will it
be the prosecutors, or will a compromise emerge?
	   The United States is a major player, the 800-pound (363 kilo)
gorilla at the conference. It _ along with fellow military powers
Russia, China and France _ wants the council to maintain ultimate
control.

World Cup: Batistuta strike gives Argentina 1-0 win 
</HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta dispensed a dose of
World Cup reality to debutant Japan Sunday, pouncing on a defensive
mistake to fire two-time champion Argentina to a 1-0 victory.
	   The Fiorentina striker prodded the ball past 'keeper Yoshikatsu
Kawaguchi in the 28th minute after Japanese midfielder Hiroshi
Nanami had lost possession in his own area.
	   It was a cruel goal for the World Cup first-timers to concede
after a promising opening in which they created the better chances.
The Japanese also went close twice near the end of their Group H
game.
	   By a strange contrast, not one of Argentina's starting 11 or two
used substitutes play in Argentina while the entire Japanese squad
of 22 play in their J-League.
	   Argentina had nine players from Italy's Serie A, three from
Spain's Primera Liga and one from the Swiss first division.
	   Japan's first ever shot in the World Cup finals came after only
two minutes but Motohiro Yamaguchi's 30-meter (yard) drive was
several meters wide.
	   In the 13th minute the debutants got closer when Nanami floated
the ball forward into the Argentina area and Naoki Soma got clear
of Javier Zanetti. Soma climbed well to meet the pass but headed
too high with only goalkeeper Carlos Roa to beat.
	   With several thousand of their fans and the neutral French
roaring them on, the tenacious-tackling Japanese had plenty of
support in the Stadium Municipal.
	   When Argentina conceded a free kick 22 meters from goal midway
through the first half, Hidetoshi Nakata curled the ball just wide
of the target.
	   Argentina's first shot on target came in the 25th minute when
Ariel Ortega released Claudio Lopez on the left and the Valencia
striker's left footed shot was confidently saved by 'keeper
Kawaguchi.
	   Batistuta had a free kick blocked and Juan Veron's follow up
shot flew just over and then the period of Argentina pressure
brought success in the 28th minute.
	   Veron's through ball should have been cleared by Hiroshi Nanami
just inside the Japanese area but he lost possession and played the
ball into Batistuta's path. The striker known as ``Batigol'' had
the simple task of lobbing the ball over the advancing 'keeper into
the net.
	   It was almost 2-0 in the 37th minute when Batistuta flicked a
long-range header against the post, Lopez dived to head the rebound
goalwards from eight meters but 'keeper Kawaguchi recovered to
save.
	   Ten minutes into the second half, Nakata went on a determined
run at the Argentina defense but his final low shot from a good
position was well wide.
	   Japan sent on its Brazilian born forward Wagner Lopes to try and
conjure an equalizer but Argentine 'keeper Roa still had little to
do.
	   But Kawaguchi rescued his team with two reaction saves in the
70th minute, beating out a close range prod by Diego Simeone and
then recovering to smother the follow up shot from substitute Abel
Balbo.
	   Six minutes from the end, Japan almost snatched a leveller when
Yutaka Akita climbed above Simeone to head across the face of the
Argentine goal, Soma just failing to connect as he slid in at the
far post.
	   The Japanese went close again in injury time when Lopes
connected with a right wing cross but his goal-bound strike was
deflected by an Argentine leg for a corner.
	   Lineups:
	   Argentina _ Carlos Roa; Roberto Ayala, Roberto Sensini (Jose
Chamot 74th), Javier Zanetti, Nelson Vivas; Matias Almeyda, Diego
Simeone, Juan Veron, Ariel Ortega; Claudio Lopez (Abel Balbo,
62nd), Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Japan _ Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi; Akira Narahashi, Masami Ihara,
Eisuke Nakanishi, Yutaka Akita, Naoki Soma (Takashi Hirano, 86th);
Hiroshi Nanami, Hidetoshi Nakata, Motohiro Yamaguchi; Shoji Jo,
Masashi Nakayama (Wagner Lopes, 68th).
	   Referee _ Mario Van Der Ende, Holland.

	   TORREMOLINOS, Spain (AP) _ An alleged boss of the Naples mafia,
his son and his son's wife were being held in the southern coastal
city of Torremolinos on Sunday, the day after they were arrested on
suspicion of drug trafficking, police said.
	   Francesco Cavallo, 68, was arrested along with his son Renzo
Cavallo, 36, and his daughter-in-law, Monica Tosoni, 30, leading

several Spanish arrest warrants for suspected involvement in
similar activities, the paper said.
	   Moroccan Nourdine Eraoui, an alleged associated of the trio, was
also arrested in the flurry of related detentions in which police
seized over 200 kilos (440 pounds) of hashish, 8.5 kilos (20
pounds) of cocaine, six million pesetas (dlrs 40,000), four cars
and false personal documents, El Pais said.

Fighting intensifies in Guinea-Bissau with rebels denying claims they're beaten 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with reports of direct hit on U.S. embassy in 3rd
graf
By BARRY HATTON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fierce fighting between rebel soldiers
and government troops in Guinea-Bissau continued Sunday as the
insurgents denied government claims that they had been crushed,
according to reports.
	   The two sides were pounding each other's positions in the
capital Bissau with rockets, mortars and artillery, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported.
	   Caught in the middle, the U.S. and Swedish embassies, the main
hospital and the Finance Ministry had taken direct hits, Portuguese
radio RDP-Africa said. Damage to the Russian and French embassies
was reported earlier in the day.
	   With the fighting intensifying, thousands of people were
desperately seeking an escape route, and the first reports emerged
Sunday that 200 people had drowned as they fled Bissau by boat two
days before.
	   The refugees were on their way to the Bissagos archipelago, 48
kilometers (30 miles) off the coast of this west African country,
Lusa said.
	   There was no reliable information on the number of casualties in
the fighting. International phone lines to the former Portuguese
colony were not working.
	   Fighting between the rebels and government forces, backed by
reinforcements from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea,
has centered on a garrison in the suburb of Bra where the mutineers
have been holed up since launching their coup attempt a week ago.
	   The military complex, covering several hectares (acres) and
surrounded by high walls, occupies a strategic defensive position
in Bissau.
	   A rebel spokesman described as ``pure propaganda'' the
government's claim, made on state radio Saturday, that the
renegades had been dislodged from their stronghold, Lusa reported.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes reportedly was speaking on a private radio
station seized by the rebels after they mutinied.
	   He said the mutineers were ready to allow emergency food aid to
be flown into the capital's international airport, located near the
garrison, which they also control, the report said.
	   A Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that embassy
staff in Bissau were holed up in the building due to the fighting
outside.
	   The situation was ``still very serious'' he said.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who gained renown as a guerilla fighter in the war against
Portuguese rule from 1961 to 1974.
	   Mane was fired in January amid allegations of smuggling arms to
separatists in Senegal and formally stepped down a week ago.
	   He has accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption and
called on him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.
	   President of Gambia Yahya Jammeh offered to mediate in the
conflict, Lusa reported Sunday.
	   Mane is originally from Gambia, and the rebels had previously
suggested talks on Gambian soil.

Egyptian police detain 17 Muslim activists 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police have detained 17 people accused of
trying to revive the Muslim militant Jihad group that was behind
the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat, officials said
Sunday.
	   They said the men had been recruiting young high school and
university students in a bid to revive the movement, which was
largely crushed following Sadat's assassination.
	   The men were also accused of possessing weapons, plotting to
burn down video stores and robbing jewelry and money exchange
shops, said the police officials, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   None of those arrested have been charged. They were arrested
over the past week.
	   Muslim militants launched a campaign of violence in 1992 in a
bid to topple Egypt's secular government and to replace it with
strict Islamic rule. More than 1,200 people have died in the
violence since then, mostly militants and police.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A major black opposition
leader jump-started campaigning for the 1999 elections Sunday,
attacking President Nelson Mandela's party at a rally for failing
to deliver on its promises.
	   Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi told 2,000
followers, some carrying traditional Zulu shields and spears, in
downtown Johannesburg that for his part, he would make no promises
he could not keep.
	   ``I cannot promise that I alone, the IFP alone, or anybody
alone, can save South Africa from the many problems threatening
it,'' Buthelezi declared.
	   Even though Mandela hasn't set an election date yet, the
gathering had every appearance of a campaign rally. IFP policy
manuals and T-shirts emblazoned with the party's new symbol, a
family of elephants, were distributed at the rally in a plaza front
of the public library.
	   There is little doubt Mandela's African National Congress will
win the nation's second all-race elections, but the party is
vulnerable for unfulfilling some campaign promises, chief among
them one to build a million homes for poor blacks by 1999. Less
than half have been built.
	   ``I do not believe that people can be fooled for long,''
Buthelezi chided. ``Whoever tried to fool the people cannot be
excused.''
	   The ANC is also vulnerable because it is faced with the huge
task of dramatically improving the lives of millions of formerly
disenfranchised South Africans with a limited budget. Buthelezi hit
that point, saying voters' lives have improved little since the
1994 elections which marked the demise of apartheid.
	   ``Our political liberation has become a portentous
achievement,'' Buthelezi said. ``But final liberation must come one
day when the majority of our people will no longer be enslaved
under the yoke of poverty, unemployment, ignorace for lack of
education, and lack of essential services.''
	   Buthelezi's attacks on the ANC's first term in government
mirrored complaints from the National Party, which had ruled under
apartheid until losing the 1994 elections.
	   Crime and corruption have soared out of control, said Buthelezi,
wearing a business suit and flanked by IFP leaders.
	   Buthelezi serves as Home Affairs Minister in the government. The
ANC may well try to woo his party's support if it appears it will
fall short of winning a crucial two-thirds majority in parliament,
needed to pass legislation.
	   But Buthelezi warned such cooperation was not to be taken for
granted. Referring to his party's symbol, he said: ``Let it be
known that this elephant does not wish to carry anybody's political
luggage, nor does it wish to piggy-back on anyone else.''
	   Inkatha nearly boycotted 1994's first all-race elections, then
won 11 percent of the seats in Parliament.
	   Notwithstanding Buthelezi's serving in the ANC-led government,
the parties remain bitter rivals. More than 10,000 people have died
in fighting between ANC and IFP supporters in KwaZulu-Natal, a
province dominated by Inkatha, over the past decade.

Orthodox Patriarch holds service with new Greek Archbishop 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Newly elected Archbishop Christodoulos
of Greece and Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of the world's
300 million Orthodox, conducted a joint service Sunday in a sign of
improved ties.
	   Relations with the ecumenical patriarch were strained during the
reign of Christodoulos's predecessor, Archbishop Seraphim, who
often hinted that Bartholowmew was trying to turn himself into a
pope-like figure with absolute power.
	   At the end of the service, Bartholomew gave a cross as well as
engraved medallions as a gift to the Greek archbishop. Bartholomew
told the congregation that ties between the two churches would
strengthen in the future and hoped good relations would help the
``unity of the Orthodox world.''
	   The two later left for the island of Heybeliada, off the coast
of Istanbul, to attend a seminar, organized by Bartholomew, to
increase environmental awareness.
	   The Istanbul-based ecumenical patriarch is considered the
``first among equals'' with the other Orthodox patriarchs.
	   But Greece's Orthodox church is independent and does not swear
allegiance to the patriarch.
	   Seen as a reformer, Christodoulos, 59, took the helm in May
after Seraphim's death.

On summit's eve, Chirac says EU must meddle less in national matters 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-EU Summit-Cardiff's Comeback
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ On the eve of a European summit, French
President Jacques Chirac said Sunday the European Union must meddle
less in national affairs _ such as telling his country how to sell
tickets to soccer's World Cup _ and do more to expand the EU into
eastern Europe.
	   Chirac complained that the European Commission, which runs the
EU's day-to-day affairs, sticks its nose into matters better left
to national governments.
	   ``Hundreds of decisions ... shouldn't have been taken,'' Chirac
said in an interview with BBC television.
	   Chirac singled out EU Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert's
harping on shortcomings in World Cup ticket sales as
``interference'' in French affairs.
	   ``Don't be silly! That's not your responsibility,'' he said of
the commission.
	   Van Miert has blamed France with unfairly restricting World Cup
tickets to French nationals or residents and threatened legal
action.
	   Chirac complained EU institutions don't work well and ``will not
work at all'' unless they are overhauled before the club grows from
15 to 25 members or more by taking on candidates among its eastern
neighbors.
	   ``We have to reform the institutions. The commission, the way to
vote (at ministerial meetings). This has to be changed and there is
no doubt that the reform must be before the first enlargement,''
Chirac said.
	   His comment raised an issue that will surface at the EU summit
Monday and Tuesday: how far should European nations go in doing
things together and how much should be left to national
governments.
	   Chirac's concerns are shared by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   In a joint letter this week to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, the summit's host, the two termed the EU an ivory tower
issuing edicts affecting the lives of 370 million Europeans but
accountable to none.
	   Writing back, Blair pledged to have ``an informal discussion of
the future development of the European Union, addressing in
particular how we can better meet the challenges we face while
responding to citizens' concerns.''
	   No one questions the need for reform, but the leaders themselves
have so far failed to push it forward. This time last year in
Amsterdam, they could not agree on proposals to streamline EU
decision-making and revamp EU institutions, especially the
commission _ long the preferred whipping boy of EU-bashing
politicians.
	   In the past year, talks to reform farm subsidies that eat up
half the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget and to forge a new funding
formula for the EU have made no progress.
	   Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Austria believe they pay
too much as it is and want their contributions limited.
	   Others say that is unreasonable when the EU plans to widen its
ranks. Also, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland want assurances
that special aid for them will not be lost to newcomers who are
poorer than they are.
	   The leaders will be accompanied by their foreign and finance
ministers. The former will debate such issues as Kosovo. The latter
will review the deteriorating Russian economy and the recession in
Japan.
	   The summit ends with a lunch on Tuesday with South African
President Nelson Mandela. Blair invited Mandela as a farewell to
the leader, who is to step down next year.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A German and a Romanian died on the
spot when their Mercedes Benz car ran into a truck in eastern
Hungary early Sunday, a police spokesman said.
	   The accident occurred a few minutes after midnight in the
outskirts of Szolnok, 100 kilometers (65 miles) southeast of
Budapest, when the passenger car hit the truck from behind.
	   The German, identified only as K.W.F, and the Romanian, D.K.,
were passengers of a Mercedes 290TD, driven by K.H.R., 56, from Bad
Pyomort, Germany, Gyoergy Lengyel from the Szolnok County police
said.
	   The owner of the car only suffered minor injuries, and was
released from the local hospital, Lengyel said.

Scott Draper defeats Laurence Tieleman in Queen's Club final 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS with Draper winning final
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Australian Scott Draper picked up his first ATP
Tour title Sunday, defeating little-know Belgian-born Italian
Laurence Tieleman in straight sets in the final at the Queen's
Club.
	   Draper, 24, didn't face a breakpoint in the grass-court match
and closed out Tieleman with his 10th ace 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
	   Despite the absence of big-name players in the final like
top-seeded Pete Sampras and No. 2 Greg Rusedski, the match was a
sellout on a rare sunny London afternoon.
	   Sampras was beaten earlier by Australian Mark Woodforde and
Rusedski, the Canadian-born Briton, had to retire with a severe
ankle sprain that could sideline him when Wimbledon opens in a
week.
	   Draper broke the 25-year-old Tieleman only once _ in the first
game of the second set _ as neither player returned well. Draper
controlled the match with better passing shots as Tieleman
consistently missed his volleys.
	   Coming into this tournament, Draper had not won consecutive
matches all season and had been slowed by injuries and
inconsistency.
	   With an ATP ranking of 108, this was only his second ATP final.
He lost in Adelaide in 1997 to countryman Tood Woodbridge.
	   Tieleman, ranked 253 by the ATP, was playing in his first-ever
ATP final, never having been further than the quarterfinals in an
ATP Tour event.
	   Entering the final against Draper, all of his main-draw
victories on the ATP Tour had come on grass. He had 12 victories on
that surface but was 0-3 on clay and 0-5 on hardcourts.

Argentina downs Japan; English fans clash with police be UPDATED with Yugoslavia-Iran and Croatia-Jamaica AP Sports Writer

By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Japan, the first of three nations making World Cup
debuts Sunday, gave a valient effort before falling to Argentina,
while police responded to the tournament's first violence involving
English fans.
	   Gabriel Batistuta scored in the 28th minute to give Group H
favorite Argentina a 1-0 victory in rainswept conditions at
Toulouse.
	   ``There are things we can improve,'' Argentine midfielder Diego
Simeone said. ``But the order of the day was to win, and we did.''
	   Later Sunday, newcomers Croatia and Jamaica played in Lens, and
Yugoslavia and Iran _ two countries back in the World Cup following
politically-related absences _ met in Saint-Etienne. Yugoslavia was
banned from the 1994 World Cup because of international sanctions,
while Iran's once-formidable soccer program took a downturn after
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Iran's preparations took a unique turn Saturday night when its
players held a three-hour religious mourning ceremony at the time
many teams would be getting a good night's sleep before a game.
	   Players beat their chests and wept as a religious teacher
recounted the death of a 7th century Shiite Muslim saint in what is
now modern day Iraq.
	   The ritual ended around midnight, about the same time that some
200 English fans were causing trouble in Marseille.
	   The violence broke out when a motorist who was blocked for
several minutes by dancing English fans tried to push his way
through, police said. His car struck and slightly injured an
English fan, setting off a melee involving some 200 fans who
showered police and their vehicles with bottles and cans.
	   At least one gendarme was hospitalized with a head injury. Four
English fans were arrested.
	   As a result, authorities stepped up security immediately in the
southern French town, with about 1,600 uniformed or plainclothes
city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS national police
patrolling the city ahead of England's first-round match against
Tunisia on Monday night.
	   Also Sunday, French organizers said they had filed a complaint
against agents and tour operators allegedly involved in the World
Cup ticket scandal.
	   None of the groups involved in the filing were identified, but
Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the organizing committee, said the
panel was adamant about prosecuting anyone who sold bogus tickets.
	   ``We are going to court and an investigation will be carried
out,'' he said.
	   Thousands of fans worldwide have been left without tickets that
had been promised to them or for which they had paid. French
prosecutors said Saturday they would investigate criminal charges
against businesses and individuals involved in ticket fraud.

Security reinforced after English fans clash with police

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Police deployed reinforcements Sunday
on the eve of an England-Tunisia match, after hundreds of English
World Cup fans clashed with officers in the Old Port district,
officials said.
	   Dozens of officers patrolled the port and down the Canebiere,
the city's main avenue, where sun-drenched cafes were brimming with
flag-waving English fans who chanted, drank and talked to the
locals a day after the clash.
	   A festive atmosphere had returned to Marseille, its beaches
filled with tourists, locals and topless sunbathers on the eve of
the England-Tunisia match here. The British tabloid The Sun sent a
topless orange double-decker bus around town, with model-TV hostess
Melinda Messenger handing out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Ice cream vendor Antoine, going good business under the hot sun,
said he felt no lingering tension from the night before. ``The
English aren't aggressive with us at all. I don't understand why
they're described as hooligans.''
	   But police weren't taking any chances. They deployed
reinforcements ahead of schedule after the melee overnight
Saturday, when about 200 English fans pelted police with bottles
and cans.
	   The clash began after a motorist tried to force his way through
the crowd of revelers, knocking over one of the fans. The fan was
slightly injured, as well as a policeman struck in the head by a
bottle. Four fans were arrested.
	   ``It's the accident that set it all off,'' said Mark Shelton, of
Doncaster, England. ``We walked around all night without the
smallest incident, but when the driver ran into us, some of my
compatriots saw red.''
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.
	   Vans of CRS and gendarmes stood ready in several Marseille
neighborhoods.

	   ZAHLE, Lebanon (AP) _ Residents in eastern Lebanon voted Sunday
in municipal elections that pit the Christian president against his
son in the region's biggest town, where they are backing rival
tickets.
	   About 4,000 soldiers, backed by armor, deployed in sweltering
heat on major roads and town squares in the Bekaa Valley, the last
region to vote in the four-stage elections.
	   Polls closed at 5 p.m. (1400 GMT). Preliminary results were
expected as early as Monday.
	   In 10 hours of balloting, the Bekaa's 434,000 eligible voters
had the opportunity to fill 1,879 city and town council posts.
	   The elections, which are held for the first time in 35 years,
marked a milestone in Lebanon's recovery after the 1975-90 civil
war between its Christian and Muslim communities.
	   What distinguishes Sunday's round from the previous ones held in
the past four weeks in other provinces is the absence of
Christian-Muslim competition.
	   It's Christians against Christians in Zahle, Bekaa's provincial
capital, and Shiites versus Shiites in Baalbek, home to ancient
Roman ruins which became infamous during the civil war as hotbed of
militants who kidnapped Westerners.
	   President Elias Hrawi, his younger son Roy and a legislator
nephew backed a slate of candidates for the 21-seat council in the
family's hometown of Zahle, Lebanon's largest Christian town of
130,000 residents.
	   But George Hrawi, the president's elder son, endorsed the ticket
of his father's arch-foe, lawmaker Elie Skaff.
	   George Hrawi, who shied away from politics until recently, on
Sunday angrily waved a bundle of cash to reporters and accused
opponents of ``vote-buying in the open.''
	   Skaff told The Associated Press that ``the president is
personally intervening'' against him in the election.
	   But their rivals denied vote-buying and the president proclaimed
neutrality.
	   ``The state is not a party ... I will be the first to
congratulate whoever wins,'' Hrawi told reporters after casting his
vote.
	   Some newspapers have said the Zahle race could have a bearing on
the president's political future as Hrawi, in office since 1989,
may seek another extension when his term expires in November.
	   For Raymonda Kallas, 24, her vote went to candidates backed by
the president because they ``inspire confidence and have the
capability of implementing development projects.''
	   In predominantly Shiite Baalbek, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
and the pro-Syrian Amal group of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri
battled for control of the 21-seat municipal council.
	   The mainstream Amal lost ground in last week's vote in southern
Lebanon to Hezbollah, which has capitalized on a successful
guerrilla war against Israel in the south. Hezbollah is challenging
Berri for leadership of the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest
single sect.
	   Mohammed Awada, a 22-year-old student in Baalbek, voted for
Hezbollah because he wants improved services in the impoverished
region.
	   ``Hezbollah has built a hospital and a school in Baalbek. It is
the only party that helps sick people and children of needy people
enroll in schools,'' he said.

World Cup: Batistuta strike gives Argentina 1-0 win quotes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recasts, adds Simeone quotes, will be updated with Japan
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Japan found out about the World Cup the
hard way.
	   The rookie qualifiers, who co-host the finals next time up in
2002, created a string of chances against two-time champion
Argentina Sunday but gifted star striker Gabriel Batistuta the only
goal of the game in a 1-0 loss.
	   Japanese midfielder Hiroshi Nanami lost possession in his own
area in the 28th minute and the Fiorentina striker, one of the
superstars of world soccer, ran clear to prod the ball past exposed
'keeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi.
	   It was a cruel goal for the World Cup first-timers to concede
after a promising opening in which they created the better chances
but couldn't get the ball on target.
	   The Japanese also went close twice near the end of their Group H
game as the Argentines, among the favorites to win the title here,
wobbled in the last 15 minutes.
	   ``Well, we're satisfied because we won, which the main thing,''
said Argentina captain Diego Simeone. ``Besides that, there are
things we can improve.
	   ``From 20 minutes on Argentina played very well. I think maybe
in the second half the urge to win held us back a bit,'' the Inter
Milan midfielder said. ``But the order of the day was to win and we
did.''
	   Japan's first ever shot in the World Cup finals came after only
two minutes but Motohiro Yamaguchi's 30-meter (yard) drive was
several meters wide.
	   In the 13th minute the debutants got closer when Nanami floated
the ball forward into the Argentina area and Naoki Soma got clear
of Javier Zanetti. Soma climbed well to meet the pass but headed
too high with only goalkeeper Carlos Roa to beat.
	   When Argentina conceded a free kick 22 meters from goal midway
through the first half, Hidetoshi Nakata curled the ball just wide
of the target.
	   Argentina's first shot on target came in the 25th minute when
Ariel Ortega released Claudio Lopez on the left and the Valencia
striker's left footed shot was confidently saved by 'keeper
Kawaguchi.
	   Batistuta had a free kick blocked and Juan Veron's follow up
shot flew just over and then the period of Argentina pressure
brought success in the 28th minute.
	   A through ball should have been cleared by Nanami just inside
the Japanese area but it squirmed away from him and went straight
into Batistuta's path. The striker known as ``Batigol'' had the
simple task of chipping the ball past the advancing 'keeper into
the net.
	   It was almost 2-0 in the 37th minute when Batistuta flicked a
long-range header against the post, Lopez dived to head the rebound
goalwards from eight meters but 'keeper Kawaguchi recovered to
save.
	   Ten minutes into the second half, Nakata went on a determined
run at the Argentina defense but his final low shot from a good
position was well wide.
	   Japan sent on its Brazilian born forward Wagner Lopes to try and
conjure an equalizer but Argentine 'keeper Roa still had little to
do.
	   But Kawaguchi rescued his team with two reaction saves in the
70th minute, beating out a close range prod by Simeone and then
recovering to smother the follow up shot from substitute Abel
Balbo.
	   Six minutes from the end, Japan almost snatched a leveller when
Yutaka Akita climbed above Simeone to head across the face of the
Argentine goal, Soma just failing to connect as he slid in at the
far post.
	   The Japanese went close again in injury time when Lopes
connected with a right wing cross but his goal-bound strike was
deflected by an Argentine leg for a corner.
	   Lineups:
	   Argentina _ Carlos Roa; Roberto Ayala, Roberto Sensini (Jose
Chamot 74th), Javier Zanetti, Nelson Vivas; Matias Almeyda, Diego
Simeone, Juan Veron, Ariel Ortega; Claudio Lopez (Abel Balbo,
62nd), Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Japan _ Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi; Akira Narahashi, Masami Ihara,
Eisuke Nakanishi, Yutaka Akita, Naoki Soma (Takashi Hirano, 86th);
Hiroshi Nanami, Hidetoshi Nakata, Motohiro Yamaguchi; Shoji Jo,
Masashi Nakayama (Wagner Lopes, 68th).
	   Referee _ Mario Van Der Ende, Holland.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Despite Japan's economic slump, the governing
party's candidate won a by-election Sunday for a seat in
Parliament's lower house.
	   In a contest closely watched for clues to how national upper
house elections will turn out on July 12, opponents attacked the
economic policies of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   But Eiichi Iwashita, the candidate of Hashimoto's Liberal
Democratic Party, won the seat vacated by the resignation of
opposition politician Morihiro Hosokawa, a former prime minister.
	   With 99 percent of ballots counted, Iwashita had 67,515 votes to
57,533 for Yorihisa Matsuno, a former secretary to Hosokawa.
Matsuno, 37, ran on the Democratic Party of Japan ticket and was
backed by three other opposition groups.
	   Sachiko Kawakami of the Communist Party had 23,152, and Sumio
Maruyama of the Social Democratic Party had 11,203.
	   Iwashita, 51, is a former prefectural assemblyman in Kumamoto,
910 kilometers (570 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   In the run-up to next month's upper house elections, Prime
Minister Hashimoto and Democratic Party leader Nato Kan both joined
in the Kumamoto campaign on Saturday.
	   Iwashita campaigned by urging support for Hashimoto's party in
its efforts to revitalize Japan's economy.
	   It was the first election for a seat in the national Parliament
under a new law extending voting hours by two hours, until 8 p.m.
(1100 GMT), in an effort to reverse the declining voter turnouts of
recent years.
	   But turnout reached only 47.96 percent, lower than 59.27 percent
in the last lower house election in the district in October 1996.
	   Hashimoto's party now has 262 of the 500 seats in the lower
house. In the less powerful 252-seat upper house, it has 118.

skiers from enjoying genuine Austrian snow brought to Warsaw's Old
Town as diplomatic luggage to highlight a weekend festival of
Tirolian culture.
	   A 9-meter (29.7 feet) slope built near the Renaissance Royal
Castle was covered with snow brought directly from the Otztaler
glacier in the Tirol region of the Alp mountains. Anyone can ski
down it, as all necessary equipment can be rented on the spot.
	   When Polish customs officers requested duty and import tax on
the snow, the Austrian Embassy declared it as diplomatic luggage,
exempt from the fees.
	   The slope, along with an artificial stone wall for climbers,
regional orchestras, souvenirs and food are highlights of a weekend
festival that advertises the attractions of Tirol to prospective
Polish tourists.

Governing party wins parliamentary by-election

RETRANSMITTING TO RESTORE HEADLINE
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Despite Japan's economic slump, the governing
party's candidate won a by-election Sunday for a seat in
Parliament's lower house.
	   In a contest closely watched for clues to how national upper
house elections will turn out on July 12, opponents attacked the
economic policies of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   But Eiichi Iwashita, the candidate of Hashimoto's Liberal
Democratic Party, won the seat vacated by the resignation of
opposition politician Morihiro Hosokawa, a former prime minister.
	   With 99 percent of ballots counted, Iwashita had 67,515 votes to
57,533 for Yorihisa Matsuno, a former secretary to Hosokawa.
Matsuno, 37, ran on the Democratic Party of Japan ticket and was
backed by three other opposition groups.
	   Sachiko Kawakami of the Communist Party had 23,152, and Sumio
Maruyama of the Social Democratic Party had 11,203.
	   Iwashita, 51, is a former prefectural assemblyman in Kumamoto,
910 kilometers (570 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   In the run-up to next month's upper house elections, Prime
Minister Hashimoto and Democratic Party leader Nato Kan both joined
in the Kumamoto campaign on Saturday.
	   Iwashita campaigned by urging support for Hashimoto's party in
its efforts to revitalize Japan's economy.
	   It was the first election for a seat in the national Parliament
under a new law extending voting hours by two hours, until 8 p.m.
(1100 GMT), in an effort to reverse the declining voter turnouts of
recent years.
	   But turnout reached only 47.96 percent, lower than 59.27 percent
in the last lower house election in the district in October 1996.
	   Hashimoto's party now has 262 of the 500 seats in the lower
house. In the less powerful 252-seat upper house, it has 118.

On summit's eve, Chirac says EU must meddle less in national matters With EU Summit-Cardiff's Comeback 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ On the eve of a European summit, French
President Jacques Chirac said Sunday the European Union must meddle
less in national affairs and do more to expand the EU into eastern
Europe.
	   Chirac complained that the European Commission, which runs the
EU's day-to-day affairs, sticks its nose into matters better left
to national governments, such as how France should sell tickets to
soccer's World Cup.
	   ``Hundreds of decisions ... shouldn't have been taken,'' Chirac
said in an interview with BBC television.
	   Chirac singled out EU Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert's
criticism of World Cup ticket sales as ``interference'' in French
affairs.
	   ``Don't be silly! That's not your responsibility,'' he said of
the commission.
	   Van Miert has said France unfairly restricted World Cup tickets
to French nationals or residents. He threatened legal action.
	   Chirac complained EU institutions don't work well and ``will not
work at all'' unless they are overhauled before the club grows from
15 to 25 members or more by taking on candidates from Eastern
Europe.
	   ``We have to reform the institutions. The commission, the way to
vote (at ministerial meetings). This has to be changed and there is
no doubt that the reform must be before the first enlargement,''
Chirac said.
	   The question of how much European nations should work together
and how much should be left to national governments will surface at
the EU summit Monday and Tuesday.
	   Chirac's concerns are shared by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   In a joint letter this week to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, the summit's host, the two termed the EU an ivory tower
issuing edicts affecting the lives of 370 million Europeans but
accountable to none.
	   Writing back, Blair pledged to have ``an informal discussion of
the future development of the EU, addressing in particular how we
can better meet the challenges we face while responding to
citizens' concerns.''
	   European leaders have previously failed in reform efforts. In
Amsterdam last year they could not agree on proposals to streamline
EU decision-making and to revamp EU institutions, especially the
commission _ long the preferred whipping boy of EU-bashing
politicians.
	   In the past year, talks to reform farm subsidies that eat up
half the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget and to forge a new funding
formula for the EU have made no progress.
	   European foreign ministers at the meeting will debate such
issues as Kosovo, while finance ministers will review the
deteriorating Russian economy and the recession in Japan.
	   The summit ends with a lunch on Tuesday with South African
President Nelson Mandela.

Politicians should discuss the future of German historic manuscripts in Polish library 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The head of the Jagiellonian Library which
has Mozart and Beethoven manuscripts said Sunday that politicians
should decide whether the items and thousands of other priceless
manuscripts should be returned to Germany.
	   The co-governing German CSU party wants Poland to return all
German cultural items that were relocated there during World War
II, the German Welt am Sonntag newspaper said Sunday.
	   The CSU mostly wants the manuscripts from the so-called Prussian
Library that were hidden in the Silesia region toward the end of
the war to protect them from allied bombings of Berlin. Silesia
became part of Poland after the war.
	   ``Let the politicians decide, it is their role,'' said Krzysztof
Zamorski, head of the Jagiellonian Library in the southern city of
Krakow, where most of the items are kept.
	   He said ``no one is hiding'' the items and scholars from around
the world are free to use them for their studies.
	   He was surprised that the Germans wanted the items back in
return for the German support of Poland's aspirations to join NATO
and the European Union.
	   ``I have thought that Poland's accession to NATO and the EU is,
among others, an effort to compensate for what happened during
World War II, now it turns out it is business,'' Zamorski said
referring to millions of Poles killed and the country destroyed
under the Nazi occupation from 1939-45.
	   Welt am Sonntag quoted CSU's Johannes Singhammer as saying that
``Germany was Poland's greatest supporter for NATO and EU
membership. Now Poland owes us something, to quickly settle the
dealing on the culture booty. It should be self-evident between
friends, that Poland return the culture items quickly.''
	   A number of items that changed hands both ways during the war
have been returned mutually. The Nazis destroyed or robbed a lot of
Poland's cultural heritage.
	   At CSU's request, a top official at the German foreign ministry,
Werner Hoyer, made up a list of German culture items still in
Poland.
	   It names, among others, some 20,000 manuscripts, including those
of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schumann. Some 212,000 manuscripts
of scholars, poets and statesmen like Goethe, Schiller and Herder,
the so-called Varnhagen Collection, and about 300,000 autographs
and documents from the romantic era in Germany.

Eds: new items on Saudi team security, Croatian complaint rejected,
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Security has been doubled around the Saudi Arabian
team after a dlrs 11,000 burglary of team rooms at a hotel in Lille
	   The thefts, including cash taken form the rooms of three players
at the Sofitel Metropole, were discovered when the team returned
about one hour after Friday's 1-0 loss to Denmark in nearby Lens,
in northern France.
	   Bruno Travade, spokesman for the French World Cup organizers,
said police were investigating the burglary, which involved a total
of 10 rooms. He said Cup officials already had acted to beef up
safety measures for the team.
	   ``We have doubled security forces around the team,'' he said.
``We are not sure if this team is just unlucky or if it is
something else.''
	   The team has since moved to another hotel outside Paris.
	   Travade said there were no immediate plans to increase security
around the 31 other teams at the World Cup although organizers
would check with all squads ``to see if security is adequate.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ A complaint by Croatia that Jamaica illegally threw
it out of a practice session last week was rejected Sunday by FIFA.
	   Croatia argued that the session was open to the public and it
could therefore send representatives to watch the Jamaicans work
out. But FIFA agreed with Jamaica that the session was closed to
all.
	   ``If it's closed, it's closed,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said.
	   Croatia and Jamica played their World Cup opener Sunday in Lens.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA has received ``quite a few'' letters and faxes
asking it to ban Yugoslavia from participating in the World Cup
because of the troubles in Kosovo, FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said
Sunday.
	   FIFA also received letters protesting Iran's participation, and
letters in support of Yugoslavia, but all that was to be expected,
he said.
	   ``An event like the World Cup is certainly going to attract
political attention,'' Cooper said at the world soccer federation's
daily briefing.
	   FIFA's policy on sanctioning nations is clearly laid out.
	   ``The FIFA line is that we follow the United Nations line. U.N.
policy and advice determines our policy,'' he said.
	   The U.N. has imposed economic sanctions on Yugoslavia but these
sanctions don't bar the country from participating in sporting
events.
	   In 1994, Yugoslavia was banned from qualifying for the World Cup
in the United States because of U.N. sanctions imposed on Serbia
for fomenting the Bosnian war. These sanctions were lifted in 1995.
	   The Yugoslav team is trying not to think about their troubles at
home and preparing for Sunday's match against Iran.
	   ``We are here to play soccer, score goals and forget about
politics and wars,'' Yugoslav star midfielder Vladimir Jugovic said
Saturday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ A continuing tribute is planned at World Cup
matches for Fernand Sastre, the moving force behind the successful
French bid for the tournament, who died Saturday after a long
illeness.
	   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said moments of silence for the
organzing committee co-president would be observed before the next
games at stadiums in Paris, Lens, Saint-Etienne, Marseille,
Montpellier, Toulouse and Bordeaux. Similar tributes were held
before matches Saturday in Nantes, Lyon and Saint-Denis.
	   ``He wouldn't wanted to have the spirit of the World Cup
dampened,'' Cooper said. ``He loved football and those who love
football see it as a joyous game.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nigeria will stage next year's world youth soccer
championships despite a change in rulers following last week's
death of strongman leader Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   FIFA said that the dates and sites for the 1999 Under-16 World
Soccer Championships were confirmed by officials Saturday.
	   The tournament will be held in Lagos and other cities April
3-24, 1999.

	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ David Beckham skipped a golf game with
his England teammates because he had a better offer.
	   Her name is Victoria Adams _ also known as Posh Spice _ and she
landed Friday in a private jet in this small Brittany town where
England is training to spend a few quiet hours with her fiance.
	   The two had permission from coach Glenn Hoddle, who has clamped
down on almost everything else at the England camp.
	   ``Victoria did fly out to spend some time with David,'' said
team spokesman Steve Double.
	   ``Glenn has already agreed that the wives and the girlfriends of
the players should be allowed to fly out to watch the England games
in the World Cup.
	   ``But Victoria's tour commitments with the Spice Girls mean she
could not come out to see David in any of the England games.''
	   Double stressed that the two had not been alone together in the
team hotel, visiting instead in the golf course clubhouse.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ They'll pick a MVP _ most valuable player _ at the
end of the World Cup, but the tournament already has an MVO _ most
valuable object.
	   It's a special edition of Footix, the tournament's rooster
mascot, and it's no ordinary souvenir. This little bird weighs 11
pounds (5 kilos) and the soccer ball he's kicking is covered with 4
1/2 pounds (2 kilos) of gold and 40-carats worth of high-quality
diamonds.
	   Designed by Paris jeweler Marc Princ as the showpiece of his
``Footbijoux'' collection, this little trinket is offered at dlrs
370,000 and will be on display at a Paris hotel during the
tournament.

Fighting intensifies in Guinea-Bissau with rebels denying claims they're beaten

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fierce fighting between rebel soldiers
and government troops in Guinea-Bissau continued Sunday as the
insurgents denied government claims that they had been crushed,
according to reports.
	   The two sides were pounding each other's positions in the
capital Bissau with rockets, mortars and artillery, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported.
	   Caught in the middle, the U.S. and Swedish embassies, the main
hospital and the Finance Ministry had taken direct hits, Portuguese
radio RDP-Africa said. Damage to the Russian and French embassies
was reported earlier in the day.
	   With the fighting intensifying in this former Portuguese colony,
thousands of people were desperately seeking an escape route, and
reports emerged Sunday that 200 people had drowned as they fled
Bissau by boat two days before.
	   The refugees were on their way to the Bissagos archipelago, 50
kilometers (30 miles) off the coast of this west African country,
Lusa said.
	   There was no reliable information on the number of casualties in
the fighting. International phone lines were not working.
	   Fighting between the rebels and government forces, backed by
reinforcements from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea,
has centered on a garrison in the suburb of Bra, where the
mutineers have been holed up since launching a coup attempt a week
ago.
	   The military complex, covering several hectares (acres) and
surrounded by high walls, occupies a strategic defensive position.
	   A rebel spokesman described as ``pure propaganda'' the
government's claim, made on state radio Saturday, that the
renegades had been dislodged from the garrison, Lusa reported.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes reportedly was speaking on a private radio
station seized by the rebels after they launched their coup
attempt.
	   He said the mutineers were ready to allow emergency food aid to
be flown into the nearby international airport, which they also
control, the report said.
	   A Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that embassy
staff in Bissau were holed up in the building due to the fighting
outside.
	   The situation was ``still very serious'' he said.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who gained renown as a guerilla fighter in the war against
Portuguese rule from 1961 to 1974.
	   Mane was fired in January amid allegations of smuggling arms to
separatists in Senegal and formally stepped down a week ago.
	   Gambian President Yahya Jammeh has offered to mediate the
conflict, Lusa reported Sunday.
	   Mane is originally from Gambia, and the rebels had previously
suggested talks on Gambian soil.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Eric Tabarly, France's best-known yachtsman who
criss-crossed oceans to win numerous solo titles, has died in a
final battle at sea, officials confirmed Sunday. He was 66.
	   Missing since late Friday night after falling off his
century-old sailboat the Pen Duick in rough seas near the coast of
Wales, Tabarly was declared dead Sunday morning by officials in the
Brittany port of Brest and in a tribute by President Jacques
Chirac.
	   Searches by sea and air failed to turn up the famous navigator,
who shot to fame in 1964 when he won England's Transat solo race
across the Atlantic.
	   ``Despite the last searches that seemed in vain, I didn't dare
believe the demise of Eric Tabarly,'' Chirac said. ``It's with
great sadness and much emotion that I give in to the evidence.''
	   Tabarly ``left his mark on several generations of sailors,''
Chirac said.
	   Patrick Tabarly said his brother ``didn't put luck on his side''
by failing to carry a radio transmitter or wear a life jacket. ``It
was his style of life that he liked, and he died in full form.''
	   The boat's crew said in a statement that Tabarly was knocked
into the sea while changing the main sail to a smaller sail for
higher winds as the boat headed toward Scotland.
	   French naval planes continued the search for Tabarly's body
Sunday, French officials said.
	   Born July 24, 1931 in the western city of Nantes, Tabarly
learned to love sailing from his father, a businessman and sailing
enthusiast.
	   His life with the Pen Duick, meaning ``blackheaded tomtit'' in
Breton, began in 1938 when his father bought the 15-meter (50-foot)
sailboat built in Ireland in 1898.
	   Tabarly joined the navy in 1953 to save the Pen Duick, learning
how to restore the boat from the keel-up.
	   ``Without me, it would just be a boat; without it, my life would
probably be different,'' Tabarly wrote in his memoirs.
	   Tabarly was a 33-year-old naval officer when he won the Transat
in June 1964 aboard the Pen Duick II, a 13.6 meter (45-foot) ketch.
He finished the 5,390-kms (3,350-mile) Plymouth to Newport race in
27 days.
	   Among other races, Tabarly went on to win the Morgan Cup, the
Gotland Round, Channel Race and the Fasnet in 1967.
	   He won the transpacific solo race in the Pen Duick V, a
11,000-km (6,800-mile) race in 39 days in 1969 and won the Los
Angeles-Tahiti race in 1972. Aboard the Pen Duick VI, he won the
Plymouth-Newport race in 23 days and 20 hours in 1976.
	   Tabarly was survived by his wife, Jacqueline, and his
14-year-old daughter Marie.
	   Mrs. Tabarly decided the boat, moored in Milford Haven after the
accident, would continue on to Scotland as her husband would have
wanted. A crew of Tabarly's friends would sail it.
	   Funeral arrangements were pending.

Colombia tries to put the fun back into the national pastime

<TEXT>
	   MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) _ As Colombia takes the field in this
year's World Cup, a soccer-crazed nation is struggling to shake the
ghost of Andres Escobar, who was shot to death just days after
inadvertently putting the ball in his own goal four years ago.
	   Colombians are praying that their country, which opens against
Romania on Monday, can learn to put the joy back into the national
pastime, but burdened by new death threats and media criticism, the
team is finding it hard to enjoy soccer's big event.
	   Never before a major soccer power, at the 1994 World Cup
Colombia had suddenly aspired to world supremacy after the team
thrashed two-time champion Argentina 5-0 in a qualifying game.
	   The victory had capped a decade in which Colombian play had
improved as the sport was corrupted by drug traffickers, who bought
teams and ran betting syndicates, creating potentially deadly
pressures to win.
	   With no relief from sky-high crime, economic malaise and a
festering civil war, Colombians began looking to soccer for
redemption.
	   ``Every frustration or national failure is supposed to be
exorcised through the triumphs of the national team, and all of the
fury is unleashed on its failures,'' author Laura Restrepo wrote in
the El Tiempo newspaper last week.
	   If soccer is a mirror on a country's soul, as with Germany's
discipline and Brazil's spontaneity, Colombia's play reflects
character traits less conducive to victory _ rebellion, egotism,
and a preference for the grandiose gesture over the safe
transaction.
	   Government peace commissioner Daniel Garcia-Pena, an admitted
soccer fanatic, says team Colombia is just like the society around
it.
	   ``When it plays together it wins. When it dedicates itself to
individualism and misunderstanding, we are the universal champions
of self-destruction,'' he wrote in a newly published anthology
entitled ``Clean Play''.
	   Top scorer Faustino Asprilla is typical. His stylish flourishes
around the goal can thrill but have also cost the team more than a
few goals.
	   In honor Escobar, his family has started projects for Colombia's
children that they hope will make a difference.
	   At a Medellin soccer school bearing Escobar's name, located in a
violent barrio where drug lords once recruited teen-age assassins,
children are being taught that winning isn't everything. And that
by having fun, you can also stay safe.
	   Young boys with shiny blue uniforms and dreams of playing
professionally stream after classes to a dust bowl with goal posts
where they practice headers, chest traps and dribbling until the
sun sets.
	   And they are honing more than their soccer skills.
	   ``We learn to make friendships, to respect one another,'' said
twelve-year old Fabio Alexander Zapata.
	   Even if he never makes the pros, Zapata says he'll still be
happy. ``I'll give thanks to God because I'm alive.''
	   The school, founded by Escobar's father Dario, employs social
workers and psychologists along with soccer coaches. It teaches a
noncompetitive philosophy not found at many other private academies
trying to produce world-class players.
	   ``The essential thing is not so much the soccer, but rather that
through soccer they learn that life is the most valuable thing we
have,'' the elder Escobar told The Associated Press.
	   But the call for sanity by the elder Escobar, whose son was
killed outside a Medellin bar after an argument about the fateful
goal, is up against a mountain of expectations and the lure of big
money.
	   It remains to be seen whether Colombia, and its fans, are more
prepared than they were four years ago to deal with defeat. There
may be no other choice for a team that has played poorly going into
the World Cup, not winning a game all year.
	   ``Nobody is pressuring us to be world champions. It is
understood that we're not ready for that yet,'' coach Hernan Dario
Gomez said recently.
	   Nevertheless, Gomez and one of his players, Victor Hugo
Aristizabal, received telephoned death threats last month before
departing for France.
	   The coach has been trying to lower expectations ever since.

Soccer's not the same for family of slain player 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Colombia-Star-Crossed Soccer

<TEXT>
	   MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) _ For Dario Escobar, the World Cup is
synonymous with sorrow.
	   The proud father watched in horror four years ago when his son,
a star defender on the Colombian national team, deflected a
crossing pass into his own net, contributing to a 2-1 loss to the
United States which eliminated a much-touted Colombia from the 1994
World Cup.
	   Five days later, as the tournament continued, drunks insulted
27-year-old Andres Escobar outside a Medellin bar. A gunman pumped
six bullets into the athlete's chest. The country and the world
condemned a senseless killing. And little changed.
	   Today, Dario Escobar keeps his son's memory alive in scrapbooks
and through social work.
	   He has tried to convert a heinous crime into a parable for
soccer fanatics and impressionable youth, speaking against violence
and founding two soccer schools that teach poor kids that winning
isn't everything.
	   Colombians in New York and London have also founded soccer
schools bearing the name of his slain son, he says.
	   But a bitter Escobar says the moral is lost on too many of his
countrymen, including whomever made death threats against a coach
and a team member now in France.
	   ``Nothing has been assimilated,'' he told The Associated Press
at his Medellin apartment Thursday. ``We can't sing victory yet.''
	   Meanwhile, the sport will never be the same for the
soccer-loving Escobars.
	   After the shooting, Andres' older brother Santiago quit the
game, ending a 14-year professional career. He now coaches a youth
team.
	   Dario Escobar visits his son's grave now and then, and it has
become a local landmark.
	   But he hasn't been to a soccer stadium since he lost his son. He
says watching television this month is too much to handle.
	   ``I watch these World Cup games for a minute or two, but it
doesn't interest me like before,'' said Escobar. ``It brings back
bad memories.''

All-party Burundi peace talks begins in Tanzania Monday 
</HEADLINE>
By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Burundi's antagonistic main political
parties jointly meet Monday for the time to seek ways of ending the
spiral of violence that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives
in five years.
	   The talks, stalled for months, will be chaired by Tanzania's
former President Julius Nyerere. They are taking place amid hopes
for a cease-fire and lifting of sanctions imposed by regional
leaders.
	   ``There is a mood of ending ethnic war between the Tutsi-led
army and Hutu rebels,'' said a Nyerere aide on condition of not
being identified further.
	   At least 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have died since the
latest round of violence erupted in October 1993 after Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated the country's first democratically
elected president, a Hutu, in a failed coup.
	   Nyerere has threatened to call the talks off ``if the Burundians
are not serious this time'' and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
on Saturday urged all the parties to show a ``spirit of
cooperation.''
	   On Saturday, Burundi's President Pierre Buyoya expressed hope
seven regional leaders, who imposed the sanctions when he seized
power in 1996, would lift them.
	   ``We have done everything the leaders of the sub-region want,''
Buyoya said at the swearing-in ceremony of a new 22-member Cabinet.
	   Twelve of the ministers and one of two vice presidents are
Hutus. Although they make only 14 percent of Burundi's population
of 6 million, the Tutsi dominated the government, economy, academia
and the military.
	   The regional leaders imposed the sanctions to press Buyoya to
reinstate political parties and parliament and to negotiate a
workable political with all groups inside and outside the country.
	   Buyoya, who boycotted last year's talks, has reinstated
parliament and political parties and brokered a ``transitional
constitution'' that brought Hutus and Tutsis into government.
	   The parties at the talks are the Hutu-dominated FRODEBU and
Buyoya's UPRONA plus two extremist ones: the Tutsi-dominated PARENA
of former President Jean-Batiste Bagaza, and Hutu-led CNDD of
Leonard Nyangoma.
	   The CNDD fighters are currently battling government troops.
	   A Tanzanian foreign ministry official who spoke on conditions of
anonymity said Buyoya is counting not only on his latest political
agreement with other parties, but also on his earlier efforts to
democratize Burundi.
	   Buyoya, a Tutsi, ousted Bagaza in 1987 and instituted reforms
that led to the country's first democratic election in 1993.
	   He lost the election to Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, who was
assassinated three months later and the country plunged into
bloodletting.
	   Leaders of Kenya, Zambia, Uganda, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania and
the Democratic Republic of Congo were expected in Arusha to discuss
whether the sanctions they imposed should be lifted.

Russia's sale of nuclear reactor to India stands, official says 
</HEADLINE>
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Russia's planned sale of an atomic power
reactor to India will continue despite the five nuclear tests New
Delhi conducted last month, an Indian official said Sunday.
	   Russia had renewed an agreement last year to sell India two
1,000-megawatt reactors for dlrs 1 billion each. The agreement was
first signed in 1988 but was postponed by Russia following the
disintegration of the Soviet Union.
	   ``A Russian scientific team led by Energy Minister Yevegeny
Adamov will shortly visit India to finalize the deal,'' Rajagopalan
Chidambaram, chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission, was
quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency.
	   The plants will be located in Kudankulam in the southern state
of Tamil Nadu and will be monitored by the International Atomic
Energy Agency, he said.
	   Russia will supply enriched fuel for the lifetime of the
proposed lightwater reactor, PTI quoted Chidambaram as saying.
	   Last year U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel told
the U.S. Congress that Russian exports of nuclear power reactors or
missile-related equipment and technology to India would be of
concern. But Moscow told New Delhi their bilateral cooperation was
not open to comment by a third country.
	   India's 10 nuclear power plants together produce 1,700 megawatts
of power, Chidambaram said. The Indian government has said it wants
to increase its nuclear power capability tenfold in the next 25
years because of an acute power shortage hampering its economic
development.
	   Chidambaram was speaking at the inauguration of Rajasthan Atomic
Power Station-2.
	   India exploded five underground nuclear devices in the desert
last month, prompting neighboring Pakistan to retaliate with six
nuclear tests a few weeks later.
	   The tests were widely condemned by nuclear powers and
industrialized nations but hailed by many poor countries. The
United States, Japan, Germany and several other nations imposed
economic and political sanctions on India and Pakistan.
	   Friday, the world's eight leading industrial powers meeting in
London agreed to postpone all development loans to both nations.

World Cup: Zagallo's team trains to face ``Brazilian-style'' Morocco 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ How would Brazil play Brazil?
	   Coach Mario Zagallo faced the question as he readied his team
this week for its game Tuesday against Morocco, a team he says
plays ``Brazilian style soccer.''
	   The answer? Just the way most opponents play Brazil, with tight
marking, a full-field press, counterstrikes and an aerial
bombardment to exploit a questionable defense.
	   It's hardly classic Brazil. But Zagallo has great respect for
Morocco, which tied favored Norway 2-2 in their first game. He
thinks the Africans are the toughest adversary in Group A.
	   ``Morocco has a Brazilian style of soccer, with touches,
give-and-go passes and speed,'' he said. ``It will be difficult. We
can't match their pace, because we're not in ideal physical shape
yet.''
	   While African teams have long impressed more for stamina than
for tactics, team coordinator Zico said Brazil shouldn't expect the
Moroccans to run themselves ragged.
	   ``It's not random running around. It all has a purpose, to
surprise at the final moment with a creative solution,'' he said.
``Morocco had a great game with Norway, and if the defense hadn't
made some mistakes they could have won.''
	   If it's true that a good offense is the best defense, Morocco
could play Brazil toe-to-toe, said Zico.
	   ``They have good players up front, and Brazil has to be alert
and not get surprised,'' he said. ``We have to work the ball, take
advantage of defensive lapses and not let them create _ especially
No. 7, Hadji.''
	   El-Moustafa Hadji, who plays for Deportivo de La Coruna of the
Spanish first division, was the standout on his team against
Norway. But Brazilians know the team has many weapons.
	   ``They don't have one player we can stop and neutralize the
offense,'' said midfielder Cesar Sampaio. ``Their speed is
impressive and they overlap well, with constant rotation.''
	   So the players spent the week improving their stamina and
compacting the defense, which showed gaping holes in Brazil's
opening day 2-1 win over Scotland.
	   ``Morocco attacks quickly, so we have to be well positioned,''
said defender Roberto Carlos. ``Brazil has to open its eyes,
because they could cause problems.''
	   Meanwhile, attackers practiced free kicks and corner kicks to
try to surprise Moroccan goalie Driss Benzekri.
	   ``I've trained so much my leg is sore,'' said Bebeto, who scored
an ``Olympic goal'' _ a goal off a corner kick _ during practice
Saturday. ``If it comes down to free kicks or corners, I'm ready.''

World Cup: Despite putting on great show, not all is well in French camp 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Hold that euphoria. With a growing
list of injuries to the strikeforce, the French team seeks to cool
the host nation's enthusiasm after a great opening World Cup game.
	   Starting forward Stephane Guivarc'h, who injured his knee in
France's 3-0 win over South Africa, is certainly lost for
Thursday's second Group C game against Saudi Arabia and is
uncertain beyond that.
	   To make matters worse for coach Aime Jacquet, David Trezeguet, a
possible substitute for Guivarc'h, injured his already tender right
ankle in a scrimmage late Saturday and will be troubled for at
least a couple of days.
	   ``We have to make sure nobody else in that position gets hurt,''
Jacquet said.
	   But there is hope Guivarc'h will have recovered enough for the
last first-round game against Denmark June 24. ``I expect to be
there,'' he said.
	   ``There is not too much damage to Guivarc'h. It's a small alert
and he'll be back,'' Jacquet said.
	   Guivarc'h left the South Africa match after only 26 minutes when
he injured himself desperately trying to reach a cross in the
goalmouth.
	   Trezeguet has a history of brittle ankles.
	   ``The pain will stay during the whole World Cup,'' he said.
``But my next match is Thursday and I want to be there,'' he said.
	   Team captain Didier Deschamps tried to put the injuries in
perspective. ``It's especially Stephane's injury. The others don't
worry me.'' he said.
	   Upon their return from Marseille to their training camp, Jacquet
wants to use the peace and quiet of their forest retreat southwest
of Paris to replace the euphoria of the first match with the
realism of the task ahead.
	   ``Enjoy this moment now, but as of tonight we'll concentrate
again because we have to continue on our long way,'' the coach
said.
	   After Saudi Arabia lost to Denmark 1-0, the Asian qualifier
already faces a do-or-die match against the French at the Stade de
France Thursday. It will be no easy task for France.
	   Because of the injuries, the team that finished the game in
Marseille is now expected to start against Saudi Arabia on
Thursday.

Spain's Checa wins Madrid Grand Prix, Doohan doesn't finish 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos MAD101-102
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Carlos Checa charged around the
Jarama circuit in Madrid to win Sunday's 500 c.c. class motorcycle
Grand Prix race that saw defending world champion Michael Doohan
retire after a fall in the fourth lap.
	   The Spaniard's victory over the 30 laps of the 3.85-kilometer
(2.3-mile) circuit delighted the 60,000 capacity crowd watching the
return of the Grand Prix to Madrid after an absence of five years.
	   Checa, clocking an average speed of 146.33 km per hour (90.93
mph) covered the course in 47 minutes 21.513 seconds, just 0.22
seconds ahead of Norifumi Abe of Japan and 1.886 clear of
third-placed compatriot Sete Gibernau.
	   Doohan, who started off in pole position, came off his bike
after bumping into Italian Max Biaggi. Biaggi stayed in the race to
finish at No. 6, just behind Spain's Alex Criville whose own hopes
of victory were crushed after he too was temporarily forced off the
track.
	   With Six of the 15 FIM World Championship tour completed,
Criville remains at the top of the standings with 103 points, five
ahead of Biaggi, eight clear of Checa and a full 13 above Doohan.
	   In the 250 c.c. class, Tetsuya Harada of Japan completed the 28
lap course 8.738 seconds clear of fellow countryman Tohru Harada
and 15.978 ahead of Italian Loris Capirossi at No. 3.
	   Harada's domination was aided by a race plagued by incidents
involving his closest rivals, including Capirossi and fellow
Italian Valentino Rossi who was forced to retire.
	   Harada is now atop the standings with 104 points compared to
Capirossi's 90.
	   Earlier in the day, Italy's Lucio Cecchinello claimed victory in
the 125 c.c. class completing the 26 laps at an average speed of
138.152 km per hour (85.85 miles).
	   Fellow countryman Marco Melandri and Japan's Hiruyuki Kicuchi
came in just over nine seconds behind at No. 2 and No. 3.
	   Cecchinello's win took him to fifth position in the overall
standings, but still 58 points behind the leader Kazuto Sakata of
Japan who finished the Jarama race at No. 4.

Even top Palestinian peace maker warns clock is ticking on accord 
</HEADLINE>
By NICOLAS B. TATRO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the
Palestinian legislative council who is better known as Abu Alaa,
has another nickname, as well: ``Mr. Peace.''
	   He took the lead in negotiating the Olso accords, and now is
deeply involved in efforts to rescue the flagging Mideast peace
process.
	   Qureia, who has reportedly held secret meetings recently with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said hopes for peace
aren't dead _ but the clock is ticking.
	   The Oslo accords set May 4, 1999, as the deadline for concluding
a final peace agreement. Palestinians, he said, will declare an
independent state in less than 11 months if the deadlock is not
resolved.
	   ``In the early morning of the 5th of May, 1999, I think we
should declare our own Palestinian state on the ground,'' Qureia
said Sunday in an interview with The Associated Press.
	   ``We will ask the world at that time to help us put an end to
the occupation of the land.''
	   Such warnings, echoed by other Palestinian leaders as well, seem
real. Declaring a state would relieve Yasser Arafat, president of
the Palestinian Authority, of the need to make unpopular
compromises on sensitive issues such as the future of Jerusalem,
the fate of Jewish settlements or the return of millions of
refugees.
	   The move, however, could invite reprisals from Israel, which
views the creation of a Palestinian state as a threat to its
security. Netanyahu has hinted, for example, that Israel might move
to annex West Bank land in response.
	   The balding 59-year-old Qureia, who rose to power as the PLO's
top money manager, is the first among equals in the 88-member
Palestinian legislative council, which was elected in 1996. He is
also the man who would take over, in the interim at least, if
anything happened to Arafat.
	   Qureia's fame, however, stems from the months of secret
negotiations with Israeli officials in Norway that led to the
famous handshake on the White House lawn in 1993 between Arafat and
the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
	   He sees Netanyahu's strategy as holding on to as much land as
possible now in order to have leverage in final status talks and to
expand settlements in the West Bank and take over houses in the
area of Jerusalem that Palestinians want for the capital of a
state.
	   ``I think we lost the spirit (of peacemaking), and I think we
are in this crisis because of the Israeli attempt to dictate the
outcome. That is the problem. The dictation,'' said Qureia.
	   According to Palestinian sources, Qureia's recent meeting with
Netanyahu resulted in a misunderstanding about whether Palestinians
would accept Israel's proposal to forego a so-called third
withdrawal - one beyond the 13.1 percent U.S. proposal now on the
table.
	   In the interview at his office in Ramallah, Qureia said the
Palestinians would not forego the idea of a further pullback as
Israel wants because they need an ``ace in the hole'' in case
negotiators are unable to agree on a final settlement.
	   But as a compromise, the Palestinians have proposed a joint
Israeli-Palestinian committee to determine the size of a third
withdrawal while parallel talks are held on the bigger final status
issues: Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, refugees and borders, Qureai
said. If the negotiations failed, then the Palestinians would
insist on implementation of the third withdrawal.
	   ``If we succeed on the permanent agreement, then we don't need
it,'' said Qureia.
	   He said Palestinians expected 90 percent of the West Bank to be
in their hands, and final status talks to deal with the remaining
10 percent. If the U.S. proposal is approved, Palestinians will
have control over some 40 percent of the area.
	   Qureia accused Israel of ``wasting time'' and said Netanyahu was
using delaying tactics, such as his proposal to hold a nationwide
Israeli referendum on whether to agree to the U.S. plan. The idea
of a nationwide vote is still undecided.
	   Israeli officials say Arafat has failed to uphold his side of
the bargain by cutting off security cooperation and refusing to
crack down on Islamic militants. They also complain that
Palestinian leaders and official media still advocate violence.
	   Qureia rejects the criticism, saying the Palestinian Authority
succeeded in convincing Palestinians to accept the peace accords.
	   ``We made a real psychological breakthrough in the Palestinian
mind set. If you ask a Palestinian if he will accept two states on
the land he will say yes. Before that he would not,'' said Qureia.
	   Asked about reports that Arafat had asked the main Islamic group
Hamas to join his self-rule government, Qureia said he doubted
Hamas would join and insisted the Palestinians would take all
necessary security measures to guard the peace.
	   It is Israel, he asserted, that is violating the ``language of
peace'' by taking over houses in Jerusalem and expanding
settlements in the West Bank.
	   ``Israel is still acting like an occupier with land
confiscation, house demolitions, and arresting people,'' he said.
	   ``These are the real violations.''

Shroud showing in Turin closes; next time 2000 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ A group of Sri Lankan immigrants who live in
Milan were the last visitors Sunday to see the mysterious Shroud of
Turin, which will be put away from public eyes until August 2000.
	   Since the linen, which many believe had wrapped the body of
Jesus after his crucifixion, went on display in Turin's cathedral
April 18, some 2.4 million people came to gaze at the cloth.
	   Among the VIPs was Pope John Paul II, who knelt in silent prayer
before the bulletproof display case last month. He urged scientists
to do more testing of the linen. Experts can't explain how the
cloth's faded image of a bearded man was made.
	   Results of carbon-14 testing 10 years ago indicated the cloth
dated to the 13th or 14th century, but some say contamination might
have skewed the results.
	   The shroud will be back on display here Aug. 26-Oct. 22 2000 as
part of Holy Year celebrations.
	   Most of the faithful had reservations but some 300,000 people,
like the dozen Sri Lankans, just showed up and were allowed to join
the lines of the public snaking through the Royal Gardens next to
the cathedral side entrance.
	   After a closing Mass by Turin's cardinal, the cathedral's doors
were to be shut to the public for several days so the cloth, which
is kept in a controlled temperature, can be transferred to a new
location. Just where was being kept secret for now for security
reasons.
	   The current showing coincided with several anniversaries,
including the 100th anniversary of the first photograph of the
cloth.

Argentina downs Japan; English fans clash with police violence, Maradona staying home; WILL be UPDATED with Yugoslavia-Iran and Croatia-Jamaica AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Argentina-Japan quotes, more on Marseille
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Japan, the first of three nations making World Cup
debuts Sunday, gave a valiant effort before falling to Argentina,
while police stepped up security following the tournament's first
violence involving English fans.
	   Gabriel Batistuta scored in the 28th minute to give Group H
favorite Argentina a 1-0 victory in rainswept conditions at
Toulouse.
	   ``It is very unfortunate that we could not score a goal. I
believe results count at the World Cup,'' said Japanese coach
Takeshi Okada, choked with emotion. ``The goal we allowed was
inevitable. Our players were aggressive and positive.''
	   Japan, co-host of the 2002 finals, created a string of scoring
chances but lacked the finishing touch necessary to compete with
the best teams in the world.
	   ``I think we were able to play as equals,'' defender Naoki Soma
said. ``We're almost there, and we'd shoot but we couldn't score.''
	   Although they didn't dominate as much as expected, Argentina is
now expected to cruise into the second round in perhaps the softest
group in the tournament.
	   ``There are things we can improve,'' midfielder Diego Simeone
said. ``But the order of the day was to win, and we did.''
	   Later Sunday, newcomers Croatia and Jamaica played in Lens, and
Yugoslavia and Iran _ two countries back in the World Cup following
politically-related absences _ met in Saint Etienne. Yugoslavia was
banned from the 1994 World Cup because of international sanctions,
while Iran's once-formidable soccer program took a downturn after
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Iran's preparations took a unique turn Saturday night when its
players held a three-hour religious mourning ceremony at the time
many teams would be getting a good night's sleep before a game.
	   Players beat their chests and wept as a religious teacher
recounted the death of a 7th century Shiite Muslim saint in what is
now modern day Iraq.
	   The ritual ended around midnight, about the same time that some
200 English fans were causing trouble in Marseille.
	   The violence broke out when a motorist who was blocked for
several minutes by dancing English fans tried to push his way
through, police said. His car struck and slightly injured an
English fan, setting off a melee involving some 200 fans who
showered police and their vehicles with bottles and cans.
	   At least one gendarme was hospitalized with a head injury. Four
English fans were arrested.
	   As a result, authorities stepped up security immediately in the
southern French town, with about 1,900 police patrolling the city
ahead of England's first-round match against Tunisia on Monday
night.
	   By Sunday, however, a festive atmosphere had returned to
Marseille, its beaches filled with tourists, locals and topless
sunbathers.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton, England, with his brother.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Also Sunday, French organizers said they had filed a complaint
against agents and tour operators allegedly involved in the World
Cup ticket scandal.
	   None of the groups involved in the filing were identified, but
Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the organizing committee, said the
panel was adamant about prosecuting anyone who sold bogus tickets.
	   ``We are going to court and an investigation will be carried
out,'' he said.
	   Thousands of fans worldwide have been left without tickets that
had been promised to them or for which they had paid. French
prosecutors said Saturday they would investigate criminal charges
against businesses and individuals involved in ticket fraud.
	   One prominent name who does have some tickets on hold has
decided not to show. Diego Maradona announced Sunday he will not
fly to France, at least for the time being, because he was
``depressed'' by his court sentence for a 1994 shooting incident.
	   Maradona, who was scheduled to be a television commentator for
an Argentine television station, received a 34-month suspended
sentence last week for a 1994 shooting incident involving four
journalists. He was convicted of assault with an air rifle.
	   ``I feel very depressed and not inclined to take a decision on
covering the World Cup as a TV commentator, at least for the time
being'', Maradona told a Buenos Aires radio station.

	   ZAHLE, Lebanon (AP) _ Residents in eastern Lebanon voted Sunday
in municipal elections that pit the Christian president against his
son in the region's biggest town, where they are backing rival
tickets.
	   About 4,000 soldiers, backed by armor, deployed in sweltering
heat on major roads and town squares in the Bekaa Valley, the last
region to vote in the four-stage elections.
	   Preliminary results in the election to fill 1,879 city and town
council posts were expected as early as Monday.
	   The elections, which were held for the first time in 35 years,
marked a milestone in Lebanon's recovery after the 1975-90 civil
war between its Christian and Muslim communities.
	   Unlike previous rounds, Sundays vote was not a Christian-Muslim
competition.
	   It's Christians against Christians in Zahle, Bekaa's provincial
capital, and Shiite Muslims versus Shiite Muslims in Baalbek, which
was a hotbed of militants who kidnapped Westerners during the civil
war.
	   President Elias Hrawi backed a slate of candidates for the
21-seat council in the family's hometown of Zahle, Lebanon's
largest Christian city with 130,000 residents.
	   But George Hrawi, the president's elder son, endorsed the ticket
of his father's rival, lawmaker Elie Skaff.
	   George Hrawi, who shied away from politics until recently,
angrily waved a bundle of cash at reporters Sunday and accused
opponents of buying votes.
	   Skaff told The Associated Press that ``the president is
personally intervening'' against him in the election.
	   Their rivals denied vote-buying and the president proclaimed
neutrality.
	   ``The state is not a party ... I will be the first to
congratulate whoever wins,'' Elias Hrawi told reporters after
casting his vote.
	   Some newspapers have said the Zahle race could have a bearing on
the president's political future. Elias Hrawi's term expires in
November.
	   In predominantly Shiite Baalbek, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
and the pro-Syrian Amal group of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri
battled for control of the 21-seat municipal council.
	   The mainstream Amal lost ground in last week's vote in southern
Lebanon to Hezbollah, which has capitalized on a successful
guerrilla war against Israel in the south. Hezbollah is challenging
Berri for leadership of the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest
single sect.
	   Mohammed Awada, a 22-year-old student in Baalbek, voted for
Hezbollah because he wants improved services in the impoverished
region.
	   ``Hezbollah has built a hospital and a school in Baalbek. It is
the only party that helps sick people and children of needy people
enroll in schools,'' he said.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat discussed Sunday a U.S. proposal for Israeli
troops withdrawal from the West Bank to restart the Middle East
peace process.
	   Mubarak will raise the subject with Arab leaders within the next
few days, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said without
elaborating.
	   Israeli-Palestinian talks are deadlocked over Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to accept a U.S mediation
proposal that calls for Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have agreed.
	   ``The Palestinian stance is that it's over, because the Israeli
side is only moving now in an attempt ... to go around with the
elements of the U.S. proposal,'' Moussa said. ``This is what the
Palestinians don't accept.''
	   Moussa described Israel's decision to arm settlers as a ``call
for violence and the use of violence. When Israeli extremists are
supported militarily, you cannot blame the other side if they want
to defend themselves.''
	   Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have failed to
make any progress since March 1997 when Israel began building 6,500
housing units for Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Arafat, who did not speak to reporters, arrived in Cairo early
Sunday and left for the Gaza Strip later in the day.

Businessman's son held a week freed by police, ransom recovered 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ The son of a German businessman who had
been missing for a week was freed unharmed Sunday when police
stormed a house in Hamburg's Harvestehude district where he was
being held.
	   Police said 24-year-old Bodo Janssen had been held by the
kidnappers since June 6 and that a 33-year-old acquaintance of his
was arrested as an alleged accessory to the kidnapping.
	   A Yugoslav man guarding Janssen at the house was overpowered
about 11:30 a.m. by police and arrested.
	   Shortly thereafter, police recovered most of the 3 million marks
(dlrs 1.8 million) in ransom that had been paid to a contact in
Klagenfurt, Austria on Friday, police said. The money was found
when two other Yugoslavs suspects were arrested on a train from
Klagenfurt to Vienna.
	   Police said they believe another Yugoslav man and woman also
suspected in the case escaped back to their home country Saturday
with a part of the ransom.

Architect Lucio Costa dies at 96 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Lucio Costa, an architect and
urban planner who helped design the capital of Brasilia, died
Saturday at the age of 96.
	   Helena Costa said her father died in his Rio apartment after
eating breakfast in bed on Saturday.
	   Costa gained nationwide fame when he designed the capital of
Brasilia with architect Oscar Niemeyer in 1957.
	   Cristovam Buarque, governor of the federal district, which
surrounds Brasilia, declared three days of mourning for Costa.
	   ``He is one of the few Brazilian names known this century
throughout the world,'' he said.
	   Costa was born in France in 1902, but lived most of his life in
Brazil.
	   He will be buried Sunday, his family announced.
	   Costa is survived by two daughters and three grand children.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Swaddled in traditional gauzy white,
tears streaming down their faces, hundreds of barefoot women prayed
for peace Sunday at the country's biggest Eritrean Orthodox church.
	   The sons, husbands and brothers of many were locked in a deadly
border conflict with Ethiopian forces.
	   ``I pray, `Please come back, my baby,''' said Hiwat, mother of a
28-year-old sent to the front.
	   Most of the women and men at the dawn service had already lived
through one of Africa's civil longest wars, between Ethiopia's
former Marxist government and Eritrean and Ethiopian rebels. After
just seven years of peace, they wanted no more war.
	   ``The people want peace,'' said priest Ghebreamlak Tsegazeab.
``War will not solve our problems. Our two peoples pray to the same
God. We speak the same language. We were once friends, and we will
be again.''
	   Diplomats on Sunday were urging Eritrea and Ethiopia to stop air
raids on each other's territory as a first step toward ending their
confrontation, said Italian envoy Rino Serri.
	   ``The friendship between these two countries is fundamental for
the stabilization of the entire area of the Horn of Africa and of
the entire continent,'' he said.
	   Serri met with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki late Saturday
before flying Sunday to the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.
	   ``A cessation of air raids is a partial aspect of a cessation of
hostilities, and that's what we want,'' said Isaias' spokesman
Yemane Gebremeskel. There was no immediate comment from the
Ethiopians.
	   Other diplomatic efforts are in the works. A team of five
leaders appointed by the Organization of African Unity plans to
begin a mission later in the week; and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak is trying to arrange a ceasefire, according to Eritrean
foreign minister Haile Woldensae.
	   Although no skirmishes have been reported since Thursday,
hundreds have died in tank and artillery battles on three fronts
since early May.
	   Bombing raids have killed at least 48 civilians in two attacks
on northern Ethiopia, and four people in two attacks on a
military-civilian airport on the outskirts of the Eritrean capital
Asmara.
	   Commercial flights to Asmara have been halted since June 5.
Ships have hovered off the coast, fearing the Ethiopians would bomb
the port of Massawa as they did during Eritrea's 30-year war for
independence.
	   Eritrea has complained bitterly to international officials about
the effective air and sea blockade.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after helping
rebels end 17 years of Marxist rule there in 1991.
	   Many of the people who came to St. Mary's Church to pray amid
clouds of incense, and others who went to a downtown cafe to sip
sweet tea, were more confused than angered by the border conflict.
	   ``With war, whether you win or lose, you lose. We've worked so
hard to rebuild our country. We don't want to lose that progress
now,'' said a civil engineer who gave his name only as Yebio.
	   But most Eritreans, honed by 30 years of struggle for
independence, said they are ready to do their government's bidding.
	   ``The most important part of my life is my country,'' said
Dashim Mesgina, a 32-year-old singer who was composing lyrics for a
patriotic song at the cafe. ``Without a country, there is no life,
no religion, no family, no anything.''

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A major black opposition
leader jump-started campaigning for the 1999 elections Sunday,
attacking President Nelson Mandela's party at a rally for failing
to deliver on its promises.
	   Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi told 2,000
followers, some carrying traditional Zulu shields and spears, in
downtown Johannesburg that for his part, he would make no promises
he could not keep.
	   ``I cannot promise that I alone, the IFP alone, or anybody
alone, can save South Africa from the many problems threatening
it,'' Buthelezi declared.
	   Even though Mandela hasn't set an election date yet, the
gathering had every appearance of a campaign rally. IFP policy
manuals and T-shirts emblazoned with the party's new symbol, a
family of elephants, were distributed at the rally in a plaza
fronting the public library.
	   There is little doubt Mandela's African National Congress will
win the nation's second all-race elections, but the party is
vulnerable for unfulfilling some campaign promises, chief among
them one to build a million homes for poor blacks by 1999. Less
than half have been built.
	   ``I do not believe that people can be fooled for long,''
Buthelezi chided. ``Whoever tried to fool the people cannot be
excused.''
	   The ANC is also vulnerable because it is faced with the huge
task of dramatically improving the lives of millions of formerly
disenfranchised South Africans with a limited budget. Buthelezi hit
that point, saying voters' lives have improved little since the
1994 elections which marked the demise of apartheid.
	   ``Our political liberation has become a portentous
achievement,'' Buthelezi said. ``But final liberation must come one
day when the majority of our people will no longer be enslaved
under the yoke of poverty, unemployment, ignorace for lack of
education, and lack of essential services.''
	   Buthelezi's attacks on the ANC's first term in government
mirrored complaints from the National Party, which had ruled under
apartheid until losing the 1994 elections.
	   Crime and corruption have soared out of control, said Buthelezi,
wearing a business suit and flanked by IFP leaders.
	   Buthelezi serves as Home Affairs Minister in the government. The
ANC may well try to woo his party's support if it appears it will
fall short of winning a crucial two-thirds majority in parliament,
needed to pass legislation.
	   But Buthelezi warned such cooperation was not to be taken for
granted. Referring to his party's symbol, he said: ``Let it be
known that this elephant does not wish to carry anybody's political
luggage, nor does it wish to piggy-back on anyone else.''
	   At a party meeting Sunday, the ANC exhorted its officials to
ensure voters sympathetic with the party are registered.
	   ``We stand a chance to achieve a two-thirds majority to
consolidate our non-racial democracy if our people all go to vote
in 1999,'' ANC official Dumisani Makhaye said in Pietermaritzburg,
400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Johannesburg.
	   Inkatha nearly boycotted 1994's first all-race elections, then
won 11 percent of the seats in Parliament.
	   Notwithstanding Buthelezi's serving in the ANC-led government,
the parties remain bitter rivals. More than 10,000 people have died
in fighting between ANC and IFP supporters in KwaZulu-Natal, a
province dominated by Inkatha, over the past decade.

World Cup: Batistuta strike gives Argentina 1-0 win Soma 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes from coaches Okada, Passarella; Japanese player
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Japan found out about the World Cup the
hard way.
	   The rookie qualifiers, who co-host the finals next time up in
2002, created a string of chances against two-time champion
Argentina Sunday but allowed gifted star striker Gabriel Batistuta
the only goal of the game in a 1-0 loss.
	   Japanese midfielder Hiroshi Nanami lost possession in his own
area in the 28th minute and the Fiorentina striker, one of the
superstars of world soccer, ran clear to prod the ball past exposed
'keeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi.
	   It was a cruel goal for the World Cup first-timers to concede
after a promising opening in which they created the better chances
but couldn't get the ball on target.
	   ``It is very unfortunate that we could not score a goal. I
believe results count at the World Cup,'' said Japanese coach
Takeshi Okada, choked with emotion. ``The goal we allowed was
inevitable. Our players were aggressive and positive.''
	   Argentine coach Daniel Passarella, who captained Argentina to
its first World Cup title in 1978, said he was relieved to have won
the opener.
	   ``It's important to win the first one. It's always hardest to
win the first one,'' he said.
	   Argentine captain Diego Simeone was happy with the victory.
	   ``Well, we're satisfied because we won, which is the main
thing,'' he said. ``Besides that, there are things we can improve.
	   ``From 20 minutes on Argentina played very well. I think maybe
in the second half the urge to win held us back a bit,'' the Inter
Milan midfielder said. ``But the order of the day was to win and we
did.''
	   Japan's first ever shot in the World Cup finals came after only
two minutes but Motohiro Yamaguchi's 30-meter (yard) drive was
several meters wide.
	   In the 13th minute the debutantes got closer when Nanami floated
the ball forward into the Argentina area and Naoki Soma got clear
of Javier Zanetti. Soma climbed well to meet the pass but headed
too high with only goalkeeper Carlos Roa to beat.
	   ``I think we were able to play as equals,'' Soma said. ``We're
almost there, and we'd shoot but we couldn't score.''
	   When Argentina conceded a free kick 22 meters from goal midway
through the first half, Hidetoshi Nakata curled the ball just wide
of the target.
	   Argentina's first shot on target came in the 25th minute when
Ariel Ortega released Claudio Lopez on the left and the Valencia
striker's left footed shot was confidently saved by 'keeper
Kawaguchi.
	   Batistuta had a free kick blocked and Juan Veron's follow up
shot flew just over and then the period of Argentina pressure
brought success in the 28th minute.
	   A through ball should have been cleared by Nanami just inside
the Japanese area but it squirmed away from him and went straight
into Batistuta's path. The striker known as ``Batigol'' had the
simple task of chipping the ball past the advancing 'keeper into
the net.
	   It was almost 2-0 in the 37th minute when Batistuta flicked a
long-range header against the post, Lopez dived to head the rebound
goalward from eight meters r against the post, Lopez dived to head
the rebound goalward from eight meters but 'keeper Kawaguchi
recovered to save.
	   Ten minutes into the second half, Nakata went on a determined
run at the Argentina defense but his final low shot from a good
position was well wide.
	   Japan sent on its Brazilian born forward Wagner Lopes to try and
conjure an equalizer but Argentine 'keeper Roa still had little to
do.
	   But Kawaguchi rescued his team with two reaction saves in the
70th minute, beating out a close range prod by Simeone and then
recovering to smother the follow up shot from substitute Abel
Balbo.
	   Six minutes from the end, Japan almost snatched a leveler when
Akita climbed above Simeone to head across the face of the
Argentine goal, Soma just failing to connect as he slid in at the
far post.
	   The Japanese went close again in injury time when Lopes
connected with a right wing cross but his goal-bound strike was
deflected by an Argentine leg for a corner.
	   Lineups:
	   Argentina _ Carlos Roa; Roberto Ayala, Roberto Sensini (Jose
Chamot 74th), Javier Zanetti, Nelson Vivas; Matias Almeyda, Diego
Simeone, Juan Veron, Ariel Ortega; Claudio Lopez (Abel Balbo,
62nd), Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Japan _ Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi; Akira Narahashi, Masami Ihara,
Eisuke Nakanishi, Yutaka Akita, Naoki Soma (Takashi Hirano, 86th);
Hiroshi Nanami, Hidetoshi Nakata, Motohiro Yamaguchi; Shoji Jo,
Masashi Nakayama (Wagner Lopes, 68th).

Rain again washes out play in DFS Classic 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Washed out Sunday for the second
straight day, frustrated officials of the DFS Classic grass-court
tournament will attempt to play semifinals and finals on Monday.
	   All-day rain wiped out all play Saturday.
	   On Sunday, the semifinal pair of Steffi Graf and Nathalie
Tauziat played briefly with Tauziat taking a 3-0 lead before rain
struck again. The other semifinal pair of Elena Likhovtseva vs.
Yayuk Basuki did not begin.
	   Organizers will try playing Monday on grass but may be forced
indoors to complete the tournament.
	   Graf, who celebrated her 29th birthday Sunday, is playing only

injuries. She has won six of seven sets in Birmingham en route to

U.S. cartoon fights rising drug addiction in Poland 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Both state Television channels and some
private stations simultaneously aired on Sunday a U.S. cartoon
campaigning against drugs, in a nationwide action against rising
addiction in Poland.
	   The 30-minute Mystery of the Lost Purse was the highlight of the
campaign going on in the media. It featured Mickey Mouse, the
Smurfs, Winnie the Pooh and other popular cartoon characters.
	   Drug addiction has been drastically rising among teenagers in
Poland since early last year, with dealers reaching school
children.
	   Some 15,000 addicts seeking cures are registered, but experts
say the total number of addicts could be close to 100,000.
	   With the lifting of borders in the early 1990s, Poland became a
major transit country for drug dealers from Asia and the Middle
East.

World Cup: Spain sets about healing wounds 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ With no one sure what exactly went
wrong, Spain was scrambling Sunday to heal its wounds after a
stinging defeat by Nigeria.
	   After a two-hour training session at its base just north of
Paris, coach Javier Clemente gave the team the rest of the day and
Monday off to let things settle and recharge team spirits.
	   ``We're fine,'' said shaven-headed FC Barcelona midfielder Luis
Enrique Martinez. ``It's a new day and what happened yesterday is
water under the bridge.''
	   But, for many, Saturday's startling 3-2 come-from-behind victory
by Nigeria won't be forgotten for a long time. Spain, one of the
tournament's favorites, controlled the game for 70 minutes; now
they are in last place in Group D with passage into the next round
an uphill battle.
	   ``It's not a case of explanations,'' said striker Kiko Narvaez.
``Seeing the game on TV last night, it's clear we played a lot
better than some people out there are saying, and if we play like
that again we'll certainly get through to the next round.''
	   Spain next faces Paraguay in Saint-Etienne on Friday, followed
by a game against Bulgaria in Lens on June 24.
	   ``We have to work on the unity of the team, which is probably
its most important asset,'' Kiko said.
	   The defeat was just Spain's second in 35 outings and the first
time it has allowed three goals since Clemente took over in
mid-1992. After the practice session, Clemente refused to talk to
press and returned to the squad's hotel ahead of the players.
	   Meanwhile, Spain's leading daily El Pais joined the growing
group of critics of the 48-year-old Basque coach Sunday, saying the
defeat stemmed from his habit of playing players out of their
natural positions. It argued that born defenders like Fernando
Hierro and Miguel Angel Nadal were unable to command from midfield
when it was needed most.
	   Against Nigeria, Garba Lawal tied it at 2-2 in the 73rd minute
and Sunday Oliseh scored on a bullet of shot from outside of the
area five minutes later.
	   ``It's almost impossible that the next games will produce the
same type of circumstances of shots from 30 yards out or individual
mistakes,'' Kiko said.
	   The player associated with the biggest blunder was goalkeeper
Andonio Zubizarreta, who fumbled what was an apparent simple cross
by Lawal and pushed the ball into his own net.
	   Zubizarreta's teammates rallied round him Sunday, saying no one
was singularly responsible for the defeat.
	   Zubizarreta was taking it all in stride.
	   ``It was an obvious mistake and it hurt,'' said the 36-year-old,
graying keeper, who is expected to retire after this World Cup.
``Like all mistakes, you just accept them and try not repeat
them.''

Without tickets, fans wait outside World Cup stadium AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Yoko Taira might be the president of the
Hard Luck Club, with her 75 missing tickets, but so could any of
thousands of Japanese and Argentines crowded in desperation outside
the roaring stadium as their teams played inside.
	   Taira's story is just one of many.
	   A young interpreter living in Germany, she found an unofficial
ticket agent in Hamburg on the Internet. She paid about dlrs 300
each for 70 tickets for two tour groups from Japan, plus her own
and some for her friends.
	   ``The tickets were confirmed, so we paid,'' she said, standing
in the train station in a crowd of confused Japanese, waiting for
good news on her cell phone. ``Then he said he didn't get the
tickets in time, and we would find them in Toulouse.''
	   Taira held the assembly point flag to keep the little group of
35 together, while the tour leader was off in search of a miracle.
Black market tickets cost up to dlrs 2,000, driven up by Frenchmen
who bought scalper tickets so they could resell them.
	   All around, Japanese fans were all dressed up with no place to
go. One had painted his face white, with a round red circle around
his nose. It was an ingenious Japanese flag, although it also gave
him the air of a circus clown.
	   Meantime, thousands of Argentines, who came without tickets in
hopes of finding extras at a reasonable markup, stood by the
barriers outside the stadium with scrawled signs in French and
English pleading for tickets.
	   ``Hey, take me with you,'' one fan yelled in Spanish into the
windows of cars rolling into the parking lot. He was ready with a
huge blue and white flag, and a floppy hat striped in the same
colors.
	   Inside the stadium, all 37,000 seats were full, and the noise
was deafening. Japan played its first World Cup match ever.
Argentina, twice world champion, is hoping to go all the way again.
	   Each country was allotted 3,000 tickets, officially, but
thousands of diehard supporters found other sources. From the
thundering noise and agitated sea of waving blue and white, the
Argentines seemed most prevalent.
	   The Argentines, not known for their modesty in matters of
soccer, displayed a huge blue-and-white banner: ``Argentina,
without you there would be no football.''
	   Another banner saluted Diego Maradona, the retired national
hero. It read: ``There will be no equal. Ever.''
	   But fans cheered Gabriel Batistuta, a heartthrob with long blond
hair who Argentines declare is the world's best attacker. When he
booted the ball into an unguarded net for the only score, the roar
sounded as if he had just clinched the final.
	   Each time the Japanese blocked a goal or stole the ball,
however, an answering din arose to raise the curiosity _ and the
hackles _ of the Hard Luck Club outside.
	   Most people without tickets joined Toulouse townsfolk around
giant screens outside the stadium, on a little island in the
Garonne River. Argentina won by only 1-0, and both sides played an
often-sloppy game. But everyone wanted to be there.
	   As kickoff approached, Yoko Taira's cellphone had not rung, and
her disappointed charges prepared to settle for TV. Japan would
play at least two more games, and they would have another shot at
watching their team in the flesh.
	   ``What can you do?'' Taira asked. ``Those tickets were confirmed
by the agent. At least I hope we can get our money back.''

President of Kalmykia region plans to seek Russian presidency 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of the Kalmyk region in southern
Russia, Kirsan Yulimzhinov, said Sunday that he will seek the
Russian presidency in 2000.
	   Yulimzhinov is a billionaire who is also president of the
International Chess Federation. He made his announcement on a TV
interview program.
	   One of his first tasks will be raising his profile outside of
Kalmykia, a resource-rich region on the steppes of southern Russia.
	   Kalmyks came to the region from Central Asia about 400 years
ago. Most were deported by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1943 and
allowed to return only 14 years later. Many Kalmyks are Buddhists,
and Yulimzhinov has invited the Dalai Lama to make his home in
Kalmykia.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has repeatedly said he plans to step
down after his current term ends, but his aides have long been
hinting that the 67-year-old leader may run again.
	   The Russian constitution limits a president to two terms, but
aides have suggested that Yeltsin's first term may not count
because it began in Soviet times, before the new constitution was
passed.
	   Russia's constitutional court is expected to rule on the issue
later this year.
	   Other potential candidates include former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, and former national security chief Alexander
Lebed.

Two Jordanian air force pilots killed in helicopter crash 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Two pilots with the Royal Jordanian Air
Force were killed Sunday when their U.S.-made Hueys 500 helicopter
crashed during a training flight.
	   RAJF chief Maj. Gen. Mohammed Kheir Ababneh said the 11:40 a.m.
(0840 gmt) crash was caused by a technical failure and he ruled out
sabotage.
	   Maj. Maher Shriyedeh and Lt. Awni Shaabout were killed shortly
after their chopper went down an hour into a training flight over a
military zone, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital,
Amman, said Ababneh.
	   ``We sent seven reconnaissance planes out when we received an
urgent call for rescue from the two pilots, but their chopper went
down shortly before we got to them,'' Ababneh told The Associate
Press.
	   ``We don't know what exactly happened,'' he added.

World Cup: Dutch star suspended for two World Cup games after expulsion 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA banned Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert for two
World Cup games Sunday as punishment for his expulsion against
Belgium.
	   Kluivert was shown the red card for elbowing Lorenzo Staelens in
the chest in an off-the-ball incident during Saturday's 0-0 tie at
Saint-Denis.
	   The two-game ban means he misses the Netherlands' other Group E
games against South Korea in Marseille on Saturday and against
Mexico at Saint-Etienne June 25.
	   If the Dutch don't qualify for the second round, that would mean
Kluivert would take no further part in this World Cup.

English fans clash with police again; security heightened

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans clashed with
riot police in the Old Port for a second day Sunday, the eve of an
England-Tunisia match that has prompted beefed-up security.
	   Several hundred English soccer fans threw bottles and beer cans
at police in helmets and shields, who fired back with tear gas to
disperse the crowds. About 15 revelers were arrested, police said.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the new clash Sunday
afternoon. English fans pelted police overnight after a motorist
who tried to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one
of the fans.
	   Dozens of officers patrolled the port and down the Canebiere,
the city's main avenue, where sun-drenched cafes brimmed with
flag-waving English fans who chanted, drank and talked to the
locals throughout the day.
	   Beaches were filled with tourists, locals and topless
sunbathers. The British tabloid The Sun sent a topless orange
double-decker bus around town, with model-TV hostess Melinda
Messenger handing out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.
	   Vans of CRS and gendarmes stood ready in several Marseille
neighborhoods.

Disfiguring syndrome adds to some AIDS patients' misery AP Medical Writer 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo WX102
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Some AIDS patients are developing a bizarre
syndrome of disfiguring fat deposits on parts of their bodies as
their faces and limbs shrink to skin and bones _ possibly side
effects of lifesaving drugs called protease inhibitors.
	   Doctors' reports to the government paint a stark picture: Three
women looked like ``apples on a stick'' from the mound of stomach
and breast fat above birdlike legs. Another patient developed a
large hump on the nape of his neck. A woman jumped four sizes as
her waist barreled and her legs shrank.
	   The Food and Drug Administration is worried that the fat
deposits are more than a cosmetic problem: some patients also are
developing risks for heart disease such as skyrocketing
cholesterol. The FDA, AIDS researchers and drug companies are
scrambling for answers.
	   ``We don't want to alarm people, because we think the benefits
of protease inhibitors still outweigh the risks,'' said FDA medical
officer Jeff Murray. But, he said, ``We're concerned.''
	   A few patients reported the syndrome disabling enough to dismiss
doctors' protests and stop taking the medicines that have saved
thousands of lives since hitting the market 1-1/2 years ago. But
doctors say most understand that stopping protease inhibitors will
let the AIDS virus rebound.
	   ``What good is vanity if you're dead?'' asked Mark Estrop, 37,
of Atlanta, who has a 2-inch (5-centimeter)-deep hump. Still, ``I
can't raise (my head). I hit this hump thing.'' The fat now is
migrating under his chin, and his cholesterol level jumped to 538,
far beyond the healthy limit of 200, so he's now taking
anti-cholesterol drugs, too.
	   Fat deposits ``really are quite deforming,'' said Dr. Harvey
Abrams, a Los Angeles dermatologist who surgically removed 14 humps
so large that patients couldn't turn their heads. Abrams discovered
the humps weren't typical squishy fat but dense, fibrous tissue.
	   Merck and Co., maker of the biggest-selling protease inhibitor,
notes a lack of proof that protease inhibitors are to blame. It
reports finding fat problems in some patients who never took the
drugs. The phenomenon could simply be another AIDS symptom that
most patients until now haven't lived long enough to see, or it
could result from a combination of other AIDS medicines.
	   ``We don't know what's causing the fat redistribution
syndrome,'' said Merck's Dr. Joan Benson, designing a study of 100
Los Angeles patients to define the problem better.
	   But the FDA says all four protease inhibitors currently being
sold are prime suspects. It is investigating 64 patients, ``but
from what we can tell, ... there's a lot more than that,'' agency
medical officer Murray said. Checking the FDA's database, he found
only three reports of the problem with older AIDS drugs.
Researchers now estimate from 5 percent of HIV patients to 64
percent may have some degree of the condition.
	   It ``is a common complication of HIV protease inhibitors,'' a
new Australian study of 75 patients reported.
	   This isn't about diet, Murray stressed. Patients lose both fat
and muscle from the hips down and in their arms. Their faces can
become skeletal, with hollowed cheeks. And they don't get the
skin-deep inches (centimeters) around the waist typical of a busted
dieter. They put on dangerous visceral fat, the kind under
abdominal muscles most associated with heart attacks and diabetes.
	   ``Patients are very concerned whether these metabolic
abnormalities may lead to other consequences,'' said Dr. Richard
Hengel, who found about a dozen early patients at Emory University.
``That's what everyone is anxiously awaiting.''
	   Protease inhibitors already are known to increase the risk of
diabetes by raising blood sugar, so AIDS researchers are studying
whether this new problem is related.
	   The National Institutes of Health is about to publish research
ruling out one theory. ``It is absolutely not related to Cushing's
disease,'' a hormone disorder that causes similar humps, said NIH's
Dr. Kirk Miller. ``We just don't know the underlying mechanism.''
	   For now, patients simply want therapy.
	   Dr. Gabriel Torres of New York will tell experts meeting in
Geneva this month that he's testing human growth hormone after it
helped one patient's buffalo hump disappear. Liposuction failed to
work on visceral fat, but Abrams, the Los Angeles skin doctor, said
surgery seems to remove the humps permanently.

Seven soldiers convicted for murder of Japanese students in Peru 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A Peruvian court has convicted seven soldiers,
including the commander of a jungle army base, for the brutal
murder of two Japanese students navigating the Amazon River on a
crude raft.
	   A court in the jungle capital of Iquitos late Saturday sentenced
base commander Milton Trigoso, who ordered the October killings, to
life in prison. Six soldiers under his command were sentenced to 20
years each.
	   The soldiers used their rifle butts and machetes to kill Chiaki
Ito, 22, and Takahiro Miyashita, 23. They then stole their money
and equipment, police said.
	   The soldiers, who were from the Pebas army base, 700 miles
(1,125 kms) northeast of Lima, dismembered the bodies and buried
them in shallow graves on the banks of a remote stretch of the
Amazon River.
	   They were arrested in December after they tried to exchange Yen

	   The students were members of the explorers' club at Tokyo's
prestigious Waseda University. They had left from the northern
jungle city of Pucallpa en route to Manaus, Brazil in an effort to
navigate the Amazon River in a 6-by-9-foot (2-by-3 meter) raft made
of balsa wood with a canopy of dried leaves.
	   The boat was modeled after those used by the Amazon Indians.
They spoke no Spanish and were not accompanied by a guide.
	   The murders caused anger in Japan.

Nigeria's opposition, shaped by Abacha years, looks warily ahead

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The secret police officers were polite
when they came for Beko Ransome-Kuti. They'd been to his house
plenty of times before. They were always polite.
	   ``Our boss wants to have a chat with you,'' the prominent
Nigerian opposition figure was told.
	   Then he disappeared, swallowed up by Nigeria's security
machinery.
	   It was nearly six months before his family learned he'd been
sentenced to 15 years in prison for trying to make public
transcripts from the trial of an accused coup plotter charged with
``accessory after the fact to treason.''
	   For Nigeria's dissidents, the five years they spent fighting
Gen. Sani Abacha's regime was a constant struggle between idealism,
fear and disdain for the ruling authority.
	   But with Abacha suddenly dead of a heart attack, and a new
general _ Abdulsalam Abubakar _ now entering his second week in
charge, Nigeria's opposition is looking warily toward the future.
	   ``It's difficult to expect fundamental change for now,'' said
Femi Falana, a lawyer and activist. ``The same characters are still
in charge.''
	   Nigeria's pro-democracy forces _ the political opposition,
rights activists, journalists and clergy fighting for reform _ have
plenty of reason to be wary.
	   Their phones have been tapped for years. Their cars have been
followed and their homes searched. They are watched by cliched
secret police officers partial to cheap black suits and big
sunglasses. Their leadership has been decimated as colleagues
disappeared into prison or exile.
	   Now, they are struggling to interpret a few contradictory signs,
hoping to get a feel for how they should deal with the new leader.
	   Though security forces used tear gas and bullets to chase away
pro-democracy demonstrators last week, they also quickly released
those they had arrested. That's a far cry from the Abacha years,
when detainees could simply disappear for years.
	   And while Abubakar was quite close to Abacha, he has also
reportedly met with one of the wives of Moshood Abiola, the
imprisoned businessman believed to have won the 1993 presidential
elections, which Abacha annulled.
	   Meanwhile, he has pledged to go forward with an Oct. 1
transition to civilian rule, but has given no details on how it
will happen.
	   ``The vicious cycle of threats of instability, with its
attendant disruptions, should not be allowed to persist,'' Abubakar
said at a weekend meeting with the five government-approved
political parties.
	   Few know what to expect next.
	   ``I think (the new leaders) don't want any judgments made of
them too soon,'' said Clement Nwankwo, a human rights lawyer.
	   He said two unofficial emissaries had sought him out on
Abubakar's behalf, asking for his thoughts on the political
situation.
	   ``He's trying to get a sense of what people are thinking,''
Nwankwo said.
	   Like many political observers, Nwankwo believes Abubakar is
still consolidating his hold on power, sorting out allegiances
among Abacha's inner circle.
	   The question is whether Abubakar will surround himself with more
hard-line officials _ such as the heads of the intelligence
services _ or with people more open to change.
	   Nwankwo said pressure shouldn't be let up on the junta. But he
chose his words carefully, trying not to alienate the men gathered
at the fortified presidential compound where the new government is
taking shape.
	   ``I think this is a time to be practical,'' he said.
	   Many in the opposition movement disagree. Their views were
formed by five years of Abacha, not to mention previous military
leaders.
	   Thousands of dissidents were imprisoned, some tortured and a few
even killed under Abacha. Corruption and mismanagement, meanwhile,
crippled the country. The world's sixth-largest oil producer cannot
even refine enough gasoline for its own use.
	   They see few reasons to be practical with a man who thrived
under such circumstances.
	   ``Abacha is gone but the power forces behind him are still
there,'' said Ransome-Kuti's daughter, Nike.
	   Her father, arrested in 1995, is held in solitary confinement
with only the Bible and the Koran to read. She now heads the
family, supporting her two younger sisters.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, a well-known dissident, has already become
Abubakar's most vocal critic.
	   ``These things are cosmetic,'' he said of Abubakar's meetings.
``This Abubakar has not made any fundamental statements, has not
many any fundamental changes.''
	   ``He hasn't taken a step to convince anybody he wants a new
Nigeria.''

World Cup: Yugoslavia, Iran play goalless first half 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Iran held heavily favored
Yugoslavia to a 0-0 draw at halftime in their opening World Cup
match Sunday.
	   Although Yugoslavia's midfield dominated most of the half, it
created few opportunities and seldom reached the Iranian goal.
Their best chance came in the 15th minute, when Goran Djurovic's
header hit the crossbar after he was found on the far post by
forward Dragan Stojkovic's left wing corner.
	   Stojkovic created another opportunity in the 30th minute with a
corner from the other side. Djorovic soared high above the Iranian
defenders at the near post, but his header shot above the crossbar.
	   Iran focused on defense, and it took 8 minutes before Yugoslav
goalkeeper Ivica Kralj scooped up his first ball. In the 23rd
minute, Kralj was well-positioned for a 20-meter volley by forward
Mehdi Mahdavikia.
	   But Iran gained in confidence towards the end, increasingly
pushing forward after brushing aside ineffectual Yugoslav attacks.
	   Iran's best chance came on a fast break in the 36th minute, when
midfielder Mehrdad Minavand ran into the Yugoslav box from the left
but shot wide with only Kralj to beat.
	   Yugoslav defender Zeljko Petrovic was yellow-carded in the 42nd
minute for bringing down Mahdavikia.
	   Lineups:
	   Yugoslavia _ Ivica Kralj; Zoran Mirkovic, Goran Djorovic, Sinisa
Mihajlovic, Zeljko Petrovic; Slavisa Jokanovic, Branko Brnovic,
Vladimir Jugovic, Dragan Stojkovic; Predrag Mijatovic, Savo
Milosevic.
	   Iran _ Nima Nakisa; Mohammad Khakpour, Mehdi Pashazadeh, Mehdi
Mahdavikia, Karim Bagheri; Hamid Estili, Nader Mohammadkhani, Javad
Zarincheh, Mehrdad Minavand Chal; Ali Daei, Khodadad Azizi.
	   Referee _ Alberto Tejada Noriega, Peru.

<TEXT>
	   HALSSKOV, Denmark (AP) _ Queen Margrethe put an end to more than
a century of picturesque ferry crossing Sunday by opening a central
Denmark road bridge linking Copenhagen to the European continent.
	   More than 10,000 people with Danish flags cheered as the royal
limousine drove onto the Storebaelt bridge. Under a blue sky and
scattered clouds, a red and white ribbon was cut as ships saluted
the royal motorcade with their distinctive foghorns, and 16 F-16
jet fighters flew across the waterway.
	   The Storebaelt bridge between the islands of Zealand where the
capital is situated, and Funen which is linked to the Jutland
peninsula, was ``the fullfilment of generations' dream,'' Margrethe
said. ``We'll now cross the country in one zip with the skies above
us and the sea under us.''
	   At mid-bridge the royal car stopped. The queen and her husband,
Prince Henrik, stepped out and took snapshots of each other before
returning to the car and continuing on to Funen.
	   Danes who loved the scenic, but slow ferry journey now will
cross the Storebaelt waterway on a 18-kilometer (11-mile),
four-lane highway in about 10 minutes _ less that a fifth of the
time it took to sail.
	   It took 10 years, four more than planned; and twice the cost,
about 38 billion kroner (dlrs 5.3 billion); to build Europe's
longest combined road-and-rail bridge.
	   Trains began using the link last year, traveling through an
8-kilometer (5-mile) underwater tunnel to a mid-strait island, and
then along a 6.6-kilometer (4.1-mile) western bridge. Cars use a
6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) bridge from Zealand to Sprogoe instead of
the tunnel.
	   The opening of the bridge for road traffic puts the bulky
white-and-black boats out of service. Since 1885, there have been
regular ferry crossings and the ferries have held a soft spot in
many Danes' hearts.
	   The link is a symbol of ``bridges which should be built between
democracies in Europe,'' Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said
in his speech to the assembled crowd.
	   More than 200 million people have used the boats since 1957 when
modern terminals opened in the ports of Knudshoved and Halsskov,
120 kilometers (74 miles) west of Copenhagen.
	   The ferries on Denmark's busiest route had a capacity of 1,200
passengers and 300 cars, and departed every 30 minutes in each
direction.
	   The ferry Arveprins Knud (Crown Prince Knud) was to make its
last trip Sunday evening.
	   Although many Danes enjoyed the ferry rides, they hindered
spontaneous travel because tickets had to be booked well in advance
to ensure a place on the packed vessels.
	   The bridge toll is 210 kroner (dlrs 30), while a one-way ferry
crossing cost 335 kroner (dlrs 48).
	   The new bridge will be a major link in a road network which will
allow motorists to drive from the Arctic Circle to southern Spain
by the turn of the century, when a bridge-tunnel link between
Copenhagen and Malmoe, Sweden, is scheduled to be completed.

President of Kalmykia region plans to seek Russian presidency 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of the Kalmyk region in southern
Russia, Kirsan Yulimzhinov, said Sunday that he will seek the
Russian presidency in 2000.
	   Yulimzhinov is a billionaire who is also president of the
International Chess Federation. He made his announcement on the TV
interview program ``Obozrevatel'' (Observer).
	   Yulimzhinov said he will either form his own political party
``relying on the regions and young people,'' or align himself with
one of the existing political parties, such as the Communists or
the Agrarians.
	   One of his first tasks will be raising his profile outside of
Kalmykia, a resource-rich region on the steppes of southern Russia.
	   Kalmyks came to the region from Central Asia about 400 years
ago. Most were deported by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1943 and
allowed to return only 14 years later. Many Kalmyks are Buddhists,
and Yulimzhinov has invited the Dalai Lama to make his home in
Kalmykia.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has repeatedly said he plans to step
down after his current term ends, but his aides have long been
hinting that the 67-year-old leader may run again.
	   The Russian constitution limits a president to two terms, but
aides have suggested that Yeltsin's first term may not count
because it began in Soviet times, before the new constitution was
passed.
	   Russia's constitutional court is expected to rule on the issue
later this year.
	   Other potential candidates include former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, and former national security chief Alexander
Lebed.

Argentina downs Japan; English fans clash with police Kluivert receiving two-match ban; TRIMS; WILL be UPDATED with Yugoslavia-Iran and Croatia-Jamaica AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with second day of clashes involving England fans,
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Japan, the first of three nations making World Cup
debuts Sunday, gave a valiant effort before falling to Argentina,
while English fans clashed with police for a consecutive second
day.
	   In the southern port city of Marseille, several hundred English
soccer fans threw bottles and beer cans at police in helmets and
shields. Police fired back with tear gas to disperse the crowds.
	   About 15 revelers were arrested, police said. There was no
immediate explanation for the rampage.
	   Meanwhile, on-field violence was punished as Dutch striker
Patrick Kluivert was banned for two games for elbowing Belgium's
Lorenzo Staelens in the chest in an off-the-ball incident during
Saturday's 0-0 tie at Saint-Denis. Kluivert, who received a red
card for the foul, will miss the Netherlands' other Group E
first-round games against South Korea and Mexico.
	   In rainswept conditions at Toulouse, Gabriel Batistuta scored in
the 28th minute to give Group H favorite Argentina a 1-0 victory
over the Japanese.
	   ``It is very unfortunate that we could not score a goal. I
believe results count at the World Cup,'' said Japanese coach
Takeshi Okada, choked with emotion. ``The goal we allowed was
inevitable. Our players were aggressive and positive.''
	   Japan, co-host of the 2002 finals, created a string of scoring
chances but lacked the finishing touch necessary to compete with
the best teams in the world.
	   ``I think we were able to play as equals,'' defender Naoki Soma
said. ``We're almost there, and we'd shoot but we couldn't score.''
	   Although they didn't dominate as much as expected, Argentina is
now expected to cruise into the second round in perhaps the softest
group in the tournament.
	   ``There are things we can improve,'' midfielder Diego Simeone
said. ``But the order of the day was to win, and we did.''
	   Later Sunday, newcomers Croatia and Jamaica played in Lens, and
Yugoslavia and Iran _ two countries back in the World Cup following
politically-related absences _ met in Saint-Etienne. Yugoslavia was
banned from the 1994 World Cup because of international sanctions,
while Iran's once-formidable soccer program took a downturn after
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Iran's preparations took a unique turn Saturday night when its
players held a three-hour religious mourning ceremony at the time
many teams would be getting a good night's sleep before a game.
	   Players beat their chests and wept as a religious teacher
recounted the death of a 7th century Shiite Muslim saint in what is
now modern day Iraq.
	   The ritual ended around midnight, about the same time that
English fans were causing the first round of trouble in Marseille.
An incident involving a motorist set off a melee involving some 200
fans who showered police and their vehicles with bottles and cans.
	   At least one gendarme was hospitalized with a head injury. Four
English fans were arrested.
	   As a result, authorities stepped up security immediately, with
about 1,900 police patrolling the city ahead of England's
first-round match against Tunisia on Monday night.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton, England, with his brother.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Also Sunday, French organizers said they had filed a complaint
against agents and tour operators allegedly involved in the World
Cup ticket scandal. Thousands of fans worldwide have been left
without tickets that had been promised to them or for which they
had paid.
	   ``We are going to court and an investigation will be carried
out,'' he said.
	   One prominent name who does have some tickets on hold has
decided not to show. Diego Maradona announced Sunday he will not
fly to France, at least for the time being, because he was
``depressed'' by a 34-month suspended sentence he received last
week for a 1994 shooting incident.
	   ``I feel very depressed and not inclined to take a decision on
covering the World Cup as a TV commentator, at least for the time
being'', Maradona told a Buenos Aires radio station.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans clashed with
Tunisian fans and for the second day with riot police Sunday, the
eve of an England-Tunisia match that has prompted beefed-up
security.
	   Several hundred English soccer fans threw bottles and beer cans
at police with helmets and shields, who fired back with tear gas.
Scattered fights also broke out between British and Tunisian fans,
police said.
	   No injuries were immediately reported. Authorities said they
arrested about 20 people.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the new clashes Sunday
afternoon, though police blamed the violence on drunkenness, not
hooligans.
	   English fans pelted police overnight after a motorist who tried
to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one of the
fans.
	   Of four English fans arrested in that clash, a 20-year-old
Liverpool railroad employee remained in custody to face charges in
court Monday for allegedly attacking police.
	   On Sunday, dozens of officers patrolled the port and down the
Canebiere, the city's main avenue, where sun-drenched cafes brimmed
with flag-waving English fans who chanted, drank and talked to the
locals throughout the day.
	   Beaches were filled with tourists, locals and topless
sunbathers. The British tabloid The Sun sent a topless orange
double-decker bus around town, with model-TV hostess Melinda
Messenger handing out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.
	   Vans of CRS and gendarmes stood ready in several Marseille
neighborhoods.

Blair urged to get EU summit to lift ban on British beef now With EU-Summit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Thousands of farmers and rural workers
staged a demonstration Sunday to urge Prime Minister Tony Blair and
his European Union colleagues to lift the ban on British beef
exports immediately.
	   Anticipating months of haggling, National Farmers Union head Ben
Gill said the two-day EU summit kicking off Monday gave Blair, as
the meeting's chairman, a chance to speed things up.
	   ``We are not prepared to tolerate a further six-month delay in
getting this ban lifted just because of political considerations,''
Gill said.
	   The beef export ban was imposed in March 1996 over fears of
``mad cow'' disease. Last week, declaring British beef safe again,
the European Commission recommended the ban be lifted under strict
conditions.
	   The initial reaction from veterinary experts from the 15 EU
nations has been that they need time to consider the proposal. If
they cannot agree, the EU agriculture ministers get involved,
injecting politics into the decision.
	   Germany, in particular, is wary about resuming British beef
sales, fearing a consumer backlash, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl may
not be in the mood for concessions in the runup to September
elections.
	   Blair said Sunday that the British government had ``started to
make progress.''
	   ``I totally understand and sympathize with the plight of the
farmers, which is why we have been working so hard to get the beef
ban lifted,'' he said. ``I can assure people in the farming
industry we are alive to their feelings.''
	   The European Commission has recommended resuming exports of
British beef from cattle born after Aug. 1, 1996 _ the date Britain
banned feeding ground remains of sheep and other animals to cattle.
	   It is believed that the use of ground remains causes ``mad cow''
disease, a brain ailment in cattle officially known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy. Mad cow disease is related to an equally
fatal human variant, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Even if the political go-ahead for a resumption of British beef
sales comes soon, it will take months before British beef is
exported again, officials have said.
	   Exports would have to wait until final EU checks on a slew of
anti-BSE health and safety measures in Britain. Under the proposal,
beef must be deboned and come from animals aged between six and 30
months that have been killed in approved slaughterhouses and hail
from herds guaranteed to be BSE-free.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans clashed with
riot police in the Old Port for a second day Sunday, the eve of an

World Cup: Dutch star suspended for two World Cup games after expulsion 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Kluivert comments on incident, adds byline
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert was banned for two
World Cup games Sunday for throwing an elbow at a Belgian defender
who made cutting remarks.
	   Kluivert was shown the red card for elbowing Lorenzo Staelens in
the chest in an off-the-ball incident during Saturday's 0-0 tie at
Saint-Denis.
	   The two-game ban by FIFA means he misses the Netherlands'
remaining Group E games against South Korea in Marseille on
Saturday and against Mexico at Saint-Etienne June 25.
	   If the Dutch don't qualify for the second round, that would mean
Kluivert would take no further part in this World Cup.
	   The AC Milan striker said Sunday that he elbowed Staelens after
being ``deeply hurt'' by the Belgian defender's comments.
	   Kluivert, who is black, said that he had been upset by offensive
comments, though he declined to eleborate.
	   ``I pushed him,'' Kluivert said after a training session in
Versailles Sunday. ``I couldn't control my emotions. My actions
were nothing to do with the way the match was going.''
	   Kluivert was visibly angry the morning after the clash and
apologized for losing his cool during the vital game. But Dutch
officials were still fuming at the way the burly Staelans fell to
the ground clutching his face after the contact.
	   ``It was only a minor incident,'' team spokesman Rob de Leede
said. ``Patrick lightly pushed the player and then we saw a piece
of theater, with Staelens going down like he was hit by Mike
Tyson.''
	   ``That doesn't mean it was right for Patrick to do something
like that,'' De Leede added.
	   Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said that he didn't condone Kluivert's
action but could understand it.
	   ``Though he shouldn't have reacted in that way, you can't
exclude emotions from a game like that,'' he said.
	   Dutch officials have already said that they would consider an
appeal if Kluivert is suspended for more than one match. A red card
carries an automatic one-game suspension and can be lengthened if
officials feel more punishment is warranted.
	   The other two players expelled so far, Bulgaria's Anatoli Nankov
and Ha Seok-ju of South Korea, received only one-game bans.
	   Nankov was sent off for two yellow cards in the game against
Nigeria while Ha became the first player to be expelled in the
World Cup for a foul tackle from behind.
	   FIFA declined comment on the two-match ban on Kluivert because
of the possibility of an appeal.
	   The Dutch camp is now looking to regroup before its next game,
against South Korea next Saturday.
	   ``I wasn't unhappy with the performance against Belgium, but I
was unhappy with the result,'' Hiddink said. ``We dominated
completely for the first 35 minutes and had chances to score. We
continued to play well defensively but needed to do more
offensively.''

Fighting flares anew in Kosovo as NATO gears up for action casualties.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting escalated on several Kosovo
fronts Sunday, with Serbs and Albanians accusing the other of
starting a series of clashes that killed at least five people, on
the eve of NATO exercises in the region.
	   The Kosovo Information center, close to the pro-independence
Albanian leadership, Serb forces launched 500 grenades into
villages in the Decani area in western Kosovo Sunday, in what
appears to be another crackdown on armed ethnic Albanian
secessionists.
	   In Pristina, Serbian police colonel Novica Zdravkovic, told
reporters ethnic Albanian militants killed two policemen and
injured two other in separate incidents in the capital and the
southwest of the province.
	   According to Novakovic, Dragan Stamenkovic, 33, was shot dead
and his partner, Nebojsa Vukojcic, 38, was seriously wounded while
patrolling near Djakovica.
	   More than 300 people in Kosovo have died since the crisis
escalated in late March, when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a bloody crackdown on separatist-minded ethnic Albanian
militants fighting to succeed the province from Serbia.
	   Fearing the conflict could spill over Yugoslavia's borders into
neighboring Albania and Macedonia, the West warned Milosevic last
week he must change his hardline policy in the region or face the
threat of force.
	   On Sunday, the main ethnic Albanian party in the province, the
Democratic League of Kosovo, also said Serbian ``military and
police forces ... began a broad attack against three villages in
the Djakovica area... with heavy artillery.''
	   The Kosovo Information Center said that Serb police brought a
reinforcement of about 40 armored vehicles and 15 tanks into the
Djakovica region, near the border with Albania.
	   The center also said Serb forces launched grenades against a
cluster of villages northwest of Pristina in the Drenica region,
where the government crackdowns began earlier this year.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed, as police
and ethnic Albanian militants, known as the Kosovo Liberation Army,
have set up a maze of blockades in the contested areas across the
province.
	   The KLA now control estimated 40 percent of the province, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1 and are particularly strong
in the Djakovica and Drenica regions.
	   A group of reporters traveling southwest from Pristina drove
into an exchange of fire between the KLA and Yugoslav army
soldiers, whose truck was ambushed on the stretch of road that
passes through a gorge.
	   The crew pulled out safely, and delivered two wounded army
soldiers to a nearby hospital.
	   An Albanian report, apparently about the same clash near the
town of Crnoljevo, 25 kilometers (16 miles) southwest of Pristina
said three Albanians died, after an army unit passing along the
road allegedly started firing on them.
	   A total of about 50,000 people have fled the fighting, many of
them across the border to neighboring Albania or to the other
Yugoslav republic, Montenegro, which together with Serbia forms
Yugoslavia.
	   In northern Italy, NATO warplanes were convening at an airbase
Sunday to prepare for simulated air attacks in Albania and
Macedonia planned for Monday to try to persuade Milosevic to halt
military action in Kosovo.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 in an attempt
to suppress the Albanian independence movement. But since Serbs
launched a bloody crackdown in the region earlier this year, the
KLA
	   has grown stronger and more popular among the ethnic Albanians.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans clashed with
Tunisian fans and for the second day with riot police Sunday, the
eve of an England-Tunisia match that has prompted beefed-up
security.
	   Several hundred English soccer fans threw bottles and beer cans
at police with helmets and shields, who fired back with tear gas.
Scattered fights also broke out between British and Tunisian fans,
police said.
	   No injuries were immediately reported. Authorities said they
arrested about 20 people.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the new clashes Sunday
afternoon, though police blamed the violence on drunkenness, not
hooligans.
	   English fans pelted police overnight after a motorist who tried
to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one of the
fans.
	   Of four English fans arrested in that clash, a 20-year-old
Liverpool railroad employee remained in custody to face charges in
court Monday for allegedly attacking police.
	   On Sunday, dozens of officers patrolled the port and down the
Canebiere, the city's main avenue, where sun-drenched cafes brimmed
with flag-waving English fans who chanted, drank and talked to the
locals throughout the day.
	   Beaches were filled with tourists, locals and topless
sunbathers. The British tabloid The Sun sent a topless orange
double-decker bus around town, with model-TV hostess Melinda
Messenger handing out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.
	   Vans of CRS and gendarmes stood ready in several Marseille
neighborhoods.

On summit's eve, Chirac says EU must meddle less in national matters 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Blair arrival comments; TRIMs pvs
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ On the eve of a European summit, French
President Jacques Chirac said Sunday the European Union must meddle
less in national affairs _ such as telling his country how to sell
tickets to soccer's World Cup _ and do more to expand the EU into
eastern Europe.
	   Chirac complained that the EU executive commission sticks its
nose into matters better left to national governments.
	   ``Hundreds of decisions ... shouldn't have been taken,'' Chirac
said in an interview with BBC television, singling out EU
Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert's harping on shortcomings
in World Cup ticket sales as ``interference'' in French affairs.
	   ``Don't be silly! That's not your responsibility,'' he said of
the commission.
	   Van Miert has blamed France with unfairly restricting World Cup
tickets to French nationals or residents.
	   Chirac complained that EU institutions don't work well and
``will not work at all'' unless they are overhauled before the club
grows to 25 members by taking on candidates among its eastern
neighbors.
	   ``We have to reform the institutions. The commission, the way to
vote (at ministerial meetings). This has to be changed ... before
the first enlargement,'' he said.
	   His comment raised an issue that will surface at the EU summit
Monday and Tuesday: how far should European nations go in doing
things together and how much should be left to national
governments.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on arrival that he hoped
he and the European leaders will commit to a reform agenda,
``ensuring that Europe is prosperous'' and open up to the east.
	   In a joint letter this week to Blair, Chirac and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed the need for change, calling the EU
an ivory tower that issues edicts affecting the lives of 370
million Europeans but is accountable to none.
	   No one questions the need for reform, but the leaders themselves
have so far failed to push it forward. This time last year in
Amsterdam, they could not agree on proposals to streamline EU
decision-making and revamp EU institutions, especially the
commission _ long the preferred whipping boy of EU-bashing
politicians.
	   In the past year, talks to reform farm subsidies, which eat up
half the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget, and to forge a new funding
formula for the EU have made no progress.
	   Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Austria say they pay too
much and want their contributions limited. Others call that
unreasonable when the EU plans to widen its ranks.
	   Also, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland want assurances that
special aid for them will not be lost to newcomers who are poorer
than they are.
	   Britain _ which has an annual ``rebate'' because of its outsized
membership payments _ will not forego that refund, though its
economy is doing so well. ``The British rebate has been very
well-established and we will hold to that,'' Blair said.
	   The leaders will be accompanied by their foreign and finance
ministers. The former will debate such issues as Kosovo. The latter
will review the deteriorating Russian economy and the recession in
Japan.
	   The summit ends with a luncheon on Tuesday in honor of Nelson
Mandela, a farewell to the South African leader, who is to step
down next year.

World Cup: Hoddle wonders how to use Owen; Tunisians ready to surprise 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with more Kasperczak, Shearer quotes
By MORLEY MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England coach Glenn Hoddle, known for
doing the unexpected in his playing days, is prepared to gamble on
the precocious talents of 18-year-old Liverpool striker Michael
Owen for Monday's opening World Cup game against Tunisia.
	   Hoddle is keeping his starting 11 secret. But there have been
enough hints that Owen figures very much in his plans, either in
preference to Alan Shearer's strike partner Teddy Sheringham or as
a substitute.
	   While Hoddle aims to send out the right lineup for a game he is
expected to win, Tunisian coach Henryk Kasperczak is preparing a
surprise.
	   ``Against England we have nothing to lose,'' he said. ``On the
other hand if the English lose against us, it will be catastrophic
for them.''
	   ``I've put England out of the World Cup once,'' said Kasperczak,
who played in the Polish team which eliminated England in the
qualifying stages of the 1974 World Cup.
	   ``Why shouldn't I help do it again?''
	   It could all depend on Owen.
	   England's youngest goal scorer when he netted against Morocco
last month, Owen has impressed Hoddle with his qualities,
particularly his stunning pace.
	   ``Michael's temperament is smashing, way above his years,''
Hoddle said of the teen-age prodigy.
	   ``He is a really exciting prospect. If he starts, he can cause
people problems and influence a game. We must find out if he can do
that at World Cup level. And if he comes off the bench, he's a
diverse option to everything else we have in the squad, an extra
dimension.''
	   Owen has no self-doubts. ``I feel I am ready and, if I play
against Tunisia, I think I'll score,'' the youngster said.
	   Shearer doesn't care who plays alongside.
	   ``I've got confidence in my own ability,'' the Newcastle striker
said. ``It's my job to score the goals, but I'm not like a Ronaldo,
who can beat three or four people from the half-way line and stick
the ball in. I need people who can create chances for me.
	   ``If we can create the chances, then hopefully I'll be on the
end of them.''
	   It is England's 10th World Cup appearance, having won the crown
in 1966, while Tunisia's only previous experience was in 1974.
Their other Group G rivals are Colombia and Romania.
	   England has not conceded a goal in its last four internationals
apart from in a penalty shootout against Belgium. That means
Tunisia will face a defence that appears sound, especially with
tough-tackling midfielders Paul Ince and David Batty shoring up the
rear guard.
	   Tunisia showed its potential with a decisive 4-0 victory over
Wales in a June 6 friendly, although it was against a
below-strength Welsh team.
	   But there were impressive performances by the long-haired
midfielder Sirajeddine Chihi, Brazilian-born Jose Clayton and
attacking defender Khaled Badra, who scored two goals.
	   ``We have a group of young, strong, ambitious players who have
been tested on the field in the 1996 African Nations Cup and the
Atlanta Olympics,'' said assistant coach Ali el-Selm. In the ANC
competition, the team went all the way to the finals before losing
to host South Africa.
	   ``We are here to show the new strength of Tunisian and Arab
football.''
	   With 460,000 Tunisians living in France, English fans are
expected to be heavily outnumbered in the 60,000 capacity Stade
Velodrome.

India's communists protest right-wing group's plan to rebuild temple 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's four major communist parties on
Sunday criticized a right-wing group's plan to rebuild a Hindu
temple on a site where radical groups tore down an ancient mosque
and set off nationwide Hindu-Muslim riots.
	   ``Construction of a temple at an undisputed spot is anybody's
choice,'' the parties said in a joint statement. ``But to indulge
in the buildup so near the disputed site gives the signal of an
attempt to set up the temple at any cost,'' it said.
	   India's Supreme Court is hearing the dispute over the shrine and
the government led by a Hindu nationalist group has said it will
abide by the ruling.
	   Newspapers this week reported that a radical Hindu group allied
with the ruling party has been secretly assembling sandstone
carvings that will be put together at Ayodhya even while the court
case is going on.
	   Hindu radicals were blamed for the 1992 destruction of the Babri
Mosque in Ayodhya, 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of New
Delhi. They say the mosque was built 400 years ago by Mogul
invaders using the rubble of a Hindu shrine they tore down. Many
people believe the shrine stood on the birthplace of Ram, an
important Hindu deity.
	   Nationwide Hindu-Muslim riots broke out after the destruction
and more than 2,000 people were killed in the violence. A year
later, suspected Muslim extremists set off 13 bomb blasts in Bombay
to avenge the riots. The blasts killed some 600 people and
destroyed many skyscrapers in the country's financial capital.
	   The governing Bharatiya Janata Party has said it will not build
the temple there unless given permission by the court. But its
sister organization, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu
Council, has said it will go ahead with its plans.
	   On Sunday, representatives of the communist parties visited
Ayodhya town to see stone carvers chip away at sandstone blocks.
	   ``The development is a matter of grave concern to us,''
communist lawmaker Gurudas Dasgupta told reporters after the visit,
Press Trust of India news agency reported.

	   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) _ The crater area of Mount Etna was
declared off-limits Sunday to tourists after the volcano belched
chunks of lava.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA, reporting from this eastern
Silican city, said only those authorized to work near the summit
were allowed near the crater.
	   Earthquake activity was virtually nil, ANSA said, and no
evacuation of the villages along the mountainside was announced.
	   The volcano has been particularly noisy and active off and on

	   Etna's last major eruption came six years ago.

Queen opens road bridge link to continent; end of the line for century-old ferry sevice 
</HEADLINE>

By JAN M. OLSEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HALSSKOV, Denmark (AP) _ Queen Margrethe put an end to more than
a century of picturesque ferry crossing Sunday by opening a central
Denmark road bridge linking Copenhagen to the European continent.
	   Danes who loved the scenic, but slow ferry journey now will
cross the Storebaelt bridge on a 18-kilometer (11-mile), four-lane
highway in about 10 minutes _ less than a fifth of the time it took
to sail.
	   The bridge links the islands of Zealand where the capital is
situated, and Funen, which is connected to the Jutland peninsula.
It took 10 years to build, four more than planned, and twice the
cost, about 38 billion kroner (dlrs 5.3 billion) to build Europe's
longest combined road-and-rail bridge.
	   Trains began using the link last year, traveling through an
8-kilometer (5-mile) underwater tunnel to a mid-strait island, and
then along a 6.6-kilometer (4.1-mile) western bridge. Cars use a
6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) bridge from Zealand to Sprogoe instead of
the tunnel.
	   The opening of the bridge for road traffic puts the bulky
white-and-black boats out of service. Since 1885, there have been
regular ferry crossings and the ferries have held a soft spot in
many Danes' hearts.
	   More than 200 million people have used the boats since 1957 when
modern terminals opened in the ports of Knudshoved and Halsskov,
120 kilometers (74 miles) west of Copenhagen.
	   The ferries on Denmark's busiest route had a capacity of 1,200
passengers and 300 cars, and departed every 30 minutes in each
direction. Although many Danes enjoyed the ferry rides, they
hindered spontaneous travel because tickets had to be booked well
in advance.
	   The bridge toll is 210 kroner (dlrs 30), while a one-way ferry
crossing cost 335 kroner (dlrs 48).

Blair urged to get EU summit to lift ban on British beef now With EU-Summit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Thousands of farmers and rural workers
staged a demonstration Sunday to urge Prime Minister Tony Blair and
his European Union colleagues to lift the ban on British beef
exports immediately.
	   Anticipating months of haggling, National Farmers Union head Ben
Gill said the two-day EU summit kicking off Monday gave Blair, as
the meeting's chairman, a chance to speed things up.
	   ``We are not prepared to tolerate a further six-month delay in
getting this ban lifted just because of political considerations,''
Gill said.
	   The beef export ban was imposed in March 1996 over fears of
``mad cow'' disease. Last week, declaring British beef safe again,
the European Commission recommended the ban be lifted under strict
conditions.
	   The initial reaction from veterinary experts from the 15 EU
nations has been that they need time to consider the proposal. If
they cannot agree, the EU agriculture ministers get involved,
injecting politics into the decision.
	   Germany, in particular, is wary about resuming British beef
sales, fearing a consumer backlash, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl may
not be in the mood for concessions in the runup to September
elections.
	   Blair said Sunday that the British government had ``started to
make progress.''
	   ``I totally understand and sympathize with the plight of the
farmers, which is why we have been working so hard to get the beef
ban lifted,'' he said.
	   Even if the political go-ahead for a resumption of British beef
sales comes soon, it will take months of EU health and safety
checks before British beef is exported again, officials have said.

Human trials of appetite-suppressing hormone show it's no miracle cure 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Preliminary findings indicate the
weight-regulating hormone leptin isn't the miracle fat cure some
hoped it would be. Still, it shows some promise in helping achieve
weight loss when combined with diet and exercise.
	   In the first trials on humans, some people lost as much as 35
pounds (16 kilos) after six months of daily injections, with no
serious side effects, while others lost no weight and some even got
pudgier.
	   ``It's a disappointment,'' said an outside expert, Dr. Roger
Unger of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in
Dallas.
	   One of those involved in the study was slightly more
enthusiastic.
	   ``I'm guardedly optimistic,'' said Dr. Andrew Greenberg, who
presented the findings Sunday at the American Diabetes
Association's annual meeting in Chicago.
	   Though the first study did not involve diabetics, obesity is
strongly linked to the disease.
	   Greenberg is an endocrinologist at the USDA Human Nutrition
Research Center at Tufts University in Boston. The center is one of
six nationwide involved in the continuing trials, sponsored by
Amgen, a California pharmaceutical research laboratory that made
the synthetic leptin used in the study.
	   The first trial was small; just 60 obese people completed the
full six months. Further trials are under way, Greenberg said.
	   Leptin is a protein produced by fat cells. It is supposed to
signal the brain to stop eating, but the signal does not get
through properly in some overweight people.
	   Scientists believe that most fat people produce high levels of
leptin but their bodies are somehow resistant. By injecting
synthetic leptin, they'd hoped to produce a response similar to
what happens in adult-onset diabetics, whose bodies are resistant
to the high levels of insulin they produce. Many do respond to
injected insulin.
	   The study examined leptin's impact on obese subjects with a body
mass index of 27.5 to 36, a measure of weight in relation to
height. For example, someone who is 5-feet-10 (1.75-meters) and 207
pounds (94 kilos) has a BMI of 30.
	   Subjects, mostly white males, were given either a placebo or a
daily injection of synthetic leptin in varying doses. They were
also placed on weight-reduction diets providing 500 calories less
than their basic energy needs and were advised to exercise.
	   There were no significant adverse side effects, excluding mild
to moderate skin reactions such as redness, itching or swelling at
the injection site.
	   For subjects receiving the highest dose, the average weight loss
was 16 pounds (7 kilos). Six of the eight people on the highest
dose lost weight.
	   But overall, about 30 percent of those studied gained weight,
including about half of the placebo subjects.
	   Leptin's discoverer, Dr. Jeffrey Friedman of the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute at Rockefeller University, called the results
``encouraging, but clearly it's a small number of patients and many
more patients are going to have to be studied until we get a clear
handle on what the use of leptin might be.'' Friedman is a
consultant for Amgen.
	   Unger, at the University of Texas, said it was possible that a
place could be found for leptin treatment, ``but it doesn't appear
from the abstract (of the study) that it's going to work for every
possible obese person.''
	   Because the ``findings are positive in a selected population,
they indicate we're on the right track,'' said Dr. George
Blackburn, director of the Center for the Study of Nutrition and
Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
Blackburn, also of Harvard Medical School, was not involved in the
research.
	   Further trials may determine whether larger doses produce better
results, and whether injection is the best means of administering
leptin. Possible clinical use of leptin is still years away.

Queen opens road bridge reducing east-west travel time

<TEXT>
	   HALSSKOV, Denmark (AP) _ Danes on Sunday bid a nostalgic but
pragmatic farewell to the ferries which since the 1880s have taken
them across a key waterway tying Denmark's two largest islands.
	   ``There is something magic and relaxing about standing in the
wind on the deck and looking at the sea. I'll miss that,'' said
salesman Per Noergaard, 55, onboard the Lodbrog ferry which made
one of its last trips across the Storebaelt strait.
	   The inauguration of an 18-kilometer (11-mile) road bridge
earlier Sunday put six huge black-and-white vessels out of
business.
	   ``We grew up with them so we feel we're saying farewell to an
old friend. We'll never get acquainted with a concrete bridge, but
we'll certainly like it because it will make travelling a lot
easier,'' said teacher Helge Holt, 46.
	   Since 1883, there have been regular ferry crossings between the
islands of Zealand, where the capital is situated, and Funen which
is linked to the Jutland peninsula and the European continent.
	   Queen Margrethe opened the bridge for road traffic to the cheers
of more than 10,000 people with Danish flags during a ceremony in
this port 120 kilometers (74 miles) west of Copenhagen.
	   After the ceremony, the queen and her husband, Prince Henrik,
drove across the bridge. The royal motorcade stopped at the highest
point. The queen threw flowers into the sea in memory of the seven
workers who died during the construction work.
	   ``We'll now cross the country in one zip with the skies above us
and the sea under us,'' Queen Margrethe said.
	   Danes who loved the scenic, but slow ferry journey now will
cross the Storebaelt waterway on a four-lane highway in about 10
minutes _ less than a fifth of the time it took to sail.
	   It took 10 years, fours years longer than planned, and twice the
cost, about 38 billion kroner (dlrs 5.3 billion) to build Europe's
longest combined road-and-rail bridge.
	   Trains, which began using the link last year, travel through an
8-kilometer (5-mile) underwater tunnel to a mid-strait island, and
then along a 6.6-kilometer (4.1-mile) western bridge. Cars use a
6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) bridge from Zealand to Sprogoe instead of
the tunnel.
	   More than 200 million people have used the boats since 1957 when
modern terminals opened in the ports of Knudshoved and Halsskov.
	   The ferries on Denmark's busiest ferry route had a maximum
capacity of 1,200 passengers and 300 cars, and departed every 30
minutes in each direction.
	   The ferry _ Arveprins Knud (Crown Prince Knud) _ was scheduled
to make its last trip Sunday evening. A few hours later, police
will open the bridge for regular traffic.
	   Although many Danes enjoyed the ferry rides, they hindered
spontaneous travel because tickets had to be booked well in
advance.
	   ``Now we can go to the opera or go shopping in Copenhagen,''
said retired nurse Sigrid Poulsen, who lives in Herning on the
Jutland peninsula. ``We don't need to book (tickets) and the
distance has shrunk timewise.''
	   The bridge toll is 210 kroner (dlrs 30), while a one-way ferry
crossing cost 335 kroner (dlrs 48).
	   The new bridge will be a major link in a road network which will
allow motorists to drive from the Arctic Circle to southern Spain
at the turn of the century, when a bridge-tunnel link between
Copenhagen and Malmoe, Sweden, is scheduled to be completed.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Soccer's ever-present fear of fan violence became a
sobering reality as England fans clashed with police for the second
straight day Sunday, stealing much of the spotlight as three
nations made their World Cup debuts.
	   In the southern port city of Marseille, several hundred English
soccer fans threw bottles and beer cans at riot police, who fired
back with tear gas. Scattered fights also broke out between British
and Tunisian fans, whose teams play Monday afternoon at the city's
Velodrome stadium.
	   Police, blaming the rampage on drunkenness, said they arrested
about 20 people.
	   Meanwhile, on-field violence was punished as Dutch striker
Patrick Kluivert was banned for two games for elbowing Belgium's
Lorenzo Staelens in the chest in an off-the-ball incident during
Saturday's 0-0 tie at Saint-Denis. Kluivert, who received a red
card for the foul, will miss the Netherlands' other Group E
first-round games against South Korea and Mexico.
	   Kluivert, who is black, said he elbowed Staelens after being
``deeply hurt'' by what he said were offensive comments made by the
Belgian defender.
	   ``I pushed him,'' Kluivert said. ``I couldn't control my
emotions.''
	   In Sunday's games, the well of goals that had been so prevalent
through the tournament's first four days began to dry up. Argentina
beat Japan and Yugoslavia downed Iran, both by the score of 1-0.
	   Later Sunday, newcomers Croatia and Jamaica played in Lens.
	   Japan, co-host of the 2002 finals and playing its first-ever
World Cup game, gave a valiant effort before falling on Gabriel
Batistuta's 28th minute goal in rainswept conditions at Toulouse.
	   ``It is very unfortunate that we could not score a goal. I
believe results count at the World Cup,'' said Japanese coach
Takeshi Okada, choked with emotion.
	   ``I think we were able to play as equals,'' Japanese defender
Naoki Soma said. ``We're almost there, and we'd shoot but we
couldn't score.''
	   Although they didn't dominate as much as expected, Argentina is
now expected to cruise into the second round in perhaps the softest
group in the tournament.
	   ``There are things we can improve,'' midfielder Diego Simeone
said. ``But the order of the day was to win, and we did.''
	   At Saint-Etienne, Sinisa Mihajlovic's 25-meter free kick in the
73rd minute gave Yugoslavia its victory in a game between two
countries back in the World Cup following politically-related
absences.
	   Yugoslavia was banned from the 1994 World Cup because of
international sanctions, while Iran's once-formidable soccer
program took a downturn after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Iran's preparations took a unique turn Saturday night when its
players held a three-hour religious mourning ceremony at the time
many teams would be getting a good night's sleep before a game.
Players beat their chests and wept as a religious teacher recounted
the death of a 7th century Shiite Muslim saint in what is now
modern day Iraq.
	   The ritual ended around midnight, about the same time that
English fans were causing the first round of trouble in Marseille.
An incident involving a motorist set off a melee involving some 200
fans who showered police and their vehicles with bottles and cans.
	   At least one gendarme was hospitalized with a head injury. Four
English fans were arrested.
	   As a result, authorities stepped up security immediately, with
about 1,900 police patrolling the city ahead of England's
first-round match against Tunisia on Monday night.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southampton, England, with his brother.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Also Sunday, French organizers said they had filed a complaint
against agents and tour operators allegedly involved in the World
Cup ticket scandal. Thousands of fans worldwide have been left
without tickets that had been promised to them or for which they
had paid.
	   ``We are going to court and an investigation will be carried
out,'' he said.
	   One prominent name who does have some tickets on hold has
decided not to show. Diego Maradona announced Sunday he will not
fly to France, at least for the time being, because he was
``depressed'' by a 34-month suspended sentence he received last
week for a 1994 shooting incident.
	   ``I feel very depressed and not inclined to take a decision on
covering the World Cup as a TV commentator, at least for the time
being,'' Maradona told a Buenos Aires radio station.

World Cup: Late goal gives Yugoslavs 1-0 victory over Iran 
</HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ One of Sinisa Mihajlovic's
trademark free kicks gave Yugoslavia a 1-0 victory over underdogs
Iran in Sunday's opening Group F match at the World Cup.
	   In a game between two countries returning to the tournament
following politically-related absences, Mihajlovic took the kick
from about 25 meters, slightly to the left of the goal.
	   Mihajlovic, who recently transferred to Italy's Lazio and is
famous for scoring such crucial goals, curved his low shot around
the Iranian wall and beat diving goalkeeper Nima Nakisa in the 73rd
minute.
	   Although they dominated much of the match, the Yugoslavs failed
during the first half to test backup keeper Nakisa. Nakisa played
in place of captain Ahmadreza Abedzadeh, who is out with a knee
injury.
	   The Iranians, making their first World Cup appearance since the
Islamic revolution, played defensively, making frequent but
ineffective counterattacks. Attacker Ali Daei, who plays in
Germany's Bundesliga, nearly tied the game when he soared over two
Yugoslav defenders to head a cross into the arms of Yugoslavia's
keeper Ivica Kralj with three minutes remaining.
	   Yugoslav striker Predrag Mijatovic was well guarded for most of
the match. His one opportunity came in the 82nd minute when Nakisa
palmed away his shot from 8 meters after Mijatovic had drilled his
way into the Iranian box.
	   Early in the second half, Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac
boosted the attack by bringing in his rising stars, 19-year-old
Dejan Stankovic and 20-year-old Perica Ognjenovic, in place of
midfielders Branko Brnovic and Savo Milosevic.
	   This was one of the sensitive matches in politically charged
Group F, which consists of Germany, longtime foes Iran and the
United States, and Europe's pariah state, Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia was barred from all sporting events _ including the
1994 World Cup in the United States _ after its forces attacked
Muslims Slavs during the Bosnian war. They are now shelling Muslim
Albanians in Kosovo province, a move that may invite U.S.-led NATO
airstrikes. Iran's Islamic government supports Muslims in Bosnia
and Albania.
	   The Iranians appeared tired in the second half, perhaps because
of a lengthy religious ceremony the team held the previous night.
Instead of getting a full night's sleep, the Iranian team was awake
until midnight performing a ritual in which players beat their
chests and wept for the death of a 7th century Shiite saint.
	   Iran was an Asian soccer power in the 1970s before the 1979
revolution, making its last World Cup appearance in 1978.
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Yugoslavia _ Ivica Kralj; Zoran Mirkovic, Goran Djorovic, Sinisa

On summit's eve, Chirac says EU must meddle less in national matters 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Blair arrival, comments; TRIMs pvs
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ On the eve of a European summit, French
President Jacques Chirac said Sunday the European Union must meddle
less in national affairs and do more to expand the EU into eastern
Europe.
	   Chirac complained that the European Commission, which runs the
EU's day-to-day affairs, sticks its nose into matters better left
to national governments, such as how France should sell tickets to
soccer's World Cup.
	   ``Hundreds of decisions ... shouldn't have been taken,'' Chirac
said in an interview with BBC television.
	   Chirac singled out EU Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert's
criticism of World Cup ticket sales as ``interference'' in French
affairs.
	   ``Don't be silly! That's not your responsibility,'' he said of
the commission.
	   Van Miert has said France unfairly restricted World Cup tickets
to French nationals or residents. He threatened legal action.
	   Chirac complained EU institutions don't work well and ``will not
work at all'' unless they are overhauled before the club grows from
15 to 25 members or more by taking on candidates from Eastern
Europe.
	   ``We have to reform the institutions. The commission, the way to
vote (at ministerial meetings). This has to be changed and there is
no doubt that the reform must be before the first enlargement,''
Chirac said.
	   The question of how much European nations should work together
and how much should be left to national governments will surface at
the EU summit Monday and Tuesday.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on arrival that he hoped
he and the European leaders will commit to a reform agenda,
``ensuring that Europe is prosperous,'' and open up to the east.
	   In a joint letter to Blair this week, Chirac and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed the need for change, calling the EU
an ivory tower that issues edicts affecting the lives of 370
million Europeans but is accountable to none.
	   European leaders have previously failed in reform efforts. In
Amsterdam last year they could not agree on proposals to streamline
EU decision-making and to revamp EU institutions, especially the
commission _ long the preferred whipping boy of EU-bashing
politicians.
	   In the past year, talks to reform farm subsidies that eat up
half the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget and to forge a new funding
formula for the EU have made no progress.
	   European foreign ministers at the meeting will debate such
issues as Kosovo, while finance ministers will review the
deteriorating Russian economy and the recession in Japan.
	   The summit ends with a lunch on Tuesday with South African
President Nelson Mandela.

World Cup: Striker Salas suffers minor strain in practice 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MARIGNAC, France (AP) _ Striker Marcelo Salas, the World Cup's
scoring co-leader, gave his Chilean teammates a scare Sunday when
he left the practice field holding a painful right thigh.
	   But the team doctor said it was only a minor strain and that
Salas will be able to play in Wednesday's match against Austria.
Salas scored both goals as Chile tied Italy 2-2 in their first game
of group B.
	   Five minutes into a practice game between starters and reserves,
Salas felt a minor pull in the right thigh and left the field.
	   He was quickly examined by doctor Eugenio Valdecantos, who
treated Salas with heat pads and a massage. Salas was able to walk
without limping.
	   Salas and Mexico's Luis Hernandez share the Cup's scoring lead
with two tallies each.

San`a University professors, administrators on strike 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ About 1,200 San`a University professors and
3,000 administrators went on strike Sunday demanding an 80 percent
salary raise.
	   The strike is expected to affect about 70,000 students who are
to begin their final exams next Saturday.
	   In 1995, a special government committee promised a monthly
salary raise of about 170,000 riyals (dlrs 128,000) in 1995, but it
never fulfilled its pledges. Finance Ministry officials, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity, say the government cannot
afford the raises.
	   A university professor earns between dlrs 300 and 500 a month in
impoverished Yemen.
	   The striking professors and administrators vowed they will
continue their strike until their demands are met.

<TEXT>
	   HALSSKOV, Denmark (AP) _ Danes on Sunday bid a nostalgic but
pragmatic farewell to the ferries which since the 1880s have taken
them across a key waterway tying Denmark's two largest islands.
	   ``There is something magic and relaxing about standing in the
wind on the deck and looking at the sea. I'll miss that,'' said
salesman Per Noergaard, 55, onboard the Lodbrog ferry which made
one of its last trips across the Storebaelt strait.
	   The inauguration of an 18-kilometer (11-mile) road bridge
earlier Sunday put six huge black-and-white vessels out of
business.
	   ``We grew up with them so we feel we're saying farewell to an
old friend. We'll never get acquainted with a concrete bridge, but
we'll certainly like it because it will make travelling a lot
easier,'' said teacher Helge Holt, 46.
	   Since 1883, there have been regular ferry crossings between the
islands of Zealand, where the capital is situated, and Funen which
is linked to the Jutland peninsula and the European continent.
	   Queen Margrethe opened the bridge for road traffic to the cheers
of more than 10,000 people with Danish flags during a ceremony in
this port 120 kilometers (74 miles) west of Copenhagen.
	   After the ceremony, the queen and her husband, Prince Henrik,
drove across the bridge. The royal motorcade stopped at the highest
point. The queen threw flowers into the sea in memory of the seven
workers who died during the construction work.
	   ``We'll now cross the country in one zip with the skies above us
and the sea under us,'' Queen Margrethe said.
	   Danes who loved the scenic, but slow ferry journey now will
cross the Storebaelt waterway on a four-lane highway in about 10
minutes _ less than a fifth of the time it took to sail.
	   It took 10 years, fours years longer than planned, and twice the
cost, about 38 billion kroner (dlrs 5.3 billion) to build Europe's
longest combined road-and-rail bridge.
	   Trains, which began using the link last year, travel through an
8-kilometer (5-mile) underwater tunnel to a mid-strait island, and
then along a 6.6-kilometer (4.1-mile) western bridge. Cars use a
6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) bridge from Zealand to Sprogoe instead of
the tunnel.
	   More than 200 million people have used the boats since 1957 when
modern terminals opened in the ports of Knudshoved and Halsskov.
	   The ferries on Denmark's busiest ferry route had a maximum
capacity of 1,200 passengers and 300 cars, and departed every 30
minutes in each direction.
	   The ferry _ Arveprins Knud (Crown Prince Knud) _ was scheduled
to make its last trip Sunday evening. A few hours later, police
will open the bridge for regular traffic.
	   Although many Danes enjoyed the ferry rides, they hindered
spontaneous travel because tickets had to be booked well in
advance.
	   ``Now we can go to the opera or go shopping in Copenhagen,''
said retired nurse Sigrid Poulsen, who lives in Herning on the
Jutland peninsula. ``We don't need to book (tickets) and the
distance has shrunk timewise.''
	   The bridge toll is 210 kroner (dlrs 30), while a one-way ferry
crossing cost 335 kroner (dlrs 48).
	   The new bridge will be a major link in a road network which will
allow motorists to drive from the Arctic Circle to southern Spain
at the turn of the century, when a bridge-tunnel link between
Copenhagen and Malmoe, Sweden, is scheduled to be completed.

World Cup: Mexico's Hernandez takes center stage alongside the other ``Matador'' 
</HEADLINE>
By MARCOS ALEMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) - Suddenly, two ``Matadors'' share the
spotlight in the World Cup. One of them, however, feels he has
something to prove.
	   Mexico's forward Luis Hernandez tallied twice Saturday in the
Mexicans' come-from-behind 3-1 win over South Korea and tied
Chile's Marcelo Salas, the Cup's other ``Matador,'' as the scoring
leader with two apiece.
	   But the similarities between Hernandez, 29, and Salas, 23, end
there.
	   The Mexican striker, as flashy as they come with his dyed blond
mane and a rattling coil of bracelets, doesn't shy away from
attention.
	   And he's got something to prove to those who doubt his talent.
	   ``I'll show I'm a good player and that I'm able to play with any
team in the world,'' Hernandez said last week. And if he becomes
scoring champion along the way, all the better, he said.
	   ``It'd be wonderful, wonderful for me and for Mexico.''
	   Hernandez, 29, made his professional debut in 1990 with Cruz
Azul of the Mexican first division. He later played for Monterrey
and has been with Necaxa since 1994.
	   After eight years of relative obscurity, he made a name for
himself in last year's America Cup in Bolivia, where he scored six
goals, including two against Brazil.
	   That display earned Hernandez a contract with Argentina's Boca
Juniors and soon he found himself playing alongside some of the
game's greats, including Diego Maradona.
	   But Hernandez found his playing time constrained by a rule
limiting the number of foreign players in league play and what he
said were personal troubles with head coach Hector Veira.
	   He proved himself to Boca fans by scoring twice in three games
in the South American Super Cup.
	   ``I did my best, I tried, I showed what I could do whenever I
played. But sometimes a coach doesn't like a player,'' Hernandez
said.
	   Still, he's grateful for his chance to have played in
Argentina's tough league.
	   ``It had a wonderful time playing on the same team with Maradona
and (Claudio) Caniggia. They helped me a lot and my time in Boca
opened my eyes as a pro,'' he says.
	   As a reminder, one of his many bracelets comes in the blue and
gold of Boca's uniform.
	   Now he sees the World Cup as a chance to restore his image after
the frustrating stint in Argentina. And he hopes his mane, and his
goals will help people remember him.
	   ``It shows my personality and it feels good against the wind.
I've always enjoyed my long hair. And if I can dye it a little, why
not?''

World Cup: African flair needed in South African attack 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ To make the second round of the World Cup,
South Africa almost certainly needs to beat Denmark. To do that,
the players feel they must bring back the African flair missing
from the opening loss to France.
	   There was little attack in the 3-0 loss to the hosts Friday that
mired Bafana Bafana in last place of Group C. Next up are the
Danes, 1-0 victors over Saudi Arabia, on Thursday in Toulouse.
	   South Africa needs a victory to give itself a reasonable chance
of advancing past the first round. A draw would make it almost
impossible, while a loss would end all hope.
	   ``This is the most important game,'' captain Lucas Radebe said
Sunday. ``There's no way we can look for a draw. We want three
points.''
	   There was some good news Sunday, with Benni McCarthy of Ajax
Amsterdam upgraded to doubtful for Thursday after his injured left
ankle responded well to treatment. But fellow striker Phil Masinga
of Bari, also hobbled by a bad ankle, said he had trouble walking
Sunday and could sit out the Denmark match.
	   Masinga and McCarthy both missed a 90-minute training session
watched by hundreds of Vichy residents despite an intermittent
drizzle. If McCarthy and Masinga can't play Thursday, South
Africa's struggling attack _ which produced no quality shots on
goal against France _ will be further constrained.
	   No one openly criticized coach Philippe Troussier's
European-style system that emphasizes ball control and discipline.
But several players said South Africa should rely on its ``natural
style'' _ with more running and attacking _ that got it to the
World Cup for the first time.
	   ``I think we have to relax a bit and play our normal football
and go forward as much as possible,'' said Radebe, a Leeds United
defender. ``Against Denmark, we cannot stay back.''
	   Striker Jerry Sikhosana, who could play Thursday if McCarthy is
out, said the South Africans must be more aggressive.
	   ``Guys just need to take guys on,'' he said. ``We never had guys
running down past defenders, even at the risk of going offside. You
have to do it to stretch them out.''
	   Sikhosana said Troussier never wanted to stifle the players,
only to establish discipline that would complement their
athleticism.
	   ``He told us that against France we should play 60 percent of
our game and 40 percent of his,'' Sikhosana said. ``The guys got it
the other way around.''
	   Delron Buckley of Vfl Bochum in Germany, who has recovered from
a turned ankle and could play Thursday, said South Africa should
avoid playing a European style against a European team such as
Denmark.
	   ``The African guys have to play African,'' he said.

Can NATO intervention bring meaningful talks? With NATO-Kosovo; Yugoslavia-Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By ALISON SMALE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ NATO's show of force on the borders of
Serbia's secessionist Kosovo province is meant to scare Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic into renouncing violence and
negotiating an end to his conflict with Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority.
	   Even if Milosevic heeds the warning, it's questionable whether
he and the ethnic Albanians' leader, Ibrahim Rugova, can reach a
meaningful settlement.
	   Both men are beginning to lose authority among those they say
they represent.
	   Milosevic, who has ruled Serbia for 11 years, has the media and
political machine to sell such a solution to the Serbs. But Serbs
outside Kosovo are increasingly unwilling to fight for it, and
concede privately it is lost.
	   Perhaps more importantly, the influential Serbian Orthodox
Church now says Milosevic has no mandate to negotiate.
	   Rugova, 53, a bespectacled writer always wrapped in a trademark
long scarf, has refused to abandon his peaceful, Gandhi-like
struggle for Kosovo's independence from Serbia.
	   That has cost him popularity since March, when a Serbian police
crackdown that killed not only militants but also women and
children radicalized Kosovo's Albanians, especially young men no
longer willing to stand Milosevic's repression.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has thus grown massively,
despite lacking clear or widely known leadership.
	   Condemning the KLA's violence and not knowing its leaders, the
West has little choice but to support Rugova _ who in recent weeks
visited the White House and French President Jacques Chirac, but
hasn't been to see regions of Kosovo bombarded by the Serbs.
	   Now, even Rugova's close aides admit they cannot end the Kosovo
conflict without some contact with the KLA.
	   ``Our organizations should set up some kind of contact,'' said
Fehmi Agani, Rugova's No. 2. ``Otherwise, negotiations would be
pointless.''
	   NATO intervention can give Rugova the upper hand over the KLA
only if it is coupled with some kind of Western political solution,
Kosovo Albanian leaders say.
	   ``Rugova's policies partly failed because the world did not give
him this kind of support before,'' said former Kosovo Albanian
leader Azem Vlasi, alluding to the West's failure to address the
Kosovo problem until recently. Now, ``the only solution I see is a
Western intervention which would include a political solution.''
	   Albania itself, which could be regarded as an advocate for
either Rugova or the KLA, is divided as to whom to support.
	   The West has also given no clue as to what a long-term political
situation for Kosovo could be. One possibility is a partition of
Kosovo _ suggested already by, among others, influential Serbian
writer and former Yugoslav President Dobrica Cosic.
	   The lion's share of Kosovo territory would go to the ethnic
Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9 to 1 in the province. Serbs would
keep less territory, but get most of their prized religious and
cultural monuments, reflecting Kosovo's hallowed status among Serbs
as heart of their medieval empire and birthplace of their Orthodox
Church.
	   Using particularly strong language, the Serbian Orthodox Chruch
spoke out against Milosevic this weekend, condemning his regime as
incapable of reaching a peaceful solution.
	   ``The current regime should be denied the right to make any
decision or sign any agreements about Kosovo,'' Serbia's Orthodox
bishops declared this weekend, also urging the formation of a
``council of national salvation'' to rule instead of Milosevic.
	   ``There can be no solution under this regime, at least not a
just and peaceful one,'' one bishop, Artemije, said this weekend.
``In Serbia as it is now, neither Serbs nor Albanians wish to live
under this regime.''

World Cup: Maldini irritated by Baggio-Del Piero debate 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with later training detail
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Coach Cesare Maldini, annoyed with the
mounting nationwide attention given to the Baggio-Del Piero saga,
on Sunday criticized Premier Romano Prodi and called for more
concentration on Italy's next World Cup match against Cameroon.
	   ``I mean no offense, but as far as I know our premier is an
expert on bikes,'' Maldini said at Italy's training camp.
	   Prodi is known as a bike enthusiast. But like most Italians,
he's been fascinated by the possibility that the two imaginative
strikers could start together in Wednesday's second match of Group
B at Montpellier.
	   Italian sports analysts have suggested that World Cup veteran
Roberto Baggio, taken to France as a substitute for Alessandro Del
Piero, should be kept on the starting team now that the younger
star has recovered from a thigh strain and is ready to take his
place back.
	   Baggio was a key to Italy's 2-2 draw against Chile last
Thursday, in the absence of Del Piero. The 31-year-old veteran
forward, who recently signed with Inter Milan and will team with
Brazilian star Ronaldo next season, earned and converted a late
penalty at Bordeaux.
	   Others favor a possible rotation of the two forwards during the
next match, in a replay of the shared role between Sandro Mazzola
and Gianni Rivera at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico which touched off
controversy and divided the country.
	   ``I can understand that the fantasy of Italians is focused on
Del Piero and Baggio, who are two great players. But we must not
forget the other 20 players of the roster, who are also important
for going on in the competition,'' Maldini said.
	   ``We must focus on Cameroon, which is very strong athletically
and fields several players with experience in European Leagues and
Japan,'' Maldini said.
	   The African team held Austria to a 1-1 draw in its first World
Cup match.
	   ``Cameroon's new coach (Claude Le Roy) has greatly improved the
tactical quality. It's a dangerous team, and we must win to qualify
for the next round,'' the coach added.
	   In brief training games at Senlis Maldini has been testing Del
Piero and Baggio in an attacking trident including Christian Vieri
in a more offensive version of the traditional 4-4-2 tactic.
	   On Sunday they combined for five goals, Baggio and Vieri each
netting twice and Del Piero one.
	   However the coach quickly explained it was part of experiments
intended to have quick alternatives if they may be needed during
the next matches.
	   After Cameroon, Italy takes on Austria at Saint-Denis, outside
Paris.
	   ``We are working, making tests. By Wednesday everything will be
clear in my mind. It already is, actually,'' Maldini said without
elaborating.
	   Del Piero, 23, who was injured in the May 20 Champions Cup final
between Juventus and Real Madrid and has not been playing a match
since then, said he was ready to play Cameroon _ and to accept
Maldini's decisions.
	   ``Certainly I can play along with Roberto in a more offensive
team ... It's up to Maldini to take the decision,'' del Piero said.
``I don't think he can tell me to play 45 minutes and Roberto to
play the other 45 ... sincerely, I don't know if I can play the
full 90 minutes.''

World Cup: Nigeria takes a day to relish win over Spain 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ Bulgaria can wait, for one day at least.
Nigeria held a relaxed practice Sunday and relished its stunning
comeback defeat of Spain 24 hours earlier in its World Cup opener.
	   Coach Bora Milutinovic gave his charges the morning off, before
holding a 1 1-2 hour practice under cloudy skies and a brief
downpour in the early evening.
	   There were smiles all around at the training site in this small
village 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Paris.
	   ``We beat one excellent team and now it's time to move
forward,'' said Milutinovic, with his record fourth different World
Cup participant. ``We are all happy but there is no time for a
party. It's just one win. For a party, we have to do something more
important.''
	   While he worked with the reserves Sunday, most of the starters
horsed around in small groups. Sunday Oliseh, who drilled the
winning goal in the 3-2 win over Spain, joined Taribo West, Jay-Jay
Okocha and Victor Ikpeba in an improvised game of volleyball, using
anything but their hands to get the ball over an iron fence that
served as the net.
	   ``Tomorrow we'll start to think about Bulgaria and prepare for
that match,'' Milutinovic said.
	   The Super Eagles' opening game in France revealed their primary
strengths _ versatility, depth at midfield, overall team speed _
and weaknesses _ defense, ball control.
	   Particularly impressive about the way the squad twice came back
from one-goal deficits was that two key strikers, Olympic star
Nwankwo Kanu and Daniel Amokachi, did not play because of lingering
injuries.
	   ``The mentality of the players was great yesterday. They showed
excellent concentration and discipline, and,'' Milutinovic said,
pointing to his heart, ``they never lost confidence.''
	   The Yugoslav now has until Friday, when the team faces Bulgaria
in Paris, to solve the hole at right back. ``I have some changes in
my head,'' was all he would reveal.
	   Mobi Oparaku started in that spot against Spain and was beaten
repeatedly by Real Madrid star Raul. Oparaku, who replaced Jero
Shakpore _ out with a broken collarbone _ on the Nigeria roster
Wednesday, was often caught too far forward by the speedy Spaniard.
	   Another talented left-flank player awaits in Bulgaria's veteran
Hristo Stoichkov. The 1994 European player of the year is dangerous
either creating chances for others or shooting the ball himself.
But unlike Raul, the 32-year-old Stoichkov has lost a step or two.
	   ``We don't know a lot about Bulgaria,'' West said, ``they do
have a very good team up front. We just have to be humble.''
	   The game against Bulgaria is a rematch from the 1994 World Cup.
Nigeria won that encounter 3-0.
	   ``They are mostly the same team, with more experience,'' Oliseh
said of the Bulgarians. ``But I'm sure coach can cook up some
strategy to help us beat them.''

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi sent a
military delegation to Guinea-Bissau Sunday in a bid to broker
peace between warring rebel soldiers and government troops, Egypt's

	   It said the three-day visit to the West African nation was aimed
at reaching reconciliation between the warring sides so ``they can
concentrate on development.''
	   The fighting in Guinea-Bissau has been concentrated in a
garrison in the capital's suburb of Bra since a coup attempt a week

World Cup: Late goal gives Yugoslavs 1-0 victory over Iran 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES thruout with quotes
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ One of Sinisa Mihajlovic's
trademark free kicks gave Yugoslavia a 1-0 victory over underdogs
Iran in Sunday's opening Group F match at the World Cup.
	   In a game between two countries returning to the tournament
following politically related absences, Mihajlovic took the kick
from about 25 meters, slightly to the left of the goal.
	   Mihajlovic, who recently transferred to Italy's Lazio and is
famous for scoring such crucial goals, curved his low shot around
the Iranian wall and beat diving goalkeeper Nima Nakisa in the 73rd
minute.
	   ``This was my spot,'' Mihajlovic said after the match. ``I
scored many important goals from the same distance and it was
perfect for me.''
	   Although they dominated much of the match, the Yugoslavs failed
during the first half to test backup keeper Nakisa. Nakisa played
in place of captain Ahmadreza Abedzadeh, who is out with a knee
injury.
	   The Iranians, making their first World Cup appearance since the
Islamic revolution, played defensively, making frequent but
ineffective counterattacks.
	   Forward Ali Daei, who plays in Germany's Bundesliga, nearly tied
the game when he soared over two Yugoslav defenders to head a cross
into the arms of Yugoslavia's keeper Ivica Kralj with three minutes
remaining.
	   Yugoslav star striker Predrag Mijatovic was well guarded for
most of the match. His one opportunity came in the 82nd minute when
Nakisa palmed away his shot from 8 meters after Mijatovic had
drilled his way into the Iranian box.
	   Early in the second half, Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac
boosted the attack by bringing in his rising stars, 19-year-old
Dejan Stankovic and 20-year-old Perica Ognjenovic, in place of
midfielder Branko Brnovic and striker Savo Milosevic.
	   ``We played badly, especially in the midfield,'' Santrac said.
``Iranians were not as dangerous as we were bad.''
	   This was one of the sensitive matches in politically charged
Group F, which consists of Germany, longtime foes Iran and the
United States, and Europe's pariah state, Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia was barred from all sporting events _ including the
1994 World Cup in the United States _ after its forces attacked
Muslims Slavs during the Bosnian war. They are now shelling Muslim
Albanians in Kosovo province, a move that may invite U.S.-led NATO
airstrikes. Iran's Islamic government supports Muslims in Bosnia
and Albania.
	   ``I'm pleased with our performance as we played one of the best
and most experienced teams in Europe,'' said Iranian coach Jalal
Talebi. ``Our mission at the World Cup is not over with this loss.
We will fight on.''
	   Iran next plays its political rival the United States in what is
already dubbed one of the most contested matches at the World Cup.
Yugoslavia plays Germany.
	   The Iranians appeared tired in the second half, perhaps because
of a lengthy religious ceremony the team held the previous night.
Instead of getting a full night's sleep, the Iranian team was awake
until midnight performing a ritual in which players beat their
chests and wept for the death of a 7th century Shiite saint.
	   Iran was an Asian soccer power in the 1970s before the 1979
revolution, making its last World Cup appearance in 1978.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting escalated Sunday on several
fronts in the separatist province of Kosovo, with Serbs and ethnic
Albanian rebels accusing each other of starting a series of clashes
that killed at least five people.
	   Serb forces launched 500 grenades into villages in the Decani
area in western Kosovo, according to the Kosovo Information Center,
which is allied with the pro-independence Albanian leadership.
	   In the provincial capital Pristina, Serbian police colonel
Novica Zdravkovic told reporters that ethnic Albanian militants
killed two policemen and injured two others in separate incidents
in the city and the southwest of the province.
	   More than 300 people in Kosovo have died since the crisis
escalated in late March, when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a bloody crackdown on separatist-minded ethnic Albanian
militants fighting for the province's independence from the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Fearing the conflict could spill over Yugoslavia's borders into
neighboring Albania and Macedonia, Western countries warned
Milosevic last week to change his hard-line policy or face the
threat of force.
	   In northern Italy, NATO warplanes were grouping at an airbase to
prepare for simulated air attacks in Albania and Macedonia on
Monday to try to persuade Milosevic to halt the crackdown in
Kosovo.
	   On Sunday, the main ethnic Albanian party in the province, the
Democratic League of Kosovo, said Serbian authorities attacked
three villages in the Djakovica area with heavy artillery.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said that Serb forces launched
grenades against a cluster of villages northwest of Pristina in the
Drenica region, where the government crackdowns began earlier this
year.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed, as police
and ethnic Albanian militants, known as the Kosovo Liberation Army,
have set up a maze of blockades in the contested areas across the
province.
	   The KLA now controls about 40 percent of the province, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1. The militants are
particularly strong in the Djakovica and Drenica regions.
	   Reporters traveling southwest from Pristina Sunday drove into a
gunfight between the KLA and Yugoslav army soldiers, whose truck
was ambushed on the stretch of road that passes through a gorge.
	   The soldiers escaped, and brought two wounded comrades to a
nearby hospital.
	   An Albanian report, apparently about the same clash near the
town of Crnoljevo, 25 kilometers (16 miles) southwest of Pristina,
said three Albanians died after an army unit passing along the road
started firing at them.
	   A total of about 50,000 people have fled the fighting, many of
them across the border to neighboring Albania or to the other
Yugoslav republic, Montenegro.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 in an attempt
to suppress the Albanian independence movement. But since Serbs
launched a bloody crackdown in the region earlier this year, the
KLA has grown stronger and more popular among the ethnic Albanians.

English fans clash again with police; Argentina, Yugoslavia win Croatia-Jamaica AP Sports Writer

Eds: UPDATES with quote from Iranian coach; WILL be UPDATED with
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Soccer's ever-present fear of fan violence became a
sobering reality as England fans clashed with police for the second
straight day Sunday, stealing much of the spotlight as three
nations made their World Cup debuts.
	   In the southern port city of Marseille, several hundred English
soccer fans threw bottles and beer cans at riot police, who fired
back with tear gas. Scattered fights also broke out between British
and Tunisian fans, whose teams play Monday afternoon at the city's
Velodrome stadium.
	   Police, blaming the rampage on drunkenness, said they arrested
about 20 people.
	   Meanwhile, on-field violence was punished as Dutch striker
Patrick Kluivert was banned for two games for elbowing Belgium's
Lorenzo Staelens in the chest in an off-the-ball incident during
Saturday's 0-0 tie at Saint-Denis. Kluivert, who received a red
card for the foul, will miss the Netherlands' other Group E
first-round games against South Korea and Mexico.
	   Kluivert, who is black, said he elbowed Staelens after being
``deeply hurt'' by what he said were offensive comments made by the
Belgian defender.
	   ``I pushed him,'' Kluivert said. ``I couldn't control my
emotions.''
	   In Sunday's games, the well of goals that had been so prevalent
through the tournament's first four days began to dry up. Argentina
beat Japan and Yugoslavia downed Iran, both by the score of 1-0.
	   Later Sunday, newcomers Croatia and Jamaica played in Lens.
	   Japan, co-host of the 2002 finals and playing its first-ever
World Cup game, gave a valiant effort before falling on Gabriel
Batistuta's 28th minute goal in rainswept conditions at Toulouse.
	   ``It is very unfortunate that we could not score a goal. I
believe results count at the World Cup,'' said Japanese coach
Takeshi Okada, choked with emotion.
	   ``I think we were able to play as equals,'' Japanese defender
Naoki Soma said. ``We're almost there, and we'd shoot but we
couldn't score.''
	   Although they didn't dominate as much as expected, Argentina is
now expected to cruise into the second round in perhaps the softest
group in the tournament.
	   ``There are things we can improve,'' midfielder Diego Simeone
said. ``But the order of the day was to win, and we did.''
	   At Saint-Etienne, Sinisa Mihajlovic's 25-meter free kick in the
73rd minute gave Yugoslavia its victory in a game between two
countries back in the World Cup following politically-related
absences.
	   Yugoslavia was banned from the 1994 World Cup because of
international sanctions, while Iran's once-formidable soccer
program took a downturn after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   ``I'm pleased with our performance as we played one of the best
and most experienced teams in Europe,'' Iranian coach Jalal Talebi
said. ``Our mission at the World Cup is not over with this loss. We
will fight on.''
	   Iran's play was less intense in the second half, perhaps because
its players held a three-hour religious mourning ceremony at the
time many teams would be getting a good night's sleep. Players beat
their chests and wept as a religious teacher recounted the death of
a 7th century Shiite Muslim.
	   The ritual ended around midnight, about the same time that
English fans were causing the first round of trouble in Marseille.
An incident involving a motorist set off a melee involving some 200
fans who showered police and their vehicles with bottles and cans.
	   At least one gendarme was hospitalized with a head injury. Four
English fans were arrested.
	   As a result, authorities stepped up security immediately, with
about 1,900 police patrolling the city ahead of England's
first-round match against Tunisia on Monday night.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southampton, England, with his brother.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Also Sunday, French organizers said they had filed a complaint
against agents and tour operators allegedly involved in the World
Cup ticket scandal. Thousands of fans worldwide have been left
without tickets that had been promised to them or for which they
had paid.
	   ``We are going to court and an investigation will be carried
out,'' he said.
	   One prominent name who does have some tickets on hold has
decided not to show. Diego Maradona announced Sunday he will not
fly to France, at least for the time being, because he was
``depressed'' by a 34-month suspended sentence he received last
week for a 1994 shooting incident.
	   ``I feel very depressed and not inclined to take a decision on
covering the World Cup as a TV commentator, at least for the time
being,'' Maradona told a Buenos Aires radio station.

Germany's chancellor challenged to TV debate on election issues The Associated Press 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE BOEHMER
<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's main challenger
in September elections has invited him to television debates to
discuss political issues publicly, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   Calls were also stepped up for Kohl to quickly turn over the
chancellorship to his announced protege and conservative faction
leader in parliament, Wolfgang Schaeuble, if he wins reelection on
Sept. 27.
	   Such a move by the 68-year-old Kohl, who has been in office more
than 15 years, would improve reelection chances of the current
government coalition, his critics say.
	   Among the loudest was Guido Westerwelle, the General Secretary
of the centrist Free Democrats, who was quoted by the Munich-based
Focus magazine as saying: ``The entire staff is waiting for someone
to say to the senior chief: `Let the junior chiefs take it.'''
	   Meanwhile, the Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag newspaper said
Social Democratic candidate Gerhard Schroeder sent a letter to the
three faction chiefs of Kohl's coalition asking them to convince
the chancellor to take part in television debates.
	   ``Our differing positions should best be revealed and passed
along to the public in a series of debates on television,'' the
newspaper quoted Schroeder as saying.
	   The chances of Kohl accepting the charismatic Schroeder's
invitation appeared slim.
	   Rolf Kiefer, spokesman for Kohl's Christian Democrats, said
Schroeder has ``again somewhat misunderstood something.''
	   ``This isn't about a personality show, but about practical
political competition between a centrist coalition and a dangerous
leftist association,'' Kiefer said in Bonn.
	   According to a survey by the respected Emnid polling institute
commissioned by the government press office and published by the
Munich-based Focus magazine, Kohl is gaining and would get 40
percent of the vote in all of Germany and Schroeder 50 percent if
the election were held now.
	   A previous Emid poll for the first week of June had Schroeder at
56 percent with Kohl at 33 percent, the report said.
	   The magazine did not say how many people were queried in the
survey taken the second week of June, and the government press
office said it did not have the figures available Sunday.
	   No one was available at Emnid to provide the figures, but the
institute regularly reports polling more than 1,000 voting age
people in its surveys, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3-4
percent.

Americans planning donor conference for Palestinians 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with fresh Eizenstat quotes, meeting with Netanyahu in
grafs 12-13, details on conference in graf 3
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The United States is working to organize a
conference to collect billions of dollars in aid for the
cash-strapped Palestinian Authority, a top U.S. official said
Sunday.
	   Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat spoke during a visit to
the West Bank town of Nablus, where he viewed the Palestinian stock
exchange. He is scheduled to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Monday.
	   Eizenstat said a date for the conference had not yet been set
but the Palestinians would like to see it scheduled for October,
five years after the first such conference was held.
	   After the start of the peace process, Washington hosted a 1993
conference to raise funds for the Palestinians. Countries as poor
as India and as rich as Japan pitched in, pledging dlrs 3 billion
over five years.
	   Now Palestinian Authority officials are lobbying for a new
package to fund infrastructure projects. The 1998 Palestinian
budget of dlrs 1.8 billion is 50 percent dependent on foreign aid.
	   ``We are already beginning to think about the next five-year
program,'' Eizenstat, who is on his third visit to the region since
October, told reporters.
	   Eizenstat pointed to the fact that the Palestinian economy has
degenerated rather than improved since the signing of the 1993 Oslo
peace accords.
	   ``The Oslo agreements were supposed to produce hope, but the
economic circumstances are instead delivering despair, and this can
erode the constituency for peace,'' he said.
	   He said he was talking with Israel about ways to help improve
the flow of workers and goods in and out of the Palestinian lands.
	   Palestinians need permission to work within Israel, and Israel
also bars Palestinian vehicles from entering. Export delays for
Palestinian goods often lead to huge economic losses.
	   Eizenstat called Palestinian prosperity ``a win-win situation''
for both Palestinians and Israel.
	   ``Poverty and deprivation are a breeding ground for
instability,'' he said.
	   Israeli and Palestinian economies, Eizenstat said in a speech in
Jerusalem later, ``are joined at the hip and there is an
interdependence,'' he said, adding that 85 percent of Palestinian
exports go to Israel and Israel's second largest export markets is
the Palestinian territories.
	   Eizenstat met in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu who said he hoped 1998 would prove to be a fruitful year
for the Palestinian economy.
	   Netanyahu said he believed that a drop in attacks against
Israelis was the key to a successful Palestinian economy.
	   Eizenstat is scheduled to meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Monday.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A young Palestinian with a knife in his hand
was arrested Sunday in a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem after he
entered a girls' school and tried to stab one of the students,
police said.
	   A taxi driver who saw the incident fired some shots into the air
with a pistol and the young man ran off. Passersby chased him and
overpowered him, police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said.
	   The suspect, 22-year-old Jalel Abu-Sirhan from the West Bank
town of Bethlehem, slipped into a technological school in the
Romema district of west Jerusalem while the security guard was
temporarily absent from the gate, Ben-Ruby said.
	   The suspect, who seemed to be mentally disturbed, kept mumbling
that he wanted to stab Jews, Ben-Ruby said.
	   When questioned later about the incident, Abu-Sirhan told police
he wanted to murder Jews because he doesn't have a steady
girlfriend. He will stay in custody for ten days, said Ben Ruby.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Europe's new currency, the euro, will
rival the U.S. dollar as an international currency over the long
term, Der Spiegel magazine reported Sunday.
	   A number of countries are already planning to hold the euro as
part of their foreign currency reserves, the magazine quoted
European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg as saying.
	   Oil imports to Europe can also be calculated in euros as well as
dollars, Duisenberg was quoted as saying.
	   ``That which the Americans see as their automatic right, namely
the financing of their enormous trade deficit by other countries in
their own currency, won't be automatically acceptable any more,''
Spiegel quoted Duisenberg as saying.
	   The report also said Duisenberg expects the future relationship
between the dollar and the euro, which officially goes into effect
on Jan. 12, to be stable.

EU sees no quick improvement in relations with Turkey 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-EU Summit
<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Chances of an improvement in strained
EU-Turkey relations are not good, officials said Sunday, the eve of
a European Union summit at which it was hoped the leaders could
mend fences with Ankara.
	   Alastair Campbell, spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, the current EU president, said Prime Minister Costas Simitis
of Greece opposes concessions to Ankara, which has been snubbed as
a candidate EU member.
	   Simitis told Blair in London on Saturday that he opposed adding
Turkey as yet to a group of 11 nations with which the EU has begun
membership talks.
	   Campbell said here that it was ``wrong to raise any expectations
there is going to be a significant breakthrough'' in relations with
Turkey at the two-day summit, which opens Monday.
	   Turkey was snubbed as an EU candidate at a summit last December
because of its poor human rights record, territorial disputes with
Greece and occupation of northern Cyprus. Instead, it was offered a
special relationship, including annual summits with EU leaders.
	   Offended, Turkey froze relations, but hopes of reconciliation
were raised last month when German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
and his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, jointly pledged to renew a
dialogue.
	   Blair told Simitis it was time to reopen ``fruitful
discussions'' with Turkey, Campbell said.
	   Greece has said it will not soften its hard-line position unless
Turkey settles territorial disputes with Greece through the
International Court of Justice in The Hague.
	   Cyprus, too, complicates matters. The EU has opened membership
talks with the Greek Cypriot side after Turkish Cypriots refused to
join an all-Cyprus negotiating team.

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans clashed with
Tunisian fans and for the second day with riot police Sunday, the
eve of an England-Tunisia match that has prompted beefed-up
security.
	   Several hundred English soccer fans threw bottles and beer cans
at police with helmets and shields, who fired back with tear gas.
Scattered fights also broke out between British and Tunisian fans,
police said.
	   No injuries were immediately reported. Authorities said they
arrested about 20 people, and calm returned to the Old Port after
police cleared the area.
	   Some British fans said they were embarrassed by the violence
their government has long sought to combat.
	   ``People who do that aren't the real fans,'' said Michael
Barrett, a 29-year-old Londoner. ``Wherever they go, there are
problems. ... It's too bad for the image we give of England.''
	   Rubbing his eyes from tear gas, George Fenwick of Gloucester
insisted he wasn't violent. ``But since the afternoon, the
Tunisians were provoking us, insulting us and making obscene
gestures.. Some young English fell into the trap and couldn't
control themselves.''
	   French television also showed English fans burning a Tunisian
flag, angering mostly French-born Tunisians from the Marseille
area.
	   ``One of them threatened us with a knife,'' said Majhid Bouzbhi.
``I'm worried about tomorrow's match.''
	   English fans pelted police overnight after a motorist who tried
to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one of the
fans.
	   Of four English fans arrested in that clash, a 20-year-old
Liverpool railroad employee remained in custody to face charges in
court Monday for allegedly attacking police.
	   Earlier Sunday, dozens of officers patrolled the port and down
the Canebiere, the city's main avenue, where sun-drenched cafes
brimmed with flag-waving English fans who chanted, drank and talked
to the locals throughout the day.
	   Beaches were filled with tourists, locals and topless
sunbathers. The British tabloid The Sun sent a topless orange
double-decker bus around town, with model-TV hostess Melinda
Messenger handing out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans clashed with
Tunisian fans and for the second day with riot police Sunday, the
eve of an England-Tunisia match that has prompted beefed-up
security.
	   Several hundred English soccer fans threw bottles and beer cans
at police with helmets and shields, who fired back with tear gas.
Scattered fights also broke out between British and Tunisian fans,
police said.
	   No injuries were immediately reported. Authorities said they
arrested about 20 people, and calm returned to the Old Port after
police cleared the area.
	   Some British fans said they were embarrassed by the violence
their government has long sought to combat.
	   ``People who do that aren't the real fans,'' said Michael
Barrett, a 29-year-old Londoner. ``Wherever they go, there are
problems. ... It's too bad for the image we give of England.''
	   Rubbing his eyes from tear gas, George Fenwick of Gloucester
insisted he wasn't violent. ``But since the afternoon, the
Tunisians were provoking us, insulting us and making obscene
gestures.. Some young English fell into the trap and couldn't
control themselves.''
	   French television also showed English fans burning a Tunisian
flag, angering mostly French-born Tunisians from the Marseille
area.
	   ``One of them threatened us with a knife,'' said Majhid Bouzbhi.
``I'm worried about tomorrow's match.''
	   English fans pelted police overnight after a motorist who tried
to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one of the
fans.
	   Of four English fans arrested in that clash, a 20-year-old
Liverpool railroad employee remained in custody to face charges in
court Monday for allegedly attacking police.
	   Earlier Sunday, dozens of officers patrolled the port and down
the Canebiere, the city's main avenue, where sun-drenched cafes
brimmed with flag-waving English fans who chanted, drank and talked
to the locals throughout the day.
	   Beaches were filled with tourists, locals and topless
sunbathers. The British tabloid The Sun sent a topless orange
double-decker bus around town, with model-TV hostess Melinda
Messenger handing out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.
	   Vans of CRS and gendarmes stood ready in several Marseille
neighborhoods.

Precede BRUSSELS NATO prepares for show of force in Balkans from USS Wasp in Adriatic; EDITS to TRIM 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with QUOTES from air forces commander at Aviano and
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ NATO warplanes from 13 nations
converged on this base in northeast Italy for a show of power
Monday over Albania and Macedonia that allied leaders hope will
convince Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to back down in
Kosovo.
	   ``This is an exercise intended to demonstrate the alliance's
commitment to peace and stability in the region and the alliance's
ability to project power into the region,'' Lt. Gen. Michael Short,
commander of the air forces in NATO's allied forces southern Europe
division, told reporters here Sunday evening.
	   The planes will come from 15 bases in five nations as well as
from carriers in the Adriatic Sea.
	   Scores of aircraft operating from Aviano air base north of
Venice and from an American amphibious task force in the Adriatic
were scheduled to participate in exercise Determined Falcon, from
early Monday morning until about midday, U.S. Navy officials said.
	   On the USS Wasp, an amphibious assault carrier in the Adriatic
which will provide four Harrier attack craft for the mission, Col.
Emerson Gardner told reporters: ``We need to show the people that
need to know exactly what we can do.''
	   The NATO action was ordered by allied defense ministers Thursday
as the bloodshed in the Serbian province of Kosovo increased in the
face of a government offensive to put down a rebellion by the
Kosovo Liberation Army and rebel attacks on Serbian forces.
	   More than 300 people have died as the Serb-led Yugoslav
government tries to suppress the increasingly radical independence
movement among Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
the province's population.
	   Emerson noted the Serbs have wide-range fighters like the MiG
21s and the newer MiG 29s, with surface-to-air missiles.
	   The Harrier are armed with air-to-air weapons for defense.
	   ``But all the risks have been assessed and we have taken
measures against it,'' Emerson said without elaborating. ``We feel
the mission can be accomplished safely.''
	   ``We will be close enough that the Serbs will know NATO will be
there,'' said Emerson when asked how close to border and how close
to the ground the aircraft will fly.
	   The Western allies oppose independence for the province, but
they also want to stop Milosevic's brutal attempts to suppress
dissent.
	   The great fear is that if the two sides aren't brought to the
negotiating table, the Kosovo fighting will spill over Yugoslavia's
borders and ignite a wider Balkan war.
	   NATO has ordered its military planners to study a range of
options for even tougher action, including direct military
intervention in Yugoslavia with air strikes and use of ground
forces. NATO insists, however, that it is only studying its options
to be ready for any political decisions.
	   Countries sending aircraft for the exercises include the United
States, France, Britain, Spain, Turkey, Denmark, the Netherlands
and Belgium.
	   The United States will reportedly supply Air Force F-16
fighters, KC-135 tankers and EA-6B airborne early warning planes.
	   The amphibious force led by the USS Wasp includes the amphibious
assault ship USS Trenton and the dock landing ship USS Portland.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the alliance continues
to support a political solution to the Kosovo problem, one that
both gives an ``enhanced status'' to Kosovo, but also ``preserves
the territorial integrity'' of Yugoslavia.

EU sees no quick improvement in relations with Turkey With EU Summit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Chances of an improvement in strained
EU-Turkey relations are not good, officials said Sunday, the eve of
a two-day European Union summit where it was hoped the leaders
could mend fences with Ankara.
	   Alastair Campbell, spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, the current EU president, said Prime Minister Costas Simitis
of Greece opposes concessions to Ankara, which has been snubbed as
a candidate EU member.
	   Simitis told Blair in London on Saturday that he opposed adding
Turkey to a group of 11 nations with which the EU has begun
membership talks.
	   In Cardiff, Campbell said it was ``wrong to raise any
expectations there is going to be a significant breakthrough'' in
relations with Turkey at the summit that opens Monday.
	   Turkey was snubbed as an EU candidate at a summit last December
because of its poor human rights record, territorial disputes with
Greece and occupation of northern Cyprus. Instead, it was offered a
special relationship, including annual summits with EU leaders.
	   Offended, Turkey froze relations, but hopes of reconciliation
were raised last month when German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
and his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, jointly pledged to renew a
dialogue.
	   Blair told Simitis it was time to reopen ``fruitful
discussions'' with Turkey, Campbell said.
	   Greece has said it will not soften its hard-line position unless
Turkey settles territorial disputes with Greece through the
International Court of Justice in The Hague.
	   Cyprus, too, complicates matters. The EU has opened membership
talks with the Greek Cypriot side after Turkish Cypriots refused to
join an all-Cyprus negotiating team.

Two-day strike slows London Underground 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ London's underground train network slowed sharply
Sunday evening when one of the rail unions began a 48-hour strike.
The government urged people not to try to drive into the capital on
Monday and Tuesday.
	   Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union voted for the
action after pressing for government assurances that conditions of
service, jobs and pensions will not be affected by plans for
private firms to become involved in running parts of the network.
	   More than 2 million people, including commuters and tourists,
travel every day on the London Underground, familiarly known as the
``tube.''
	   ``I would encourage people to walk or cycle wherever feasible,''
Transport Minister Glenda Jackson said Sunday, adding that
employers should encourage staff to stagger working hours, arrange
alternative forms of transport, or work from home.
	   Her appeal will be welcomed by English soccer fans looking for
an excuse to stay home in front of the TV during their team's
opening game in the World Cup on Monday.
	   London Underground employees represented by the RMT union
stopped showing up for work as the strike began at 1730 GMT Sunday,
but the Underground said some services were still running.
	   The union represents one-third of the tube staff and some
stations will remain open with trains staffed by workers from
another union, said Mark Chapman, a spokesman for the Underground.
	   As for Monday, Chapman said: ``Very broadly speaking, we're
expecting about half of the services will run.''
	   The head of the striking union, Jimmy Knapp, had previously
predicted the walkout would cause ``complete stoppage'' of the
network.
	   The strike is to end at 1729 GMT on Tuesday.

By ISMET HAJDARI

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting escalated on several Kosovo
fronts Sunday, with Serbs and Albanians accusing the other of
starting a series of clashes that killed at least five people, on
the eve of NATO exercises in the region.
	   The Kosovo Information center, close to the pro-independence
Albanian leadership, Serb forces launched 500 grenades into
villages in the Decani area in western Kosovo Sunday, in what
appears to be another crackdown on armed ethnic Albanian
secessionists.
	   In Pristina, Serbian police colonel Novica Zdravkovic, told
reporters ethnic Albanian militants killed two policemen and
injured two others in separate incidents, one in Kosovo's
southwestern Djakovica region and in the western Decani region.
	   More than 300 people in Kosovo have died since the crisis
escalated in late March, when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a bloody crackdown on separatist-minded ethnic Albanian
militants fighting to secede the province from Serbia.
	   Fearing the conflict could spill over Yugoslavia's borders into
neighboring Albania and Macedonia, the West warned Milosevic last
week he must change his hardline policy in the region or face the
threat of force.
	   On Sunday, the main ethnic Albanian party in the province, the
Democratic League of Kosovo, also said Serbian ``military and
police forces ... began a broad attack against three villages in
the Djakovica area... with heavy artillery.''
	   The Kosovo Information Center said that Serb police brought a
reinforcement of about 40 armored vehicles and 15 tanks into the
Djakovica region, near the border with Albania.
	   The center also said Serb forces launched grenades against a
cluster of villages northwest of Pristina in the Drenica region,
where the government crackdowns began earlier this year.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed, as police
and ethnic Albanian militants, known as the Kosovo Liberation Army,
have set up a maze of road blocks across the province.
	   The KLA now control estimated 40 percent of the province, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   A group of reporters traveling southwest from Pristina drove
into an exchange of fire between the KLA and Yugoslav army
soldiers, whose truck was ambushed on the stretch of road that
passes through a gorge.
	   An Albanian report, apparently about the same clash near the
town of Crnoljevo, 25 kilometers (16 miles) southwest of Pristina
said three Albanians died, after an army unit passing along the
road allegedly started firing on them.
	   A total of about 50,000 people have fled the fighting, many of
them across the border to neighboring Albania or to Montenegro,
which together with Serbia forms Yugoslavia.
	   In northern Italy, NATO warplanes were convening at an airbase
Sunday to prepare for simulated air attacks in Albania and
Macedonia planned for Monday to try and persuade Milosevic to halt
military action in Kosovo.
	   Outside of Belgrade Sunday Yugoslavia demonstrated its own air
power, in an airshow displaying military helicopters and planes,
including Russian-made MiG29 jets. The show is an annual event
marking Yugoslav Army Day on June 16.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 in an attempt
to suppress the Albanian independence movement. But since Serbs
launched a bloody crackdown in the region earlier this year, the
KLA has grown stronger and more popular among the ethnic Albanians.

World Cup: Mihajlovic hands Yugoslavia 1-0 victory over Iran 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional lead. Updates with more quotes.
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ One of Sinisa Mihajlovic's
trademark free kicks saved the day for Yugoslavia in its return to
the World Cup.
	   Famous for scoring crucial goals from long-distance free kicks,
Mihajlovic's blast was enough for struggling Yugoslavia's 1-0
victory Sunday over Iran in the first Group F match.
	   In a game between two countries returning to the tournament
following politically-related absences, the free-kick specialist
took the kick from about 25 meters, slightly to the left of the
goal.
	   Mihajlovic, who has scored many such crucial goals in the past _
including during a 1-1 tie with Slovakia that led Yugoslavia to the
World Cup _ curved his low shot around the Iranian wall and beat
diving goalkeeper Nima Nakisa in the 73rd minute.
	   ``This was my spot,'' Mihajlovic said after the match. ``I
scored many important goals from the same distance and it was
perfect for me.''
	   ``Those free-kicks help, especially if my team isn't playing
well,'' said the smiling 29-year-old, who just transferred from
Sampdoria to Lazio in Italy and who has dual Yugoslav-Italian
citizenship.
	   Although they dominated much of the match, the favored Yugoslavs
failed during the first half to test backup keeper Nakisa. Nakisa
played in place of captain Ahmadreza Abedzadeh, who is out with a
knee injury.
	   The Iranians, making their first World Cup appearance since the
Islamic revolution, played defensively, making frequent but
ineffective counterattacks.
	   Forward Ali Daei, who plays in Germany's Bundesliga, nearly tied
the game when he soared over two Yugoslav defenders to head a cross
into the arms of Yugoslavia's keeper Ivica Kralj with three minutes
remaining.
	   Yugoslav star striker Predrag Mijatovic was well guarded for
most of the match. His one opportunity came in the 82nd minute when
Nakisa palmed away his shot from 8 meters after Mijatovic had
drilled his way into the Iranian box.
	   Early in the second half, Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac
boosted the attack by bringing in his rising stars, 19-year-old
Dejan Stankovic and 20-year-old Perica Ognjenovic, in place of
midfielder Branko Brnovic and striker Savo Milosevic.
	   ``We played badly, especially in the midfield,'' Santrac said.
``Iranians were not as dangerous as we were bad.''
	   This was one of the sensitive matches in politically charged
Group F, which consists of Germany, longtime foes Iran and the
United States, and Europe's pariah state, Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia was barred from all sporting events _ including the
1994 World Cup in the United States _ after its forces attacked
Muslims Slavs during the Bosnian war. They are now shelling Muslim
Albanians in Kosovo province, a move that may invite U.S.-led NATO
airstrikes. Iran's Islamic government supports Muslims in Bosnia
and Albania.
	   ``I'm pleased with our performance as we played one of the best
and most experienced teams in Europe,'' said Iranian coach Jalal
Talebi. ``Our mission at the World Cup is not over with this loss.
We will fight on.''
	   The Iranians appeared tired in the second half, perhaps because
of a lengthy religious ceremony the team held the previous night.
Instead of getting a full night's sleep, the Iranian team was awake
until midnight performing a ritual in which players beat their
chests and wept for the death of a 7th century Shiite saint.
	   Iran was an Asian soccer power in the 1970s before the 1979
revolution, making its last World Cup appearance in 1978.

Gorbachev urges United States to end Cuban embargo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, whose reforms heralded the end of the Soviet Union, is
urging the United States to loosen its embargo against Cuba.
	   In an interview published Sunday, Gorbachev told the San Juan
Star that an increase of trade would spur moves toward democracy.
Gorbachev visited Puerto Rico on Saturday to attend a dinner
sponsored by the State of the World Forum.
	   ``I think it's a shame that the blockade is continuing,''
Gorbachev said. ``If it is lifted, very soon there would be a rapid
process of democratization in Cuba.''
	   He warned the United States against making Castro a target for
diplomatic pressure, calling the Cuban president a ``broad-minded''
leader who ``requires that he be respected.''
	   ``I do not share the longer view that one country or even a
group of countries can set conditions on others, such as removal of
a particular leader or government official,'' he said.

Concern over radiation cloud from Spanish steel mill first detected elsewhere in Europe 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Nuclear authorities moved Sunday to counter
criticism from environmental groups prompted by revelations that a
steel mill in southern Spain was the probable source of a radiation
cloud first detected elsewhere in Europe.
	   The Nuclear Security Council issued a statement ``to calm
(misplaced) public fears about radioactive risk to the environment
or the population, and reclaim confidence in the technical rigor
(of existing controls).''
	   Increases of Cesium 137 were discovered at the beginning of the
month in France, Switzerland and Italy, puzzling scientists trying
to identify the cause.
	   Then on June 12th the Spanish nuclear council revealed that a
privately-owned steel plant located in the city of Algeciras on the
southern tip of Spain, had reported this same radioactive isotope
in one of its chimneys.
	   The council said the levels of radioactivity were too low to
cause concern.
	   But environmental groups such as Greenpeace raised the alarm
about negligence and a possible cover-up, while the Italian
government accused Spain of not informing it about the leak.
	   In Sunday's statement, the council countered accusations that it
had failed to detect or reveal the cloud's passage north across
Spain with the hypothesis that it had traveled over the
Mediterranean.
	   ``The Cesium was not detected by the (high precision) laboratory
in Madrid nor at any other point on the Spanish network because the
diffusion isotope was beyond the Spanish coastline,'' the statement
said.
	   According to the council, initial evidence traced the cloud to
radioactive scrap metal of unknown origin melted down at the plant
at the end of May.
	   Workers who had come into contact with it were called for a
medical evaluation due Monday.

First woman accepted to El Al's pilot course 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A woman who sued Israel's national airlines for
sex discrimination was admitted to the company's pilot program
Sunday, more than three years after she handed in her application.
	   In December El Al announced a new equal opportunity employment
policy shortly after Orit Katsir, a pilot who flew for commercial
airlines in the United States, won her suit against the airline
whose policy was to only accept applicants who were former Israeli
air force pilots.
	   The Israeli air force, until compelled last year by Israel's
Supreme Court to change its policy, only accepted men to its pilots
course.
	   ``For the first time a woman has been accepted as a student for
the El Al pilot course,'' said a statement by the company's
spokesman Nachman Klieman. ``Katsir was informed Saturday by
telephone that she has been accepted.'' Katsir and 15 others were
accepted to the course which begins next month.
	   El Al's new policy also opened the door to civilian pilots who
gained experience in civil aviation through other companies, and to
Israeli Arabs who generally do not serve in the Israeli army.

Japan Airlines plane swerves off runway while landing in Manila, 23 injured

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Japan Airlines plane swerved
halfway off the runway and stuck in the mud as it was landing in a
heavy rain at Manila's airport Sunday, blocking the tarmac and
forcing the airport to close, officials said.
	   At least 23 passengers were injured while being evacuated down
emergency chutes from the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 jet, airport
health officials said.
	   Flight JL 745, which originated at Tokyo's Narita airport with
264 people aboard, was making its second landing approach when the
accident occurred Sunday night, tower supervisor Rolly Pelayo said.
	   He said the pilot had been apprehensive because of limited
visibility caused by a thunderstorm during the first landing
attempt.
	   It was still raining during the second approach, according to
the pilot, Capt. Takayashi Minami.
	   ``There was plenty of water on the runway,'' he said. ``It was
very bad.''
	   Minami told airport General Manager Francisco Alayed that when
he reversed the thrust of the two engines to slow the plane after
touching down he felt the left engine reverse, but not the right
one. That forced the plane to swerve to the left, he said.
	   The plane's left and central landing gear veered off the runway
and into the mud. They left a long skid mark in the muddy grass and
the plane stopped at an angle with its left wing and engine close
to the ground.
	   Most of the injuries were minor, but three passengers _ two
Japanese and a Filipino _ were hospitalized, officials said.
	   Three other international flights scheduled to arrive after the
Japan Airlines flight were diverted to other airports. Manila's
airport has only one runway long enough to service large planes.
	   Airport personnel were attempting to lift the plane with large
inflatable airbags to clear the runway before a planned flight
early Monday by President Fidel Ramos to Senegal, where he is to
receive a U.N. peace award for his role in forging a peace accord
with Muslim rebels.

Friend of Rabin killer convicted; failed to tell police of intent assassination 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with state considering charging former informant in
By DANNY BEN-TAL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A young woman who was a friend of
Yitzhak Rabin's killer was convicted Sunday of failing to inform
the police of his murderous intentions.
	   Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, could face up to two years in prison.
Her lawyer said an appeal is planned.
	   Rabin's widow, Leah, expressed relief over the conviction,
calling it a ``ray of light in the darkness surrounding us.''
	   Har-Shefi was a friend of Yigal Amir, who boasted to her that he
was planning to assassinate the prime minister in order to stop the
peace process and the handing over of land to the Palestinians.
Amir is serving a life sentence for the November 1995 murder.
	   State prosecutor Edna Arbel is now considering charging another
friend of Amir's, Avishai Raviv, a right wing extremist who also
acted as an informant for the Shin Bet government agency. A
statement from Arbel's office said a decision regarding Raviv would
be made ``within a few weeks.''
	   An indictment against Raviv who was briefly detained and then
released after the murder was thought to be unlikely because it may
expose secretive tactics of the Shin Bet. But Israeli media
reported that Shin Bet chief Ami Ayalon recently withdrew his
opposition to an indictment against Raviv.
	   Har-Shefi had pleaded innocent in her case, telling the Tel Aviv
Magistrates Court she did not believe Amir really intended to kill
Rabin and that she thought Amir was just trying to impress her.

Fighting escalates in Guinea-Bissau, direct hits on foreign embassies reported 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with reports from the U.S., Sweden and Britain that
their nationals thought safe 9th-12th graf, EDITS to conform
By BARRY HATTON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fierce fighting between rebel soldiers
and government troops in Guinea-Bissau continued Sunday as the
insurgents denied government claims that they had been crushed,
according to reports.
	   The two sides were pounding each other's positions in the
capital Bissau with rockets, mortars and artillery, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported.
	   Caught in the middle, the U.S. and Swedish embassies, the main
hospital and the Finance Ministry had taken direct hits, Portuguese
radio RDP-Africa said. Damage to the Russian and French embassies
was reported earlier in the day.
	   With the fighting escalating, thousands of people were
desperately seeking an escape route. The first reports emerged
Sunday that 200 people had drowned as they fled Bissau by boat two
days before.
	   The refugees were on their way to the Bissagos archipelago, 48
kilometers (30 miles) off the coast of this west African country,
Lusa said.
	   There was no reliable information on the number of casualties in
the fighting. International phone lines to the former Portuguese
colony were not working.
	   A Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman said that embassy staff
in Bissau were holed up in the building due to the fighting
outside.
	   The situation was ``still very serious'' he said.
	   A spokesman from the Foreign Office in London said that the six
Britons known to be still in the country were thought safe.
	   Three British voluntary workers had fled late Saturday on a
flight chartered by American authorities to evacuated U.S. Peace
Corps workers.
	   All Americans who wanted to leave have done so safely, including
Ambassador Peggy Blackford and her four remaining staff, who left
Sunday before the shelling, U.S. State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said.
	   Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman Tommy Andersson reported that
about two dozen Nordic citizens in Guinea Bissau were safe, and
there were no plans to evacuate them despite heavy shelling.
	   Fighting between the rebels and government forces, backed by
reinforcements from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea,
has centered on a garrison in the suburb of Bra where the mutineers
have been holed up since launching their coup attempt a week ago.
	   The military complex, covering several hectares (acres) and
surrounded by high walls, occupies a strategic defensive position
in Bissau.
	   A rebel spokesman described as ``pure propaganda'' the
government's claim, made on state radio Saturday, that the
renegades had been dislodged from their stronghold, Lusa reported.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes reportedly was speaking on a private radio
station seized by the rebels.
	   He said the mutineers were ready to allow emergency food aid to
be flown into the capital's international airport, located near the
garrison, which they also control, the report said.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who gained renown as a guerilla fighter in the war against
Portuguese rule from 1961 to 1974.
	   Mane was fired in January amid allegations of smuggling arms to
separatists in Senegal and formally stepped down a week ago.
	   He has accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption and
called on him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.
	   President of Gambia Yahya Jammeh offered to mediate in the
conflict, Lusa reported Sunday.
	   Mane is originally from Gambia, and the rebels had previously
suggested talks on Gambian soil.

English clash with Tunisians, police; security heightened 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with up to 100 English fans arrested, damage
AP Photos MAR101-103

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans smashed windows,
fought with Tunisian fans and clashed with riot police in a second
day of violence Sunday, the eve of an England-Tunisia match.
	   Police said they arrested as many as 100 of the English fans in
a series of clashes that continued into Sunday evening, with some
youths breaking shop windows. Several of the fans suffered minor
injuries, authorities said.
	   About a hundred other singing and chanting English fans, many
drunk and shirtless, stood outside an Irish pub along one side of
the Old Port, littered with an overturned car, broken glass and
scattered cafe chairs.
	   As a result, authorities canceled a free evening concert in the
Old Port, and restaurants closed for the night, while diners
cowered in eateries that remained open.
	   Several hundred English soccer fans earlier threw bottles and
beer cans at police with helmets and shields, who fired back with
tear gas. Scattered fights also broke out between British and
Tunisian fans, police said.
	   Some British fans said they were embarrassed by the violence
their government has long sought to combat.
	   ``People who do that aren't the real fans,'' said Michael
Barrett, a 29-year-old Londoner. ``Wherever they go, there are
problems. ... It's too bad for the image we give of England.''
	   Rubbing his eyes from tear gas, George Fenwick of Gloucester
insisted he wasn't violent. ``But since the afternoon, the
Tunisians were provoking us, insulting us and making obscene
gestures.. Some young English fell into the trap and couldn't
control themselves.''
	   French television also showed English fans burning a Tunisian
flag, angering mostly French-born Tunisians from the Marseille
area.
	   ``One of them threatened us with a knife,'' said Majhid Bouzbhi.
``I'm worried about tomorrow's match.''
	   English fans pelted police overnight after a motorist who tried
to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one of the
fans.
	   Of four English fans arrested in that clash, a 20-year-old
Liverpool railroad employee remained in custody to face charges in
court Monday for allegedly attacking police.
	   Earlier Sunday, dozens of officers patrolled the port and down
the Canebiere, the city's main avenue, where sun-drenched cafes
brimmed with flag-waving English fans who chanted, drank and talked
to the locals throughout the day.
	   Beaches were filled with tourists, locals and topless
sunbathers. The British tabloid The Sun sent a topless orange
double-decker bus around town, with model-TV hostess Melinda
Messenger handing out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.
	   Vans of CRS and gendarmes stood ready in several Marseille
neighborhoods.

English clash with Tunisians, police; security heightened

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans smashed windows,
fought with Tunisian fans and clashed with riot police in a second
day of violence Sunday, the eve of an England-Tunisia match.
	   Police said they arrested as many as 100 of the English fans in
a series of clashes that continued into Sunday evening, with some
youths breaking shop windows. Several of the fans suffered minor
injuries, authorities said.
	   About a hundred other singing and chanting English fans, many
drunk and shirtless, stood outside an Irish pub along one side of
the Old Port, littered with an overturned car, broken glass and
scattered cafe chairs.
	   As a result, authorities canceled a free evening concert in the
Old Port, and restaurants closed for the night, while diners
cowered in eateries that remained open.
	   Several hundred English soccer fans earlier threw bottles and
beer cans at police with helmets and shields, who fired back with
tear gas. Scattered fights also broke out between British and
Tunisian fans, police said.
	   Some British fans said they were embarrassed by the violence
their government has long sought to combat.
	   ``People who do that aren't the real fans,'' said Michael
Barrett, a 29-year-old Londoner. ``Wherever they go, there are
problems. ... It's too bad for the image we give of England.''
	   Rubbing his eyes from tear gas, George Fenwick of Gloucester
insisted he wasn't violent. ``But since the afternoon, the
Tunisians were provoking us, insulting us and making obscene
gestures.. Some young English fell into the trap and couldn't
control themselves.''
	   French television also showed English fans burning a Tunisian
flag, angering mostly French-born Tunisians from the Marseille
area.
	   ``One of them threatened us with a knife,'' said Majhid Bouzbhi.
``I'm worried about tomorrow's match.''
	   English fans pelted police overnight after a motorist who tried
to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one of the
fans.
	   Of four English fans arrested in that clash, a 20-year-old
Liverpool railroad employee remained in custody to face charges in
court Monday for allegedly attacking police.
	   Earlier Sunday, dozens of officers patrolled the port and down
the Canebiere, the city's main avenue, where sun-drenched cafes
brimmed with flag-waving English fans who chanted, drank and talked
to the locals throughout the day.
	   Beaches were filled with tourists, locals and topless
sunbathers. The British tabloid The Sun sent a topless orange
double-decker bus around town, with model-TV hostess Melinda
Messenger handing out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.
	   Vans of CRS and gendarmes stood ready in several Marseille
neighborhoods.

World Cup: Late Earle goal give Jamaicans 1-1 draw 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Robbie Earl knocked in a high ball with a
powerful header in the 45th minute, and Jamaica shared a 1-1 draw
with Croatia at halftime in the World Cup debut for both teams
Sunday night.
	   Earle's goal from eight yards came on only the third touch for
Jamaica in Croatia's penalty area in the half, but was enough to
get the Reggae Boyz faithful pounding their drums two levels
higher.
	   Earle ran full stride down the middle of the area past a
defender and leaped to direct Ricardo Gardener's pass inside the
left post.
	   Mario Stanic put in a rebound from six meters in the 27th minute
to give Croatia the lead.
	   Igor Stimac hit the crossbar from 10 meters off a from Dario
Simic cross from the end line and the rebound came to the feet of
Stanic, who had to step to his left to settle the ball before
shooting into an empty net.
	   It was only the second serious chance Croatia had in the first
45 minutes, although they clearly dominated possesion and hit the
bar once more before the half was over.
	   Jamaica got only two touches in the penalty before Earle's goal,
one coming on the second of three consecutive corners crosses
midway through which produced its only real opportunity.
	   Earle headed down Fitzroy Simpson's corner and it bounded down
and was headed for the crossbar when Simic made sure by heading it
over at the far post.
	   Otherwise, it was all Croatia. But except for a header by Stanic
in the seventh minute from eight meters that struck Jamaican keeper
Warren Barrett in the chest, Croatia was plagued by poor croses
that the Caribbean islanders kept heading away.
	   The goal by Stanic seemed to enliven the Croatian attack.
	   Zvinomir Soldo hit the bar from 10 meters in the 34th minute and
Davor Suker, who caused trouble in the early minutes down the right
flank, had a shot that Barrett had to dive to palm away.
	   ___ &QC;

Eds: UPDATES with NATO preparations, Yugoslav military airshow,

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting escalated Sunday on several
fronts in the separatist province of Kosovo, with Serbs and ethnic
Albanian rebels accusing each other of starting a series of clashes
that killed at least five people.
	   In what appeared to be another crackdown on armed ethnic
Albanian secessionists, Serb forces launched 500 grenades into the
Decani area in western Kosovo Sunday, according to the Kosovo
Information center, which is close to the separatist Albanian
leadership.
	   In Pristina, Serbian police colonel Novica Zdravkovic, told
reporters that ethnic Albanian militants killed two policemen and
injured two others in separate incidents, one in Kosovo's
southwestern Djakovica region and in the western Decani region.
	   More than 300 people in Kosovo have died since the crisis
escalated in late March, when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
launched a bloody crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants fighting
for the province's independence from the Yugoslav republic of
Serbia.
	   Fearing the conflict could spill over Yugoslavia's borders into
neighboring Albania and Macedonia, Western countries warned
Milosevic last week to change his hard-line policy or face the
threat of force.
	   In northern Italy, NATO warplanes were grouping at an airbase to
prepare for simulated air attacks in Albania and Macedonia on
Monday to try to persuade Milosevic to halt the crackdown in
Kosovo.
	   Outside of Belgrade Sunday Yugoslavia demonstrated its own air
power, in an airshow displaying military helicopters and planes,
including Russian-made MiG29 jets. The show is an annual event
marking Yugoslav Army Day on June 16.
	   On Sunday, the main ethnic Albanian party in the province, the
Democratic League of Kosovo, said Serbian authorities attacked
three villages in the Djakovica area with heavy artillery.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said that Serb police brought a
reinforcement of about 40 armored vehicles and 15 tanks into the
Djakovica region, near the border with Albania.
	   The center also said Serb forces launched grenades against a
cluster of villages northwest of Pristina in the Drenica region,
where the government crackdowns began earlier this year.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed. Police and
ethnic Albanian militants, known as the Kosovo Liberation Army,
have set up a maze of blockades in the contested areas across the
province.
	   The KLA now controls about 40 percent of the province, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1. The militants are
particularly strong in the Djakovica and Drenica regions.
	   Reporters traveling southwest from Pristina Sunday drove into a
gunfight between the KLA and Yugoslav army soldiers, whose truck
was ambushed on the stretch of road that passes through a gorge.
	   The soldiers escaped, and brought two wounded comrades to a
nearby hospital.
	   An Albanian report, apparently about the same clash near the
town of Crnoljevo, 25 kilometers (16 miles) southwest of Pristina,
said three Albanians died after an army unit passing along the road
started firing at them.
	   About 50,000 people have fled the fighting, many of them across
the border to neighboring Albania or to the other Yugoslav
republic, Montenegro.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 in an attempt
to suppress the Albanian independence movement. But since Serbs
launched a bloody crackdown in the region earlier this year, the
KLA has grown stronger and more popular among the ethnic Albanians.

NATO prepares for show of force in Balkans Aviano, ADDS details

EDS: UPDATES with latest number of planes; CORRECTS that not all at
By JEFFREY ULBRICH

<TEXT>
	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ Eighty NATO warplanes from 13
nations converged here and at other regional allied bases for a
show of power Monday over Albania and Macedonia that allied leaders
hope will convince Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to back
down in Kosovo.
	   ``This is an exercise intended to demonstrate the alliance's
commitment to peace and stability in the region and the alliance's
ability to project power into the region,'' Lt. Gen. Michael Short,
commander of NATO air forces in the alliance's southern Europe
division, told reporters here Sunday evening.
	   The planes will come from 15 bases in five nations as well as
from carriers in the Adriatic Sea.
	   The allied aircraft were scheduled to participate in exercise
Determined Falcon from early Monday morning until about midday,
flying a route over the Adriatic and into Albanian and Macedonian
airspace, Short said.
	   On the USS Wasp, an amphibious assault carrier in the Adriatic
which will provide four Harrier attack craft for the mission, Col.
Emerson Gardner told reporters: ``We need to show the people that
need to know exactly what we can do.''
	   The NATO action was ordered by allied defense ministers Thursday
as the bloodshed in the Serbian province of Kosovo increased in the
face of a government offensive to put down a rebellion by the
Kosovo Liberation Army and rebel attacks on Serbian forces.
	   More than 300 people have died as the Serb-led Yugoslav
government tries to suppress the increasingly radical independence
movement among Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
the province's population.
	   Emerson noted the Serbs have wide-range fighters like the MiG
21s and the newer MiG 29s, with surface-to-air missiles.
	   The Harrier are armed with air-to-air weapons for defense.
	   ``But all the risks have been assessed and we have taken
measures against it,'' Emerson said without elaborating. ``We feel
the mission can be accomplished safely.''
	   ``We will be close enough that the Serbs will know NATO will be
there,'' said Emerson when asked how close to border and how close
to the ground the aircraft will fly.
	   Gen. Short would not say just how close to Yugoslavia's border
the allied aircraft will fly.
	   The Western allies oppose independence for the province, but
they also want to stop Milosevic's brutal attempts to suppress
dissent.
	   The great fear is that if the two sides aren't brought to the
negotiating table, the Kosovo fighting will spill over Yugoslavia's
borders and ignite a wider Balkan war.
	   NATO has ordered its military planners to study a range of
options for even tougher action, including direct military
intervention in Yugoslavia with air strikes and use of ground
forces. NATO insists, however, that it is only studying its options
to be ready for any political decisions.
	   Countries sending aircraft for the exercises come from all of
the NATO countries except Iceland and Luxembourg, which do not have
air forces, and Canada, which couldn't get airplanes here on such
short notice.
	   The United States will supply Air Force F-16 fighters, KC-135
tankers and EA-6B airborne early warning planes.
	   The amphibious force led by the USS Wasp includes the amphibious
assault ship USS Trenton and the dock landing ship USS Portland.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the alliance continues
to support a political solution to the Kosovo problem, one that
both gives an ``enhanced status'' to Kosovo, but also ``preserves
the territorial integrity'' of Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fierce fighting between rebel soldiers
and government troops in the West African country of Guinea-Bissau
continued Sunday as the insurgents denied government claims that
they had been crushed, according to reports.
	   The two sides were pounding each other's positions in the
capital Bissau with rockets, mortars and artillery, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported.
	   Caught in the middle, the U.S. and Swedish embassies, the main
hospital and the Finance Ministry had taken direct hits, Portuguese
radio RDP-Africa said. Damage to the Russian and French embassies
was reported earlier in the day.
	   With the fighting escalating, thousands of people were
desperately seeking an escape route. The first reports emerged
Sunday that 200 people had drowned as they fled Bissau by boat two
days before.
	   The refugees were on their way to the Bissagos archipelago, 50
kilometers (30 miles) off the coast, Lusa said.
	   There was no reliable information on the number of casualties in
the fighting. International phone lines to the former Portuguese
colony were not working.
	   A Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman said that embassy staff
in Bissau were holed up in the building due to the fighting
outside.
	   The situation was ``still very serious'' he said.
	   A spokesman from the Foreign Office in London said that the six
Britons known to be still in the country were thought safe. Three
British volunteers had fled late Saturday on a flight chartered by
American authorities to evacuated U.S. Peace Corps workers.
	   All Americans who wanted to leave have done so safely, including
Ambassador Peggy Blackford and her four remaining staff, who left
Sunday before the shelling, U.S. State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said.
	   Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman Tommy Andersson reported that
about two dozen Nordic citizens in Guinea Bissau were safe, and
there were no plans to evacuate them despite heavy shelling.
	   Fighting between the rebels and government forces, backed by
reinforcements from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea,
has centered on a garrison in the suburb of Bra, where the
mutineers have been holed up since launching their coup attempt a
week ago.
	   The military complex, covering several hectares (acres) and
surrounded by high walls, occupies a strategic defensive position
in Bissau.
	   A rebel spokesman described as ``pure propaganda'' the
government's claim, made on state radio Saturday, that the
renegades had been dislodged from their stronghold, Lusa reported.
	   Maj. Gomes Fernandes reportedly was speaking on a private radio
station seized by the rebels.
	   He said the mutineers were ready to allow emergency food aid to
be flown into the capital's international airport, located near the
garrison, which they also control, the report said.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, a former guerilla fighter in the war against Portuguese rule
from 1961 to 1974.
	   Mane was fired in January amid allegations of smuggling arms to
separatists in Senegal and formally stepped down a week ago.
	   He has accused President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption and
called on him to step down so that early elections can be held.
	   Vieira himself came to power in a 1980 coup. He was elected in
the country's first democratic elections for president and
parliament four years ago.
	   Gambian President Yahya Jammeh offered to mediate in the
conflict, Lusa reported Sunday.
	   Mane is originally from Gambia, and the rebels had previously
suggested talks on Gambian soil.

Arellanes throws three TDS as Rhein Fire win World Bowl 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Jim Arellanes, a last-minute
subsitute, tossed three touchdowns Sunday to lead a 34-10 rout by
Duesseldorf Rhein Fire of German rival Frankfurt Galaxy in the
World Bowl.
	   Arellanes, allocated by the Seattle Seahawks, hooked up with
Dialleo Burks for 15 and 27 yards and Marcus Robinson for 74 yards
in a rain-soaked champion game of NFL Europe.
	   Arellanes, who had thrown just one pass all year before the
game, threw for 263 yards on 12-of-18 passes in front of 47,546 at
Waldstadium _ the largest crowd of the season for the Europe's
developmental league.
	   The win gave the Fire their first World Bowl title in three
tries, while the Galaxy failed to become the first team to capture
NFL Europe's biggest prize twice after winning in 1995.
	   Arellanes, a former Fresno State player was named at the last
moment to step in for Mike Quinn, NFL Europe's top-rated
quarterback nursing a strained ankle.
	   With the German fans blowing horns and throwing confetti,
Arellanes passed on the first play of the opening drive _ and found
Robinson streaking down the sideline for 40 yards.
	   But with a rainstorm and gusty winds hitting the stadium on the
first quarter, Galaxy quarterback Chris Dittoe didn't fare as well
on the muddy turf.
	   Dittoe, also a subsitute for injured starter Damon Huard, had
two passes intercepted. The second one, thrown straight at
cornerback Robert Davis, with 6:25 remaining, killed the Galaxy's
last hopes of a comeback.
	   Defensive tackle Ed Philion also pressured Dittoe through the
game, while free safety Kerry Joseph stuffed up the Galaxy middle.
	   After Galaxy kicker Ralf Kleinmann nailed a 40-yard early in the
third quarter that cut the Fire's lead to 17-10, Arellanes broke
open the game by hitting Robinson for the 74-yard scoring pass.
	   Jon Vaughn added the Fire's last touchdown, scrambling 16 yards
with 1:53 remaining, while Manny Burgsmueller hit a 15-yard field
goal to first put the team on the board.
	   Galaxy running back Jermaine Chaney scored his team's only
touchdown, a 3-yard run in the second quarter.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Jim Arellanes had thrown just one pass
in competition this season _ and that one wobbled incomplete.
	   But Arellanes, allocated by the Seattle Seahawks, stepped in for
the injured Mike Quinn Sunday and tossed three touchdowns to help
the Duesseldorf Rhein Fire win the World Bowl 34-10 over the
Frankfurt Galaxy.
	   Arellanes hooked up with Dialleo Burks for 15 and 27 yards and
Marcus Robinson for 74 yards in a rain-soaked champion game of NFL
Europe.
	   The former Fresno State player ended up throwing for 263 yards
on 12-of-18 passes in front of 47,546 at Waldstadium _ the largest
crowd of the season for Europe's developmental league.
	   The day before in practice, Arellanes had said he was ready to
step in for Quinn, NFL Europe's top-rated quarterback hobbling on a
sprained ankle.
	   ``I'm going in with the attitude this is a game like any
other,'' Arellanes said. ``I'm well-prepared.''
	   The Fire won their first World Bowl title in three tries, while
the Galaxy failed to become the first team to capture NFL Europe's
biggest prize twice after winning in 1995.
	   With the German fans blowing horns and throwing confetti,
Arellanes passed on the first play of the opening drive _ and found
Robinson streaking down the sideline for 40 yards.
	   But with a rainstorm and gusty winds hitting the stadium on the
first quarter, Galaxy quarterback Chris Dittoe didn't fare as well
on the muddy turf.
	   Dittoe, also a subsitute for injured starter Damon Huard, had
two passes intercepted. The second one, thrown straight at
cornerback Robert Davis, with 6:25 remaining, killed the Galaxy's
last hopes of a comeback.
	   Defensive tackle Ed Philion also pressured Dittoe through the
game, while free safety Kerry Joseph stuffed up the Galaxy middle.
	   After Galaxy kicker Ralf Kleinmann nailed a 40-yard early in the
third quarter that cut the Fire's lead to 17-10, Arellanes broke
open the game by hitting Robinson for the 74-yard scoring pass.
	   Jon Vaughn added the Fire's last touchdown, scrambling 16 yards
with 1:53 remaining, while Manny Burgsmueller hit a 15-yard field
goal to first put the team on the board.
	   In between it was all Arellanes for the Fire. He would have had

Concern over radiation cloud from Spanish steel mill first detected elsewhere in Europe 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Reacting to heavy criticism by
environmental groups, nuclear authorities said Sunday that
radiation that apparently leaked from a steel mill in southern
Spain did not present a danger to the public.
	   Increases of Cesium 137 were discovered early this month in
France, Switzerland and Italy, puzzling scientists trying to
identify the cause.
	   Then on Friday, the Spanish Nuclear Security Council revealed
that a privately owned steel plant in Algeciras, on the southern
tip of Spain, had reported the same radioactive isotope in one of
its chimneys.
	   The council issued a statement Sunday ``to calm (misplaced)
public fears about radioactive risk to the environment or the
population'' and reassure people that safety controls were
adequate.
	   The council said the levels of radioactivity were too low to
cause concern.
	   But Greenpeace and other environmental groups accused the
government of negligence and a possible cover-up, while the Italian
government accused Spain of not informing it about the leak.
	   In Sunday's statement, the council said it had not detected the
radioactive cloud because it did not travel over Spain, and instead
had gone over the Mediterranean.
	   According to the council, initial evidence traced the cloud to
radioactive scrap metal of unknown origin melted down at the plant
at the end of May.
	   Workers who had come into contact with it were called for a
medical evaluation due Monday.

English clash with Tunisians, police; security heightened background, TRIMS

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans trashed cars,
smashed windows, fought with Tunisian fans and clashed with riot
police in a second day of violence Sunday, the eve of an
England-Tunisia match.
	   As many as 100 of the English fans were arrested in running
street battles through the Old Port that continued into Sunday
evening, fueled by alcohol and rage against Tunisian fans who
exhanged insults with them.
	   Police with helmets and shields charged back with tear gas to
disperse the chanting mobs that showered them with bottles and beer
cans. It was the wild scene of hooliganism the French had hoped to
prevent during the five-week World Cup that only began Wednesday.
	   Authorities said several English fans suffered minor injuries
but had no immediate figures.
	   Diners in the trendy bar-restaurant district cowered inside
eateries, watching the clashes that left behind trashed cars,
broken glass and scattered cafe chairs.
	   As a result, authorities canceled a free evening concert in the
Old Port, and many restaurants closed for the night.
	   Some British fans said they were embarrassed by the violence
their government has long sought to combat.
	   ``People who do that aren't the real fans,'' said Michael
Barrett, a 29-year-old Londoner. ``Wherever they go, there are
problems. ... It's too bad for the image we give of England.''
	   Rubbing his eyes from tear gas, George Fenwick of Gloucester
insisted he wasn't violent. ``But since the afternoon, the
Tunisians were provoking us, insulting us and making obscene
gestures.. Some young English fell into the trap and couldn't
control themselves.''
	   French television also showed English fans burning a Tunisian
flag, angering mostly French-born Tunisians from the Marseille
area.
	   ``One of them threatened us with a knife,'' said Majhid Bouzbhi.
``I'm worried about tomorrow's match.''
	   English fans pelted police overnight after a motorist who tried
to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one of the
fans.
	   Of four English fans arrested in that clash, a 20-year-old
Liverpool railroad employee remained in custody to face charges in
court Monday for allegedly attacking police.
	   Earlier Sunday, dozens of officers patrolled a festive
atmosphere along the sun-drenched cafes. Beaches were filled with
tourists, locals and topless sunbathers.
	   The British tabloid The Sun sent a topless orange double-decker
bus around town, with model-TV hostess Melinda Messenger handing
out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.

Iraq, UN reach agreement on 2-month timetable eliminate weapons of mass destruction; CHANGES overline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Butler saying Iraq agreed to cooperate in bid to
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and the United Nations agreed Sunday
to a two-month timetable to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, the chief U.N. inspector said.
	   ``We have agreed upon a schedule of work program for the next
two months on outstanding disarmament,'' chief arms inspector
Richard Butler told reporters at the end of his talks with Iraq's
Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz in Baghdad.
	   The two sides agreed to work together for the next two months to
try to verify that Iraq has complied fully with U.N orders to get
rid of all its illegal weapons.
	   Butler, who arrived in Baghdad Thursday, presented Iraq with a
list of steps the government must take to back its claim that it
has dismantled all weapons of mass destruction and other illegal
weapons program. Until that happens, U.N. sanctions imposed
following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait will remain in place.
	   Butler said that at the end of two months, he and Aziz ``will
meet again to consider where we are up to.''
	   ``The aim of this activity is to bring to an end as soon as
possible, but legitimately and validly, the work of this armament
of Iraq's proscribed weapons of mass destruction,'' Butler said.
	   Aziz said said his meetings with Butler were ``very fruitful.''
	   ``The discussions were businesslike and professional and we
agreed on a schedule for the work of the next two months and we
will meet again in August,'' Aziz told reporters.
	   In the list of demands, which he has described as ``a road
map,'' Butler is asking Iraq to hand over information on long-range
missiles, prove it has scrapped biological and chemical warheads,
and fully account for its production of VX nerve gas and germ
warfare weapons.
	   Earlier, Sami Saadoun, head of Aziz's office, complained in a
newspaper article that Butler's latest demands were designed to
prolong economic sanctions on Iraq indefinitely. The front-page
article appeared in the Babil newspaper, Iraq's most influential,
which is owned by President Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Odai.
	   Butler ``has put an impregnable wall on the path of ending the
unfair embargo,'' wrote Saadoun, who has been a regular participant
in previous Iraq-U.N. disarmament talks.
	   The article was seem as a sign of Iraqi frustration at being
presented with another list of demands after seven years of
inspections.

Friend of Rabin killer convicted of failing to inform police informant.

Eds: UPDATES with prosecutors considering charging former
By DANNY BEN-TAL

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A young woman who was a friend of the
killer of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was convicted Sunday of
knowing of the killer's intentions and failing to inform the
police.
	   Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, was a friend of Yigal Amir, who boasted
to her that he was planning to assassinate Rabin in order to stop
the peace process and the handing over of land to the Palestinians.
	   Amir is serving a life sentence for murdering Rabin at a
November 1995 peace rally in Tel Aviv. Har-Shefi, who pleaded not
guilty, could face up to two years in prison. Her lawyer said an
appeal was planned.
	   Rabin's widow, Leah, called the conviction a ``ray of light in
the darkness surrounding us.''
	   State prosecutor Edna Arbel is now considering charging another
friend of Amir's, Avishai Raviv, a right-wing extremist who also
acted as an informant for the Shin Bet government agency. Arbel's
office said a decision regarding Raviv would be made ``within a few
weeks.''
	   An indictment against Raviv, who was briefly detained and then
released after the murder, was thought to be unlikely because it
may the Shin Bet's secretive tactics. But Israeli media reported
that Shin Bet chief Ami Ayalon recently withdrew his opposition to
an indictment against Raviv.
	   Har-Shefi had pleaded innocent, telling the Tel Aviv Magistrates
Court she did not believe Amir really intended to kill Rabin. She
said she thought he was trying to impress her.

World Cup: Prosinecki, Suker tally in second half to lead 3-1 win 
</HEADLINE>
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Robert Prosinecki curled in a left-footed
shot from just outside the penalty area in the 53rd minute,
breaking a 1-1 tie and leading Croatia to a 3-1 victory over
lightly regarded Jamaica in the World Cup debut for both teams
Sunday night.
	   Prosinecki one-touched a free kick toward the endline to himself
and bent a ball that just skimmed under the bar at the far corner
of the goal.
	   The goal gave Prosinecki goals for two different teams in a
World Cup, having scored for Yugoslavia in a 4-1 victory over the
United Arab Emirates in 1990.
	   Davor Suker added another in the 69th and Croatia cruised home
after struggling to put away the upstart Caribbean islanders in the
first half.
	   Croatia dominated the possession and the scoring opportunities
throughout, but Robbie Earle's header as the teams were about to
head into first-half injury time gave the ``Reggae Boyz'' renewed
hope and tripled the volume of their already loud faithful.
	   Earle knocked in a high ball from eight yards, running full
stride down the middle of the area past a defender and leaping to
direct Ricardo Gardener's pass inside the left post.
	   The goal came on only the third touch for Jamaica in Croatia's
penalty area in the half, and they didn't have many more in the
second.
	   Mario Stanic put in a rebound from six meters in the 27th minute
to give Croatia the lead.
	   Igor Stimac hit the crossbar from 10 meters off a from Dario
Simic cross from the end line and the rebound came to the feet of
Stanic, who had to step to his left to settle the ball before
shooting into an empty net.
	   It was only the second serious chance Croatia had in the first
45 minutes, although they clearly dominated possession and hit the
bar once more before the half was over.
	   Prosinecki's goal dimmed the Jamaican partisan crowd only
slightly, but Suker's tally lowered it enough to let the sizable
Croatian fan contingent be heard.
	   Suker was involved in several altercations and once went down
well after play had stopped, drawing the ire of the crowd. Every
time he touched the ball after that drew loud whistling.
	   But when he settled Stanic's cross and cracked a shot that
deflected off Gardener's legs, the crowd was silenced.
	   Jamaica got only two touches in the penalty before Earle's goal,
one coming on the second of three consecutive corners crosses
midway through which produced its only real opportunity.
	   Earle headed down Fitzroy Simpson's corner and it bounded down
and was headed for the crossbar when Simic made sure by heading it
over at the far post.
	   Otherwise, it was all Croatia. But except for a header by Stanic
in the seventh minute from eight meters that struck Jamaican keeper
Warren Barrett in the chest, Croatia was plagued by poor crosses
that the Caribbean islanders kept heading away.
	   The goal by Stanic seemed to enliven the Croatian attack.
	   Zvinomir Soldo hit the bar from 10 meters in the 34th minute and
Suker, who caused trouble in the early minutes down the right
flank, had a shot that Barrett had to dive to palm away.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Croatia: Drazen Ladic; Zvonimir Soldo, Robert Jarni, Dario Simic
(Goran Vlaovic, 73rd minute), Igor Stimac, Slaven Bilic; Zvinomir
Boban, Mario Stanic, Aljosa Asanovic, Robert Prosinecki; Davor
Suker.

Sinclair; Fitzroy Simpson, Peter Cargill (Darryl Powell, 71st),

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and the United Nations agreed Sunday
to a two-month timetable to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, the chief U.N. inspector said.
	   ``We have agreed upon a schedule of work program for the next
two months on outstanding disarmament,'' chief arms inspector
Richard Butler told reporters at the end of his talks with Iraq's
Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz in Baghdad.
	   The two sides agreed to work together for the next two months to
try to verify that Iraq has complied fully with U.N orders to get
rid of all its illegal weapons.
	   Butler, who arrived in Baghdad Thursday, presented Iraq with a
list of steps the government must take to back its claim that it
has dismantled all weapons of mass destruction and other illegal
weapons program. Until that happens, U.N. sanctions imposed
following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait will remain in place.
	   Butler said that at the end of two months, he and Aziz ``will
meet again to consider where we are up to.''
	   ``The aim of this activity is to bring to an end as soon as
possible, but legitimately and validly, the work of disarmament of
Iraq's proscribed weapons of mass destruction,'' Butler said.

Court orders new election in four Jamaican districts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's Election Court has ordered
four southeastern polling districts to hold new parliamentary
elections for a third time because of irregularities in vote
counts.
	   Voters in west-central St. Andrew Parish, an area near the
capital of Kingston, will once again choose between Warren Blake of
the ruling People's National Party and Andrew Holness of the
Jamaica Labor Party.
	   No date has been set for the election, which the court ordered
on Friday.
	   Holness became Jamaica's youngest lawmaker at age 25 by winning
the Dec. 18 election with 8,649 votes to Blake's 8,496. The
election court later annulled the results because of discrepancies
discovered during ballot-counting.
	   Blake, a medical doctor, won the second election on March 26
with 5,631 votes to Holness' 5,334. He replaced Holness in
Parliament days later.

	   Aziz said his meetings with Butler were ``very fruitful.''
	   ``The discussions were businesslike and professional and we
agreed on a schedule for the work of the next two months and we
will meet again in August,'' Aziz told reporters.
	   In his list of demands, Butler has asked Iraq to hand over
information on long-range missiles, prove it has scrapped
biological and chemical warheads, and fully account for its
production of VX nerve gas and germ warfare weapons.
	   Earlier, Sami Saadoun, head of Aziz's office, complained in a
newspaper article that Butler's latest demands were designed to
prolong economic sanctions on Iraq indefinitely. The front-page
article appeared in the Babil newspaper, Iraq's most influential,
which is owned by President Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Odai.
	   The article was seem as a sign of Iraqi frustration at being
presented with another list of demands after seven years of
inspections.

Eds: UPDATES with Croatia-Jamaica; more details, quote on fan
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Soccer's ever-present fear of fan violence became a
sobering reality as England fans clashed with police for the second
straight day Sunday, stealing much of the spotlight as three
nations made their World Cup debuts.
	   In the southern port city of Marseille, as many as 100 English
fans were arrested in a series of skirmishes that continued into
Sunday evening, with some youths breaking shop windows and trashing
cars.
	   Many fans threw bottles and beer cans at riot police, who fired
back with tear gas. Scattered fights also broke out between British
and Tunisian fans, whose teams play Monday afternoon at the city's
Velodrome stadium.
	   Several of the fans suffered minor injuries, authorities said.
	   About a hundred other singing and chanting English fans, many
drunk and shirtless, stood outside an Irish pub along one side of
the Old Port, littered with an overturned car, broken glass and
scattered cafe chairs.
	   As a result, authorities canceled a free evening concert in the
Old Port, and restaurants closed for the night, while diners
cowered in eateries that remained open.
	   Police blamed much of the rampage on drunkenness.
	   ``People who do that aren't the real fans,'' said Michael
Barrett, a 29-year-old Londoner. ``Wherever they go, there are
problems. ... It's too bad for the image we give of England.''
	   Meanwhile, on-field violence was punished as Dutch striker
Patrick Kluivert was banned for two games for elbowing Belgium's
Lorenzo Staelens in the chest in an off-the-ball incident during
Saturday's 0-0 tie at Saint-Denis.
	   Kluivert, who received a red card for the foul, will miss the
Netherlands' other Group E first-round games against South Korea
and Mexico.
	   Kluivert, who is black, said he elbowed Staelens after being
``deeply hurt'' by what he said were offensive comments made by the
Belgian defender.
	   ``I pushed him,'' Kluivert said. ``I couldn't control my
emotions.''
	   In Sunday's games, the well of goals that had been so prevalent
through the tournament's first four days went close to drying up up
as Argentina beat Japan and Yugoslavia downed Iran, both by the
score of 1-0. Croatia did add some punch with a 3-1 victory over
Jamaica.
	   In a game matching World Cup newcomers, Mario Stanic, Robert
Prosinecki and Davor Suker scored for Croatia and Robbie Earle
netted for Jamaica, disappointing thousands of dancing
green-and-yellow clad fans at Stade Gerland in Lens. Prosinecki
also scored for Yugoslavia in the 1990 World Cup, before the
breakup of the Balkan nation.
	   Japan, co-host of the 2002 finals and also playing its
first-ever World Cup game, gave a valiant effort against the
Argentines before falling on Gabriel Batistuta's 28th minute goal
in rainswept conditions at Toulouse.
	   ``It is very unfortunate that we could not score a goal. I
believe results count at the World Cup,'' said Japanese coach
Takeshi Okada, choked with emotion.
	   At Saint-Etienne, Sinisa Mihajlovic's 25-meter free kick in the
73rd minute gave Yugoslavia its victory in a game between two
countries back in the World Cup following politically related
absences.
	   Yugoslavia was banned from the 1994 World Cup because of
international sanctions, while Iran's once-formidable soccer
program took a downturn after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   ``I'm pleased with our performance as we played one of the best
and most experienced teams in Europe,'' said Iranian coach Jalal
Talebi, whose team plays the United States next Sunday. ``Our
mission at the World Cup is not over with this loss. We will fight
on. ... We are looking forward to a victory against the United
States.''
	   Iran's play was less intense in the second half, perhaps because
its players held a three-hour religious mourning ceremony at the
time many teams would be getting a good night's sleep. Players beat
their chests and wept as a religious teacher recounted the death of
a 7th century Shiite Muslim.
	   The ritual ended around midnight Saturday, about the same time
that English fans were causing the first round of trouble in
Marseille. An incident involving a motorist set off a melee
involving some 200 fans who showered police and their vehicles with
bottles and cans.
	   At least one gendarme was hospitalized with a head injury. Four
English fans were arrested.
	   As a result, authorities stepped up security immediately, with
about 1,900 police patrolling the city.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southampton, England, with his brother.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were expected in town to look for tickets on the
black market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Also Sunday, French organizers said they had filed a complaint
against agents and tour operators allegedly involved in the World
Cup ticket scandal. Thousands of fans worldwide have been left
without tickets that had been promised to them or for which they
had paid.
	   And Argentine legend Diego Maradona, who was supposed to work as
a TV commentator during the World Cup, said he will not fly to
France because he was ``depressed'' over a 34-month suspended
sentence he received last week for a 1994 shooting incident.

Scott Draper defeats Laurence Tieleman in Queen's Club final 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS doubles final rained out; title shared
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Australian Scott Draper picked up his first ATP
Tour title Sunday, defeating little-know Belgian-born Italian
Laurence Tieleman in straight sets in the final at the Queen's
Club.
	   Draper, 24, didn't face a breakpoint in the grass-court match
and closed out Tieleman with his 10th ace 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
	   Despite the absence of big-name players in the final like
top-seeded Pete Sampras and No. 2 Greg Rusedski, the match between
the two unseeded players was a sellout on a rare sunny London
afternoon.
	   Sampras was beaten earlier by Australian Mark Woodforde and
Rusedski, the Canadian-born Briton, had to retire with a severe
ankle sprain that may sideline him when Wimbledon opens in a week.
	   Draper broke the 25-year-old Tieleman only once _ in the first
game of the second set _ as neither player returned well. Draper
controlled the match with better passing shots as Tieleman
consistently missed his volleys.
	   The title was a long time coming for Draper, who said he nearly
skipped the tournament.
	   ``I was so close to going back to the States after the French
Open and getting knee surgery,'' Draper said. ``But I played
phenomenal tennis this week. It was my first title and it's a long
time coming.
	   ``I was oozing with confidence this week and I'm hoping this is
the start of more titles to come,'' added Draper, who has failed in
three tries to win a singles match at Wimbledon.
	   Coming into this tournament, Draper had not won consecutive
matches all season and had been slowed by injuries and
inconsistency.
	   With an ATP ranking of 108, this was only his second ATP final.
He lost in Adelaide in 1997 to countryman Todd Woodbridge.
	   Born to an Dutch father and Italian mother, Tieleman lives in
London and is a member of the Queen's Club where he is coached by
Peter Fleming _ John McEnroe's former doubles partner.
	   Tieleman, ranked 253 by the ATP, was playing in his first-ever
ATP final, never having been further than the quarterfinals in an
ATP Tour event.
	   Entering the final against Draper, all of his main-draw
victories on the ATP Tour had come on grass. He had 12 victories on
that surface but was 0-3 on clay and 0-5 on hardcourts.
	   The doubles final was rained out with Australia's duo of Todd
Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde leading Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and
Patrick Rafter of Australia 3-1. The match was abandoned and both
teams will share the title.

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Carlton Loewer pitched a five-hitter to win
an impressive major league debut Sunday, leading the Philadelphia
Phillies over the Chicago Cubs 4-2.
	   Loewer walked none and struck out eight, retiring 14 straight
batters at one stretch. The 24-year-old right-hander was 7-3 with a
2.87 ERA in 12 starts at Triple-A Scranton.
	   Loewer became the first pitcher to throw a complete game in his
major league debut since Boston's Nate Minchey beat Cleveland 11-1
on Sept. 12, 1993. The last NL pitcher to do it was Tim Wakefield,
who led Pittsburgh over St. Louis 3-2 on July 31, 1992.
	   With his parents in town from Louisiana to watch, Loewer kept
the Cubs off-balance by mixing his fastball and changeup. He gave
up an RBI single to Henry Rodriguez in the second inning, then did
not give up another hit until Mickey Morandini singled to start the
seventh.
	   Mark Clark (4-7) allowed nine hits, including five doubles, in
five-plus innings.
 &UR; Astros 6, Reds 3, 10 innings
	   In Cincinnatti, the Houston Astros scored two runs off Jeff Shaw
to tie it in the ninth and three more off him in the 10th inning,
rallying past the Cincinnati Reds.
	   Bill Spiers started the tying rally with a leadoff double in the
ninth and hit a two-run homer off Shaw (1-4) in the 10th, his
fourth hit of the game.
	   Shaw, who had not given up an earned run in his previous 18
appearances spanning 25 1-3 innings, gave up one hard-hit ball
after another. He had a 0.97 ERA when he took the mound _ best
among NL closers _ but gave up seven hits, a walk and five runs in
two innings.
	   Billy Wagner (1-2) pitched out of a threat in the bottom of the
ninth and got the final three outs for the win.
 &UR; Braves 5, Expos 1
	   In Atlanta, Kevin Millwood pitched a four-hitter and Bobby Cox
equaled Frank Selee as the winningest manager in Braves history as
Atlanta defeated the Montreal Expos.
	   Cox's record during two stints as the Braves manager improved to
1,004-819. His overall mark is 1,359-1,111, making him the 22nd
winningest manager in baseball history.
	   Selee won 1,004 games from 1890-1901 when the Braves were in
their original city, Boston. His teams won five NL pennants, one
more than Cox has achieved during the Braves' run of success in the
1990s.
	   On a more contemporary note, Millwood (9-2) joined teammates Tom
Glavine and Greg Maddux as the NL's top winners in his second
complete game.
	   Carlos Perez (6-5) lost despite hitting his third career homer.
 &UR; Pirates 7, Brewers 2
	   In Pittsburgh, Mark Smith, Aramis Ramirez and Kevin Young
homered in the first three innings and the Pittsburgh Pirates
finally mounted some offense against the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   The Pirates had scored only six runs in four consecutive losses
to the Brewers until homering three times off Steve Woodard (3-5),
who had allowed only two homers in 13 previous appearances.
	   Pirates starter Chris Peters (2-4) went on to retire the side in
order in five of the six innings he pitched, needing only 56
pitches in his longest start of the season.

Eds: UPDATES throughout with last ferry sailing, bridge opens for
By JAN M. OLSEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HALSSKOV, Denmark (AP) _ Hundreds of people waved on the quay.
Others followed in sailboats as the ferry left this central Denmark
harbor Sunday for its last crossing.
	   The huge Arveprins Knud ferry and five other ferries, now
obsolete, made a detour to sail under the bridge, blasting their
foghorns in a final salute.
	   ``It's sad. I'll miss the screaming seagulls, the smell of the
engines and the cosy atmosphere,'' said passenger Peter Pedersen
whose family all worked on the ferries plying the Storebaelt
strait. ``I have it in my veins.''
	   From the deck of the ferry passengers could see a steady stream
of cars driving over the bridge. The cars' head- and taillights lit
up the night sky like a string of colored pearls.
	   Danes who loved the slow, but scenic journeys now will cross the
Storebaelt waterway between Denmark's two largest islands on an
18-kilometer (11-mile) four-lane highway which was opened Sunday by
Queen Margrethe.
	   Construction of Europe's longest combined road-and-rail bridge
began in 1988 and cost 38 billion kroner (dlrs 5.3 billion).
	   ``We've had the time to prepare ourselves for the last day,''
said Joergen Friis Pedersen, second-in-command on the Arveprins
Knud ferry.
	   ``In the past 10 years, we've seen the bridge being built as we
sailed past it.''
	   The bridge put the bulky black-and-white ferries, which have
sailed since 1883, out of business. Many said they would miss the
boats, but admitted it would now be easier and quicker to travel
east-west.
	   Passenger Per Noergaard said he would miss standing in the wind
looking at the sea.
	   No advance booking of ferry tickets is needed. The crossing of
the strait on the four-lane, 18-kilometer (11-mile) bridge takes 10
minutes _ a fifth of the time it took the ferries.
	   More than 10,000 people cheered as the queen opened the bridge
between the islands of Zealand, where the capital is situated, and
Funen which is linked to the Jutland peninsula and the European
continent.
	   Queen Margrethe and her husband, Prince Henrik, left this port
120 kilometers (74 miles) west of Copenhagen, and drove across the
bridge. They stopped at the highest point and threw flowers into
the sea in memory of the seven workers who died during the
construction work.
	   ``We'll now cross the country in one zip with the skies above us
and the sea under us,'' Queen Margrethe said.
	   At 10 p.m. (2000 GMT), police opened the bridge for ordinary
traffic after thousands of motorists had waited for hours to be
among the first to cross the bridge.
	   Trains began using the link last year, traveling through an
8-kilometer (5-mile) underwater tunnel to a mid-strait island, and
then along a 6.6-kilometer (4.1-mile) western bridge. Cars use a
6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) bridge from Zealand to Sprogoe instead of
the tunnel.
	   More than 200 million people have used the boats since 1957 when
modern terminals opened in the ports of Knudshoved and Halsskov.
	   The ferries on Denmark's busiest ferry route had a maximum
capacity of 1,200 passengers and 300 cars, and departed every 30
minutes in each direction.
	   The bridge toll is 210 kroner (dlrs 30), while a one-way ferry
crossing cost 335 kroner (dlrs 48).

World Cup: Prosinecki, Suker tally in second half to lead 3-1 win 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with coaches quotes; Optional upcoming.
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Robert Prosinecki curled in a left-footed
shot from just outside the penalty area in the 53rd minute,
breaking a 1-1 tie and leading Croatia to a 3-1 victory over
lightly regarded Jamaica in the World Cup debut for both teams
Sunday night.
	   Prosinecki one-touched a free kick toward the endline to himself
and bent a ball that just skimmed under the bar at the far corner
of the goal.
	   The tally gave Prosinecki goals for two different teams in a
World Cup, having scored for Yugoslavia in a 4-1 victory over the
United Arab Emirates in 1990.
	   Davor Suker added another in the 69th and Croatia cruised home
after struggling to put away the upstart Caribbean islanders in the
first half.
	   ``In the second half, that first goal was so tough because it
came so early,'' Jamaica's Brazilian coach Rene Simoes said. ``The
goal was so early and the team fell a little bit.''
	   Croatia dominated the possession and the scoring opportunities
throughout, but Robbie Earle's header as the teams were about to
head into first-half injury time gave the ``Reggae Boyz'' renewed
hope and tripled the volume of their already loud faithful.
	   Earle knocked in a high ball from eight yards, running full
stride down the middle of the area past a defender and leaping to
direct Ricardo Gardener's pass inside the left post.
	   The goal came on only the third touch for Jamaica in Croatia's
penalty area in the half.
	   ``Obviously it was a big psychological chop when you give up a
goal right before halftime,'' Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic
said. ``But I told my team to push up more in the second half,
because I didn't think their counters would be quick enough to take
our defense by surprise.
	   ``I also told them right before they went out for the second
half they would not be allowed back in the dressing room without
three points.''
	   Prosinecki's goal dimmed the Jamaican partisan crowd only
slightly, but Suker's tally lowered it enough to let the sizable
Croatian fan contingent be heard.
	   Suker was involved in several altercations and once went down
well after play had stopped, drawing the ire of the crowd. Every
time he touched the ball after that drew loud whistling.
	   But when he settled Stanic's cross and cracked a shot that
deflected off Gardener's legs, the crowd was silenced.
	   Mario Stanic put in a rebound from six meters in the 27th minute
to give Croatia the lead.
	   Igor Stimac hit the crossbar from 10 meters off a from Dario
Simic cross from the end line and the rebound came to the feet of
Stanic, who had to step to his left to settle the ball before
shooting into an empty net.
	   It was only the second serious chance Croatia had in the first
45 minutes, although they clearly dominated possession and hit the
bar once more before the half was over.
	   Jamaica got only two touches in the penalty before Earle's goal,
one coming on the second of three consecutive corners crosses
midway through which produced its only real opportunity.
	   Earle headed down Fitzroy Simpson's corner and it bounded down
and was headed for the crossbar when Simic made sure by heading it
over at the far post.
	   Otherwise, it was all Croatia. But except for a header by Stanic
in the seventh minute from eight meters that struck Jamaican keeper
Warren Barrett in the chest, Croatia was plagued by poor crosses
that the Caribbean islanders kept heading away.
	   ``We were fearing the game against Jamaica,'' Blazevic said.
``If we won tonight it was because we were a little more
experienced, and, although this may sound a little bit pretentious
and with all due respect to the Jamaicans, the better team.''
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Croatia: Drazen Ladic; Zvonimir Soldo, Robert Jarni, Dario Simic
(Goran Vlaovic, 73rd minute), Igor Stimac, Slaven Bilic; Zvinomir
Boban, Mario Stanic, Aljosa Asanovic, Robert Prosinecki; Davor
Suker.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans trashed cars,
smashed windows, fought with local youths and clashed with riot
police in a second day of violence Sunday, the eve of an
England-Tunisia match.
	   About 80 English fans were arrested in running street battles
through the Old Port that continued into Sunday evening, fueled by
alcohol and rage against pro-Tunisian fans who exchanged insults
with them.
	   Police with helmets and shields charged back with tear gas to
disperse the chanting mobs that showered them with bottles and beer
cans. It was the wild scene of hooliganism the French had hoped to
prevent during the five-week World Cup that only began Wednesday.
	   Diners in the Old Port, a trendy bar-restaurant district,
cowered inside eateries, watching the clashes that left behind
trashed cars, broken glass and scattered cafe chairs.
	   Later Sunday evening, violence scattered into surrounding
streets. The pro-Tunisian fans _ mostly Marseille area youths from
working-class North African immigrant families _ attacked small
groups of English fans or smashed shop windows.
	   At least two-dozen English fans suffered minor injuries, but by
late Sunday authorities had no comprehensive figures on injuries or
arrests.
	   Authorities canceled a free evening concert in the Old Port,
where many restaurants closed for the night.
	   Some British fans said they were embarrassed by the violence
their government has long sought to combat.
	   ``People who do that aren't the real fans,'' said Michael
Barrett, a 29-year-old Londoner. ``Wherever they go, there are
problems. ... It's too bad for the image we give of England.''
	   Rubbing his eyes from tear gas, George Fenwick of Gloucester
insisted he wasn't violent. ``But since the afternoon, the
Tunisians were provoking us, insulting us and making obscene
gestures.. Some young English fell into the trap and couldn't
control themselves.''
	   French television also showed English fans burning a Tunisian
flag, angering mostly French-born Tunisians from the Marseille
area.
	   ``One of them threatened us with a knife,'' said Majhid Bouzbhi.
``I'm worried about tomorrow's match.''
	   English fans pelted police overnight after a motorist who tried
to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one of the
fans.
	   Of four English fans arrested in that clash, a 20-year-old
Liverpool railroad employee remained in custody to face charges in
court Monday for allegedly attacking police.
	   Earlier Sunday, dozens of officers patrolled a festive
atmosphere along the sun-drenched cafes. Beaches were filled with
tourists, locals and topless sunbathers.
	   The British tabloid The Sun sent a topless orange double-decker
bus around town, with model-TV hostess Melinda Messenger handing
out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were here looking for tickets on the black
market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.
	   French authorities faced unruly fans at the start of the World
Cup. About three-dozen police were injured in clashes in Paris
after Tuesday's street celebration, though the games have been
virtually trouble-free due to tight stadium security.

Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.
	   French authorities faced unruly fans at the start of the World
Cup. About three-dozen police were injured in clashes in Paris
after Tuesday's street celebration, though the games have been
virtually trouble-free due to tight stadium security.

	   HALSSKOV, Denmark (AP) _ Queen Margrethe put an end to more than
a century of picturesque ferry crossing Sunday by opening a central
Denmark road bridge linking Copenhagen to the European continent.
	   Danes who loved the scenic, but slow ferry journey now will
cross the Storebaelt bridge on a 18-kilometer (11-mile), four-lane
highway in about 10 minutes _ less than a fifth of the time it took
to sail.
	   With hundreds of spectators waving, and others following in
sailboats, the huge Arveprins Knud and five other ferries made
their final journey late Sunday. The ferries made a detour to sail
under the bridge and blasted their foghorns in a final solute.
	   ``It's sad. I'll miss the screaming seagulls, the smell of the
engines and the cozy atmosphere,'' said passenger Peter Pedersen,
whose family all worked on the ferries plying the Storebaelt
strait. ``I have it in my veins.''
	   More than 10,000 people had attended the opening ceremony. Queen
Margrethe and her husband, Prince Henrik, left this port 120
kilometers (70 miles) west of Copenhagen, and drove across the
bridge. They stopped at the highest point and threw flowers into
the sea in memory of the seven workers who died during the
construction work.
	   ``We'll now cross the country in one zip with the skies above us
and the sea under us,'' Queen Margrethe said.
	   From the deck of the ferry, passengers could see a steady stream
of cars driving over the bridge after it was opened to the public
Sunday night. The cars' lights lit up the night sky like a string
of colored pearls.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Cone won for the ninth time in 10 starts
and Tino Martinez drove in three runs as the New York Yankees tied
a major league record by winning or splitting their 24th straight
series with a soggy 4-2 win over the Cleveland Indians on Sunday in
a series shortened to one game by rain.
	   The Yankees tied the 1912 Boston Red Sox and 1970 Cincinnati
Reds for most consecutive non-losing series.
	   Heavy rains postponed the first two games of the three-game
series, the first meeting between the clubs since last October's AL
playoffs, and the finale began in a light rain and was played in at
least a constant drizzle throughout.
	   Cone (9-1) struck out 12 and allowed just four hits in eight
innings for New York, which hasn't lost a series since dropping two
games to open the season at Anaheim.
 &UR; Royals 2, Tigers 0 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Glendon Rusch scattered seven hits in
his first major league shutout.
	   Rusch (4-8), who had lost five straight decisions, walked none
and struck out five. He never faced more than four batters in an
inning and permitted only one runner past first base.
	   Rusch, making his 41st start in the big leagues, won for the
first time since beating the Toronto Blue Jays 7-4 on April 30.
	   Johnny Damon gave the Royals a 1-0 lead two pitches into the
Kansas City first, homering off rookie Seth Greisinger (0-2). Luis
Rivera added an RBI single in the sixth.
 &UR; Twins 2, White Sox 1 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, LaTroy Hawkins pitched seven strong innings and
Orlando Merced went 3-for-4 to lead Minnesota.
	   Hawkins (4-6), who lost his last two decisions and had not won a
game since May 23, gave up just four hits and struck out five. The
only run scored against him was unearned.
	   Rick Aguilera pitched a perfect ninth inning for his 13th save.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Soccer's ever-present fear of fan violence became a
sobering reality as England fans clashed with police for the second

Walters ties record in winning Oldsmobile Classic 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EAST LANSING, Michigan (AP) _ Canadian Lisa Walters tied the
all-time LPGA record by winning the Oldsmobile Classic with a
23-under 265 total Sunday.
	   Wendy Ward set the record of 23-under at last year's Fieldcrest
Cannon Classic in Charlotte, North Carolina.
	   Walters fired a 6-under 66 in the final round for her third
victory on the LPGA Tour, her first since 1993. She tied Ward's
record with a birdie at the 175-yard (meter), par-3 16th hole.
	   Walters earned dlrs 97,500 from the dlrs 650,000 purse. She
earned less than dlrs 27,000 on tour last year and earned only dlrs
769 in 1996.
	   ``This win is better than my first,'' Walters said. ``This is
the first time I've won a four-day tournament. This is a nice
comeback, to win and to win in grand style.''
	   Donna Andrews, the LPGA's leading money winner who led after
each of the first two rounds, finished second for the fourth week
in a row. Andrews closed with a 67 for a 271 total. Australian
Karrie Webb was third at 272.
	   Walters broke the tournament record by three strokes. Beth
Daniel won with a 20-under 268 in 1994.
	   Walters and Andrews both eagled the 440-yard (meter), par-5 14th
hole, but Walters' eagle sealed the victory as it kept her six
strokes ahead with four holes to play.
	   ``I was not complacent today,'' Walters said. ``For two days I
watched (Andrews) hit the ball right at the flag and she didn't
look like she was going to stop doing that.''
	   ``I have had so many bad years out here. I knew I was a better
golfer than I was proving. I felt like I was a disappointment to
myself.''
	   Andrews, who has won more than dlrs 530,000 this season, was not
frustrated by her runner-up finish again.
	   ``To shoot 17-under and finish second, I know I played well, but
it was not my time to win,'' said Andrews, winner of the Longs
Drugs Challenge earlier this season.
	   ``I don't feel like I played poorly. I had three great days and
one so-so day.''

Arellanes throws three TDS as Rhein Fire win World Bowl 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: RECASTS in parts, adds QUOTES, STATS
By ROY KAMMERER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The Rhein Fire's Jim Arellanes had
thrown just one pass this season in a game situation _ and that one
wobbled incomplete.
	   But Arellanes stepped in for the injured Mike Quinn Sunday and
fired three touchdowns as his Duesseldorf team routed the Frankfurt
Galaxy 34-10 to win the World Bowl.
	   Arellanes, allocated by the Seattle Seahawks, hooked up with
Dialleo Burks for 15 and 27 yards and Marcus Robinson for 74 yards
despite a rainstorm that hit NFL Europe's championship game.
	   ``I just tried to stay relaxed out there,'' said Arellanes. ``If
anything I had trouble with the snaps. I never played in the rain
before and the ball kept slipping through my fingers.''
	   The former Fresno State player, who grew up in California, threw
for 263 yards on 12-of-18 passes in front of 47,546 at Waldstadium
_ the largest crowd of the season for Europe's developmental
league.
	   Arellanes also gave Fire coach Galen Hall, the former Florida
Gators coach, his first World Bowl title in three tries.
	   ``I'm not surprised at the way he played. He's thrown very well
in practice,'' said Hall. ``He's got a good NFL future ahead of
him.''
	   The Fire defense held the Galaxy offense to 223 yards, while Jon
Vaughn rushed for 89 yards on 11 carries and scrambled 16 yards for
a late touchdown. Duesseldorf teammate Derrick Clark added 69 yards
on 17 attempts.
	   With the roaring German fans blowing horns and throwing
confetti, Arellanes tried a fleaflicker play the first time he
touched the ball _ and found Robinson streaking down the sideline
for 40 yards.
	   ``That gave me some confidence right away. But I also knew we
had sixty minutes ahead of us,'' said Arellanes.
	   Galaxy quarterback Chris Dittoe, also subbing for the injured
Miami Dolphins allocatee Damon Huard, didn't have as much luck on
the muddy field. He completed 15-of-27 passes, but only for 111
yards.
	   ``We didn't make the big plays,'' said Dittoe, signed last week
by the Detriot Lions. ``It was tough out there, but you have to
give their defense some credit.''
	   Dittoe, pressured all day by Fire tackle Ed Philion, threw two
interceptions. The second one, picked off by cornerback Robert
Davies, came with 6:58 remaining and the Galaxy behind 24-10.
	   ``I kind of got hit while I was throwing. That really killed
us,'' said Dittoe.
	   But it was Arellane's 74-yard scoring toss to Robinson, the
league's offensive MVP, that broke the game open.
	   It came with 11:08 remaining, just one minute after German
kicker Ralf Kleinmann booted a 40-yard field goal that pulled the
Galaxy to 17-10.
	   Galaxy running back Jermaine Chaney, the team's only effective
weapon with 84 yards on 19 carries, scored his team's only
touchdown, a 3-yard run in the second quarter.
	   Manny Burgsmueller, the Fire's 48-year-kicker, hit a 15-yard
field goal for his team's first score.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans trashed cars,
smashed windows, fought with local youths and clashed with riot
police in a second day of violence Sunday, the eve of an
England-Tunisia match.
	   About 80 English fans were arrested in running street battles
through the Old Port that continued into Sunday evening, fueled by
alcohol and rage against pro-Tunisian fans who exchanged insults
with them.
	   Police with helmets and shields charged back with tear gas to
disperse the chanting mobs that showered them with bottles and beer
cans. It was the wild scene of hooliganism the French had hoped to
prevent during the five-week World Cup that only began Wednesday.
	   Diners in the Old Port, a trendy bar-restaurant district,
cowered inside eateries, watching the clashes that left behind
trashed cars, broken glass and scattered cafe chairs. Three bars
were ransacked.
	   Later Sunday evening, violence scattered into surrounding
streets. The pro-Tunisian fans _ mostly Marseille area youths from
working-class North African immigrant families _ attacked small
groups of English fans or smashed shop windows.
	   One English fan was hospitalized in serious condition after an
attacker slashed an artery in his neck. At least two-dozen English
fans suffered minor injuries and one police officer was injured in
the knee.
	   Authorities canceled a free evening concert in the Old Port,
where many restaurants closed for the night.
	   Some British fans said they were embarrassed by the violence
their government has long sought to combat.
	   ``People who do that aren't the real fans,'' said Michael
Barrett, a 29-year-old Londoner. ``Wherever they go, there are
problems. ... It's too bad for the image we give of England.''
	   In London, British Sports Minister Tony Banks called the
troublemakers ``drunken, brain-dead louts.'' Home Secretary Jack
Straw said French police had full support of the British
government.
	   His eyes red from tear gas, George Fenwick of Gloucester
insisted he wasn't violent. ``But since the afternoon, the
Tunisians were provoking us, insulting us and making obscene
gestures.. Some young English fell into the trap and couldn't
control themselves.''
	   English fans were seen burning Tunisian flags while some of them
gave the Nazi salute.
	   ``One of them threatened us with a knife,'' said Majhid Bouzbhi.
``I'm worried about tomorrow's match.''
	   English fans pelted police overnight after a motorist who tried
to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one of the
fans.
	   Of four English fans arrested in that clash, a 20-year-old
Liverpool railroad employee remained in custody to face charges in
court Monday for allegedly attacking police.
	   Earlier Sunday, dozens of officers patrolled a festive
atmosphere along the sun-drenched cafes. Beaches were filled with
tourists, locals and topless sunbathers.
	   The British tabloid The Sun sent a topless orange double-decker
bus around town, with model-TV hostess Melinda Messenger handing
out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were here looking for tickets on the black
market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.
	   French authorities faced unruly fans at the start of the World
Cup. About three-dozen police were injured in Paris after Tuesday's
street celebration, though the games have been virtually
trouble-free due to tight stadium security.

World Cup: Jamaican fans add splash of color to World Cup debut 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Beating drums, dancing and waving a sea of
colorful national flags, Jamaican fans turned their nation's World
Cup debut into a Caribbean carnival.
	   About 10,000 Jamaican supporters, many with their faces painted
in the national colors, packed into Felix Bollaert Stadium to cheer
on the underdog ``Reggae Boyz'' against Croatia.
	   For most, the biggest thrill was simply being there Sunday night
for a party that even Croatia's 3-1 win couldn't spoil.
	   ``We're here to have fun,'' said Trevor Bird, 34, who had driven
from Amsterdam to watch his team. ``We know we won't win the World
Cup. But we don't even have a professional league and we qualified.
That's reason enough to celebrate.''
	   Sympathies among the 40,000 spectators clearly were on the
Jamaicans' side. When Rob Earle knocked in his team's first World
Cup finals goal to tie the score 1-1 at the stroke of halftime,
most of the stadium exploded into frenzy.
	   Many European soccer fans with a soft spot for the outsiders
also converged on this northern French mining town to join in the
fun.
	   Stuart Fraser, 24, came from the London area with two friends.
``We like the underdogs,'' he said, fishing a whistle out of the
car before adjusting his yellow and green Jamaican fan scarf.
	   For hours before the game, fans from both sides turned the small
city center into a street party _ Croatians decked out in the
checkerboard red and white colors of their nation mingling
peacefully with Jamaicans on the sidewalks and in cafes.
	   As the first English-speaking Caribbean nation to reach the
World Cup, the nation best known for languid reggae rhythms also
had a serious task, for which Brazilian coach Rene Simoes had
disciplined the Jamaican squad.
	   ``We are a small country and on the world stage, we have
something to prove,'' said Dennis Brown, 46, a Jamaican fan from
London attending the game.
	   However Jamaica fares, he would never miss the chance to see
them in soccer's greatest tournament.
	   ``This occasion may never come again,'' said Brown.

	   ``People who do that aren't the real fans,'' said Michael
Barrett, a 29-year-old Londoner. ``Wherever they go, there are
problems. ... It's too bad for the image we give of England.''
	   In London, British Sports Minister Tony Banks called the
troublemakers ``drunken, brain-dead louts.'' Home Secretary Jack
Straw said French police had full support of the British
government.
	   His eyes red from tear gas, George Fenwick of Gloucester
insisted he wasn't violent. ``But since the afternoon, the
Tunisians were provoking us, insulting us and making obscene
gestures.. Some young English fell into the trap and couldn't
control themselves.''
	   English fans were seen burning Tunisian flags while some of them
gave the Nazi salute.
	   ``One of them threatened us with a knife,'' said Majhid Bouzbhi.
``I'm worried about tomorrow's match.''
	   English fans pelted police overnight after a motorist who tried
to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one of the
fans.
	   Of four English fans arrested in that clash, a 20-year-old
Liverpool railroad employee remained in custody to face charges in
court Monday for allegedly attacking police.
	   Earlier Sunday, dozens of officers patrolled a festive
atmosphere along the sun-drenched cafes. Beaches were filled with
tourists, locals and topless sunbathers.
	   The British tabloid The Sun sent a topless orange double-decker
bus around town, with model-TV hostess Melinda Messenger handing
out hats.
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected at Monday's match, but
about 2,000 others were here looking for tickets on the black
market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police. Since the beginning of the World Cup last
Wednesday, submachine gun-toting troops on anti-terrorist duty have
also patrolled public areas.
	   French authorities faced unruly fans at the start of the World
Cup. About three-dozen police were injured in Paris after Tuesday's
street celebration, though the games have been virtually
trouble-free due to tight stadium security.

World Cup: Prosinecki, Suker tally in second half to lead 3-1 win 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Optional.
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Robert Prosinecki and Davor Suker never
silenced the reggae drums. They just turned down the volume a whole
lot.
	   Prosinecki and Suker scored 16 minutes apart in the second half,
vanquishing an outplayed and underdog Jamaican team 3-1 Sunday,
disappointing many in the packed house of 38,058 who came looking
for an upset.
	   It never really seemed likely. Croatia dominated possession and
the chances throughout, slipping only to allow a goal just before
halftime to give hope to the hopeless.
	   ``Obviously it was a big psychological chop when you give up a
goal right before halftime,'' Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic
said. ``But I told my team to push up more in the second half,
because I didn't think their counters would be quick enough to take
our defense by surprise.
	   ``I also told them right before they went out for the second
half they would not be allowed back in the dressing room without
three points.''
	   Prosinecki scored the goal that deflated Jamaica in the 53rd
minute, and Suker added a lot of insult to injury when he secured
the game in the 69th.
	   ``In the second half, that first goal was so tough because it
came so early,'' Jamaica's Brazilian coach Rene Simoes said. ``The
goal was so early and the team fell a little bit.''
	   Standing just outside the left side of the penalty area,
Prosinecki one-touched a free kick toward the endline to himself
and bent a ball that just skimmed under the bar at the far corner
of the goal.
	   The tally gave Prosinecki goals for two different teams in a
World Cup, having scored for Yugoslavia in a 4-1 victory over the
United Arab Emirates in 1990.
	   If Prosinecki's goal won the game, Suker's hurt more, at least
to the crowd.
	   Suker was involved in several altercations and once fell to the
ground well after play had stopped, drawing the ire of the
spectators. After that, every time he touched the ball drew loud
whistling.
	   But when he settled Stanic's cross and cracked a shot that
deflected off Ricardo Gardener's legs, the crowd was silenced.
	   ``I didn't play much with my club (European Cup champion Real
Madrid) last season,'' Suker said. ``But I trained hard so I'm
hungry for goals, and victories.''
	   Jamaica's lone moment of glory, that which gave them thoughts of
at least a draw, came just as the sides were about to head into
first-half injury time.
	   Robbie Earle ran full stride onto a midfield cross from Gardener
and drove a powerful header from eight meters just inside the left
post.
	   The goal came on only the third touch for Jamaica in Croatia's
penalty area in the half.
	   ``We knew they would come out strong in the second half, and
again started with their passing game,'' Earle said. ``We hoped we
could at least hang on for a point.''
	   Mario Stanic's goal in the 27th minute came on only Croatia's
second real chance, and seemed to do little to dampen Jamaica.
	   Starting with a short corner from Prosinecki, Dario Simic drove
along the end line and sent a cross back to Igor Stimac, whose
blast from 10 meters hit the crossbar.
	   The rebound fell to the feet of Stanic, who had settle the ball
with his left foot before shooting into an empty net.
	   ``We were fearing the game against Jamaica,'' Blazevic said.
``If we won tonight it was because we were a little more
experienced, and, although this may sound a little bit pretentious
and with all due respect to the Jamaicans, the better team.''

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's public approval ratings have fallen, leaving him tied
with leftist candidate Luiz Inazio Lula da Silva, according to an
opinion poll published Sunday.
	   The polling firm Datafolha showed that 45 percent of Brazilian
voters supported Cardoso, while 44 percent supported Lula, a
statistical tie. The rest of the voters said they did not know or
would cast blank votes.
	   The poll surveyed 12,592 Brazilians of voting age throughout the
country on June 8 and 9. It has a margin of error of 2 percentage
points.
	   Polls earlier this year showed Cardoso holding a strong lead
over all other candidates.
	   The first round of the elections is scheduled for October. A
runoff will be held if the winner doesn't receive more votes than
all other candidates combined.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A Mexico City police chief and five others
were injured in a triple car crash on the road to Toluca, the
capital of the neighboring state of Mexico.
	   Mauricio Tornero Salinas, chief of the city's judicial police
force, was reported in serious but stable condition Sunday at the
Los Angeles hospital with a sprained neck, a broken leg bone and
injuries to his nose.
	   The others, including two young girls and three of Tornero's
bodyguards, suffered lesser injuries, but details were not
immediately available. The judicial police is the criminal
investigating agency of the city attorney general's office.
	   Police sources, who insisted on anonymity, said the crash
occurred around 8:30 p.m. Saturday about 20 miles (35 kms) west of
Mexico City on the road to Toluca. But they refused to provide more
information.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Soccer's ever-present fear of fan violence became a
sobering reality as England fans clashed with police for the second
straight day Sunday, stealing much of the spotlight as three
nations made their World Cup debuts.
	   In the southern port city of Marseille, some 80 English fans
were arrested in a series of skirmishes that continued into Sunday
evening, with some youths breaking shop windows and trashing cars.
	   One English fan was hospitalized in serious condition after an
attacker slashed an artery in his neck. At least two-dozen English
fans suffered minor injuries and one police officer was injured in
the knee.
	   Many fans threw bottles and beer cans at riot police, who fired
back with tear gas. Scattered fights also broke out between British
and Tunisian fans, whose teams play Monday afternoon at the city's
Velodrome stadium.
	   About a hundred other singing and chanting English fans, many
drunk and shirtless, stood outside an Irish pub along one side of
the Old Port, littered with an overturned car, broken glass and
scattered cafe chairs.
	   As a result, 6th graf pvs.

	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived
Sunday night for talks with Tunisia's president, after meeting with
Egyptian officials on the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   Arafat on Monday was to see President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to
discuss the peace process as well as efforts to hold an Arab
summit, a Palestinian source said on condition of anonyity.
	   The head of the Palestinian Authority was accompanied by his
international cooperation minister, Nabil Shaath, among other

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans trashed cars,
smashed windows, fought with local youths and clashed with riot
police in a second day of violence Sunday, the eve of an
England-Tunisia match.
	   About 80 English fans were arrested in running street battles
through the Old Port that continued into Sunday evening, fueled by
alcohol and rage against pro-Tunisian fans who exchanged insults
with them.
	   Police with helmets and shields charged back with tear gas to
disperse the chanting mobs that showered them with bottles and beer
cans. It was the wild scene of hooliganism the French had hoped to
prevent during the five-week World Cup that only began Wednesday.
	   Diners in the Old Port, a trendy bar-restaurant district,
cowered inside eateries, watching the clashes that left behind
trashed cars, broken glass and scattered cafe chairs. Three bars
were ransacked.
	   Later Sunday evening, violence scattered into surrounding
streets. The pro-Tunisian fans _ mostly Marseille area youths from
working-class North African immigrant families _ attacked small
groups of English fans or smashed shop windows.
	   While most streets were calm by midnight, a crowd of
pro-Tunisian fans threw stones at British fans arriving at
Saint-Charles train station.
	   One English fan was hospitalized in serious condition after an
attacker slashed an artery in his neck. At least two-dozen English
fans suffered minor injuries and one police officer was injured in
the knee.
	   Authorities canceled a free evening concert in the Old Port,
where many restaurants closed for the night.
	   Some British fans said they were embarrassed by the violence

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Swaddled in traditional gauzy white,
tears streaming down their faces, hundreds of barefoot women prayed
for peace Sunday at the country's biggest Eritrean Orthodox church.
	   The sons, husbands and brothers of many were locked in a deadly
border conflict with Ethiopian forces.
	   ``I pray, `Please come back, my baby,''' said Hiwat, mother of a
28-year-old sent to the front.
	   Most of the women and men at the dawn service had already lived
through one of Africa's longest civil wars, between Ethiopia's
former Marxist government and Eritrean and Ethiopian rebels.
	   The fighting stopped when the rebel allies overthrew the regime.
	   After just seven years of peace, Eritreans wanted no more war.
	   ``The people want peace,'' said priest Ghebreamlak Tsegazeab.
``War will not solve our problems. Our two peoples pray to the same
God. We speak the same language. We were once friends, and we will
be again.''
	   In a sign of progress, the United States announced late Sunday
that Eritrea and Ethiopia had accepted a proposal to immediately
halt the use of air strikes in their border war.
	   The two countries agreed to the measure after President Bill
Clinton personally called the Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders, the
White House said.
	   The statement thanked Italy, ``whose diplomatic efforts has
helped to secure this agreement.''
	   Italian envoy Rino Serri had met with Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki late Saturday before flying Sunday to the Ethiopian
capital, Addis Ababa. He said diplomats had urged an end to air
raids as a first step toward ending their confrontation.
	   ``The friendship between these two countries is fundamental for
the stabilization of the entire area of the Horn of Africa and of
the entire continent,'' he said.
	   Other diplomatic efforts are in the works. A team of five
leaders appointed by the Organization of African Unity plans to
begin a mission later in the week, and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak is trying to arrange a cease-fire, according to Eritrean
Foreign Minister Haile Woldensae.
	   Although no skirmishes have been reported since Thursday,
hundreds have died in tank and artillery battles on three fronts
since early May.
	   Bombing raids have killed at least 48 civilians in two attacks
on northern Ethiopia, and four people were killed in two attacks on
a military-civilian airport on the outskirts of the Eritrean
capital Asmara.
	   Commercial flights to Asmara have been halted since June 5.
Ships have hovered off the coast, fearing the Ethiopians would bomb
the port of Massawa as they did during Eritrea's war for
independence.
	   Eritrea has complained bitterly to international officials about
the effective air and sea blockade.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after helping
rebels end 17 years of Marxist rule there in 1991.
	   Many Eritreans were more confused than angered by the border
conflict.
	   ``With war, whether you win or lose, you lose. We've worked so
hard to rebuild our country. We don't want to lose that progress
now,'' said a civil engineer who gave his name only as Yebio.
	   But most Eritreans, honed by 30 years of struggle for
independence, said they are ready to do their government's bidding.
	   ``The most important part of my life is my country,'' said
Dashim Mesgina, a 32-year-old singer who was composing lyrics for a
patriotic song at the cafe. ``Without a country, there is no life,
no religion, no family, no anything.''

problems. ... It's too bad for the image we give of England.''
	   In London, British Sports Minister Tony Banks called the
troublemakers ``drunken, brain-dead louts.'' Home Secretary Jack
Straw said French police had full support of the British
government.
	   His eyes red from tear gas, George Fenwick of Gloucester
insisted he wasn't violent. ``But since the afternoon, the
Tunisians were provoking us, insulting us and making obscene
gestures.. Some young English fell into the trap and couldn't
control themselves.''
	   English fans were seen burning Tunisian flags while some of them
gave the Nazi salute.
	   ``One of them threatened us with a knife,'' said French-born
Majhid Bouzbhi. ``I'm worried about tomorrow's match.''
	   English fans pelted police overnight Saturday after a motorist
who tried to force through a crowd struck and slightly injured one
of the fans.
	   Of four English fans arrested in that clash, a 20-year-old
Liverpool railroad employee remained in custody to face charges in
court Monday for allegedly attacking police.
	   Authorities were deploying a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police for Monday's match scheduled for 1230 GMT.
	   Ten thousand English fans were expected to attend. But about
2,000 others were in Marseille looking for tickets on the black
market, where prices were reportedly running as high as 2,000
francs (dlrs 330).
	   ``There won't be any trouble tomorrow, unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southhampton with his brother Oliver.
	   French authorities faced unruly fans at the start of the World
Cup. About three-dozen police were injured in Paris after Tuesday's
street celebration, though the games have been virtually
trouble-free due to tight stadium security.

Governing party wins parliamentary by-election 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with final vote tally in 4th, 5th grafs
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Despite Japan's economic slump, the governing
party's candidate won a by-election Sunday for a seat in
Parliament's lower house.
	   In a contest closely watched for clues to how national upper
house elections will turn out on July 12, opponents attacked the
economic policies of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   But Eiichi Iwashita, the candidate of Hashimoto's Liberal
Democratic Party, won the seat vacated by the resignation of
opposition politician Morihiro Hosokawa, a former prime minister.
	   With 100 percent of ballots counted, Iwashita had 67,620 votes
to 57,606 for Yorihisa Matsuno, a former secretary to Hosokawa.
Matsuno, 37, ran on the Democratic Party of Japan ticket and was
backed by three other opposition groups.
	   Sachiko Kawakami of the Communist Party had 23,240, and Sumio
Maruyama of the Social Democratic Party had 11,225.
	   Iwashita, 51, is a former prefectural assemblyman in Kumamoto,
910 kilometers (570 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   In the run-up to next month's upper house elections, Prime
Minister Hashimoto and Democratic Party leader Nato Kan both joined
in the Kumamoto campaign on Saturday.
	   Iwashita campaigned by urging support for Hashimoto's party in
its efforts to revitalize Japan's economy.
	   It was the first election for a seat in the national Parliament
under a new law extending voting hours by two hours, until 8 p.m.
(1100 GMT), in an effort to reverse the declining voter turnouts of
recent years.
	   But turnout reached only 47.96 percent, lower than 59.27 percent
in the last lower house election in the district in October 1996.
	   Hashimoto's party now has 262 of the 500 seats in the lower
house. In the less powerful 252-seat upper house, it has 118.

Hayes beats Furyk to win Buick Classic 
</HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HARRISON, New York (AP) _ J.P. Hayes earned the first victory of
his PGA Tour career Sunday with a birdie on the first hole of a
playoff with Jim Furyk at the rain-shortened Buick Classic.
	   The loss continued Furyk's frustrating, but lucrative, string of
near misses.
	   Furyk forced the playoff by making a 10-foot (3-meter) eagle
putt on the same par-5 18th used for the playoff, while Hayes,
playing in the same group, made a birdie out of a greenside bunker
on the final hole of regulation.
	   Both golfers started the day tied for the lead at nine under and
both shot 3-under-par 68s to finish at 201 in the tournament
shortened to 54 holes.
	   Tom Lehman finished third at 9-under 204, thanks to six birdies
on a final-round 65, the best score of the day. Bruce Fleisher was
fourth at 205 after shooting a closing 69.
	   Furyk drove into the left rough on the playoff hole and, when he
tried to duplicate the sensational 3-wood he had hit to the green
minutes earlier, he hooked the ball left into even deeper rough.
His wedge was on the back edge of the green, 40 feet (12 meters)
from the cup and he missed his birdie attempt by three feet (1
meter).
	   Hayes, meanwhile, was on the fringe in two, hit his first putt
within six feet (2 meters) and knocked the second one into the
center of the cup.
	   First-prize money of dlrs 324,000 at the Buick Classic was not
much less than the dlrs 368,610 Hayes had won in his five years on
the PGA Tour starting in 1992.
	   The tournament was cut to 54 holes because heavy rain and
lightning prevented Friday's second round from being completed
until Sunday morning. Hayes had to play five holes in the morning
and come back for the closing round in the afternoon.
	   Playing in the final group, Hayes and Furyk were by turns
brilliant and shaky during the closing round. Hayes made birdies on
Nos. 5, 6 and 7 to go 13 under and take his biggest lead of the day
at three shots. Furyk's birdie on 10 narrowed Hayes' margin to two
strokes.
	   On 14, the pressure started to get to both players when they
each three-putted.
	   Furyk got within a stroke with a birdie on 15, but both players
missed putts of less than eight feet (2.5 meters) on the par-3 16th
for two more bogeys.
	   Furyk hasn't won in two years, but he has remained in the top 10
on the money list by often finishing on the leaderboard on Sunday.
In his last three tournaments, Furyk has finished second at the
Colonial, fourth at the Memorial and second here and won dlrs
548,000. Furyk set a record in 1997 for most prize money ever
earned _ dlrs 1.6 million _ without winning a tournament.
	   The first-round leader, Kevin Sutherland, was only a stroke back
as the final round started, but fell out of contention with double
bogeys on Nos. 8 and 14. He also had a three-foot putt for par rim
out on No. 12.
	   He shot a 71 and finished at 6-under 207 along with Bob Tway.
	   Hayes' previous best finish was tying for sixth at the Anheuser
Busch Golf Classic in 1992. His best showing in 1998 came at the
Greensboro Chrysler Classic in April, when he tied for 42nd, and
overall he had only made the cut in three of eight events he played
and earned just dlrs 16,712.

Japan should boost yen and help stabilize regional economies 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
on Sunday called for Japan to urgently boost the yen, saying the
currency's dramatic fall was reigniting financial turmoil in Asia
and damaging economies throughout the world.
	   In an address on the first day of an Australian visit, Tung told
a dinner of business and academic leaders that Japan should be
doing more to stabilize the economic turmoil in the region.
	   ``No one should doubt the tremendous sacrifice that both Hong
Kong and the mainland of China are bearing to prevent the problems
of currency depreciation from cascading,'' Tung said.
	   ``I know we in Hong Kong and the leaders of Beijing have been
urged by many around the world to maintain the stability of our
currencies.
	   ``There needs to be a similar degree of urgency in stabilizing
the yen.''
	   As well as economic stimulus packages, the government of the
world's second largest economy had to develop credible policies in
the reform and liberalization of Japan's banking sector.
	   Tung said the stability of the Chinese renminbi and the Hong
Kong dollar needed to be maintained as the anchors of currency
stability in Asia. He said this could be done with reforms enforced
to cut out the inefficiencies that led to the turmoil.
	   ``We are now in the depth of a major economic adjustment, the
result of which may be prolonged and painful,'' Tung said.
	   ``We have negative growth in the first quarter and
unfortunately, the economy will continue to be difficult for the
future.
	   ``In the longer term, Hong Kong will begin from a much lower
base once recovery starts. This will help our competitiveness.''
	   Tung said Hong Kong was determined to defend the Hong Kong-U.S.
dollar link and will press ahead with planned spending on
infrastructure.
	   The yen slumped to an eight-year low last week amid growing
concern the central banks of the United States and Japan would not
coordinate an effort to stop the yen's plunge against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The Japanese currency, which traded at about 139 yen to the
dollar early last week, closed the week at around 144 yen to the
U.S. dollar.
	   Rattled by the yen's fall, Hong Kong's key benchmark Hang Seng
Index lost a total of 7.63 percent last week. Interbank rates hit
five-month highs, and are expected to jump.
	   Tung will meet with political and business leaders during his
six-day tour of Australia and New Zealand including Australian
Prime Minister John Howard and New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ NATO forces hope a show of force
Monday will persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
reconsider his tough policies in Kosovo province. Eighty NATO
fighters and reconnaissance aircraft were set to take off at dawn
for several hours of exercises over neighboring Albania and
Macedonia. The exercise, involving 13 of NATO's 16 member
countries, is meant to show how quickly and powerfully the Western
alliance can deploy its forces if needed. More than 300 people have
been killed in Kosovo since Yugoslavia launched a crackdown on the
southern province's ethnic Albanian majority in March.
(NATO-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States announced Sunday that the
governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia have accepted a proposal to
immediately halt the use of air strikes in their border war. Deputy
press secretary Joe Lockhart said President Bill Clinton personally
talked by telephone with the leaders of the two countries Sunday.
The White House announcement also thanked Italy for its help in
reaching the agreement. Eritrea and Ethiopia, one-time allies who
less than a decade ago were part of the same country, have battled
since early May over several stretches of their common border with
the loss of hundreds of lives. (ERITREA-ETHIOPIA)
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fierce fighting between rebel soldiers
and government troops in the West African country of Guinea-Bissau
continued Sunday as the insurgents denied government claims that
they had been crushed, according to reports. The two sides were
pounding each other's positions in the capital Bissau with rockets,
mortars and artillery, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
With the fighting escalating, thousands of people were desperately
seeking an escape route. The first reports emerged Sunday that 200
people had drowned as they fled Bissau by boat two days before.
(GUINEA-BISSAU)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and the United Nations agreed Sunday
to a two-month timetable to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, the chief U.N. inspector said. The two sides agreed to
work together for the next two months to try to verify that Iraq
has complied fully with U.N. orders to get rid of all weapons of
mass destruction and other illegal weapons. Chief arms inspector
Richard Butler announced the agreement at the end of his talks with
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz in Baghdad. Iraq must
eliminate its illegal weapons for the lifting of sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. (IRAQ-UN)
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ English World Cup fans trashed cars,
smashed windows, fought with local youths and clashed with riot
police in a second day of violence Sunday, the eve of an
England-Tunisia match. About 80 English fans were arrested in
running street battles through the Old Port that continued into
Sunday evening, fueled by alcohol and rage against pro-Tunisian
fans who exchanged insults with them. Police with helmets and
shields charged back with tear gas to disperse the chanting mobs
that showered them with bottles and beer cans. It was the wild
scene of hooliganism the French had hoped to prevent during the
five-week World Cup that only began Wednesday. (SPORTS-WORLD

Eds: Contains items on a Puerto Rican parade, Queen Margrethe, the
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Waving and wearing all varieties of the red,
white and blue Puerto Rican flag, thousands jammed a rainy Fifth
Avenue in New York on Sunday for the 40th annual parade celebrating
the culture of the Caribbean island.
	   Proud Puerto Ricans at the parade fashioned the colors of the
flag into capes, caps, scarves, sweatbands, necklaces and even
fingernail polish.
	   Others said they were unfazed by the show in which the character
Kramer uses a sparkler to light a cigar and accidentally tosses it
on top of a Puerto Rican flag, setting it on fire. Then, a group of
Puerto Ricans push Jerry's car down a stairwell leading to a
building's basement entrance.
	   ``Maybe he shouldn't have burned the flag, but people do it to
the American flag,'' said 23-year-old Elena Matias, a court clerk
from New Brunswick, New Jersey. ``I think people have better things
to be worrying about.''
	   Police reported no arrests and had no immediate estimate of the
total number of marchers and spectators. But in previous years, as
many as 2 million showed up and this year's turnout appeared to be
as strong.

	   HALSSKOV, Denmark (AP) _ Queen Margrethe put an end to more than
a century of picturesque ferry crossing Sunday by opening a central
Denmark road bridge linking Copenhagen to the European continent.
	   Danes who loved the scenic, but slow ferry journey now will
cross the Storebaelt bridge on a 18-kilometer (11-mile), four-lane
highway in about 10 minutes _ less than a fifth of the time it took
to sail.
	   With hundreds of spectators waving, and others following in
sailboats, the huge Arveprins Knud and five other ferries made
their final journey late Sunday. The ferries made a detour to sail
under the bridge and blasted their foghorns in a final solute.
	   Queen Margrethe and her husband, Prince Henrik, left this port
120 kilometers (70 miles) west of Copenhagen, and drove across the
bridge. They stopped at the highest point and threw flowers into
the sea in memory of the seven workers who died during the
construction work.
	   ``We'll now cross the country in one zip with the skies above us
and the sea under us,'' Queen Margrethe said.
	   ___
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ A group of Sri Lankan immigrants who live in
Milan were the last visitors Sunday to see the mysterious Shroud of
Turin, which will be put away from public eyes until August 2000.
	   Since the linen, which many believe had wrapped the body of
Jesus after his crucifixion, went on display in Turin's cathedral
April 18, some 2.4 million people came to gaze at the cloth.
	   Among the dignitaries was Pope John Paul II, who knelt in silent
prayer before the bulletproof display case last month. He urged
scientists to do more testing of the linen. Experts can't explain
how the cloth's faded image of a bearded man was made.
	   Results of carbon-14 testing 10 years ago indicated the cloth
dated to the 13th or 14th century, but some say contamination might
have skewed the results.
	   The shroud will be back on display here Aug. 26-Oct. 22 2000 as
part of Holy Year celebrations.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Going from supermodel to supermom hasn't been a
breeze for Elle MacPherson.
	   ``I'm the one who's up at 4 in the morning, going absolutely
bonkers because I haven't gotten sleep,'' MacPherson says in the
July issue of US magazine. ``I thought I would have an easier time
leaving the baby in the care of others, but I find I can't do
that.''
	   MacPherson gave birth to Arpad Flynn Alexander Busson on
Valentine's Day in a Manhattan hospital. The father is French
financier Arpad ``Arki'' Busson.
	   The child is already a globetrotter, jetting to his mother's
native Australia, Europe and the Caribbean before he's even 6
months old.
	   ``He's a great traveling companion,'' MacPherson said. ``He
already has seven stamps in his passport.''
	   ___
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A woman who sued Israel's national airlines for
sex discrimination was admitted to the company's pilot program
Sunday, more than three years after she handed in her application.
	   In December El Al announced a new equal opportunity employment
policy shortly after Orit Katsir, a pilot who flew for commercial
airlines in the United States, won her suit against the airline
whose policy was to only accept applicants who were former Israeli
air force pilots.
	   The Israeli air force, until compelled last year by Israel's
Supreme Court to change its policy, only accepted men to its pilots
course. Katsir and 15 others were accepted to the course which
begins next month.
	   El Al's new policy also opened the door to civilian pilots who
gained experience in civil aviation through other companies, and to
Israeli Arabs who generally do not serve in the Israeli army.

NATO allies give Milosevic a lesson in power 
</HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) _ NATO forces hope a show of force
will persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to reconsider
his tough policies in Kosovo province.
	   Eighty NATO fighters and reconnaissance aircraft were set to
take off at dawn Monday for several hours of exercises over
neighboring Albania and Macedonia. The exercise, involving 13 of
NATO's 16 member countries, is meant to show how quickly and
powerfully the Western alliance can deploy its forces if needed.
	   ``This is an exercise intended to demonstrate the alliance's
commitment to peace and stability in the region and the alliance's
ability to project power into the region,'' Lt. Gen. Michael Short,
commander of NATO air forces in the alliance's southern Europe
division, said at Aviano Air Base Sunday evening.
	   More than 300 people have been killed in Kosovo since Yugoslavia
launched a crackdown on the southern province's ethnic Albanian
majority in March. Thousands have fled across the border into
Albania and Macedonia, as well as the Yugoslav republic of
Montenegro.
	   Western leaders want to halt the violence, but have also said
they do not support efforts by ethnic Albanian militants seeking
independence.
	   NATO defense ministers ordered the air exercises on Thursday
during a meeting in Brussels. The ministers also ordered the
alliance's military planners to begin looking at a wide range of
options for future action, including direct intervention in
Yugoslavia with air and ground forces.
	   In the Adriatic sea aboard USS Wasp, Col. Emerson Gardner told
reporters: ``We need to show the people that need to know exactly
what we can do.''
	   The Wasp will throw four Harrier jump-jet attack aircraft into
the exercise, code-named Determined Falcon.
	   Planes are departing from 15 bases in five nations. Only Iceland
and Luxembourg, which have no air forces, and Canada, which could
not deploy planes to Europe on such short notice, will not
participate.
	   Among the aircraft taking part will be F-16s from Portugal,
F-18s from Spain, U.S. Air Force F-16s and KC-135 tankers, and
Marine Corps EA-6B early warning planes.
	   The NATO exercise will take place before Russian President Boris
Yeltsin has an opportunity to try to persuade Milosevic to back off
in Kosovo. Milosevic is in Moscow Monday and Tuesday. The Russian
leader has promised to use what influence he has on Milosevic to
defuse the situation.
	   Moscow has strongly opposed any direct intervention in
Yugoslavia, considering that all of the diplomatic options have yet
to be exhausted.
	   Emerson noted the Serbs have wide-range fighters from old MiG
21s to the newer MiG 29s, with surface-to-air missiles.
	   ``But all the risks have been assessed and we have taken
measures against it,'' Emerson said without elaborating. ``We feel
the mission can be accomplished safely.''
	   Short would not say just how close the allied planes will come
to the Yugoslav border. But Emerson said: ``We will be close enough
that the Serbs will know NATO will be there.''

Refugees trickle into Albanian and agencies prepare for more With NATO-Kosovo

	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ After walking 24 hours through the
mountains to cross the border into Albania, Shqipe Kuka summoned
all her strength to hold her squirming child.
	   Kuka, 30, was one of 40 refugees from Yugoslavia's Kosovo
province to reach this northern Albanian town Sunday, weary and
desperate for help.
	   ``We need the help of the entire world to end this terrible
drama,'' said Kuka. ``I pray to God to have this help not for us,
but just for our children.''
	   She and other ethnic Albanians in the group said they fled the
southwestern Kosovo villages of Popoc and Ponoshec, which were
completely destroyed when Serbian forces targeted them with sniper
fire, air missiles and heavy artillery.
	   The refugees also told of thousands of people camped in crude
shelters in the Kosovo mountains.
	   Muslie Demi, 55, said they don't want to come into Albania. They
want to stay near their homes so they can go back to them, even if
they're burned.
	   Another man who had crossed the border with Demi, but declined
to give his name, said the others were only resting in the
mountains and would cross the border in the coming days.
	   Either way, it is unlikely they will be able to return home
soon.
	   Since they started arriving two weeks ago, many refugees have
been taken into the homes of families in Tropoja.
	   Taulant Dedja, a special envoy of the Albanian government,
arrived Sunday to help international aid agencies convert former
military barracks around Tropoja into housing for the refugees.
	   Some 50,000 people have fled their homes in Kosovo, most seeking
safety in other parts of the province. But at least 13,000 of them
have arrived in Albania, 8,000 in the Yugoslav republic of
Montenegro, and others going to neighboring Macedonia.
	   Both the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and World Food
Program, said they were planning to begin moving tons of food and
non-food items from the Albanian capital Tirana to the border
region.

Japan's current account surplus rises 10 percent in April 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: CORRECTS dollar amount in 2nd graf
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade rose 10 percent
in April from a year ago, the government announced Monday.
	   Japan's current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal
factors, was at 1.170 trillion yen (dlrs 8.1 billion) in April, up
10.3 percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise, modest in comparison with recent months, was lower
than Tokyo-based economists had forecast. But it still marked the
13th consecutive monthly year-on-year increase in the surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its sluggish
economy to import more goods and cap a ballooning surplus.
	   Last month, the ministry announced that the current account
recorded its first annual increase on a fiscal year basis in five
years.
	   Japan's economy has been slumping for much of this decade. On
Friday, the government reported the second quarter in a row of
negative economic growth, confirming that the country has slipped
into recession.
	   Japan's economy also contracted on a fiscal year basis for the
first time since 1974, the Economic Planning Agency said.

World Cup: With complaints filed, authorities prepare to investigate ticket scandal AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The next move in the World Cup ticket scandal
should come from French prosecutors.
	   Organizers of soccer's world championship said Sunday that they
had filed a complaint against agents and tour operators allegedly
involved in the scam, which has left thousands of fans without the
tickets they had paid for or been promised.
	   While failing to identify the groups involved in the filing,
Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the organizing committee, said the
panel was adamant about prosecuting anyone who sold bogus tickets.
	   ``We are going to court and an investigation will be carried
out,'' he said.
	   On Saturday, French prosecutors said they would investigate
criminal charges against businesses and individuals involved in
ticket fraud.
	   Soccer's world body, meanwhile, officially cleared Colombia's
soccer federation of any ticket wrongdoing.
	   ``Without foundation,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said when
asked if any evidence against Colombia had been found in the
two-day investigation.
	   FIFA said Friday it was investigating an unidentified South
American country for ticket improprieties. French reports said it
was Colombia, although Colombian officials said they were in the
clear.
	   Soccer officials in Cameroon remain under a FIFA investigation
for allegedly mishandling World Cup tickets.
	   For more than a year, critics have said World Cup
ticket-distribution plans were unfairly weighted toward French fans
and sponsors. Of the 2.7 million tickets printed, almost 1.5
million were earmarked for interests in the host country, with the
rest distributed through tightly licensed channels.
	   Soccer federations worldwide and commercial sponsors of the
World Cup received almost 1.2 million tickets to distribute through
their own channels, leaving only 138,000 for the general public.
	   Fans were told to deal with 17 approved agencies worldwide to
get those tickets. But officials said many fans arrived in France
to discover tickets they thought would be waiting for them came
from unlicensed brokers and tour operators, especially in Japan,
where some 12,000 fans were left ticketless.
	   Similar, although smaller, cases have been reported in Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil.

World Cup: Despite 1-0 loss, Iranians satisfied 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Despite a 1-0 defeat against
powerful Yugoslavia, Iran's first World Cup game in 20 years was a
victory of sorts.
	   For Yugoslavia, Iran was the easy team to beat in Group F, which
also includes the United States and Germany. For the Iranians,
Sunday's opening World Cup game against some of Europe's best
players was something like David meeting Goliath.
	   In defeat, Iran's coach Jalal Talebi was a happier man than his
Yugoslav counterpart, Slobodan Santrac, was in victory.
	   ``We played fair and we played hard, and I'm not ashamed of the
result,'' Talebi said. Santrac, looking glum, said he was ``not
satisfied with the team.''
	   ``We played badly, especially in the midfield,'' Santrac said.
``Iranians were not as dangerous as we were bad.''
	   Yugoslavia's star-studded team has players that have shone in
their Spanish and Italian clubs.
	   But instead of crumbling against the powerful opposition as
expected, the Iranians put up a fight and went into the second half
with a scoreless draw. In the end, one of Sinisa Mihajlovic's
trademark free kicks gave Yugoslavia the only goal in the opening
match of the group.
	   Thousands of Iranian fans showed up to cheer their team, some
with their hair painted in the green-white-red of the Iranian flag.
Other had the flag painted across their faces.
	   The Iranians, making their first World Cup appearance since the
1979 Islamic revolution, played defensively. Their three
German-based strikers, Ali Daei, Karim Bagheri and Khodadad Azizi,
made frequent but ineffective counterattacks.
	   Daei, who recently signed up to leave Armenia Bielefeld for
Bayern Munich, nearly tied the game when he soared over two
Yugoslav defenders to head a cross into the arms of Yugoslavia's
keeper Ivica Kralj with three minutes remaining.
	   Iran played without its captain and main goalkeeper, Ahmad Reza
Abedzadeh, who was out with a bad knee.
	   Nima Nakissa, standing in for Abedzadeh at the Iranian goal,
came into his own in Sunday's game. Seven years younger than the
32-year-old captain, Nakissa nevertheless prevented several
dangerous attacks against his side.
	   Abedzadeh said the players were happy with the result.
	   ``We could have won this game, or at least equalize it,'' said
defender Mohammad Khakpour. ``In the end, we only lost on a free
kick.''
	   Standing up to a team with a reputation for no mercy has given
the Iranians new hope in their next two matches, against the United
States and Germany.
	   Given nearly 20 years of hostility between their two
governments, the June 21 game between Iran and the United States
will be the most politically charged in this year's World Cup.
	   Already, anti-American hard-liners in Iran are urging the
government to order players not to exchange T-shirts with the
Americans after the game.
	   ``After today, I believe we can beat any team. We are looking
forward to a victory against the United States,'' Talebi said.

World Cup: Croatian stars spoil Jamaican party 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS pvs.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ The reggae faded after halftime.
	   For 53 minutes, World Cup upstart and fan favorite Jamaica held
off Croatia's more experienced stars. Then Robert Prosinecki and
Davor Suker cruelly deflated the ``Reggae Boyz'' with two goals
that sealed a confidence-boosting 3-1 debut victory for Croatia,
considered one of the tournament's dark horses.
	   Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic was relieved that his team had
overcome the first-game jitters and can now concentrate on what is
expected to be a more difficult game against Japan on Saturday.
	   ``I'm very happy because I feared this game very much,''
Blazevic said.
	   As for Japan's performance in its 1-0 loss to Argentina earlier
Sunday, Blazevic said he was impressed that a ``soccer nation
without tradition'' had played ``such a modern game.''
	   Croatia's contest with Japan is ``wide open,'' he said.
	   That was never quite the case against Jamaica, which was
outplayed throughout the game to the dismay of its thousands of
boisterous fans among the 38,000 spectators.
	   Parma's Mario Stanic nailed Croatia's first goal on a rebound in
the 27th minute with a close-range blast between a Jamaican
defender and goalkeeper Warren Barrett after a deft series of
passes starting with a tapped corner kick by Prosinecki.
	   Sparked by drum-beating fans and a sea of yellow, green and
black _ Jamaica's national colors _ in the stands, the Caribbean
underdogs touched off a frenzy in the stadium only once, when
Robbie Earle sent a powerful header into Drazen Ladic's net at the
stroke of halftime.
	   After the break, the Croatians turned up the pressure after
Blazevic told the back four to move up ``because I didn't think
their counters would be quick enough to take our defense by
surprise.''
	   ``I also told them they would not be allowed back in the
dressing room without three points,'' the Croatian coach said.
	   Prosinecki obliged first, lifting a sharply angled lob over a
stunned Barrett eight minutes after halftime. Suker wrapped it up
in the 69th, ricocheting a close-range shot off Ricardo Gardener's
leg into the top of the goal.
	   They were sweet goals for both: Prosinecki is building up a
second wind at age 29 after some frustrating years in Spain; Suker
was buoyed after a season at European club champion Real Madrid,
Prosinecki's former club, in which he rarely made the starting
lineup.
	   ``I didn't play much at my club, so I'm hungry for goals and
victories,'' Suker said.

World Cup: South Korea faces almost certain elimination 
</HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT QUENTIN, France (AP) _ Following a 3-1 defeat in its
opening World Cup match to Mexico, South Korea's hopes of advancing
to the second round are virtually non-existent.
	   The South Koreans almost certainly would require unlikely wins
over soccer forces Netherlands and Belgium to remain in the
tournament.
	   Realizing the task at hand, the team has lowered its
expectations, saying it would be happy just to leave Europe with a
single victory _ its first ever in five World Cup appearances _
before it co-hosts the 2002 soccer showcase with Japan.
	   Next up for South Korea is Saturday's match against the strong
Dutch team _ one of the contenders for the World Cup title _ which
drew 0-0 with Belgium and is now desperate for a win to keep its
chances of advancing alive.
	   ``Our own chances now are very, very slim,'' South Korean coach
Cha Bum-kun said Sunday. ``It will be very, very difficult for us
to get to the second round now.
	   ``Maybe we can get a 0-0 draw with Holland, and then go full out
against Belgium for a win.''
	   The task has been made even more difficult because of injuries.
	   Star striker Hwang Sun-hong was sidelined with a knee injury
earlier this month, and midfielder Choi Sung-yong has not fully
recovered from a twisted ankle.
	   ``Some of our best players are injured,'' said Cha. ``Hopefully
they'll have recovered sufficiently for our matches against
Netherlands and Belgium.
	   ``It is very difficult when you only have one striker. For our
next match against Holland, our toughest match, I'll have to
reinforce the defense of our team, and play counterattack.''
	   In addition, South Korea will have to play the Dutch without Ha
Seok-ju, who scored the Asian team's only goal against Mexico.
	   Ha was given a red card during Saturday's match for tackling a
Mexican player from behind and is thus automatically suspended for
the next game.
	   Following the defeat to the Mexicans, morale in the Korean camp
was very low Sunday.
	   ``We really thought we had a chance against Mexico,'' team
official Chun Hanjin said. ``If a certain thing is destined to go
wrong, everything falls apart, which is what happened to us.''

World Cup: Japan had missed chances in 1-0 loss to Argentina 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Japan could not beat the odds to manage
a draw, let alone a miracle upset, in its 1-0 loss to Argentina at
their World Cup opener.
	   But the players were content with having convincingly kept one
of the world's top strikers, Gabriel Batistuta and company, to just
one goal.
	   ``They couldn't do anything when I could mark them well. So I
now feel I can be effective against the best in the world,'' said
Yutaka Akita, who was marking the aptly nicknamed ``Batigol'' most
of the game. ``We were able to play aggressive defense.''
	   Akita, who headed off several dangerous passes to Batistuta,
gave a thumbs-up sign and bowed deeply to the thousands of fans
chanting his name before kick off _ a touching moment that seemed
to symbolize Japan's arrival at the World Cup.
	   The stands were roaring with chants of ``Nippon!'' _ or Japan _
more than an hour ahead of the game. Japanese flags and blue
plastic bags filled with air waved frantically in the air at the
Toulouse stadium.
	   ``Show your killer passes to the world,'' said one banner for
orange-haired star midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata, considered a
candidate for the European leagues.
	   The fans said they were relieved Japan had not lost by a
humiliating margin.
	   ``I'm happy. One goal, hey, that's great for Japan,'' said
19-year-old Tokyo student Takahisa Fujiki, who had to watch the
game on a huge screen set up nearby for the thousands of fans
without tickets.
	   The goal from two-time World Cup champion Argentina came in the
28th minute, when a through pass from Ariel Ortega found Batistuta,
although Nanami was right behind him.
	   The Fiorentina attacker popped the ball in, past advancing
goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi.
	   But Japan had a series of opportunities.
	   In the first half, Naoki Soma got clear of Javier Zanetti and
rushed to head a pass, but the shot was too high.
	   Six minutes from the end, Japan almost snatched a leveler when
Akita climbed above Diego Simeone to head a pass from Motohiro
Yamaguchi across the face of the Argentine goal.
	   Soma tried to shove it in but collided with Argentine goalkeeper
Carlos Roa, and the ball slid outside the net.
	   ``I think we were able to play as equals,'' Soma said. ``We're
almost there, and we'd shoot but we couldn't score. We just need
that one little bit more. We're not going to get better overnight,
but we can become mentally stronger.''
	   Argentine coach Daniel Passarella said he was relieved to have
won.
	   ``It's important to win the first one. It's always hardest to
win the first one,'' he told reporters.
	   Japanese coach Takeshi Okada took the loss hard.
	   ``We had a chance for a win or a draw. Even if we played
commendably, we could not produce the results,'' he said.
	   Lineups:
	   Argentina _ Carlos Roa; Roberto Ayala, Roberto Sensini (Jose
Chamot 72nd), Javier Zanetti, Nelson Vivas; Matias Almeyda, Diego
Simeone, Juan Veron, Ariel Ortega; Claudio Lopez (Abel Balbo,
61st), Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Japan _ Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi; Akira Narahashi, Masami Ihara,
Eisuke Nakanishi, Yutaka Akita, Naoki Soma (Takashi Hirano, 84th);
Hiroshi Nanami, Hidetoshi Nakata, Motohiro Yamaguchi; Shoji Jo,
Masashi Nakayama (Wagner Lopes, 65th).
	   Referee _ Mario Van Der Ende, Holland.

Fighting escalates in Kosovo as NATO prepares for show of force With NATO-Kosovo, Albania-Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting escalated on several fronts
in Kosovo, with Serbs and ethnic Albanians trading blame for the
clashes, as NATO geared up for a show of force to try to persuade
Yugoslavia's president to halt his offensive in the southern
province.
	   On Sunday, Serb forces launched 500 grenades into villages in
the Decani area in western Kosovo, according to the Kosovo
Information center, which is close to the pro-independence Albanian
leadership.
	   In the provincial capital of Pristina, Serbian police colonel
Novica Zdravkovic said ethnic Albanian militants killed two
policemen and injured two others in separate incidents in Kosovo's
southwestern Djakovica region and the Decani area.
	   More than 300 people have died since the crisis escalated in
March, when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown on separatist ethnic Albanians fighting to free the
province from Serbia.
	   Fearing the conflict could spill over into neighboring Albania
and Macedonia, Western nations warned Milosevic last week that he
must change his hard-line policy or face the threat of force.
	   NATO warplanes from across Europe prepared at an airbase in
northern Italy for simulated air attacks in Albania and Macedonia
in an effort to intimidate the Serbs into stopping attacks on the
ethnic Albanians.
	   Albania and Macedonia, countries neighboring Kosovo, have agreed
to let their territory be used for the exercises, which were
ordered by allied defense ministers Thursday.
	   NATO also has called for its military planners to study options
for even tougher action, while insisting that it is only studying
its options to be ready for any political decisions.
	   Outside Belgrade on Sunday, Yugoslavia demonstrated its own air
power in an airshow displaying military helicopters and planes,
including Russian-made MiG29 jets. The show is an annual event.
	   The main ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic League of Kosovo,
said Serbian military and police forces ``began a broad attack''
with heavy artillery against three villages in the Djakovica area,
near the border with Albania.
	   The Kosovo Information Center added that Serb police brought
reinforcements of about 40 armored vehicles and 15 tanks into the
region.
	   The center also said Serb forces launched grenades against a
cluster of villages northwest of Pristina in the Drenica region,
where the government crackdown began earlier this year.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed, since
police and ethnic Albanian militants, known as the Kosovo
Liberation Army, have set up a maze of blockades in contested areas
across the province.
	   Milosevic revoked Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 in an attempt
to suppress the Albanian independence movement. But since the
crackdown began, the KLA has grown stronger and more popular among
ethnic Albanians.
	   The KLA controls an estimated 40 percent of the province, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   About 50,000 people have fled the fighting, many of them across
the border to Albania or Macedonia, or to the province of
Montenegro, which together with Serbia forms Yugoslavia.

Dollar higher, Japanese stock prices fall in early trading 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar extended its gains against the yen
early Monday on continuing worries over Japan's economy. Tokyo
stock prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 144.64 yen in early trading, up 0.62 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo to again match its highest level since August
30, 1990, also touched briefly Friday.
	   In New York, the dollar settled at 144.72 yen late Friday.
	   The yen has been under selling pressure as investors bought
dollars on strong U.S. economic growth and a weakening economy in
Japan.
	   On Friday, the Economic Planning Agency said Japan's gross
domestic product had contracted for two consecutive quarters,
confirming that Japan has dipped into recession.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the yen's decline and selling by
foreign investors on renewed fears about economic turmoil in Asia
drove stock prices down.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 92.01 points, or 0.61
percent, to 14,930.32 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Friday, the Nikkei gained 8.29 points, or 0.06 percent.
	   A weaker yen makes Japanese exports cheaper and more
competitive, thus hurting the economies of other Asian countries
such as South Korea and Thailand.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 4.92 points or 0.42 percent, to 1,172.33.. The
TOPIX closed down 1.56 points, or 0.13 percent, on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.210 percent, unchanged from Friday's
finish. Its price also remained unchanged at 111.94 yen.

World Cup: Dutch consider appeal over two-match ban 
</HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It just gets worse for Patrick Kluivert.
	   Expelled from a World Cup game against Belgium, the troubled
young Dutch striker will miss the two other group games against
South Korea and Mexico after being suspended for two matches.
	   If the Dutch don't make it to the second round, that means his
World Cup is already over.
	   Kluivert, whose career looked set for greatness two years ago
but has been dogged by a fatal car accident, a rape allegation and
loss of form, was furious that he was sent off against Belgium.
	   In an unsavory incident that was thought to have had racial
overtones, he was shown the red card for elbowing Belgium's Lorenzo
Staelens in the chest after the two players had collided going for
the ball.
	   As play continued, Kluivert, who is black, walked toward the
Belgian defender, waving his finger in admonishment, and planted
his elbow in Staelen's chest.
	   He explained Friday it was because of something Staelens said to
him. Kluivert said he was ``deeply hurt'' by the Belgian defender's
comments although he declined to eleborate.
	   ``I pushed him,'' Kluivert said after a training session in
Versailles. ``I couldn't control my emotions. My actions were
nothing to do with the way the match was going.''
	   Dutch team officials, who are considering an appeal against the
ban, were still fuming at the way the burly Staelans fell to the
ground clutching his face after the contact.
	   ``It was only a minor incident,'' team spokesman Rob de Leede
said. ``Patrick lightly pushed the player and then we saw a piece
of theater, with Staelens going down like he was hit by Mike
Tyson.''
	   Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said that he didn't condone Kluivert's
action but understood it.
	   ``Though he shouldn't have reacted in that way, you can't
exclude emotions from a game like that,'' he said.
	   The other two players expelled so far, Bulgaria's Anatoli Nankov
and Ha Seok-ju of South Korea, received only one-game bans.
	   Nankov was sent off for two yellow cards in the game against
Nigeria while Ha became the first player to be expelled in the
World Cup for a foul tackle from behind.
	   FIFA declined comment on the two-match ban on Kluivert because
of the possibility of an appeal.

English, Tunisian fans fight their match a day early AP Special Correspondent

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ England and Tunisia fought their World
Cup match a day early, heaving bottles, smashing windows and
shouting filthy insults. Police arrested some 80 English fans, and
sporadic violence continued early Monday.
	   One English fan was hospitalized in serious condition after an
attacker slashed an artery in his neck. At least two dozen others
suffered injuries.
	   At Saint-Charles train station, a group of Tunisians ambushed
English fans arriving on a midnight train. Heads were bloodied on
both sides before police could intervene.
	   ``It will get worse, whatever happens,'' said Gary Lazarus, a
London printer who came for a tranquil soccer match. ``If England
loses, people will want revenge. If Tunisia loses, they'll come
after us.''
	   English fans spent most of Sunday drinking peacefully, if
noisily, at bars on the Canebiere, a once elegant boulevard that
has gone to seed. Young Tunisians from the tough northern suburbs
buzzed them repeatedly on motorscooters, waving flags.
	   ``Some silly person hit a Tunisian and started it,'' according
to Jeff Cotgrave, 30, an electrical worker from Birmingham, who
left the area for safety.
	   ``I know Englishmen aren't all so good, but the Tunisians and
police provoked English supporters all day,'' he said. ``We haven't
even played a match and look what they're doing. It's all because
of a bad reputation. I find that scandalous.''
	   Few Tunisians were anxious to speak. When asked how the trouble
started, one demanded: ``Is this an interview?'' For emphasis, he
brandished the heavy metal pole he was carrying.
	   Hundreds of police, with riot gear, tear gas and dogs, separated
small groups of Britons from excited crowds of local Tunisians, who
chanted and taunted.
	   The English fought back when they could evade police lines. At
one point, a dozen of them stood behind an unfurled Union Jack,
urging a bottle-throwing crowd to attack. When one young Tunisian
advanced, a Briton slammed him with a chair.
	   Police picked off drunken English stragglers, wrestling them to
the ground, handcuffing them, and hauling them off to jail.
	   As riot troops led away a bald, burly Englishmen, Tunisian kids
jeered.
	   ``Give us their ears, and keep a count,'' one yelled.
	   ``Hit that queer with your nightstick,'' another shouted.
	   Down the street, a huge Englishman still on the loose ran after
a young Arab, threatening serious harm in unprintable language.
	   The running battle prevented an outdoor concert that brought
people from miles (kilometers) around for a World Cup party in the
ancient port.
	   ``We were eating dinner and suddenly got a mouthful of tear
gas,'' said Christian Pierre, a mason who brought his wife from
their Vaucluse village for a night on the town. They surveyed a
panorama of smashed glass and shook their heads.
	   Three sober young Englishmen were distressed by the rioting.
They had met the day before at a police station where they
separately reported break-ins of their cars.
	   ``I'm here on holiday, and all I want to do is see my team
play,'' said Lazarus, one of the three. He had covered up his blue
and red Coventry soccer jersey with a sweatshirt.
	   He said part of the blame belonged to unruly English soccer
thugs, but he added that the French had allowed tension to build.
	   ``They were even selling an official World Cup knife,'' he said,
although sales were halted well before the tournament began. ``Can
you imagine? Here, buy your official murder weapon.''
	   Lazarus spent an entire day dialing Paris to order one of the
extra tickets France made available after European Union partners
complained that too many were kept for the French.
	   ``As soon as I said I was from London, the lady hung up the
phone,'' He said. His friends confirmed that French operators
refused to sell tickets to people with English addresses,
apparently in fear of hooligan violence.
	   Scott Astle, 30, one of his friends, was also bitter that all
English fans had been treated as thugs and forced to defend
themselves.
	   ``Those guys (Tunisians) kept at it, over and over,'' he said.
``Some people have pretty short tempers. What can you expect?''
	   In London, British Sports Minister Tony Banks called the
troublemakers ``drunken, brain-dead louts.'' Home Secretary Jack
Straw said French police had full support of the British
government.
	   Authorities planned to deploy a total of 1,600 uniformed or
plainclothed city police, 200 gendarmes and about 100 elite CRS
national police for Monday's match scheduled for 1230 GMT.

Eds: includes items on Milutinovic motivation; Saudis can't pass;
<TEXT>
	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ Count on Bora Milutinovic to spring a
surprise motivational tactic at the World Cup.
	   Two hours before Nigeria took the field for its opening game
against Spain in Nantes, the wily coach _ who was with the United
States in 1994 and now has taken a record four countries to the
World Cup _ gathered his players in front of the TV and popped in a
videotape.
	   Game footage? Not quite.
	   It was a recording of encouraging messages from several of the
players' parents back in Nigeria. The unorthodox motivation
certainly didn't hurt: Nigeria twice rallied from one-goal deficits
to stun the Spaniards 3-2.
	   ``We had no idea he had that tape,'' said Sunday Oliseh, who
scored the winner with a blast from nearly 30 meters (yards) out.
``You can imagine what that did for us before the game. It was
extraordinary.''
	   After his goal, which was clocked at 116 kph (72 mph), Oliseh
pointed at Stephen Dosu, who was sitting in the stands at Beaujoire
Stadium. Dosu was the goalkeeper on Nigeria's 1996 Olympic
champions but was injured in a car crash hours after the Super
Eagles beat Kenya in June to clinch a spot at the World Cup.
	   ``I wanted to dedicate the goal to him,'' Oliseh said. ``He
should be playing with us.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MOISSY, France (AP) _ Having coached Brazil to its fourth World
Cup title in 1994, Carlos Alberto Parreira has a great reputation.
	   But he's telling his Saudi Arabian players at this World Cup not
to expect him to pass the ball for them.
	   ``It's completely out of the hands of the coach if the players
can't pass the ball to each other properly. We will have to make
extra efforts to make better passes,'' said Parreira, whose team
went down 1-0 against Denmark on Friday.
	   Parreira is aware that his team has a tougher game against host
nation France at Saint-Denis Friday. The French scored a one-sided
3-0 victory over South Africa.
	   ``It's a big game for us to play against the home team. They are
one of the favorites to win the World Cup'' Perreira said.
	   ``They had a good start and that puts us under a lot of
pressure.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The funeral of Fernand Sastre, co-president of the
World Cup organizing committee who died Saturday of a long illness,
will take place Wednesday at Saint-Maur-des Fossees, near Paris.
	   Aime Jacquet, coach to the French national team, continued the
tributes Sunday.
	   ``He was a great leader,'' Jacquet said. ``Let's not forget that
it's thanks to him and to (co-president) Michel Platini that this
World Cup is being played in our country. He worked endlessly so
that this event would be a success.
	   ``From now on, the French team will play thinking of him and for
him.''

Violence erupts among English, Tunisians at World Cup AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The fifth day of the World Cup saw some 80 arrests,
123 fouls, a two-game ban for a wayward elbow and two lackluster
1-0 games.
	   The sixth day, when England plays, could be even worse.
	   Officials were nervous and police were on high alert awaiting
the Monday afternoon kickoff of the England-Tunisia match in
Marseille, a game preceded by three days of violent clashes among
England and Tunisian fans, local youth and riot police.
	   ``It'll be worse (Monday), whatever happens,'' said England fan
Gerry Lazarus, a printer from London. ``If England loses, people
are going to want revenge. If Tunisia loses, they'll come after
us.''
	   The first skirmishes occurred Saturday night and continued most
of the day Sunday and early Monday, fueled by drunkenness and
filthy insults traded by fans from the two nations. Shop windows
were smashed, cars were overturned, and innocent diners cowered in
the scattered restaurants that dared stay open during the mess.
English fans burned Tunisian flags while giving Nazi-like salutes.
	   One English fan was hospitalized in serious condition after an
attacker slashed an artery in his neck. At least two-dozen fans
suffered minor injuries, and one police officer was injured in the
knee. Police said they made about 80 arrests.
	   ``What can we do to combat these individuals?'' said Sepp
Blatter, the newly elected president of world soccer's governing
body, FIFA. ``We must get rid of them, stop them from entering
stadiums and return them to their countries. Football is a game,
and must bring joy to the whole world.''
	   Some 1,900 police were patrolling Marseille, anticipating more
violence in part because as many as 2,000 of the estimated 12,000
English fans came to the city without tickets, hoping to find some
on the black market.
	   ``There won't be any trouble (Monday), unless too many English
are kept out of the stadium for a lack of seats,'' said Kevin
Sharpe, who came from Southampton, England, with his brother.
``France should sell more tickets.''
	   The violence was condemned in England, but English Football
Association security advisor Brian Hayes dismissed suggestions that
the country withdraw from the tournament.
	   ``That's absolute rubbish,'' Hayes said. ``The England team have
been training for years, they've qualified, they're here as of
right, this is nothing to do with football, this is just sheer
hooliganism and drunkenness.''
	   While fretting over the rampages in the streets, FIFA also dealt
with a nasty on-field confrontation.
	   Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert was banned for two games for
elbowing Belgium's Lorenzo Staelens in the chest during Saturday's
0-0 draw at Saint-Denis. Kluivert, who received a red card for the
foul, will miss the Netherlands' other first-round games against
South Korea and Mexico.
	   Kluivert, who is black, said he lashed out at Staelens after
being ``deeply hurt'' by what he said were offensive comments made
by the Belgian defender.
	   ``I pushed him,'' Kluivert said. ``I couldn't control my
emotions.''
	   Sunday's games weren't much of a distraction from the day's
sobering developments, despite the presence of three teams making
World Cup debuts.
	   Argentina beat Japan and Yugoslavia downed Iran, both by the
score of 1-0. Croatia, as expected, easily handled Jamaica 3-1 in
Lens, although the result did little to dampen the enthusiasm of
thousands of green-black-and-yellow clad Jamaican fans who beat
drums and danced before, during and after the game.
	   And, unlike the English, they caused no trouble.
	   ``We're here to have fun,'' said Trevor Bird, who had driven
from Amsterdam to watch his team. ``We know we won't win the World
Cup. But we don't even have a professional league and we qualified.
That's reason enough to celebrate.''
	   Mario Stanic, Robert Prosinecki and Davor Suker scored for
Croatia and Robbie Earle netted for Jamaica in a game matching
World Cup newcomers. Prosinecki also scored for Yugoslavia in the
1990 World Cup, before the breakup of the Balkan nation.
	   There were 60 fouls _ including 35 from World Cup first-timer
and 2002 host Japan _ in Argentina's victory, which was decided by
Gabriel Batistuta's 28th minute goal in rainswept conditions at
Toulouse.
	   ``There are things we can improve,'' Argentine captain Diego
Simeone said. ``But the order of the day was to win, and we did.''
	   At Saint-Etienne, Sinisa Mihajlovic's 25-meter free kick in the
73rd minute gave Yugoslavia its victory in a game between two
nations back in the World Cup following politically related
absences.
	   Yugoslavia was banned from the 1994 tournament because of
international sanctions, while Iran's once-formidable soccer
program took a downturn after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Next on the Iranians' schedule: a potentially tense showdown
with the United States on Sunday.
	   ``Our mission at the World Cup is not over with this loss,''
Iranian coach Jalal Talebi said. ``We will fight on. ... We are
looking forward to a victory against the United States.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Cone won for the ninth time in 10 starts
and Tino Martinez drove in three runs as the New York Yankees tied
a U.S. Major League Baseball record by winning or splitting their
24th straight series.
	   With a 4-2 win over the Cleveland Indians on Sunday, the Yankees
tied the 1912 Boston Red Sox and 1970 Cincinnati Reds for most
consecutive non-losing series.
	   Heavy rains postponed the first two games of the three-game
series, the first meeting between the clubs since last October's
American League playoffs, and the finale began in a light rain and
was played in at least a constant drizzle throughout.
	   Cone (9-1) struck out 12 and allowed just four hits in eight
innings for New York, which hasn't lost a series since dropping two
games to open the season at Anaheim.
 &UR; Royals 2, Tigers 0 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Glendon Rusch scattered seven hits in
his first major league shutout.
	   Rusch (4-8), who had lost five straight decisions, walked none
and struck out five. He never faced more than four batters in an
inning and permitted only one runner past first base.
	   Rusch, making his 41st start in the big leagues, won for the
first time since beating the Toronto Blue Jays 7-4 on April 30.
	   Johnny Damon gave the Royals a 1-0 lead two pitches into the
Kansas City first, homering off rookie Seth Greisinger (0-2). Luis
Rivera added an RBI single in the sixth.
 &UR; Twins 2, White Sox 1 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, LaTroy Hawkins pitched seven strong innings and
Orlando Merced went 3-for-4 to lead Minnesota.
	   Hawkins (4-6), who lost his last two decisions and had not won a
game since May 23, gave up just four hits and struck out five. The
only run scored against him was unearned.
	   Rick Aguilera pitched a perfect ninth inning for his 13th save.
 &UR; Athletics 4, Mariners 3, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, third baseman Russ Davis' error in the
10th inning led to the winning run after Seattle's bullpen blew
another save.
	   Seattle got home runs from David Segui, Alex Rodriguez and
Glenallen Hill to increase their major league-leading total to 112,
but they weren't enough to overcome another failure by the
Mariners' bullpen.
	   Heathcliff Slocumb (1-4) issued a leadoff walk to Scott Spiezio
in the 10th and Ben Grieve followed with a single. Matt Stairs then
flied out to right, advancing Spiezio to third.
	   Blowers grounded sharply to third and Davis bobbled the ball and
was unable to make a play on Spiezio, who had broken for home.
 &UR; Red Sox 3, Devil Rays 2, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In Boston, Troy O'Leary got two hits for the sixth straight
game, including a one-out single in the 10th inning that gave
Boston its fourth consecutive win.
	   Nomar Garciaparra singled off Albie Lopez (2-2) to start the
10th and Mike Benjamin, who pinch-ran for Mo Vaughn earlier, bunted
for a single.
	   After Reggie Jefferson lined out against reliever Matt Ruebel,
O'Leary bounced Jim Mecir's fourth pitch down the first-base line
past Fred McGriff for the winning run.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ The leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia have
agreed to immediately halt the use of air strikes in their border
war, according to a U.S. presidential spokesman.
	   President Bill Clinton personally talked personally by telephone
with the leaders of the two countries Sunday during an Air Force
One flight from Los Angeles to Washington, deputy press secretary
Joe Lockhart said.
	   While the agreement does not end the border dispute between the
Horn of Africa countries, the White House said it ``can help
restore the mutual confidence necessary to achieve a peaceful
resolution of the conflict as quickly as possible.''
	   There was no immediate comment from the Ethiopians.
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea, one-time allies who less than a decade ago
were part of the same country, have battled since early May over
several stretches of their common border with the loss of hundreds
of lives. No skirmishes have been reported since Thursday
	   Ethiopia has insisted that Eritrea withdraw its troops from more
than half a dozen disputed areas, the largest being the
160-square-mile (414-square-kilometer) Yirga triangle _ before
peace talks can begin. Eritrea has refused, claiming it owns the
disputed territory, based on boundaries drawn by Italy when it
occupied the country in 1885.
	   The White House press office statement announcing the agreement
was issued shortly before the president's plane landed Sunday in
suburban Maryland.
	   It said the moratorium against air strikes, as well as threats
of air strikes, ``will continue indefinitely or until such time as
either party concludes that any prospect for a peace process has
come to an end and provides formal advance notice to the U.S.
government that it will no longer respect this moratorium.''
	   The statement also thanked Italy for diplomatic efforts that
helped to secure the agreement.
	   Italian envoy Rino Serri met with Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki late Saturday before flying Sunday to the Ethiopian
capital, Addis Ababa.
	   ``A cessation of air raids is a partial aspect of a cessation of
hostilities, and that's what we want,'' a spokesman for Isaias,
Yemane Gebremeskel, said before the announcement of the agreement.
	   Other diplomatic efforts were in the works. Five leaders
appointed by the Organization of African Unity planned to begin a
mission later in the week. To avert a full-scale war that could
destabilize the region, the African delegation is seeking a plan
that would allow both Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and
Isaias to back down with honor.
	   Also, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was trying to arrange a
cease-fire, according to Eritrean foreign minister Haile Woldensae.
	   Eritrean bombing raids have killed at least 48 civilians in two
attacks on northern Ethiopia. Ethiopian warplanes killed four
people in two attacks at a military-civilian airport on the
outskirts of the Eritrean capital Asmara.
	   Commercial flights to Asmara have been halted since June 5.
Fearing continued violence, embassies evacuated thousands of their
citizens in chartered flights.
	   Ships have hovered off the coast, fearing the Ethiopians would
bomb the port of Massawa as they did during Eritrea's 30-year war
for independence.
	   Eritrea has complained bitterly to international officials about
the effective air and sea blockade.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991, and Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   After just seven years of peace, many Eritreans want no more
war.
	   Swaddled in traditional gauzy white, hundreds of barefoot women
prayed for peace Sunday at Eritrea's biggest Orthodox church.
	   ``I pray, `Please come back, my baby,''' said Hiwat, mother of a
28-year-old sent to the front.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Waving and wearing all varieties of the red,
white and blue Puerto Rican flag, thousands jammed a rainy Fifth
Avenue in New York on Sunday for the 41st annual parade celebrating
the culture of the Caribbean island.
	   Proud Puerto Ricans at the parade fashioned the colors of the
flag into capes, caps, scarves, sweatbands, necklaces and even
fingernail polish.
	   Others said they were unfazed by the show in which the character
Kramer uses a sparkler to light a cigar and accidentally tosses it
on top of a Puerto Rican flag, setting it on fire. Then, a group of
Puerto Ricans push Jerry's car down a stairwell leading to a
building's basement entrance.
	   ``Maybe he shouldn't have burned the flag, but people do it to
the American flag,'' said 23-year-old Elena Matias, a court clerk
from New Brunswick, New Jersey. ``I think people have better things
to be worrying about.''
	   Police reported no arrests and had no immediate estimate of the
total number of marchers and spectators. But in previous years, as
many as 2 million showed up and this year's turnout appeared to be
as strong.

	   HALSSKOV, Denmark (AP) _ Queen Margrethe put an end to more than
a century of picturesque ferry crossing Sunday by opening a central
Denmark road bridge linking Copenhagen to the European continent.
	   Danes who loved the scenic, but slow ferry journey now will
cross the Storebaelt bridge on a 18-kilometer (11-mile), four-lane
highway in about 10 minutes _ less than a fifth of the time it took
to sail.
	   With hundreds of spectators waving, and others following in
sailboats, the huge Arveprins Knud and five other ferries made
their final journey late Sunday. The ferries made a detour to sail
under the bridge and blasted their foghorns in a final solute.
	   Queen Margrethe and her husband, Prince Henrik, left this port
120 kilometers (70 miles) west of Copenhagen, and drove across the
bridge. They stopped at the highest point and threw flowers into
the sea in memory of the seven workers who died during the
construction work.
	   ``We'll now cross the country in one zip with the skies above us
and the sea under us,'' Queen Margrethe said.

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ A group of Sri Lankan immigrants who live in
Milan were the last visitors Sunday to see the mysterious Shroud of
Turin, which will be put away from public eyes until August 2000.
	   Since the linen, which many believe had wrapped the body of
Jesus after his crucifixion, went on display in Turin's cathedral
April 18, some 2.4 million people came to gaze at the cloth.
	   Among the dignitaries was Pope John Paul II, who knelt in silent
prayer before the bulletproof display case last month. He urged
scientists to do more testing of the linen. Experts can't explain
how the cloth's faded image of a bearded man was made.
	   Results of carbon-14 testing 10 years ago indicated the cloth
dated to the 13th or 14th century, but some say contamination might
have skewed the results.
	   The shroud will be back on display here Aug. 26-Oct. 22 2000 as
part of Holy Year celebrations.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Going from supermodel to supermom hasn't been a
breeze for Elle MacPherson.
	   ``I'm the one who's up at 4 in the morning, going absolutely
bonkers because I haven't gotten sleep,'' MacPherson says in the
July issue of US magazine. ``I thought I would have an easier time
leaving the baby in the care of others, but I find I can't do
that.''
	   MacPherson gave birth to Arpad Flynn Alexander Busson on
Valentine's Day in a Manhattan hospital. The father is French
financier Arpad ``Arki'' Busson.
	   The child is already a globetrotter, jetting to his mother's
native Australia, Europe and the Caribbean before he's even 6
months old.
	   ``He's a great traveling companion,'' MacPherson said. ``He
already has seven stamps in his passport.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A woman who sued Israel's national airlines for
sex discrimination was admitted to the company's pilot program
Sunday, more than three years after she handed in her application.
	   In December El Al announced a new equal opportunity employment
policy shortly after Orit Katsir, a pilot who flew for commercial
airlines in the United States, won her suit against the airline
whose policy was to only accept applicants who were former Israeli
air force pilots.
	   The Israeli air force, until compelled last year by Israel's
Supreme Court to change its policy, only accepted men to its pilots
course. Katsir and 15 others were accepted to the course which
begins next month.
	   El Al's new policy also opened the door to civilian pilots who
gained experience in civil aviation through other companies, and to
Israeli Arabs who generally do not serve in the Israeli army.

Phillies 4, Cubs 2 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
Eds: Recaps previous to UPDATE with late games.
<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Carlton Loewer pitched a five-hitter to win
an impressive major league debut Sunday, leading the Philadelphia
Phillies over the Chicago Cubs 4-2.
	   Loewer walked none and struck out eight, retiring 14 straight
batters at one stretch.
	   Loewer became the first pitcher to throw a complete game in his
major league debut since Boston's Nate Minchey beat Cleveland 11-1
on Sept. 12, 1993. The last NL pitcher to do it was Tim Wakefield,
who led Pittsburgh over St. Louis 3-2 on July 31, 1992.
	   With his parents in town from Louisiana to watch, Loewer kept
the Cubs off-balance by mixing his fastball and changeup. He gave
up an RBI single to Henry Rodriguez in the second inning, then did
not give up another hit until Mickey Morandini singled to start the
seventh.
	   Mark Clark (4-7) allowed nine hits, including five doubles, in
five-plus innings.
 &UR; Astros 6, Reds 3, 10 innings
	   In Cincinnati, the Houston Astros scored two runs off Jeff Shaw
to tie it in the ninth and three more off him in the 10th inning,
rallying past the host Reds.
	   Bill Spiers started the tying rally with a leadoff double in the
ninth and hit a two-run homer off Shaw (1-4) in the 10th, his
fourth hit of the game.
	   Shaw, who had not given up an earned run in his previous 18
appearances spanning 25 1-3 innings, gave up one hard-hit ball
after another. He had a 0.97 ERA when he took the mound _ best
among NL closers _ but gave up seven hits, a walk and five runs in
two innings.
	   Billy Wagner (1-2) pitched out of a threat in the bottom of the
ninth and got the final three outs for the win.
 &UR; Braves 5, Expos 1
	   In Atlanta, Kevin Millwood pitched a four-hitter and Bobby Cox
equaled Frank Selee as the winningest manager in Braves history as
Atlanta defeated the Montreal Expos.
	   Cox's record during two stints as the Braves manager improved to
1,004-819. His overall mark is 1,359-1,111, making him the 22nd
winningest manager in baseball history.
	   Selee won 1,004 games from 1890-1901 when the Braves were in
their original city, Boston. His teams won five NL pennants, one
more than Cox has achieved during the Braves' run of success in the
1990s.
	   On a more contemporary note, Millwood (9-2) joined teammates Tom
Glavine and Greg Maddux as the NL's top winners in his second
complete game.
	   Carlos Perez (6-5) lost despite hitting his third career homer.
 &UR; Pirates 7, Brewers 2
	   In Pittsburgh, Mark Smith, Aramis Ramirez and Kevin Young
homered in the first three innings and the Pittsburgh Pirates
finally mounted some offense against the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   The Pirates had scored only six runs in four consecutive losses
to the Brewers until homering three times off Steve Woodard (3-5),
who had allowed only two homers in 13 previous appearances.
	   Pirates starter Chris Peters (2-4) went on to retire the side in
order in five of the six innings he pitched, needing only 56
pitches in his longest start of the season.
 &UR; Cardinals 2, Diamondbacks 0 &QC; 
	   In Phoenix, Royce Clayton singled twice and scored after each
hit, and Mark Petkovsek pitched five strong innings and drove in a
run as St. Louis defeated Arizona.
	   Petkovsek (4-3) allowed two hits and walked two before a cramp
in his left leg forced him to leave the game. Kent Bottenfield
pitched two-hit relief for four innings for his fourth save.
	   Willie Blair (2-9) struck out Mark McGwire three times. McGwire
drew his major league-best 71st walk in the sixth and reached third
on a double by Gary Gaetti, but Ron Gant grounded out to end the
inning.
 &UR; Padres 3, Giants 2 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Quilvio Veras ended a 500 at-bat homerless drought
with a solo shot in the sixth inning as the San Diego Padres won
their seventh straight.
	   Veras, who earlier had a RBI single, broke a 1-1 tie when he
connected off Danny Darwin for his first homer since last July 4.
	   The Padres swept the three-game series that started with the two
teams tied for the NL West lead. The Giants lost their fourth
consecutive game following an 11-game winning streak.
	   Padres starter Andy Ashby (9-4) allowed one run and five hits in
7 1-3 innings. Trevor Hoffman pitched out of a jam in the ninth for
his 20th save this season and 28th in a row dating back to last
year.
 &UR; Rockies 3, Dodgers 2, 12 innings &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Todd Helton hit a two-run single after a
throwing error by reliever Scott Radinsky in the 12th inning as
Colorado defeated Los Angeles.
	   Vinny Castilla greeted Radinsky (2-3) with a single leading off
the 12th and Jeff Reed laid down a sacrifice bunt to the right of
the mound. Radinsky threw wildly past first baseman Jim Eisenreich,
putting both runners in scoring position.
	   Helton, who entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the bottom of
the ninth, grounded a single up the middle for a 3-1 lead.
	   Mike DeJean (2-0) earned the victory with a perfect 11th inning.
Eisenreich hit an RBI single in the 12th off Jerry Dipoto, and
Chuck McElroy got the last out for his first save.
 &UR; Marlins 5, Mets 4 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Todd Zeile singled home the winning run with two outs
in the bottom of the ninth as Florida, shut out for six innings by
Hideo Nomo, rallied against New York's bullpen.
	   Nomo, seeking his first win since being traded from the Dodgers
to the Mets, gave up just four hits and left with a 3-0 lead. But
Cliff Floyd's two-run homer capped a four-run burst by Florida in
the eighth that tied it at 4.
	   In the ninth, Edgar Renteria singled with two outs for his third
hit of the game. Todd Dunwoody followed with a hit-and-run single
off John Hudek (0-4) that sent Renteria to third. Zeile, who had an
RBI double in the eighth, then grounded a single into center for
the victory.

Galen Hall adds another title as his Rhein Fire win World Bowl 
</HEADLINE>
By ROY KAMMERER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Rhein Fire Coach Galen Hall has won
his first World Bowl title, upending the Frankfort Galaxy 34-10.
	   Hall twice before had been thwarted in his attempt to win with
his Duesseldorf team in NFL Europe's championship game, following
1992 and 1997.
	   But the 58-year-old coach has been successful many other times.
His 1984 Florida Gators won the national college championship in
some polls and he was an assistant coach on two Oklahoma teams that
were elected unanimiously.
	   ``You can't compare, because the situation is so different,''
said Hall. ``But this one is especially gratifying, because you
have to take 42 new players and get them to work together.''
	   Hall has to thank an unlikely candidate for the Rhein Fire
winning the title in the U.S. National Football League's
developmental league, which ripens talent for the big leagues.
	   Jim Arellanes, a Seattle Seahawks allocatee, was told just an
hour before kickoff that he was starting for the injured Mike
Quinn, the Pittsburgh Steelers' player who is the league's
top-rated quarterback.
	   Arellanes had thrown just one pass and taken two snaps, right
after Quinn sprained his ankle in the final regular season game.
	   Arellanes responded Sunday by stepping in and tossing three
touchdowns, making the Galaxy reel with big plays.
	   Despite a muddy field after a first-quarter downburst, Arellanes
hooked up with Dialleo Burks for 15 and 27 yards and Marcus
Robinson for 74 yards.
	   Arellanes finished 12-of-18 for 263 yards passing in front of
47,546 wildly cheering German fans at Waldstadium _ NFL Europe's
largest crowd of the season.
	   ``I'm not surprised at the way he played. He's thrown very well
in practice,'' said Hall. ``He's got a good NFL future ahead of
him.''
	   Before the German fans, who like to blow horns and sing
throughout the contest, had even settled into their seats,
Arellanes had launched his first pass. A fleaflicker play, it
fooled the Galaxy and landed 40 yards downfield in Robinson's arms.
	   ``I wasn't nervous at all. I think I was well prepared,'' said
Arellanes, who wore crib notes on his arm with plays in case the
crowd noise from the rowdy Germans got overbearing.
	   Arellanes wasn't the only Fire weapon against the Galaxy. The
team, which started out 6-0 before losing motivation by clinching a
World Bowl berth, showed a solid running game with 158 yards.
	   Robinson, the league's offensive MVP headed to the Chicago
Bears, gained 114 yards on just two passes. Ed Philion, who led the
league in the category, sacked Galaxy quarterback Chris Dittoe
twice and helped pressure him into just an 111-yard passing
performance.
	   ``This is a very good team,'' said Hall, who will lose a number
of those players to the NFL next season.

Economy, cronyism likely to dominate Malaysia's ruling party assembly 
</HEADLINE>
By BETH DUFF-BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ When Malaysia's ruling party opens
its general assembly this week in a majestic Islamic skyscraper,
it's likely to be haunted by the specter of Indonesia.
	   Malaysia's crumbling economy and charges of corruption and
cronyism will be high on the unwritten agenda for the United Malays
National Organization's convention that opens Wednesday.
	   The same ingredients led to deadly riots and the downfall of
Indonesian President Suharto last month.
	   In Malaysia, there are opposition calls for the resignation of
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and rumblings of discontent within
the UNMO, the dominant force of the 13-party coalition that has
ruled this Southeast Asian nation since it gained independence from
Britain in 1957.
	   Many are comparing Suharto and his old friend Mahathir, who has
replaced the Indonesian as the longest-serving leader in Asia.
Mahathir, in power for 17 years, frequently has denied accusations
of nepotism such as those directed at Suharto and his family.
	   Last week, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim _ Mahathir's
hand-picked successor _ reiterated the prime minister's belief that
irrational currency speculation was at the root of Malaysia's
economic woes.
	   But he conceded that ``internal weaknesses also contributed to
some of the problems.''
	   ``If we are unwilling to accept this, then we may face the
Indonesian situation where the people demanded changes. Therefore,
we have to make changes before it is too late,'' he said.
	   One prominent faction of the 2.7-million-strong UMNO already is
pressing for economic policy change.
	   ``There's no doubt that the question of economics will dominate
the discussion'' at the assembly, said Abdul Razak Baginda,
director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a private
think tank. ``But cronyism, corruption and nepotism _ that's the X
factor.''
	   Abdul Razak expects Mahathir, in his general assembly speech on
Friday, to lay out his strategy for economic recovery. Though he
may launch into one of his heated tirades against currency
speculators and the International Monetary Fund, Mahathir likely
will focus on national unity and continuity of government
leadership.
	   UMNO discord has been playing itself out for weeks.
	   Mahathir and Anwar have been at odds publicly over economic
policy, further damaging investor confidence.
	   Interest rates, currently between 12 percent and 16 percent, are
too high and are hurting businesses, Mahathir argues. Anwar and the
central bank have defended the tough monetary policy, contending
higher interest rates are needed to stop capital flight and
maintain price and currency stability.
	   Meanwhile, the head of the powerful UMNO Youth wing, Ahmad Zahid
Hamidi, said evidence of corruption and power abuse would be
brought before the general assembly.
	   ``It seems very clear that the lines have been drawn,'' said
Abdul Razak, the analyst. ``It's very clear that when Zahid brought
up those issues, he was targeting only one person.''
	   That person was Mahathir.
	   No one expects him to resign during the general assembly.
Mahathir recently said he would gladly step down once he had
stabilized the economy.
	   An editorial last week in the Harakah newspaper, published by
the fundamentalist All Islamic Religious Party, said the problem is
Mahathir.
	   ``The economic crisis that has beleaguered this nation is due to
the plans and directions of the country he rules,'' the editorial
said. ``But if Mahathir himself is the problem, how can the
problems end if he doesn't step down?''
	   The Asian Wall Street Journal suggested Mahathir retire and let
Anwar concentrate on economic recovery.
	   But Mahathir is loath to be told what to do _ especially by the
foreign press, whom he often accuses of trying to topple him.
	   ``I suspect that he wants to wait until the economy and general
situation sees some improvement'' before he resigns, said Chandra
Muzzafar, a political science professor at the University of
Malaysia.
	   ``He's still got quite a bit of fire in him.''

Japan's current account surplus rises 10 percent in April surplus, declines in both exports and imports, other details 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS; ADDS detail about how weak yen helped increase
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade rose for a 13th
consecutive month in April, the government announced Monday.
	   Japan's current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal
factors, gained 10.3 percent to 1.17 trillion yen (dlrs 8.1
billion) from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry said.
	   Japan's surplus with the world rose despite the financial crisis
in the rest of Asia as a weaker yen boosted the competitiveness of
its products in the U.S. and European markets.
	   The Japanese currency fell to 145 yen to the U.S. dollar Monday
from a level of about 115 a year ago. A weaker yen helps Japanese
exporters by allowing them to cut prices overseas and increasing
the yen value of dollar-based profits.
	   Still, despite the weaker yen, total exports fell for the first
time in 33 months, declining 2.4 percent as shipments to Asia
dropped sharply.
	   But imports, hit by sluggish domestic demand, fell by a wider
margin, dropping 13.8 percent for the fourth month in a row of
decline.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and payments owed overseas, excluding investment.
	   The latest rise, modest in comparison with recent months, was
lower than Tokyo-based economists had forecast.
	   Last month, the ministry announced that the current account
recorded its first annual increase on a fiscal year basis in five
years.
	   The ministry Monday said that the pace of growth the surplus was
slowing and that a sharp rise wasn't expected in the long term.
	   As its surplus has risen, Japan has come under pressure to
revive its sluggish economy and reverse the yen's slide. The
tumbling Japanese currency threatens to throw Asia into renewed
turmoil by eating into the market share of other Asian exports in
the United States and Europe.
	   Japan's economy has been slumping for much of this decade. On
Friday, the government reported the second quarter in a row of
economic contraction, confirming that the country has slipped into
its third recession of the 1990s.

Money and power wrangles cloud EU drive to reunite Europe 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders must plot a course
out of a tangle of disputes or risk delaying their plan to draw in
their eastern neighbors in hopes of finally ending the post-war
division of Europe.
	   The 15 EU nations agree the union's workings must be streamlined
before it brings in Poland, Cyprus, Estonia and up to eight other
new members. But heading into a two-day summit on Monday, they were
hopelessly split on how the reforms should adjust the EU's balance
of power.
	   The leaders know taking on the poor farmers and declining
industries of the old east bloc will add to the EU's budget burden,
but they can't agree on who should pay.
	   Germany, the EU's biggest donor, says its contribution should
fall. But poorer members _ Greece, Portugal and Spain _ resist talk
of diverting the flow of EU funds from south to east.
	   ``There are horribly complicated disputes that are going to have
to take place,'' said Alastair Campbell, spokesman for British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, the current EU president.
	   Campbell acknowledged Britain was not going to broker a solution
over the two-day Cardiff summit, the climax of its six-month EU
presidency. Britain hopes to at least get the debate on track so
the enlargement can go ahead in the first half of the next decade.
	   ``If we can put economic reform and political reform for the
future right at the top of the agenda, that is a significant
advance,'' Blair told reporters in the Welsh capital Sunday.
	   French President Jacques Chirac said reform was essential before
the union could open its arms to its ``brothers'' to the east and
reunite the European ``family'' after the divisions of the Cold
War.
	   ``To be frank, (EU institutions) do not work very well,'' Chirac
told BBC television Sunday. ``When we are more than 15, they won't
work at all.''
	   Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wrote to Blair to say
the way ahead was to devolve power from EU head office to national
governments to create what the French leader called a ``Europe of
nations.''
	   But smaller EU nations fear that's a ploy to allow the EU's big
countries to dominate.
	   When the EU leaders last sought to overhaul the body a year ago,
they produced the Treaty of Amsterdam, a much watered-down
compromise that most now acknowledge solved none of their problems.
By relaunching the debate now, the Europeans are aiming to resolve
the institutional dispute and the divisions over who pays by 2000.
	   They are unlikely to get a breakthrough on Germany's 21 billion
mark (dlrs 11.7 billion) net-contribution to EU coffers until after
the country's legislative elections in September.
	   Away from their internal problems, the EU leaders will have
their customary debate on how to get Europe's 18 million unemployed
back to work. They are boosted this time by encouraging signs of
economic recovery.
	   EU foreign ministers, also in Cardiff, will monitor developments
in the Balkans as NATO launches air exercises over Albania in an
effort to dissuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from
pursuing his military action in Kosovo.
	   The 15 finance ministers will focus on the latest economic
wobbles in Russia and East Asia.

Rising violence tarnishes peace in Central America With FEA-Violent-Vigilantes, FEA-Violent-Tourists

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ It wasn't war that put Carlos
Gutierrez Espana in Rosales Hospital, his left hand amputated, his
right hand hacked.
	   It may have been the peace.
	   Gutierrez was maimed in a robbery, the victim of a crime wave
that has surged since 12 years of civil war ended in 1992.
	   Today, crime is killing Salvadorans faster than the war did, and
at a rate 10 times that of New York City's. Depending on how the
statistics are read, El Salvador may now be Latin America's most
violent nation.
	   The end of the war may have actually fueled the violence.
Repressive police departments were dismantled and new ones put
together with inexperienced officers, leaving gaps in authority.
Weapons moved from the battlefield to civilian hands. Refugees
returned home, some schooled by criminal gangs in U.S. cities.
	   ``Truthfully, what we're suffering from is a transition,'' says
Rodrigo Avila, chief of the National Civilian Police. ``What we're
experiencing is a trauma, a trauma of passing to a new system of
government, a new system of openness.''
	   The problem is not just El Salvador's. Crime is rising
throughout Central America, fed by widespread poverty, corruption
and a breakdown in the traditionally strong family structure.
	   In countries where civil wars were fought in the 1980s _ El
Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala _ ex-combatants became civilians
with few skills beyond an ability to kill. Some formed gangs, often
with police or army connections, specializing in extortion, car
theft, drug trafficking and kidnapping.
	   Even Costa Rica, seen as the safest Central America country in
the 1980s, has not been untouched. Foreign tourists have become
frequent crime victims there.
	   Crime has slowed the post-war recovery. Money that could be used
for education is spent on police and jails. Health care systems are
stretched thin. Young men who could be rebuilding their nations are
dying young, languishing in prison, or _ like Gutierrez _ lying in
hot, crowded hospital wards.
	   Gutierrez was robbed in March while walking home in Nahuizalco,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the capital, San Salvador.
	   One man with a shotgun and a second with a large knife stole his
wallet containing 2,800 colones (dlrs 320) _ his monthly pay from a
sugar processing plant. A scuffle broke out when Gutierrez asked
for his public insurance card. While one man held him down, the
other slashed. Gutierrez raised his hands to fend off the blade.
	   ``Look at how I am now. I can't do anything,'' he says,
gesturing to his arms. ``I'm missing a hand. I can't grab hold of
anything.''
	   Violent crime in El Salvador, already high in 1996, was worse
last year, statistics from the national prosecutor's office show.
	   Homicides climbed to 8,281 from 8,019 and crime-related injuries
increased to 15,697 from 14,352. During the war, an average of
6,330 people died violently each year _ about 76,000 overall.
	   In this nation of some 6 million people, about 23 Salvadorans
are slain each day. New York City, with more than 7 million
residents, averages about two homicides daily.
	   El Salvador's homicide rate is more than 100 per 100,000
population. Colombia _ long considered the most violent country in
Latin America _ had a rate of 81 per 100,000 in 1996, the most
recent year available.
	   Some criminologists say the statistics are misleading because
countries use varying methods to report homicides. Avila, the
national police chief, says El Salvador includes some deaths in
homicide statistics that other nations don't, such as some traffic
fatalities and suicides.
	   Still, Avila adds, ``It doesn't interest me to be second or
third.''
	   Dr. Julio Cesar Gomez Flores sees the violence first-hand at
Rosales Hospital, where most victims of violence, like Gutierrez,
are young men, wounded by bullets or blades.
	   Gomez Flores, the chief resident anesthesiologist, recalls a
gang leader killed after being put in a police cell with members of
a rival gang three years ago. He was stabbed 132 times.
	   ``The war desensitized us,'' Gomez Flores says. ``I'm talking
about the human quality that each of us develops. Each person who
saw so many dead and wounded could no longer feel anything.''
	   Violence is a part of Salvadoran history. For generations,
military dictators supported by the country's wealthy elite used
brute force to preserve power.

<TEXT>
	   In 1979, leftist rebels united as the Farabundi Marti National
Liberation Front and fought against a series of U.S.-backed
governments. Right-wing death squads killed suspected rebel
sympathizers with impunity.
	   A U.N.-mediated cease-fire was signed in January 1992 and the
war ended that December. Peace agreements called for land reform,
conversion of the rebels into a political party and a smaller
military.
	   Former combatants are now politicians and there is no talk of
revolts or coups. The FMLN party holds San Salvador's mayoral seat
and is the second-largest bloc in the national legislature.
	   But the accords did little to help civilians.
	   ``No one thought of the children, no one thought of the
teen-agers who were born during the conflict and became accustomed
to the environment of a war, to violence, to death,'' says Ruth
Anabella Henriquez Chavez, deputy attorney general responsible for
children's rights.
	   Some children who moved with their families to the United States
during those years joined gangs, got arrested and were sent back to
El Salvador. Returning alone, many joined newly formed Salvadoran
chapters of their old gangs.
	   ``I thought that going around with a gang was the right thing to
do,'' says Julio Cesar Chavez, a former member of the Los
Angeles-based Mara Salvatrucha gang now in the hospital recovering
from shotgun wounds.
	   Inexperienced police and a judicial system in flux also are
problems. And the political reforms didn't address the problem of
weapons. Guns used in the war still circulate, and others can be
purchased legally and easily.
	   In Guatemala, citizens have formed vigilante groups to mete out
their own justice to criminals. That hasn't happened in El
Salvador, but many people here say they are more scared now than
they were during the war.
	   ``Before, the fighters were guerrillas or from the army,'' says
Lorena Abrego, who recently was struck in the chest by a wayward
bullet while waiting for a bus. ``If there were conflicts, if there
were confrontations, it was between them. The civilians had nothing
to do with it.''

Fighting intensifies in Guinea-Bissau, U.S. Embassy reported hit

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Rebel soldiers and government troops in
Guinea-Bissau pounded each other's positions in the capital with
rockets, mortars and artillery, with several empty embassies
reportedly hit and the insurgents denying claims they had been
crushed.
	   The intensified fighting in the West African country's capital,
Bissau, came as the insurgents denied government claims that they
had been crushed. Guinea-Bissau is a former Portuguese colony.
	   The U.S. and Swedish embassies, the main hospital and the
Finance Ministry took direct hits, Portuguese radio RDP-Africa
said. Damage to the Russian and French embassies also was reported.
	   With the fighting escalating, thousands of people were
desperately seeking an escape route. Reports emerged Sunday that
200 people had drowned as they fled Bissau by boat two days before,
Lusa said.
	   There was no reliable information on the number of casualties in
the fighting.
	   Fighting between the rebels and government forces, backed by
reinforcements from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea,
has centered on a garrison in the suburb of Bra, where the
mutineers have been holed up since launching a coup attempt a week
ago.
	   A rebel spokesman, Maj. Gomes Fernandes, described as ``pure
propaganda'' the government's claim, made on state radio Saturday,
that the renegades had been dislodged from the garrison, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   A Portuguese Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that embassy
staff in Bissau were holed up in the building. The situation was
``still very serious,'' he said.
	   All Americans who wanted to leave have done so safely, including
Ambassador Peggy Blackford and her four remaining staff, who left
Sunday before the shelling, said State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin.
	   A spokesman from the Foreign Office in London said that six
Britons in the West African nation were thought to be safe.
	   Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman Tommy Andersson reported that
about two dozen Nordic citizens in Guinea-Bissau were safe, and
there were no plans to evacuate them despite heavy shelling.
	   The rebels are led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, who was fired in January amid allegations of smuggling arms
to separatists in Senegal. He has accused President Joao Bernardo
Vieira of corruption.
	   Also Sunday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi sent a military
delegation to Guinea-Bissau in a bid to broker peace, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The agency said the three-day visit was aimed at reaching
reconciliation between the warring sides so ``they can concentrate
on development.''

	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Michael Jordan, practically all by
himself, made the Chicago Bulls champions for one more and perhaps
one last time.
	   Jordan scored 45 points Sunday and made the key play of the game
like only he could, stealing the ball from Karl Malone and hitting
a jumper with 5.2 seconds left to give Chicago an 87-86 victory and
a 4-2 series victory over the Utah Jazz.

Arab tradition drying up: Iraq's baths going out of business With FEA-Syria-Vanishing Storytellers

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Everyone is equal under the domed roof.
There are no rich men or poor men. Only men without clothes sitting
languidly on stone benches, soaking in clouds of steam to drain the
dirt from their skin.
	   The picky opt for the 20-minute full body scrub by a masseur
dressed only in shorts and vigorously wielding a horsehair mitt to
scrape layers of dead skin and dirt with every stroke.
	   For centuries, these scenes have been repeated at the
``hammamat,'' or bathhouses, that have flourished in the Arab world
since medieval times _ when much of Europe had yet to discover
soap, let alone plumbing.
	   Now the hammamat are running out of steam, falling victim to
modernization.
	   In cities like Baghdad, Mosul, Cairo and Damascus, which boasted
the best and oldest, many public baths have been demolished to make
way for new neighborhoods, streets and shopping complexes.
	   Lack of business has forced others to close, their vast vaulted
chambers, lit by sunlight filtering through colored glass on domed
roofs, lying unused and crumbling.
	   ``We are on the verge of extinction,'' said Jamil Hamza
Mashgoor, manager of the Rasheed Bath for Men, the oldest surviving
bathhouse in Baghdad. He said only about 30 are left in the city,
once home to about 100 hammamat.
	   The West knows such baths as Turkish baths, even though they
predate the Ottoman Turkish rule in the Mideast. In Arabic a bath
is a ``hammam,'' the plural ``hammamat.''
	   Baghdad's baths have faced an extra blow from the nearly eight
years of U.N. economic sanctions that crippled the economy and
shrunk wages.
	   ``People are saying, `It is better I wash at home rather than
pay 350 dinars to get myself washed,''' said Mashgoor, who has run
the Rasheed hammam for 40 years.
	   New customers could easily miss his establishment, which is
entered through a rickety door, nestled in a row of shops on
Rasheed street, a chaotic marketplace along the Tigris River.
	   The door opens to a dark and dirty corridor leading into a wide,
ill-lit chamber called the ``menza,'' where customers undress and
where they return after bathing to sip tea in tiny glass cups and
munch split beans.
	   Newer baths, such as the Hajmehdi Hammam in the upscale Karrada
neighborhood, provide lockers. Towel-wrapped customers carry locker
keys on elastic bands around their wrists.
	   Wearing rubber sandals, bathers at Hajmehdi clop through a
doorway protected by a thick plastic curtain into the hammam, a
large circular room. Stepping in, customers are hit by hot mist so
thick that breathing is an ordeal. The smell of steam, soap and
sweat rises from the scalding tile floor.
	   During peak hours one recent afternoon at the Rasheed hammam,
two men sat hunched on a bench, drops of sweat trickling down their
sticky hair. A naked middle-aged man reclined in a shallow stone
bowl built into the floor, washing himself from the hot and cold
taps extending from the white tiled wall. The other bathing basins
were empty.
	   In its heyday, the Rasheed hammam used to serve about 1,000
people a day. ``Now if we get 30 customers, we are lucky,'' said
Mashgoor, who is also the hammam's masseur, or the ``muddalik.''
	   The decline of Iraq's baths began in the 1980s when Iraq's oil
wealth reached its citizens. They began moving to suburbs into new
homes with modern plumbing and some even with saunas.
	   To many, the hammamat were once a social retreat, something like
the gentlemen's clubs in England. Bridegrooms went for pre-nuptial
cleansings.
	   For women, the baths provided the only refuge from the humdrum,
cloistered life of conservative Muslim society. Women also used the
pretext of nudity to check prospective daughters-in-law for
physical flaws.
	   Often, the baths would be reserved for all-women parties with
children, said Nasira al-Sadoun, director of the Baghdad Central
Library, recalling her childhood days in the 1940s.
	   ``Every week, my mother used to invite all the upper class women
of Baghdad, and servants used to clean their backs,'' she said.
``We took with us oranges, sandwiches, tea. Oh, it was a feast!''

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The air is heavy with the smoke of
cigarettes and gurgling water pipes. Strong, dark tea is served by
bored-looking waiters to attentive customers.
	   You might expect the crowded al-Nofara Cafe, one of Syria's
oldest and most famous, to be filled with noisy chatter and music.
But not a sound is heard as Abu Shadi takes his place on a tall
chair to begin his story for the evening.
	   And for an hour the ``hakawati'' _ Arabic for storyteller _
keeps an audience of about 100 people captivated with the tale of
Antar, a legendary black slave snubbed for his color but renowned
for his courage, strength and chivalry.
	   Wearing a red fez and a long tan robe over his suit, the
mustachioed, 50-year-old storyteller occasionally strikes a nearby
table with a long, shiny sword to stifle a noisy spectator or make
a point in his narrative.
	   Abu Shadi, his strong, clear voice rising and falling with the
story's pace, tells how Antar eventually wins the love of his
long-cherished cousin Princess Abla through his audacity in battle.
	   He briefly looks up from the book he uses as a prompt and
describes Abla's silky black hair, white skin and curvaceous
figure, drawing applause from the largely male audience.
	   ``I ask you, what man can resist such beauty?'' he says.
	   The role of the hakawati has long been a symbol of Arabic
heritage, passing on heroic tales from one generation to the next.
Now it is becoming a victim of technology.
	   Abu Shadi, whose real name is Rashid Hallak, says he is the only
hakawati regularly performing in Damascus, Syria's capital. A few
other storytellers make occasional appearances.
	   ``The profession of the hakawati is unfortunately on its way to
extinction. I am proud to be one of the few people keen on keeping
it alive,'' Abu Shadi says.
	   Hakawatis thrived early in the century when coffee houses were
nightly hangouts for Arab poets, actors and intellectuals. The
numbers have sharply dwindled over the years with the spread of
radio and television.
	   The stories Abu Shadi recounts are mainly of pre-Islamic heroes
and poets, including the famous ``Thousand and One Nights,'' a
series of anonymous tales from ancient Arabia, Persia and India.
	   And for that, Al-Nofara cafe could not be a more suitable
setting.
	   It is more than 300 years old and sits in the heart of Damascus'
bustling old market, behind the 1,200-year-old Omayyad Mosque. A
water fountain _ the ``nofara'' for which the cafe is named _ marks
its entrance.
	   Abu Shadi remembers going to the cafe with his father as a child
and hearing the old stories. He became a peddler but felt his real
talent was storytelling.
	   Eight years ago, Abu Shadi took on the job of hakawati, too, at
a salary he won't specify but calls ``satisfactory.'' He has been
at it ever since, six days a week, and plans to stay until he can
no longer tell his stories in classical Arabic.
	   ``I love what I do. For me, it's not just another source of
income. It's a profession and I do it because I feel that through
it I am contributing to keeping Arab heritage alive,'' he says.
	   Saleh Rabbat, al-Nofara's owner, says the hakawati is the cafe's
prime attraction.
	   ``We get old people, young people, men, women, locals and
foreigners,'' he says. ``For many, it's their home away from
home.''
	   Fawaz Ghazal, a Syrian journalist who is a regular, says he does
not come only for the stories, many of which he knows by heart.
	   ``I come here for the ambiance and the cultural richness of the
place, which reminds us of our ancestors' history. This is very
important,'' he says as he draws in the thick smoke from his water
pipe.
	   The same aura attracts foreigners as well.
	   Jacques Tournebize, a French writer of children's stories, heard
about the Arab raconteur from a Syrian friend and stopped by during
his two-day visit to the country.
	   ``I admit I did not understand a word, but I'm not disappointed
one bit,'' he says. ``The ambiance is extraordinary. It's very warm
and amicable.''

Dollar higher, Japanese stock prices fall in morning trading 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with midday stock, bond and currency prices, comments
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar soared above 145 yen for the first
time in eight years Monday in Tokyo amid growing pessimism about
the Japanese economy. Japanese stock prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 144.96 yen at midday, up 0.94 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo and above 144.72 yen Friday in New York. In earlier
trading, the U.S. currency rose as high as 145.08 yen _ its first
time past 145 yen since August 1990.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 85.82 points, or 0.57
percent, to 14,936.51 at the end of morning trading. On Friday, the
Nikkei gained 8.29 points, or 0.06 percent.
	   Gross domestic product figures released Friday confirmed what
many investors had feared: Japan's economy is in the midst of its
deepest recession in over 50 years.
	   The world's second-largest economy recorded its worst year in
1997 since the end of World War II, contracting 0.7 percent, the
Economic Planning Agency said.
	   That sent investors scurrying for cover, dumping yen for
dollars. One concern is that Japan may be forced to cut interest
rates from already historic lows.
	   An interest rate cut would make overseas investments look more
attractive because of their relatively higher rates of return.
While the Bank of Japan's policy board decided Friday to leave
rates unchanged, traders pointed out the vote wasn't unanimous,
with some favoring a cut.
	   ``If some members are actually in favor of credit easing, that
would certainly accelerate investment in foreign bonds by
institutional investors,'' said Ryuichi Takami, a senior trader at
Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   There is also increasing doubt that Japan's central bank could
stem the yen's fall even if it follows through on threats to
intervene in currency markets. Japan's economic fundamentals are
simply too weak, and other countries have shown little enthusiasm
for propping up the yen.
	   ``Even if there is intervention, it will be solo,'' said Seiji
Masumoto, a dealer at Nippon Trust Bank Ltd.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, stocks fell amid worries the
weakening yen may throw the rest of Asia into renewed economic
turmoil.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 5.19 points or 0.44 percent, to 1,172.06. The
TOPIX closed down 1.56 points, or 0.13 percent, on Friday.
	   While the yen's decline boosts sales of Japan's exporters, that
hurts the rest of Asia by eating into their exports to the United
States and Europe.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond dropped to 1.180 percent from Friday's close of
1.210 percent. Its price rose to 112.16 yen from 111.94 yen.

	   What made this one even more special was the way Jordan had to
work in the clinching game. With Scottie Pippen severely hobbled by
a sore back, Jordan pumped up 35 field goal attempts and 15 free
throws.
	   He made 15 shots, including three 3-pointers, and had his
highest scoring game in the finals since scoring 55 against Phoenix
in 1993.
	   He was rewarded with his sixth finals Most Valuable Player
trophy and avoided playing his first Game 7 in the finals.
	   The Bulls have never lost a Game 6, clinching the title four
previous times _ beating Portland in 1992, Phoenix in 1993, Seattle
in 1996 and Utah in 1997 _ without having to face a seventh game.
	   Now, the basketball world awaits the answer to the question of
the season: Will this be the final championship for the Bulls _ or
even Jordan's final game?

	   In Arlington, Texas, Rick Helling pitched eight effective
innings and Mike Simms homered and drove in three runs as the Texas
Rangers snapped a three-game losing streak by beating the Anaheim
Angels.
	   Helling (9-3) ran into trouble only once, allowing home runs on
consecutive pitches to Jim Edmonds and Tim Salmon in the fourth
inning. He struck out seven, walked one and retired his last 14
batters.
	   Helling tamed a lineup that had tagged Texas pitching for 23
runs in the first two games of the four-game series, both won by
the Angels.
	   John Wetteland relieved to start the ninth and hung on for his
19th save. He gave up two hits and a walk to load the bases with
two outs, but got Garret Anderson on a grounder to end the game.
	   Anaheim's three-game winning streak ended as Chuck Finley (7-3)
fell to 3-8 lifetime in Arlington. He allowed four runs and 13 hits
in 6 2-3 innings.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The hammer taps as regularly as a heartbeat. In
front of a red curtain, behind a green-draped table, a man in a
white coat seems to glow while repeating an incantation.
	   ``Into your brain, into your brain, into your brain I place the
anti-alcohol code,'' he says. His small silver hammer moves up and
down.
	   The men in the audience are still and silent. A few are crying.
Most have spent years battling their drinking problems in vain.
They've been on the wagon for at least two weeks and paid the
equivalent of dlrs 100 to reach this climactic moment. And when
they walk out the door, they believe, they will finally have the
power to stop drinking.
	   ``You are free people _ free of the power of alcohol,'' the man
says soothingly as he closes the session.
	   This is the daily ``seance'' at the Dar Center, one of the
largest of a new crop of private treatment centers in Russia
offering ``cures'' for what is perhaps the country's most
widespread and deep-rooted health problem: alcoholism.
	   Vodka has long been the balm and bane of Russian life. It is as
common as candy, sold in kiosks on most street corners for as
little as dlrs 3 a bottle, affordable even for financially pressed
Russians.
	   The damage is visible everywhere, from tattered figures huddling
near heating grates to businessmen weaving their way home at night,
a briefcase in one hand and a canned gin-and-tonic in the other.
	   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the desperation of
Russia's many problem drinkers and their families has fueled a
thriving market in anti-alcohol remedies _ many useless, some
dangerous.
	   There's an herbal tea that promises to take away cravings for
booze. There are treatments that claim to work by ``filtering''
blood or administering electric shocks.
	   There are injections and below-the-skin implants, known by the
trade names ``Torpedo'' and ``Esperal,'' that reputedly form
poisons when combined with alcohol. Although it's seen as
hyperbole, the patient is told he will literally die the next time
he takes a drink.
	   One of the most popular methods is hypnosis, which is the
foundation of the program at the Dar Center. After the group
hypnotism, patients have a quick individual session with the
doctor, in which they are ``coded'' for whatever period of time
they request _ usually one to five years.
	   What none of these methods promote is life-long abstinence from
alcohol.
	   Dr. Mikhail Polykovsky, the chief doctor and hypnotist at the
Dar Center, says abstinence is too frightening a concept for most
alcoholics.
	   ``What we want to do is free them from their fears,'' he says.
	   Polykovsky's philosophy differs markedly from approaches common
in the West. In fact, the whole history and pattern of alcoholism
in Russia has special features.
	   In Russia, drinking yourself into oblivion is considered
acceptable behavior. Social gatherings usually include liquor,
swilled straight, with obligatory rounds of toasts to family,
guests and friendship. Refusing to take part is considered bad
form, and social rules dictate that once a bottle is opened, it
must be finished.
	   According to some studies, Russians consume less alcohol on
average than many Europeans, such as the French and Italians. But
the way the Russians drink is far more dangerous.
	   Russia's Health Ministry says alcohol poisoning _ drinking a
lethal amount at one sitting _ causes an extraordinary 50,000
deaths a year.
	   In the United States, which has nearly twice the population, the
number of such deaths is 400-500 a year, says Vladimir Treml, a
Duke University expert on Russian drinking patterns.
	   ``It's not that Russians drink so much (overall), it's that when
they do drink they drink in an uncontrolled fashion,'' Treml says.
	   No one knows for sure how many Russians are alcoholics. The
Health Ministry says its official number _ 2.5 million _ is clearly
three or four times too low.
	   But even though alcohol dependency is extremely common, there is
little sympathy for those affected. Russians still consider it less
an illness than a weakness.
	   ``Russian society promotes drunkenness through many traditions,
and then condemns the person who can't handle it,'' says Dr. Oleg
Zykov, chief physician at one of Moscow's few Western-style rehab
clinics.
	   Government services are simple and short-term, amounting to
little more than detoxification.
	   Neighborhoods have squalid ``dispensaries,'' sometimes inside
police stations, where drunks found lying on the street are taken
to sleep it off. Moscow also has two official alcoholism hospitals,
where patients can check in for 45 days to dry out.
	   That's about it. There is little in the way of long-term
counseling, and many can't stay sober for long.
	   ``We send them back to the same home, job and surroundings that
caused them to drink in the first place,'' admits Dr. Sergei
Zolotukhin, deputy chief physician at Narcological Hospital No. 17.
	   The free market is taking over where the government leaves off.
	   Volodya, a recovered alcoholic who declines to give his surname,
says he must have tried every one of the methods on the market
before finally joining one of Moscow's 30 Alcoholics Anonymous
chapters.
	   ``It's the only thing that says you have to live a healthy
lifestyle,'' he says. ``And if you're an alcoholic, one part of a
healthy lifestyle is abstinence.''
	   Western experts believe Russia won't make substantial progress
in combating alcoholism without undergoing significant cultural
changes. And one of those is the acceptance of abstinence.
	   ``We have to learn that alcoholism is like an allergy. If you
are allergic to something, you just don't eat it,'' says Zykov.
``That's not a tragedy.''

U.S. casino files lawsuit to recover gambling debts owed by Koreans 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An American casino has filed suit in a
Seoul court to recover dlrs 2.86 million in gambling debts owed by
31 South Koreans, lawyers said Monday.
	   Ramada of Nevada Hotel in Las Vegas filed the suit Saturday,
accusing the Koreans of not paying back money they borrowed to
gamble at the hotel casino in 1996 and 1997, said lawyers
representing the hotel.
	   The lawyers refused to identify those accused but said a
50-year-old Seoul businessmen owed the hotel dlrs 1.24 million. The
rest owe relatively small amounts of money, they said.
	   It was the first lawsuit to be filed by a foreign casino to
recover gambling debts from South Koreans.
	   Laws of South Korea and the United States differ on the recovery
of gambling debts. Korean law prohibits recovery if lenders knew in
advance that the money would be used in gambling, which is illegal
in South Korea except for a few places for foreign tourists.
	   But gambling is legal in the U.S. state of Nevada and its laws
support recovery of gambling debts.

Russian government addicted to alcohol's revenues With FEA-Russia-Battling Booze 
</HEADLINE>
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One reason Russia's government doesn't do more to
combat alcoholism is that the state is addicted to the bottle in
its own way.
	   ``Vodka has always been an example of government greed and
hypocrisy,'' President Boris Yeltsin said last year in a national
radio address.
	   ``The authorities have always said that drinking is bad for you.
But at the same time it was vodka, in fact, that allowed the
government to make ends meet.''
	   Taxes on alcohol have been a significant contribution to
Russia's federal budget for many years. In Soviet times, they were
said to constitute more 25 percent of state revenues.
	   In the post-Soviet period, many liquor businesses are trying to
stay one step ahead of the tax inspector. But levies on wine and
spirits are still an important source of income, Yeltsin said.
	   ``When the people spend their money on vodka, it should go to
the treasury, not to swindlers,'' Yeltsin said, urging his
countrymen to drink legally taxed liquor. ``We will give (the tax
money) to pensioners, soldiers, doctors, and teachers. It will help
build the economy.''
	   But such appeals fall largely on deaf ears _ and strained
wallets. Government officials estimate the state loses as much as
dlrs 360 million a month from evasion of alcohol taxes, or more
than four times the amount Yeltsin said it takes in each month from
such taxes.
	   The government also has tried to turn consumers away from
bootleg booze by repeatedly warning it can be deadly.
	   But Vladimir Treml, a Duke University demographer who has
studied Russian alcohol use, says the warnings are aimed less at
protecting citizens' health than filling treasury coffers.
	   ``They try to perpetuate the perception that tainted alcohol is
a serious problem,'' he says. ``But the real problem is that they
depend on it, too.''

SALT LAKE CITY: final game. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   If it was, Jordan left everyone with something special to
remember him by.
	   In the best-played and perhaps hardest-fought game of the
series, it looked like Malone and the Jazz were going to force a
seventh game.
	   They made Jordan earn many of his points from the foul line, got
a spirited performance from Malone (31 points) and led for most of
the fourth quarter.
	   Russell gave the Jazz an 81-79 lead on two foul shots with 3:20
left, and Utah stayed ahead until Jordan made a pair of free throws
with 59 seconds left, making it 83-all.
	   Stockton hit a 3-pointer for Utah with 42 seconds left, and
Jordan made it 86-85 by making two foul shots with 37 seconds left.
	   That set up the sequence where Jordan made the play of the game,
leaving his man and coming around the baseline to sneak up behind
Malone.
	   Pippen, a leading contender for the finals MVP until he had a
poor Game 5, scored only eight points with four assists, three
rebounds and two steals in 26 minutes, as he played in obvious
pain.
	   Toni Kukoc had 15 points, Dennis Rodman had seven points and
eight rebounds and Ron Harper scored eight.
	   Those contributions ended up being just enough to help the Bulls
win perhaps their last Jordan-era title. Jordan, Pippen, Rodman and
coach Phil Jackson may have played their last game together.
	   Jordan will be a free agent this summer and has spoke of
retiring. Jackson has insisted that he doesn't expect to be back,
and Pippen, Rodman and six others will be free agents.
	   The way things were going at the outset of Game 6, it looked
like the Bulls might waltz away with the trophy.
	   Getting balanced scoring from Jordan, Pippen, Harper and Kukoc,
the Bulls opened a 17-8 lead seven minutes into the game.
	   But Pippen then left to go to the locker room to have his back
treated, and he took his team's momentum with him.
	   The Jazz quickly caught up, and Malone scored seven of Utah's
final eight points in the quarter as Utah finished the period ahead
25-22.
	   A controversial call cost the Jazz a chance to go ahead by
seven. Howard Eisley made a 3-pointer just before the shot clock
expired, but referee Dick Bavetta waved it off and ruled it came
late. The Bulls quickly pulled even, and the game stayed tight for
the rest of the first half as Jordan, with 23 points, and Malone,
with 20, carried their teams.
	   Utah led 49-45 entering the third quarter after shooting 61
percent in the first half, and it was 59-59 with 3:01 left in the
third when Pippen again left for the locker room.
	   The Bulls scored only two more points the rest of the quarter _
both on Jordan going 1-for-2 at the line _ and Utah took a 66-61
lead into the fourth.
	   Pippen returned to the game with 9 1/2 minutes left and the
Bulls trailing 70-67, and a 3-pointer by Steve Kerr tied the game
90 seconds later. Shandon Anderson answered with a three-point
play, making it 73-70 before Jordan re-entered the game with 7:42
left.
	   Jordan quickly scored Chicago's next four points to give the
Bulls a one-point edge, and there would be three more ties the rest
of the way.
	   Russell gave the Jazz an 81-79 lead on two foul shots with 3:20
left, and Utah stayed ahead until Jordan made a pair of free throws
with 59 seconds left, making it 83-all.

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ For one more and perhaps one last time,
Michael Jordan delivered an NBA championship to the Chicago Bulls _
almost single-handedly and with just seconds to go.
	   Jordan scored 45 points and made the key play as only he could,
stealing the ball from Karl Malone and hitting a jumper with 5.2
seconds left to give Chicago an 87-86 victory on Sunday night and a
4-2 series victory over the Utah Jazz.
	   It was an incredible moment for the greatest player in the game,
as dramatic as anything he has done in a title-clinching game
during his magnificent career.
	   With the Jazz ahead 86-85 and the clock ticking inside of 15
seconds, Jordan snuck up behind Malone and poked the ball away. The
sound of 20,000 people gasping filled the Delta Center as Jazz fans
collectively feared what was about to happen.
	   And Jordan did exactly what they feared, dribbling to the foul
line, pulling up to lose defender Bryon Russell and draining a
jumper.
	   The Jazz still had one more chance, but John Stockton missed a
3-point attempt just before the buzzer.
	   Jordan ran to midcourt and held up six fingers to signify six
championships _ one for every full season he has played this
decade.
	   ``Of all the championships we've won, this was the toughest,''
Jordan said. ``It was a long road with lots of bumps.''
	   What made this championship even more special was the way Jordan
had to work in the clinching game. With Scottie Pippen severely
hobbled by a sore back, Jordan pumped up 35 field goal attempts and
15 free throws.
	   He made 15 shots, including three 3-pointers, and had his
highest scoring game in the finals since scoring 55 against Phoenix
in 1993.
	   He was rewarded with his sixth finals MVP trophy and avoided
playing his first Game 7 in the finals.
	   The Bulls have never lost a Game 6, clinching the title four
previous times _ beating Portland in 1992, Phoenix in 1993, Seattle
in 1996 and Utah in 1997 _ without having to face a seventh game.
	   Now, the basketball world awaits the answer to the question of
the season: Will this be the final championship for the Bulls _ or
even Jordan's final game?
	   If it was, Jordan left everyone with something special to
remember him by. But he said he'd ``love'' to have a chance to
defend the title again.
	   ``That's something that will be determined over the summer,'' he
said.

	   LEXINGTON, Ohio (AP) _ Elliott Forbes-Robinson and Dorsey
Schroeder dominated a Can-Am race Sunday at Mid-Ohio Sports Car
Course to win for the first time this year.

including the final 22, and defeated their Dyson Racing teammates
James Weaver of England and Butch Leitzinger by 15.170 seconds,
averaging 99.367 mph (158.987 kph).
	   The top two finishers were in reverse order of their qualifying
positions. Both drove Riley &AMP; Scott Fords.
	   Finishing third overall and first in the GT class were
Australian David Brabham and England's Andy Wallace, driving a
Panoz that also was the fastest GT qualifier.

Nearly two-thirds of Tokyo households watch World Cup game

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nearly two-thirds of households in Tokyo and its
surrounding areas watched Sunday's World Cup soccer match between
Japan and Argentina, a TV ratings company said Monday.
	   Video Research said coverage of Japan's World Cup debut
attracted the viewership of 60.5 percent of households in the Kanto
region, for a total of 9,014,500. There are about 15 million
households in the area.
	   That figure was the sixth highest rating in the capital region
since Video Research began compiling statistics in 1962.
	   The company only surveys viewership on a regional basis, not for
the nation as a whole. Each household in the Tokyo area averages
just over three people.
	   Japan lost to two-time World Cup champion Argentina 1-0 in
Sunday's game, played in Toulouse, France. It was broadcast live to
a national audience by Japan's semi-public broadcaster NHK starting
at 9:22 p.m. (1222 GMT Sunday).
	   The game was also aired live on NHK's satellite channel.
	   Last November's World Cup Soccer elimination round game, in
which Japan earned the right to play in this year's World Cup, drew
47.9 percent of households in the region, the ratings company said.
	   ``Japan had long awaited the country's debut on the World Cup
stage,'' said NHK Chairman Katsuji Ebisawa in a statement. ``The
game even attracted those who until now had no interest in soccer
at all,'' he said of Sunday's match.
	   Sunday's rating also compares with 35.8 percent for the Nagano
Olympic opening ceremony in February. A typical weekend Japanese
professional baseball game featuring the Yomiuri Giants, the
nation's most popular team, draws ratings in the mid-20s.
	   The highest rated sports broadcast ever was the women's
volleyball final at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics between Japan and the
Soviet Union, which drew 66.8 percent. Japan won that match to take
the gold medal.
	   The highest rating ever recorded was 81.4 percent for NHK's
annual year-end song program aired on Dec. 31, 1963.

Will Jordan ever do this again? AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By KEN BERGER
<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ It was one more stroke of genius, this
time from the top of the key. The master of basketball's greatest
moments and biggest trophies did it again.
	   He seized his sixth NBA championship with a game-winning shot
Sunday night that ripped the hearts from the Utah Jazz. Then he
walked away _ for the last time? _ with his sixth NBA Finals MVP
trophy.
	   Now the question is, will he do it again?
	   ``It's a gut feeling,'' said Jordan, who had 45 points and hit
the jumper with 5.2 seconds left to give the Bulls an 87-86 victory
over the stunned Jazz in Game 6.
	   ``When I walked away the first time, it was a feeling. When I
came back, it was a feeling. When that time comes to walk away, I
hope that because I walk away, people won't look at me any less.''
	   No, but if this is the end, Jordan left everyone wanting more.
	   ``Michael's probably got another five years left in his career
before you even see a decline in him,'' said Scottie Pippen, whose
past and future is linked with Jordan's. ``There are so many things
that are waiting in his game that he can pull out at any moment.''
	   Somehow, he made what could have been his last game one of the
best of his incomparable career. When it is over _ and it could be
already _ someone had better write down all of Jordan's
accomplishments and have them notarized. Future generations might
not believe it.
	   Coach Phil Jackson called it ``the best performance I've seen by
Michael Jordan in a critical situation in a critical series.''
	   ``We're celebrating like this is our last one,'' Jackson said.
``Unless something absolutely unusual comes out of left field, I
don't expect us to be back here.''
	   With Chicago trailing 86-85 in the closing seconds, Jordan stole
the ball from Karl Malone, then drove on Bryon Russell, stopping on
a dime and pulling up for yet another game-winning shot. He crushed
the Jazz the way he's crushed so many teams.
	   Last year, he burned Utah in the opener of the NBA Finals with a
jumper over Russell. Then, in Game 5, playing despite a draining
virus, he punctuated a 38-point game with the 3-pointer that
decided the game.
	   In Game 6 last year, he passed to Steve Kerr for the winning
shot.
	   Leaving no doubt that he is the best ever, Jordan still left one
question unanswered. Is he retiring? Is this the end? Jordan and
Pippen are among nine Chicago players who can become free agents,
and Jackson doesn't have a contract for next season.
	   ``I'm not thinking about that right now,'' Pippen said. ``Give
me a couple days, and I'll give you an answer.''
	   While Pippen, his hobbled partner because of a back injury, was
struggling to get up near the top of the circle, Jordan dribbled
around the crowd and hit another jumper to give Chicago a 74-73
lead with 6:51 to play.
	   It wasn't all artistry. Jordan missed two straight jumpers and
was short on a 3-pointer as the Jazz took an 81-79 lead on two free
throws by Russell. But it was evident how badly Jordan wanted this
game _ if not only for himself, but for Pippen.
	   Jordan got thrown hard to the court on a drive, stepped to the
line and tied it at 83 with 59 seconds left _ points 40 and 41.
	   There was another drive to pull Chicago within 86-85 with 37
seconds left, and then the winning shot _ a crowning moment and
confusing dagger all at once.
	   Was this it?
	   ``Hopefully, I've done enough so that everybody can have some
thoughts about what Michael Jordan did in 13 years,'' Jordan said.
``I have another life, and I have to get to it at some point in
time.''
