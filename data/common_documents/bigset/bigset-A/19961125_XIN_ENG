<P>
It is imperative to adapt to the new situation of opening to
the outside world, and boost foreign trade and enhance the quality
of using foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Opening to the outside world represents a basic policy of the
country and must be pursued unswervingly over a long period. This
is crucial for making full use of both the domestic and overseas
markets and resources, and expediting a shift from
quantity-oriented exports to quality-oriented exports.
</P>
<P>
The country will continue to effectively use foreign investment
and increase the scope of opening-up. Vigorous measures will be
taken to support the development of domestic enterprises and raise
their competitiveness. And economic laws and regulations governing
foreign trade or businesses will be perfected.
</P>
<P>
The final task for next year's economic work is continuing to
improve the material and cultural life of urban and rural
residents, and advancing a coordinated economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of economic development, the income of workers and
farmers will continue to be increased. In urban districts,
emphasis will be placed on housing. Construction of "comfort
projects" -- houses built for low-income residents -- will be
expanded and expedited.
</P>
<P>
Poor areas should view the solution to the food and clothing
problems as a primary task. Central and local governments will
increase the amount of funds used to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
The minimum cost-of-living and income systems for urban
residents and workers will be improved. The country will
invigorate its economy by developing science and education,
promoting scientific and technological progress, boosting
education, protecting the environment, using resources rationally,
controlling the population growth, and realizing a sustained
development and comprehensive social progress.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Hints at A New IRA Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn
Fein, has hinted that he could deliver a new Irish Republican
Army's ceasefire if Britain allowed Sinn Fein into multi-party
talks on the future of Northern Ireland, according to reports from
Belfast on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams told a closed conference Saturday attended by more
than 300 Sinn Fein delegates: "The key is in the hands of Major
and he should move the situation forward. If he does that, all
things are possible--but it is up to him."
</P>
<P>
However, Adams is insisting that the British government abandon
its preconditions about the decommissioning of IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
"What is required is for Sinn Fein to be permitted to enter
talks without any pre-conditions. I think only Mr Major can do
that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein called the one-day closed conference,in Athboy,
CoMeath, to discuss "the processes of conflict resolution".
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams said that he and John Hume, the leader of the
Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP), had drafted a joint
"peace plan", which had been given to Major over a month ago, and
he called for Major's reply.
</P>
<P>
Hume declined to specify details of the plan, but he said his
proposals are geared towards providing "reassurances" about the
nature of all-party talks and the comprehensiveness of an agenda
for them.
</P>
<P>
A British government spokesman said on Saturday that its
position had not changed, and any new ceasefire would have to be
"unequivocal and believable".
</P>
<P>
Joe Hendron, the SDLP MP said that he believed an IRA ceasefire
was imminent: "There will be one before Christmas, I have no
doubt about that. I expect the Government to make an announcement
about Sinn Fein's entry to the talks--but only after a ceasefire
is declared."
</P>
<P>
However, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said the
restoration of an IRA ceasefire remains extremely remote.
</P>
<P>
He told BBC today that Sinn Fein's talks of peace was a
"camouflage" for violence. Any ceasefire had to be a "genuine
cessation of violence" and there were no signs of that happening,
he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Conscientiously studying and implementing the resolution of the
sixth plenum of the CPC Central Committee is an important task for
1997. Leading officials at all levels should have a better
understanding of the strategic position of the cultural and
ethical building in the socialist modernization drive, and
consciously place equal emphasis on material progress and on
cultural and ethical advancement.
</P>
<P>
In making annual plans, all localities and departments should
arrange for the promotion of culture and ethics, and to create a
new situation in cultural and ethical progress in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The conference stated that carrying out reform and economic
development is an arduous task and requires strong leadership. The
Party Central Committee calls on the whole party, especially the
leading officials, to have good understanding of the situation,
and to work persistently, with united efforts and a pioneer
spirit, calling this a the basic requirement and an important
guarantee for success.
</P>
<P>
It is important to adhere to the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial on Central Economic Conference (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper,
"People's Daily," will carry an editorial on Monday applauding the
just-ended economic conference held by the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee from November 21-24.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Grasp the Overall Situation and Continue
to March Forward," says the conference reviewed and analyzed the
overall economic situation since the start of macro-economic
control in late 1993, and worked out the general principles and
main tasks for the economic work in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This will have a great impact on the economic work in the
upcoming year," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It claims that this year, as the first year of the Ninth
Five-Year (1996-2000) Plan, has had a good beginning, and the
overall economic situation continues in the direction of
development.
</P>
<P>
The main signs of this, the editorial says, are that the
economy has maintained rapid growth and inflation is under
effective control; the overall social supply and demand is in
balance, while the macro-economic control has improved; the reform
continues to be deepening; and the economy and society are
enjoying coordinated growth.
</P>
<P>
It notes that in the past three years, China has achieved a
"sustained, rapid and sound" economic and social development, and
the overall economy has entered onto a fast yet stable development
track.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of the Party's correct implementation of its
basic principles and Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, the editorial says, adding that the
arduous efforts of the whole nation also contributed to the
success.

All party members, especially high-ranking officials, will keep
in line with the Party Central Committee politically,
ideologically and in their actions, work with one heart and one
mind, conscientiously safeguard the authority of the Party Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
It is to important to promote awareness of the reform, and to
elicit new ideas and actively solve the key and difficult problems
encountered in the reform and construction.
</P>
<P>
The conference called on all localities and all departments to
do a good job in economic affairs in the remaining days of 1996,
including grain and cotton purchasing, industrial production,
communications and market supply.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will made to enhance the collection and management of
taxes, strictly control revenue expenditure and complete this
year's financial budget to lay a solid foundation for next
year. Leading officials at all levels should visit the
disaster-affected areas, poor areas and enterprises to offer
relief to the masses.

However, the editorial states that the existing contradictions
and problems in the current economy cannot be underestimated. They
include the increasing inconsistencies in the economic structures,
the redundant construction, the weak agricultural foundation, and
in particular, the low efficiency and business troubles of some
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It urges that effective steps be taken to solve these problems,
saying the good economic situation cannot be consolidated and
developed in any other way.
</P>
<P>
The whole nation should unify its thinking on the situation in
line with the judgement and analysis of the Party Central
Committee, the editorial says, adding that this is the only way
the Party's policies and principles can be effectively carried out.
</P>
<P>
1997 is an important year in Chinese history, the editorial
explains, as China will then resume the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong and the Party will hold its 15th congress.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the editorial says, the current economic conference has
designated general requirements for the economic work in 1997, and
under the new circumstances, the relationship between the reform,
development and stability should be further improved and a bigger
push given to the reform and opening, and the socialist
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"We should have a deep understanding of and seriously implement
the policies set by the Party Central Committee," the editorial
says.
</P>
<P>
It warns that past experiences have indicated that whenever the
economic situation progresses smoothly, unrealistic high goals are
certain to emerge.

The editorial said that the current obstacle for China's
economy is not the speed of development, but the unreasonable
economic structure and poor economic returns.
</P>
<P>
"We shall seriously summarize past experiences, and take steps
in accordance with the objective law of economy to prevent the
economy from presenting any major ups and downs," it said.
</P>
<P>
The focus of economic work should be to promote fundamental
changes in the economic structure and the mode of economic growth,
by deepening economic reforms and adjusting economic structure, it
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, we can improve the quality and efficiency of economic
development, and achieve an economic growth that is both rapid and
sound," it explained.
</P>
<P>
According to the editorial, the Party Central Committee has
emphasized that "four combinations" in next year's economic work
should be carefully considered.
</P>
<P>
"This means that we should combine control of the overall
volume with economic restructuring, macro control with micro
invigoration, deepening of reform with promotion of development,
and economic growth with social progress," it explained.
</P>
<P>
Describing the tasks for the country's economic work in 1997 as
"arduous," the editorial said that the key to their success is to
grasp the general situation, make persistent efforts, be of one
heart and one mind, and move forward with a pioneer spirit.
</P>
<P>
It attached great importance to the understanding of the
general situation, in adhering to Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the Party's
basic lines.

the whole country, to observe, consider, and solve problems from a

<HEADLINE> 40-Year Human Radiation Tests Revealed in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
sponsored a 40-year program of secret radiation experiments on
humans including people being injected with, inhaling or eating a
range of radioactive substances, according to a report by the
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND).
</P>
<P>
The CND report, based on copies of more than 50 of Britain's
Ministry of Defense documents, flatly contradicted previous
denials by the British government that humans have been used for
such research experiments, all having the potential to cause
cancer and other disease.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times newspaper quoted the CND report as saying that
about 200 government personnel including many women were used in
such experiments, which would raise the prospect that the
experiments could have affected children born after the tests.
</P>
<P>
The British Ministry of Defense Saturday night confirmed that
the experiments had been carried out but insisted that they had
been "ethical".
</P>
<P>
"These experiments started in the 1950s and continued until the
1980s and were used to estimate the effects of absorbing nuclear
material. The amounts of radioactive substances administered was
negligible," a ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, a CND spokesman said in a statement that it would have
been pointless to conduct experiments using "negligible" amounts
of radioactivity because the scientists would have been unable to
obtain any results.
</P>
<P>
"One issue is to what extent these guinea pigs were volunteers
and to what extent they had the risks properly explained to them,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Defense Budget Rises by 40 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to spend 40 percent
more money in defense for the 1997 fiscal year than the current
which ends on March 20, preliminary calculation showed.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget bill presented to the parliament today,
8,283.9 billion rials (2.7 billion U.S. dollars) has been
earmarked for the defense spending.
</P>
<P>
But in real terms, the increase in defense spending would be
marginal or not exist at all if deducting the impact of inflation
which grows at an annual rate widely believed to be 40 or 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the increase is still remarkable if calculating with the
official inflation rate of only 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The budget bill did not specify the constant U.S. value to
calculate items.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget bill, President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
said "Iran will continue its efforts to defuse the tension and
establish stability in the region as well as the world."

<HEADLINE> One in Three British Babies Born in Poverty: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Almost one in three British
babies are now born into poverty in 1995-1996, representing
roughly 30 percent of all those born in that period, the
Independent on Sunday newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
A new breakdown of social security statistics, based on
official government figures, showed that over the year past about
215,000 babies were born into families which receive state
benefits because they are on the breadline.
</P>
<P>
Britain's opposition Labor Party said that the shocking figures
showed a dramatic increase in the proportion of young children on
the poverty line in the country.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Wicks, a shadow social security minister, was quoted as
saying: "This is a genuinely shocking finding. It illustrates
graphically that, while poverty afflicts all age groups in
Britain, the face of poverty is increasingly a child's face."
</P>
<P>
"The welfare state was meant to provide support from the cradle
to the grave, yet 30 percent of babies are now born into poverty.
This figure of 200,000 benefit babies is a damning indictment of
the Tories' record on supporting children," he added.

HARARE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Staff manning central
hospitals of Zimbabwe, hit by the dismissal of thousands of
nurses and hundreds of doctors, said they are now exhausted and
depressed because of increased pressure of work.

Three leading hospitals in the capital have been severely
affected by the dismissal of nurses and junior doctors who went
on strike on October 21 and defied the government orders to
return to work by October 30.
</P>
<P>
This has paralysed health services as many wards and
departments have been closed for the past 37 days, resulting in
seriously patients being turned away.
</P>
<P>
There has also been a rise in cases of people brought in dead
to hospital mortuaries.

were on duty on Sunday said they wished the government could
urgently reinstate or replace the fired staff so the situation
could return to normal.
</P>
<P>
"We are tired and depressed about the whole health situation.
Some of us have been on duty every day for the past month and have
not taken a single day off. With this kind of exhaustion it is
difficult to be efficient," one senior nurse said.
</P>
<P>
The government last Tuesday said it reinstated 153 of the
1,127 dismissed nurses countrywide, but the staff situation at
most hospitals in Harare has not yet changed significantly.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Plan to Build More Settlements on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government
today issued a statement denying reports that it plans to build
new settlements on the disputed Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"The report regarding the construction of new communities on
the Golan Heights is not correct. There is no approval for the
construction of new communities, and no government source has
announced the establishment of new communities," said the
statement issued by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's office.
</P>
<P>
"Any step to build a new community requires a decision by the
government, and no discussion of this sort is imminent," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Syria strongly attacked Israel'
reported plans to build three new settlements on the Golan
Heights with a total of 900 homes.
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers over the weekend quoted government
officials as saying that the plans were being drawn up at the
request of the hardline Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon,
and with the approval of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Syria's official newspapers accused Israel of
pushing the region into war by taking the steps to build new
settlements on the Golan Heights. They said the move showed that
Israel did not want to make peace with Syria and called for
world pressure to stop Israel's settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Syria's official Tishreen daily said that Israel "not only
want to undermine the peace process but also to detonate the
situation in the region and return it once again to the cycle of
wars and disasters."
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria are locked in a fierce dispute over the
Golan Heights which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967
war. There are 32 Israeli settlements that now house
approximately 14,000 Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Syria is demanding Israel to return the strategic plateau
while Israeli government vowed not to relinquish its
self-claimed sovereignty. Tension is brewing between the two
sides as the bilateral peace talks, suspended from last March,
have failed to resume so far due to the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece Decide to Bolster Cyprus' Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Defense Minister
Costas Eliades and his Greek counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos have
taken decisions on Bolstering Cyprus' defense during their talks
here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today on the conclusion
of his four-day official visit to Cyprus, Greek Defense Minister
Tsohatzopoulos said that strengthening and upgrading defenses of
the two countries is the best possible prerequisite to make
everybody feel the need to back peaceful efforts to settle the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"I leave Cyprus satisfied and at ease that we are on the
right track and that future moves shall be effective in such a
way as to meet our national goals," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the talks, it was agreed that there
are possibilities to improve and conclude the defense doctrine
through promoting coordination and planning joint military
exercises, training, arms purchases or technical matters.
</P>
<P>
"Our defense capability must be complemented by a steady
economic and social development which backs our ability to meet
the cost of arms acquisition programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that the joint Greco-Cypriot defense
pact, signed in November 1993, is not "a race to catch up with
Turkey's defense capability" but a defensive pact to enable
Cyprus to boost its defenses and deter any possible offensive
against the island.
</P>
<P>
He also gave assurances that Greek air defense will be in a
position to respond quickly and effectively in Cyprus' defense,
should the need arise.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Cypriot Defense Minister Eliades pointed out that
the decisions taken during Tsohatzopoulos' visit will result in
bolstering Cyprus' air defenses.
</P>
<P>
"Our air defense capability will be strengthened significantly
following our talks here," Eliades said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that next month Cyprus' Defense Ministry
officials will go to Athens for further talks in a bid to push
for implementation of decisions taken during this visit.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos, who arrived here Thursday, left for home this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned into a Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and a Turkish-controlled north since 1974.

<HEADLINE> Better Conditions Urged for S.African Mineworkers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's mining
managements have been warned to change living conditions of
mineworkers.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made today by Labour Minister Tito Mboweni at
a meeting in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
For decades, South African black mineworkers have been housed
in ethnically-segregated single-sex dormitories.
</P>
<P>
These hostels, scattered in and around Johannesburg, house an
estimated 500,000 men contracted to work in the mines in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Workers share communal toilets, showers and kithens. Miners
have to live in the hostel for at least one year before
qualifying for a break to visit their families in the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
However, this practice is scheduled to undergo a long-overdue
transformation.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni warned mining houses that unless the hostel system
undergoes a total revamp, it will be abolished.
</P>
<P>
South African trade unions have blamed mining houses for the
escalating violence among mineworkers.
</P>
<P>
Last month 47 workers died in ethnic clashes at a mining area
in Johannesburg. The government subsequently appointed a
commission to study the situation.
</P>
<P>
The commission has come up with possible long-term solutions.
The National Union of Mineworkers wants the hostels upgraded.
</P>
<P>
But an Anglo American spokesman said this week that his
company is doing the best to address this situation. "Upgrading
the existing facilities is a major capital-intensive project
which has to be tackled with care," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the government does not accept this argument. Mboweni
warned those mining houses reluctant to convert the hostels into
family units that legal actions are being considered.

<HEADLINE> Cellphone Plague Invades Israel's Classrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- When the bell rings in a
school, should the students respond by going to a new class, or
should the teacher just whip the phone from the briefcase?
</P>
<P>
Such confusion will soon be added to the modern school life
in Israel: cellular phones have begun invading Israel's
classrooms despite the increasing outcry about the relentless
spread of the plague across the country.
</P>
<P>
The invasion started when Israel's Secondary School Teachers'
Association concluded a 2.5 million U.S. dollars deal recently with
the Pelephone company to buy 31,000 cellphones as a holiday gift
for its members.
</P>
<P>
The much larger Histadrut (Israel's General Trade Union)
Teachers Union is still negotiating with Pelephone and another
cellphone company Cellcom to supply cellphones for its 100,000
members.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, despite of the education budget cuts which have
forced the reduction of school hours, the Education Ministry
still managed to find the huge sum for buying the gifts for
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Teachers have their own argument. "Every plumber has a
cellular phone these days - there's no reason why teachers
shouldn't," Teachers Union Chairwoman Shosh Oren told the Hebrew
paper Ma'ariv. "I will not utter non sequiturs."
</P>
<P>
She is right. Most Israelis, from taxi driver to businessman,
from housewife to messenger boy, nowadays own such a trendy
little black rectangle. It is already an integral part of life
for many.
</P>
<P>
When first introduced in Israel in the mid-1980's, cellphones
were once a symbol of status because of their high charges and
fees, but now they are so common that they have even become a
social scandal and public nuisance.
</P>
<P>
In a sign showing the success of the aggressive marketing by
cellphone companies, there are now nearly 100,000 mobile phones
in the country with a population of only 5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Worse than that, the number of cellphones is expected to grow
to over 2 million by the year 2000, according to the current
penetration rate of 11 percent, the world's second just behind
the U.S.' 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Scenes of people talking to cellphones while plowing through
streets unheeding the traffic or screaming at the tops of their
voices are so irritating that the public often protest against
the inconvenience or discomfort caused by the phone users.
</P>
<P>
The government has finally begun taking moves to heed the
complaints. The Army ordered earlier this year soldiers not to
use the mobile phones while on duty. Last week, the Tel Aviv
Municipality initiated a drive to limit the use of cellular
phones in some public places.
</P>
<P>
Municipal workers in Tel Aviv began issuing stickers in
places such as restaurants, supermarkets, theaters and libraries
to remind people of avoiding using the cellphones. The stickers
read "No talking on cellular phones here" and show a mobile
phone with a big red X on it.
</P>
<P>
Some worrying parents now suggest the government issue such
stickers in schools immediately before the nation is irreparably
damaged.

<HEADLINE> French Jews Welcome Release of Card Index on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Jean Kahn, president of the
Central Israeli Consistory of France, today welcomed the decision
by the French government to release the card index on Jewish
properties seized by the Vichy collaboration regime during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
He said that the card index, held by the government in its
archives for more than 50 years, "would thus become the tomb
stone of those (Jews) who died without burial place."
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the French government has been suspected of
deliberately refusing to clarify the whereabouts of billions of
dollars of Jewish properties, seized by the Vichy regime from
thousands of Jews who were deported to Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
The Paris City Council was also lately accused of holding some
real estates seized from Jews during World War II, an accusation
which forced the municipal government to stop selling some public
flats late last month.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Kahn, the government has agreed to submit the
card index on seized Jewish properties to the Center of
Contemporary Jewish Documentation, a specialized department on
Jewish properties in the National Archives of France.
</P>
<P>
The card index, which was verified by a commission to be on the
properties of Jews arrested in the Paris region by the Vichy
regime, was first discovered by historian Serge Klarsfeld in the
Ministry of Former Resistance Fighters in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kahn said that this measure would prevent the "risk of a new
cover-up" of the documents on seized Jewish properties.
</P>
<P>
However, this decision also aroused concern from several French
historians that France would risk losing part of its "national
patrimony," as some of its classic artistic masterpieces could
turn out to be seized properties.

<HEADLINE> UN Official: Supervision Mission in Iraq Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The UN mission on the
dismantling of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is facing a
serious shortage of funds, said a UN official here today.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the United Nations Special Commission on the
dismantling of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq (UNSCOM) Rolf
Ekeus ended his three-day visit to Kuwait today and left for
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, he said his commission is also facing an
arduous task to determine how many prohibited weapons Iraq still
hides.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus arrived here Friday on his first leg of a Gulf
tour aimed at achieving an understanding by the Gulf countries
on the commission's work.
</P>
<P>
He will seek advice from the Gulf leaders on "the difficult
political issues and the sensitive political waters we are walking
into."
</P>
<P>
He said "we will also raise the issue on our concern with the
immediate operational problems linked to our finance."
</P>
<P>
He clarified that operational costs amount up to 2 to 3 million
U.S. dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
But he said "everything should be paid by Iraq, however
until Iraqi money is available and the Security Council lifts
the oil embargo, we have to depend on member states to fund
the mission."
</P>
<P>
"I have warned the Security Council on the unsecure
financial situation we are facing," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM started its work five years ago following the end of the
Gulf War in 1991 during which the U.S.-led allied forces drove the
Iraqi troops out of Kuwait they occupied for seven months.
</P>
<P>
He said that "after five years of work, the UNSCOM still
has not been able to determine the full extent of Iraq's
programs to build and deploy weapons of mass destruction nor
the amount of stocks that remain hidden."
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM's mission is not only to destroy existing missiles but
to also prevent new missiles from being established, he noted.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Kuwait, Ekeus met with the
Amir Salim Al-Sabah, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh
Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah and the First Deputy Prime Minister,
Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Jaber Al-Sabah and the
Speaker of the National Assembly Ahmad Al-Saadoun.
</P>
<P>
Before coming here he was in Paris, London and Stockholm,
raising the issue of funding.
</P>
<P>
He is due in Baghdad, Iraq, on December 8.

<HEADLINE> 50 Survive Ethiopian Plane Crash, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Airline
formally announced here today that 50 out of the 163 passengers
and 12 crew have survived the Saturday crash of the ET-961 flight.
</P>
<P>
While 68 people have been confirmed dead, the fate of the
remaining 57 people is not yet known. The rescue work is still
going on, according to an official announcement made by the
airline's general manager, Dr. Ahmed Kello.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ahmed said the crashed jet is one of the three Boeing-767
passenger planes owned by the Ethiopian Airline. However, he
declined to provide the name list of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Among the passengers, 83 boarded the plane at Addis Ababa
while the rest were transit passengers from other locations.
</P>
<P>
Those who got on board at Addis Ababa were of 24 nationalities
including Ethiopia, Kenya, Israel, Britain, Ukran, France, Italy,
Cameroon, Djibouti, Sweden, America, Australia, Canada, Congo,
Germany, Hungary, India, Japan, South Korea, Lesotho, Somalia,
Switzerland, Uganda and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ahmed said the airline is employing an Israeli ambulance
plane to ferry injured passengers to Nairobi and Addis Ababa. An
international expert team has been dispatched to the area to
identify the crash victims, he added.
</P>
<P>
The flight, hijacked at 11:30 hours gmt on its way from Addis
Ababa to Nairobi by persons who demanded to be flown to
Australia, was running out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
Despite the pilot's pleading to make a stop over for
refueling, the flight was forced on and the plane ditched about
one kilometer near a beach hotel in one of the Comoro Islands.
</P>
<P>
The general manager disclosed two of the hijackers are
Ethiopians who, after surviving the air crash caused by the
shortage of fuel, were arrested by the police.
</P>
<P>
The pilot and many other survivors are still in unstable
conditions, therefore, it is difficult to speak of the hijacking
drama with outmost certainty, said Dr. Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the accident, the Ethiopian government called for
rescue operations, which were carried out by Comoros authorities
with support of a French military contingent stationed on
the island.

LAGOS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG will be deployed as a buffer between rival
Liberian factions, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Commander Major-general Victor Malu was quoted as
saying in a statement that the peacekeepers will be deployed in
Tappita, 215 kilometers east of Liberian capital Monrovia, within

The troop will serve as a buffer between the National
Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) militia of Charles Taylor and
its rival Liberia Peace Council (LPC) of George Boley, both
members of the ruling council of state.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Malu had met with Boley at the ECOMOG
headquarters in Monrovia to discuss the ongoing disarment
process.
</P>
<P>
The LPC has persistently complained to the ECOMOG that its
positions in Zwedru, 290 kilometers east of Monrovia, are

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Resume Hebron Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators resumed talks today on the long-delayed Israeli troop
redeployment from Hebron in an effort to overcome the last
outstanding obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The talks, suspended from last Thursday, resumed here this
evening after Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu convened
earlier the day a meeting of the ministerial committee
overseeing the talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu held consultations with Foreign Minister David Levy
and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to discuss ways of
achieving possible progress in the Hebron talks. No details of
the meeting were released afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the two sides remained far apart
on several key issues concerning the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The stumbling obstacle is Israel's demand for Israeli troops'
free access to the Palestinian-controlled areas in Hebron even
after the redeployment in order to conduct hot pursuits of
suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Other issues include the opening of a street in central
Hebron and the arming of Palestinian police to be deployed
in the city after the Israeli redeployment, the radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel demands Palestinian police be equipped with only light
weapons, citing they fired on Israelis during a bloodshed late
September.
</P>
<P>
Also in dispute are letters that Netanyahu and Palestinian
Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat will exchange on the
issue of implementing the rest of the interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron talks, resumed after the September violence, have
so far failed to clinch a deal despite the repeated claims
by Israel that an agreement is close at hand.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PA often trade accusations with each other
blaming the other side for delaying the signing of the
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Governor to Step Down Over Unlawful Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Akita Governor Kikuji
Sasaki said today that he will step down to take responsibility
for massive misuse of taxpayers' money by prefectural government
officials who wined and dined and cheated on business trips, Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first resignation by a governor in Japan over
improper spending of public money by prefectural officials.
</P>
<P>
Despite his planned resignation, Sasaki and other high-ranking
prefectural officials have refused to account for how the
misappropriated money was spent, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The scandal over misappropriation of public money by Akita
prefectural government officials broke into the open after the
gubernatorial race in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Civic groups doggedly unearthed one scandal after another and
some 750 senior prefectural government officials returned 820
million yen (7.5 million U.S. dollars) to the prefectural
government's coffers after acknowledging wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
The misuse of public funds involved bogus conferences, business
trips they never made and illegal transfers of national
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Later, it also came to light that an additional 90 million yen
(820,000 dollars) was spent unlawfully, prompting virtually all of
the prefecture's 69 city, town and village assemblies to demand
Sasaki's resignation, according to the news agency.

<HEADLINE> Joined Twins Survive After Separation Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese surgeons have
successfully separated a pair of Siamese twins whose abdominal
cavities and livers were joined.
</P>
<P>
Both baby boys have survived for a record 14 days.
</P>
<P>
Experts said this is probably the first successful operation in
China, performed on conjoined babies less than one month after
they were born.
</P>
<P>
Born nine weeks prematurely, the boys were joined from the
bottom of their chests to their navels. Their livers were the only
major organs that were connected.
</P>
<P>
A team of surgeons at Xinqiao Hospital in southwest China's
city of Chongqing opened the twins' abdominal cavities and cut
apart the joined livers on November 11, 28 days after the babies'
birth.
</P>
<P>
The experts said such a case occurs in 50,000 to 80,000 babies,
and the survival rate after surgical separation is very low.
</P>
<P>
Operations to separate Siamese twins are usually done at least
one month after birth.

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants No Peace, Says Syrian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Syrian official said
today that Israel's plan to build more settlements on the occupied
Golan Heights proves that Israel is not willing to realize peace
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with local radio Soutel Arab, Syrian
Minister of Social Affairs and Labor Ali Khalil said the new
settlement expansion revealed Israel's true intention of derailing
peace with Syria, which regards peace as a strategic option.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed his country's conviction of peace based on the
international legitimacy and the principle of land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel reportedly planned to build three new settlements on the
Golan Heights with a total of 900 homes. But Israel Sunday denied
the reports.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official strongly criticized the government of
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu for not "making any
progress along the course of peace" so far.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria are locked in a fierce dispute over the Golan
Heights which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast
war. There are 32 Israeli settlements that now house approximately
14,000 Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Syria is demanding Israel to return the strategic plateau
while the Israeli government vows not to relinquish its
self-claimed sovereignty. Tension is brewing between the two sides
as the bilateral peace talks, suspended from last March, have
failed to resume so far due to the dispute.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- As a renewable source of
energy, hydropower is a major focus for the development in Nepal
as the country's other sources are either absent or in danger of
depletion, a senior Nepali official said today.
</P>
<P>

income over two times through a recent 400-megawatt hydropower
project, the Nepali minister said Nepal could achieve similar
phenomenal rates of economic growth by developing the proposed
major hydro projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is planning to launch a 6,420-megawatt project jointly
with India on the border river between the two countries and the
feasibility study for a 10,800-megawatt project in west Nepal had
also completed several years ago.
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of markets for electricity exports in the
region, Rana said.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the seminar disclosed that a big power company
of the United States has shown interest in investing in major
hydropower projects in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
About 45 people including government officials, technical
experts and representatives of donor countries were taking part in

<HEADLINE> China Fights Cheating by Advertisement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China's advertising watchdog
has issued a circular designed to outlaw cheating by false adverts
that solicit project investors.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of law violators have been found using
adverts to lure business partners to sign contracts for false
processing projects, and to profit from the cheating.
</P>
<P>
Usually they employ vague advertising language in terms of
project quality and examination methods. Once the project is
completed, they explain the terms of the adverts wantonly, aiming
to discredit the quality of the project, and scrap the contract.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many undertakers of projects have suffered heavy
economic losses.
</P>
<P>
As the number of cases becomes rampant, the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) issued the
circular. It stipulates that advertising for soliciting processing
projects are merely a form of project introduction, which can not
be taken as a basis for signing economic contracts.
</P>
<P>
For that, the circular bans the certain contents from appearing
in such adverts. demanding that adverts must explicitly state the
adverts should not be taken as a basis for signing a contract.
</P>
<P>
People cheated by fake adverts have the right to file
complaints with local offices of SAIC.
</P>
<P>
When economic conflicts arise, opposing partners can require
mediation or arbitration, or take out law suits, the circular
says.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Tourism has
earned a new record total of 61 billion HK dollars (7.87 billion
US dollars) in the first three quarters in 1996, according to
figures released today by the Hong Kong Tourist Association
(HKTA).
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an increase of 16.5 percent over the same
period last year, an HKTA official said.
</P>
<P>
Spending by visitors from all major market regions rose in line
with the increases in visitor arrivals from those regions, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Over the nine-month period, spending by visitors from North
Asia rose 29.9 percent to 14.8 billion HK dollars (1.91 billion
US dollars), visitors from the Chinese inland areas increased
their spending by 11.8 percent to a total of 11.1 billion HK
dollars (1.43 billion US dollars), and spending by visitors from
South and Southeast Asia rose 18.2 percent to 8.3 billion HK
dollars (1.07 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Spending by visitors from Europe, Africa and the Middle East
rose 17.8 percent and those from the Americas rose 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shopping remained the category on which the most money was
spent, bringing in 29.6 billion HK dollars (3.82 billion US
dollars), or 49.7 percent of the total. This was an increase of
12.9 percent over spending on shopping in the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure on meals outside hotels also rose 12.1 percent to
6.5 billion HK dollars (838.72 million US dollars), accounting for
10.9 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
However, expenditure on tours showed the greatest increase,
with the total rising 35.9 percent to 1.9 billion HK dollars
(245.16 million US dollars), accounting for 3.3 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA is forecasting a year-end increase of 15 percent over
the record total of 75 billion HK dollars (9.68 billion US
dollars) earned by tourism last year, estimating that the 1996
total will be some 87 billion HK dollars (11.2 billion US
dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Has More than 5,500 Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHONGSHAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China has 5,500 small towns
which are playing an increasingly important role in advancing the
development of rural economies.
</P>
<P>
Details were given at an on-going national conference on town
construction held in Zhongshan City, in south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Hou Jie, Minister of Construction, during the
period from 1991 to 1995, the small towns absorbed 60 million
rural surplus workers, and saw the establishment of more than
50,000 various specialized and wholesale markets, with the annual
business volumes amounting to 450 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises, an important force in urbanization, now
total one million across the country, contributing one quarter of
the country's entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and one quarter
of combined taxes to the state.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, China has pumped 64 billion yuan into
the construction of basic facilities for towns, and has built
178,000 kilometers of new highways, linking towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
And the availability rate of tap water in the towns has now
reached 32 percent. Electricity is now available in all towns and
69 percent of the country's natural villages.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of 1995, the per capita living space for
residents in towns was 16.4 square meters, and forest coverage was
recorded at 10.3 percent in towns.
</P>
<P>
While accelerating construction of small towns, different
localities have strengthened their work for preventing and curbing
environmental pollution, and the planning of town construction.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, 47,000 km of water pipelines have been
laid around towns, and most towns have built sewage and garbage
disposal facilities equipped with advanced environmental hygienic
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The central government, as well as local governments at various
levels, have also published a number of rules and regulations to
standardize the construction of towns.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks International Cooperation on Paper-Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China will seek wide
international cooperation in order to boost its paper-making
industry, Vice-Minister of Forestry Li Yucai told a visiting
Canadian delegation from the paper industry.
</P>
<P>
China now ranks the third in the world in terms of the annual
output of paper products, but its paper made from wood pulp has
long relied on imports for production, and accounts only for 13
percent of the total amount of goods.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that China will boost its output of wood-pulp
paper to 30 million tons by the year 2000, and the figure can
reach 40 million by the year 2010," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China is the home of paper making, and has 1900 years of
history in the craft. But the country now only consumes 21
kilograms of paper products per person yearly, which is less than
half of the world's average level.
</P>
<P>
Li said that in the Ninth-Five-Year Plan for the nation's
social and economic development, the manufacturing of paper made
from wood pulp has been listed as one of the key sectors.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the ministry signed a contract for building a
wood-pulp project with an investment of six billion yuan or 720
million US dollars, which is so far the largest in China.

<HEADLINE> China's Ten-Month Tax Revenue up 20.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial and
commercial tax revenue was up 20.3 percent to 510 billion yuan
(about 61.4 billion US dollars) in the first ten months of this
year, the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents 84.6 percent of the target for 1996. A
breakdown shows that the value-added tax and the consumption tax,
two major tax items under China's new taxation regime introduced
in 1994, came to 286.2 billion yuan, an increase of 16.8 percent
over a year ago, or 78.3 percent of the annual target.
</P>
<P>
The administration noted that the tax revenue grew less than 10
percent in seven regions, while in another 13 areas the collection
of taxes was behind the time schedule by more than one month.
</P>
<P>
"The tax collection situation in these areas is fairly grim,"
the SAT said, urging tax agencies to make greater efforts to
collect taxes, in order to ensure that this year's national tax
target will not slip out of reach.
</P>
<P>
"In the final days of this year, all payable taxes should be
turned to the state coffer in full and on time," the
administration said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that promises of tax rebates to exporters must be
honored.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said today he would continue efforts to cooperate with
the opposition dominated parliament, after winning new powers in
the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a midday news conference in Minsk, Lukashenko said
the constitutional amendments to expand presidential powers
proposed by him won more than 70.5 percent of the votes in the
nationwide referendum on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But he said he would not dissolve the present parliament, which
has been involved in a political confrontation with him over the
constitutional amendments designed to expand the presidential
powers.
</P>
<P>
He said he was still working "together with the parliament to
form a new supreme organ of authority."
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko pledged that he would "strictly observe the accord
on the socio-political situation and constitutional reform," which
was signed on November 22 between the president and the parliament
under Russia's mediation, and has yet to be ratified by the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko expressed gratitude to voters "for the enormous
backing" during the referendum. He said all his actions would be
in line with the newly amended constitution.
</P>
<P>
He said Belarus would build its cooperation with the CIS
(Commonwealth of Independent States) member states, with the West
and especially with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko added that there would be "certain replacements" in
the government soon.

<HEADLINE> Strategies for Boosting Teachers' Morale Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Education officials from the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries were
urged today to come up with strategies for boosting morale among
teachers in light of falling educational standards in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint meeting of the SADC teacher management
support working group and permanent secretaries, Zimbabwe's
Education Minister Edmund Garwe said teacher motivation and
morale is currently low, negatively affecting the quality of
education in the region.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that once we improve the conditions of service,
regardless of teachers' location, we will go a long way in
improving the quality of our education systems," said Garwe.
</P>
<P>
Garwe said participants to the meeting should in their
discussions take note of the global socio-economic changes taking
place as well as the dynamics of employer-employee relations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at sensitizing permanent and principal
education secretaries in the region about issues and problems
of current school inspection systems in order to come up with an
action plan for effective school inspectors' training program.
</P>
<P>
Some 25 top educationists, including nine permanent
secretaries, are attending the two-day meeting which was
co-sponsored by the Dutch Development Agency and the Commonwealth

WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Defying the West, East European nations and his own
Parliament, President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus went ahead
with a referendum on giving himself near-absolute power.
</P>
<P>
-- The Environmental Protection Agency is taking steps toward
protecting the health of the public with a proposal that will cut
air pollution from smog and soot, a step that will cost some
businesses billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After more than a year in which the United States has
lurched through a series of crises and confrontations in Asia,
President Clinton's encounters this weekend showed that he has
succeeded in steering U.S. relations with the region back to
normal.
</P>
<P>
-- Western and African military commanders said today they have
reached agreement on a range of possible missions by a
multinational force to ensure humanitarian relief for hundreds of

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Slams at Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today renewed his warning against the detrimental consequences of
building new Jewish settlements to the entire Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the Israeli prime minister's previous announcement
that no new settlements will be built, there are conflicting
statements on this score," Mubarak told reporters following the
inauguration of the innovation works of the Central Military
Zone's Command, the oldest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak described Israeli statements on the Jewish settlements
as "fearful" and gravely "harmful" to the Arab-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the peace negotiating process in the region
would be in jeopardy if these provocative policies push people
into extremes and resort to violent means.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians, like all peoples in the Arab region and the
world, want peace rather than war," he added.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Israeli government Sunday issued a
statement denying reports that it plans to build new settlements
on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Syria strongly attacked Israel's reported plans to build three
new settlements on the Golan Heights with a total of 900 homes. It called
for world pressure to stop Israel's settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria are locked in a fierce dispute over the Golan
Heights which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast
war. There are 32 Israeli settlements that now house approximately
14,000 Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Syria is demanding Israel to return the strategic plateau
while Israeli government vows not to relinquish its self-claimed
sovereignty. Tension is brewing between the two sides as the
bilateral peace talks, suspended from last March, have failed to
resume so far due to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Sunday accused Israel of
seeking to imposing a fait accompli in the occupied lands,
therefore undermining the land-for-peace principle and the Arabs'
rights in their lands.
</P>
<P>
He said new settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem and on
the Golan Heights were a flagrant violation of the international
law and the principles of the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing Holds Talks with Belgian Visitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Li
Lanqing held talks here today with visiting Belgian Prince
Philippe and Deputy Prime Minister P. Maystadt, saying that China
and Europe have no fundamental conflicts of interest, and that he
hopes the two sides will further expand cooperation in all fields
to contribute to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Li welcomed the Belgian guests, saying their visit will surely
help deepen understanding between the enterprises of the two
countries and promote bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes China and Belgium will increase consultation
and exchange through continued dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government attaches importance to developing
relations with the European Union (EU), including Belgium," Li
pointed out. "The Sino-Belgian economic and trade relations, which
have made remarkable progress over the past 25 years since they
forged diplomatic ties, have great potential."
</P>
<P>
Li welcomed Belgian enterprises to increase their investment in
China, especially in the central and western regions of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU imposition of "anti-dumping" measures and
quantitative limits on Chinese exports have an adverse affect on
the development of Sino-European economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Belgium will play an important role in EU to lift
unfair restrictions on Chinese goods," he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also explained China's principled stand
regarding its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), and
thanked EU for its support to China in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the issue of China's entry into WTO would be solved as
soon as possible with the joint efforts of all the signatories to
the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
Prince Philippe and Maystadt thanked Li for his invitation and
the hospitality of the Chinese government. Maystadt agreed that it
is necessary to continue the dialogue and consultation between
Europe and China.
</P>
<P>
Europe and China are complimentary economically, and thus can
develop mutually-beneficial cooperation, Maystadt said. And
Belgium is capable and willing to cooperate with China in
agriculture, environmental protection, chemicals, energy and
service sectors, and other fields.
</P>
<P>
He said the WTO can not be called a world trade body without
China's presence, which is why both Belgium and the EU support
China's membership.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Li and Maystadt signed an agreement on the
Belgian government's financial assistance to the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Li, Prince Philippe and Maystadt addressed a
seminar on economic and trade cooperation between China and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Prince Philippe and Maystadt are leading a 200-member business
and industrial delegation on a two-week tour of China, which will
take them to the coastal industrial bases of Tianjin, Shanghai,
Suzhou and Dalian.

<HEADLINE> Iran's War Games not Affected by US Concern (by Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian military
commander claimed today that Iran's on-going military maneuvers
are not affected by concern of U.S. military authorities in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Navy Commander Ali Shamkhani said "American warships were
carefully watching the maneuvers using their full radar,
communication and monitoring system."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "their concern would not affect the
program of the forces participating in the maneuvers."
</P>
<P>
Iran launched the 10-day military maneuvers beginning from
November 21. Some 100 combat boats and 40 aircraft are
participating in the games in an area of about 11,000 nautical
square miles.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military maneuvers, code-named "Pirouzi"
(victory), aims to test the existing defense technology as well
as Iran's experience of the war years.
</P>
<P>
He said mariners participating in the war games had already
performed 70 exercises in preparation for the war games that
was to fight a hypothetical modern day war.
</P>
<P>
"Phase one and two of Pirouzi-7 maneuvers had been carried
out successfully," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said a third submarine bought from Russia earlier had set
for the Persian Gulf Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced the military budget for the next year, which is
4.7 billion dollars -- 40 percent higher than this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
He also said the presence in the Persian Gulf of foreign
war ships would be detrimental to peace rather than contribute
to tranquility in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran regards the U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf as the most
dangerous threat to its security. The U.S. had threatened to
launch military strike against Iranian targets.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The First Chicago NBD
Corporation opened its Beijing branch today, raising the number of
overseas bank branches in the Chinese capital to seven.
</P>
<P>
First Chicago NBD, which was formed at the end of 1995 as a
merger between the First National Bank of Chicago Corporation and
the National Bank of Detroit Corporation, is also the second US
bank to have opened a branch here, following the establishment of
a Citibank branch last year.
</P>
<P>
First Chicago's relationship with China can be traced back to
1980, when it became the first foreign commercial bank to set up a
representative office in China.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Beijing branch will provide services for trade
financing, trade settlements, fund-raising and global transfer of
funds for US customers and Chinese enterprises and institutions.
</P>
<P>
The other five overseas banks with a branch in Beijing are the
Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation, the Nanyang Commercial Bank, the Industrial Bank of
Japan, and the Foreign Exchange Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks in China are still restricted to accepting
foreign-currency deposits and extending foreign-currency loans,
remitting money in foreign currency, providing foreign-currency
guarantees and conducting foreign trade settlements. They are
barred from dealing in business in the local currency, the
Renminbi yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government has said it would allow more
overseas financial institutions to set up operational branches,
but only in a planned and gradual manner.
</P>
<P>
The number of representative offices set up by overseas
financial institutions in China's capital reached 213 by the end
of August.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu Muzhi, president of the Human Rights Society of China, said
at the meeting that the building of socialism is meant to solve
human rights problems in a fundamental way.
</P>
<P>
Theories should be linked to practices in studying the ways to
let people enjoy more and more human rights in the process of
building socialism.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that the policies of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, taking economic
construction as the central task, making public ownership as the
main body of the national economy, and achieving common
prosperity, are all directly related to the rights of the state
and human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the rights of the state, he said that only by
becoming strong, not only politically but also economically, can a
country expect to achieve complete national independence.
</P>
<P>
As for human rights, he said that only when exploitation is
eradicated, production boosted, and people are free from hunger
and coldness, can primary rights to existence and development be
obtained.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that cultural and ethical progress represents a major
characteristic of the building of socialism in China. In this
regard, the development of scientific, educational and cultural
undertakings, the promotion of people's awareness of democracy and
the law, and the enhancement of people's ideological and ethical
qualities, all have a direct bearing on human rights
progress.

Serving the people, which is the core of socialist moral
construction, asks for respecting and caring about the people,
loving the collective, helping the poor and those with
difficulties, equality between men and women, respecting the old,
and loving the young, he said.
</P>
<P>
All these serve to highlight China's socialist construction as
being full of respect and love for people, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
The development of such lofty moral values constitute a most
profound ideological basis and a solid social guarantee for
safeguarding human rights, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that those western countries attacking China in the
name of human rights are doomed to failure. The most powerful
counterattack lies in a complete and systematic account of China's
theory and practices of human rights, which will allow the outside
world to have a good understanding of the real human rights
situation in this country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The achievements China has made in human rights protection have
won praise across the world, while China's stand and views on
human rights, especially that of living rights and development
rights being the top human rights, have won support from an
increasing number of developing countries, as well as
understanding from some western people of insight, he said.

At the opening ceremony, Zeng Jianhui, director of the
Information Office under the State Council, also made a speech,
saying that western countries employ "human rights" as a strategic
weapon to "westernize" and "split" China.
</P>
<P>
These western countries have blocked public opinion on the real
human rights situation in China, and use the issue of human rights
as an excuse to distort facts and attack China, in an attempt to
vilify and contain the development of China, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
To fight against the western attack, and to be active in
showing the real human rights situation in China to the outside
world, represents a common task of the ideological and publicity
departments and the academic and theoretical circles, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding, the Human Rights Society of China has done
a great deal in theoretical research on human rights, and in
publicizing China's views on and its real situation of human
rights, the director said.
</P>
<P>
It has also made outstanding achievements in international
media struggles as well as exchanges with regard to human rights,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng stressed that human rights constitute not only a
theoretical but also a political issue, for international
struggles on human rights have a bearing on China's sovereignty
and national dignity, he said. enditem.

<HEADLINE> China to Build 10,000 Developed Small Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHONGSHAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up 10,000
economically-developed small towns and provide jobs for over 30
million surplus laborers in rural areas by 2000, Chinese
vice-minister of construction Mao Rubai said here today.
</P>
<P>
The move aims at accelerating the urbanization process, said
Mao Rubai at a national working conference on construction of
small villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is transferring rural surplus labor and
adjusting its industrial structure in the countryside through the
construction of small towns.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years of the century, China plans to turn a
fifth of its small towns into new towns that are capable of
spurring local socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said the small towns should be reasonably planned, and have
certain scales, a beautiful environment and local characteristics.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has 55,000 small towns and 3.7 million
villages. Under the plans, China will transfer 30 million surplus
laborers to small towns, increasing the population in small towns
to over 200 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country plans to set up 10,000 economically
developed towns, with 7,000 having populations of more than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, the country will build homes covering
a total floor space of 2.79 billion square meters in these towns,
with 42 percent of households having access to running water, and
each person having 2.85 square meters of public green space.
</P>
<P>
Mao Rubai said that in urban development, China has taken a
path of "strictly controlling the size of large cities, moderately
developing medium-sized and small cities, and actively developing
small towns."
</P>
<P>
In the planning and construction of small towns, China will
overhaul the village structure, he said, adding that the country
will merge villages for integrated development and create
conditions for the development of groups of township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Mao Rubai noted that China has a large number of small towns in
a vast region, making it impossible to develop all of them
simultaneously. The development should take into consideration the
differences in regional conditions, and the development of market
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The country will give priority to the development of small
towns along the coast, rivers, major traffic routes, and along its
borders by providing favorable treatment in policies and funding,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the Ministry of Construction is
piloting tests in Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan cities to sum up
experiences for building small towns in the suburbs of large
cities, and piloting tests in Nanyang-Xiangfan district to
accumulate experiences for the construction of small towns in
high-yield grain production bases in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ministry has selected another 500 small towns for
experimental tests to explore ways of building other types of
towns, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official also said various localities are also conducting
their own pilot tests. Altogether, 1,200 towns across the country
are carrying out experiments in urban development.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
in Beijing today that the central government should set a good
example for local governments at all levels in the country's
latest drive to promote socialist ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Li made the call at a Party work conference for the central
government, which started today.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the campaign to advance ethical and
cultural progress is not only a task for those central government
departments directly involved in this work, such as departments in
charge of science, education, culture, arts, broadcasting, and
publications, but also the duty of all economic departments.
</P>
<P>
"Never should we seek a temporary development of the economy at
the cost of ethical and cultural progress," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He praised a movement to "create a civilized government," which
is scheduled to begin within the central government next year.
</P>
<P>
"The key to creating a civilized government is to raise
government efficiency and provide high-quality service, not only
for the Party Central Committee and the State Council, but also
for various localities and grassroots units," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of building a first-class team of
civil servants, who must have firm political beliefs, lofty
communist ideals, loyalty to the Party and the government, and the
spirit to seek what will best benefit the general public.
</P>
<P>
He urged central government departments to strictly manage
their own employees, and strengthen internal supervision and
inspection, and to build an efficient, clean, and streamlined
contingent of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
"Civil servants of middle or senior ranks must set good
examples for those at lower levels, and play a leading role in the
promotion of ethical and cultural progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that all central government departments
should show concern for their employees, and help them to overcome
difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Chinese State Councillor Meets Russian Minister of Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Luo Gan said
here today that he hopes cooperation between Chinese and Russian
justice departments will be advanced to maintain stable
development in bilateral relations, and suggested that joint
efforts should be made to fight cross-country crimes.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting this afternoon with Russian Minister of Justice
Valentin Alexeyevich Kovalyov, Luo, who is also Secretary-General
of the State Council, said he was glad to see Sino-Russian ties
keep growing over the years.
</P>
<P>
He said the bond is the result of frequent visits between
leaders of the two sides as well as increased bilateral exchanges
and cooperation in economic, cultural and scientific spheres.
</P>
<P>
Kovalyov noted that relations between Russia and China have
progressed smoothly, and that the two countries have good
cooperation concerning international affairs.
</P>
<P>
None of their problems are unsolvable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kovalyov stressed the importance of the judicial cooperation,
which, he said, will be a prerequisite for further political
relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Minister spoke highly of the accord for exchanges
and cooperation between the two ministries of justice signed this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Luo noted Sino-Russian ties have been demonstrated in official,
unofficial and individual relationships.
</P>
<P>
He added that he hopes judicial cooperation between the two
sides will be promoted, particularly cracking down on cross-border
crimes and drug smuggling, in order to maintain stably-developing
bilateral ties.

SEOUL, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A sailor of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) who was rescued by South Korean

<HEADLINE> Egypt Tries To Keep Forgers in Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- When the U.S administration is
spurred to mint a new 100 dollar note last June to deter the
fakes that hit the market in waves, it did not expect the money
forgers in Egypt would slip up to its heel, or at least so soon.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Egyptian security authorities have seized 1 million
dollars in counterfeit notes, as well as 2 million still in the
process of being forged. The notes were a close imitation of the
new bills, which include special markings designed to prevent
forgery.
</P>
<P>
Authorities went on the alert after the fakes began to
circulate in Cairo and Giza. An undercover agent managed to crack
the ring when he approached a member and offered to buy 5,000
dollars worth of fakes for 8,000 Egyptian pounds.
</P>
<P>
The police seized in the Delta town of Mansoura a million
pounds in 10, 20 and 50 pounds notes, which were adroitly forged
by using a computer and printer.
</P>
<P>
The ring included the owner of a food canning company, a
teacher and a civil servant. Another ring involved nine members
from the northern provinces while a third was led by a tile layer
who forged about 1.5 million pounds and dollars.
</P>
<P>
The malpractice, attributed in most cases to the overwhelming
desire to accumulate as much money as possible in the shortest
possible time, is already making enough progress to threaten the
national economy of Egypt, which is forging ahead on the path of
comprehensive development.
</P>
<P>
While the 100 dollar note is the main target worldwide and
forged dollars now constitute about 75 percent of the counterfeit
notes in the world, but with computer, the troops of forgers find
producing Egyptian money no less an easy job with sizeable
returns.
</P>
<P>
The dollar, only printed in two colors, is said much easier to
imitate than the 20 and 50 pounds notes carrying interlacing
designs and colors.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Egyptian forgers prefer to concentrate their efforts
on the difficult Egyptian denominations since it would be much
easier for them to infiltrate the market.
</P>
<P>
Facing the increasingly difficult task, security agencies
always ban the publication of any details about the forgery
process, so new members can not follow suit.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the hectic endeavors by the security
authoritys, legislators have suggested that the best way to fight
forgery of foreign and local currencies should be developing
anti-forgery equipment than applying stricter legal punishment.
</P>
<P>
They called for concerted efforts by research centers in a
race against time to combat the crime. One of the recent
innovations is a dye that forgers would find a hard nut to
crack.

<HEADLINE> Major Health Operation Ends in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A major health operation
has been concluded in central Somalia recently, in which more
than 157 blind and semi-blind patients were cured.
</P>
<P>
The three-day operation was sponsored by the Italian Aid
Agency for the Peoples Development (CISP).
</P>
<P>
According to Health Coordination Officer for the CISP Mario
Maritano, free eye lenses and medicines had also been
distributed to the patients by his agency after the eye surgery
was completed.
</P>
<P>
However, Maritano said his agency could not perform all the
needed eye surgeries owing to the limited time as too many people
had come from different places. "But we will come back again to
perform other major operations in May and in December next year."
</P>
<P>
This has been the largest health operation since the failed
operation of the United Nations in Somalia had departed Somalia
in early March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Somalis are more likely to develop blindness after the age
of 50 due to the imbalance of the necessary daily diets according
to the doctors. Many people also suffer from Trichoma diseases
which lead them to total blindness even before that age.

<P>
SEOUL, November 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's investment trust
market will open to foreign firms next month, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said here today.
</P>
<P>
As from mid-December, foreign companies can open branch offices
in South Korea only by registering themselves with the government,
a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's current regulations on investment trust markets
require mutual exchanges of branch offices with South Korean firms.
</P>
<P>
The official said sales of foreign investment securities would
also be allowed in both domestic and foreign securities firms
after registering with the government.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization measure on the investment trust market is
one of the preliminary steps to South Korea's joining the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
Seoul signed an agreement on joining the organization at the
end of October after the OECD Council officially invited it to
join, on October 11.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will become the 29th OECD member when it deposits
an admission document with the French government after its
parliamentary ratification before December 25.

SUBIC, Philippines, November 25 (Xinhua) -- When one gives a
mouthful of promises, others usually doubt whether he or she will
be able to fulfill them at their face value.
</P>
<P>
A muffle, however, may well silence those who have been dubbing
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as simply a
talking shop in which promises are readily made but seldom honored
as such.
</P>
<P>
People who have doubts about the 18-member APEC trading bloc
were somewhat hushed today after the reading of the Manila
Declaration which came out after this year's APEC fora.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos, representing all the APEC
leaders, promised that the process of the APEC forum will produce
"substantial, concrete, measurable and sustainable results." He
reassured citizens of the 18 APEC members that their lives will be
"tangibly improved by the turn of the century."
</P>
<P>
This promise is expected to be fulfilled as activities aimed at
achieving the results and improvement will be launched on January
1 next year.
</P>
<P>
The promise is also bolstered by events taken place in the last
three years in regard to the APEC, of which Seattle, Bogor and
Osaka have been cited as the three previous milestones.
</P>
<P>
"At Blake Island (Seattle) three years ago," Ramos said, "we
committed ourselves to deepening our spirit of community based on
our shared vision of achieving stability, security and prosperity
for our peoples."
</P>
<P>
The APEC began in Bogor the process of realizing the Seattle
vision by committing its members to the goals of free and open
trade and investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
In Osaka, Ramos added, all members agreed on the framework of
their future work to reach their common goals built through trade
and investment liberalization, trade and investment facilitation
as well as economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"This year, we have advanced our work on economic and technical
cooperation significantly," he announced. "To give it further
impetus, we endorse the declaration of a framework of principles
for economic cooperation and development."
</P>
<P>
According to the document, these principles should be applied
to the activities of relevant APEC fora, giving a human face to
development. By so doing, high priority will be given to
developing human capital, fostering safe, efficient capital
markets, strengthening the economic infrastructure, harnessing
technologies of the future, promoting environmentally-sustainable
growth and encouraging the growth of small and medium enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In their joint appraisal of the Manila Action Plan for APEC
(MAPA), the leaders agreed that the plan, worked out by the APEC
Senior Officials Meeting and Ministerial Meeting last week,
represents the first steps of an evolutionary process of
progressive and comprehensive trade and investment liberalization
toward achieving the Bogor goals by 2010 and 2020 in accordance
with the Osaka agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan for APEC has incorporated individual as
well as collective actions with joint activities in economic and
technical cooperation, all aimed at materializing the Seattle
vision.
</P>
<P>
The APEC has set two deadlines in its 1994 meeting for trade
and investment liberalization and facilitation.
</P>
<P>
The developed members are required to liberalize their trade
and investment by the year 2010 while the developing ones are
given 10 more years to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Curtains fell on the one-day informal leadership meeting after
the reading of the declaration and citizens around and away from
the Pacific rim have to wait and see whether the APEC leaders will
be in a position to materialize their promises.
</P>
<P>
Doubts are not to disappear on their own.
</P>
<P>
While the APEC leaders were meeting behind closed doors today,
thousands of demonstrators protested outside Subic by blocking the
one major highway linking the former U.S. military base with the
capital city of Manila. The blockade and the ensuing standoff
between demonstrators and security personnel lasted late into the
night.
</P>
<P>
Some sleeping in cars while others cooking meals in the small
hours by roadside, the demonstrators had planned a caravan trip to
Subic to protest against the liberalization of trade and
investment, which they believe will damage local labor and
merchandise markets.
</P>
<P>
Stopped by government troops and police, the cars of the
demonstrators jammed the two-lane highway in the form of a
bumper-to-bumper motorcade which sprawled for at least eight
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Some of the reporters assigned to cover the Subic meeting had
to be ferried in by air instead of by car as had been planned.
</P>
<P>
But there were also local advocates of the APEC vision of
community. They turned up to help stop demonstrators from entering
the scenic seaside town and interrupting the informal leadership
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The APEC vision, just as Ramos claimed in the declaration,
requires that all sectors of society develop a stake in the
success of the 18-member trading bloc.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore commit ourselves to foster greater public-private
sector partnership in APEC. We also place great value on promoting
more people-to-people linkages, particularly those in education
and business."
</P>
<P>
The strength of APEC derives from its diversity and the
deepening of the spirit of community in accordance with the APEC
approach is crucial in exerting a positive influence on the region
and the world as well, the declaration concluded.
</P>
<P>
Is it vision or dreams that almost always drive people to
strive for something better?

<HEADLINE> Finland Hails Lira's Re-entry into ERM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government today
expressed satisfaction with European Union's decision to bring the
Italian lira back into the EU's exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
</P>
<P>
The Finnish government said the re-entry of lira into the ERM
is a step towards the realization of single currency for EU in
1999.
</P>
<P>
EU finance ministers agreed late Sunday to allow the lira back
into the ERM, giving a boost to Italy's hope of becoming a founder
member of the single currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Lira was thrown out of the ERM in 1992 amid ferocious market
speculation.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of a stable currency exchange rate is important
to the economic cooperation between Italy and other countries that
have joined the ERM, the Finnish government said.
</P>
<P>
Finland placed its mark into the ERM on October 12 this
year. Among EU's 15 countries, now only Britain, Sweden and Greece
are outside the ERM.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing today invited Belgian enterprises to actively take part in
competition in Chinese markets in a bid to increase their market
share.
</P>
<P>
China's abundant resources, cheap labor, sound industrial and
technological foundation, advancing legal system, and the rapidly
growing economy, make itself an ideal investment spot, and a broad
market for the Belgian enterprises, the Vice-Premier pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while addressing the Sino-Belgian Economic
and Trade Seminar held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Crown Prince Philippe, Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Finance Philippe Maystadt, and a 150-strong Belgian
economic and trade delegation, the largest ever to China since the
establishment of diplomatic ties in 1971, attended the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed the participants on China's reform and opening up as
well as its economic progress.
</P>
<P>
China and Belgium have carred out fruitful co-operation, laying
a solid foundation for further development, Li said, expressing
the hope that both countries would adopt practical measures in an
effort to accelerate bilateral economic and trade links.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volumes reached 2.13 billion US dollars in
1995, compared with 22.34 million US dollars in 1971.
</P>
<P>
China introduced 48 technological projects from Belgium from
1981 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1995, China used Belgian government loans worth
120 million US dollars, and during the same period, Belgian
directed a total of 170 million US dollars worth of investment to
China.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Philippe said at the seminar that the remarkable
changes that have taken place in both countries have created new
opportunities for co-operation, hoping they would promote
co-operation based on mutual understanding and reciprocal benefits.
</P>
<P>
Maystadt noted that Belgian entrepreneurs are eager to learn
about China, and Belgium, while eyeing Asian markets, puts much
attention on its co-operation with China.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from relevant Chinese departments also briefed
the Belgian entrepreneurs on the reform and co-operation of
Chinese medium-sized and small-enterprises, reform of its tariff
system, introduction of foreign investment and concerning

<P>
LAGOS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Petroleum Trust Fund
(PTF) is to rehabilitate about 12,500 kilometers of highways and
roads with about 33 billion naira (about 40 million US Dollars),
the Business Time reported today.
</P>
<P>
PTF Executive Secretary Chief Tayo Akpata was quoted as saying
in Lagos recently that most of the roads in Nigeria will be
covered by the program.
</P>
<P>
He said the program is aimed at saving the nation's collapsing
social service and deteriorating infrastructure and lay the
foundation for revamping the economy.
</P>
<P>
Most of Nigeria's relatively developed highways were built in
the oil boom period in the 1970s, however, poor maintenance in
the past have rendered them into what Akpata called "death
traps".
</P>
<P>
The PTF is set up by the Nigerian government in 1995 to
channel funds from the oil industry into road, education and
other infrastructure sectors. enditem

considering in order to diversify our sources of procurement, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Even if we decides to buy Alaskan crude, it's still uncertain
whether we will conclude a long-term contract or purchase it on a
spot basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Idemitsu imported on an experimental basis 1.3 million barrels
of Alaskan crude in August and confirmed that it could clear the
standards for distribution in Japan if mixed with oil produced
elsewhere, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Idemitsu is currently buying 70 to 80 percent of its overall
crude oil imports from the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, he
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Agrees to Let Italian Lira Re-enter ERM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- European Union finance
ministers agreed late Sunday to allow the Italian lira back into
the EU's exchange rate mechanism (ERM), according to news reports
here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision gives a boost to Italy's hopes of taking part in
the union's single currency plans in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Being part of the ERM, a grid designed to keep currencies
stable, is one criteria for qualifying for the single currency,
the Euro. Italian lira was thrown out of the ERM in 1992 amid
ferocious market speculation.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Ramano Prodi hailed the re-entry move as
a "fundamental step" towards Italy being a founder member of the
Euro, ANSA news agency said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important step," Prodi told reporters in Italy,
"It is extremely positive news for the Italian economy".
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the lira would rejoin the currency fold at a
central rate of 990 lira to the German mark, far stronger than the
1,000 to 1,050 lira rate initially sought by Rome.
</P>
<P>
The lira's entry came at the end of an eight-hour special
session of EU finance ministers and central bank governors
convened after a futile attempt to reach a deal by lower-level
officials on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Italy tried to enter at a rate no stronger than 1,000 lira to
the mark. But its partners were unwilling to let the lira in at
such a rate, fearful both of the damage a weak lira could do to
their trade and of encouraging a weak currency to qualify for the
Euro. Some were even talking about 950 to 980 lira to the mark.
</P>
<P>
EU policy-makers said the stronger re-entry rate matched the
efforts the Italian government had made towards improving the
economy's fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
But they said that Italy was not being invited to join the
single currency simply by being allowed back into the ERM.
</P>
<P>
With the lira in the ERM, only three of the EU's 15 countries
-- Britain, Sweden and Greece -- are now outside the grid.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko's draft constitution won the backing of 70.5 percent of
the electorate at the nationwide referendum held on Sunday,
reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The ITAR-TASS news agency cited Lidia Yermoshina, acting
chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, as saying that only
7.9 percent of the 7.2 million electorate backed the
constitutional draft proposed by Lukashenko's opponents in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yermoshina said over 84 percent of the 7.2 million registered
voters participated in Sunday's referendum.
</P>
<P>
However, Yermoshina's predecessor, Viktor Gonchar, who had
criticized the referendum and had been sacked consequently, said
the turnout had been falsified, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The referendum was initiated by President Lukashenko who put
forth four questions before the voters. The key question of them,
connected with constitutional amendments, covered an expansion of
presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
Most voters had backed the president, who also wants to extend
his term beyond 2000, the reports quoted sources in Lukashenko's
administration as saying.
</P>
<P>
While fixing a date for the referendum, the
opposition-dominated parliament added three questions of its own,
in an effort to limit presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the president and the parliament has lasted
for several months, and the results of Sunday's referendum will
decide which of the conflicting sides wins the dispute over the
power-sharing.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko told a press conference today that he would start
forming a new, lower house of parliament with the existing
deputies on Monday.

<HEADLINE> S.African Farmers Call for Stopping Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Farming in South Africa
had developed into a high risk industry which urgently needed
effective measures to stop the increasing murders of farmers, the
Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU) has said.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made in a statement issued at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the murder of a 64-year-old farmer, Cornelius
Erasmus, in Ellisras area, TAU President Dries Bruwer said
organised agriculture could no longer prevent their members from
taking the law into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
Erasmus' body was discovered on friday on Kleinbegin farm,
in Gauteng Province.
</P>
<P>
The white farmer's hands and feet were tied and he apparently
died from a deep head wound.
</P>
<P>
Three suspects were arrested and being questioned by police.
</P>
<P>
Bruwer said in his statement that farmers had become passive
combatants in a rural civil war and he hoped the government would
introduce effective measures to protect farming communities.
</P>
<P>
Despite talks with South African President Nelson Mandela and
senior cabinet ministers, nothing had been done to remedy the
situation, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Bruwer also said the TAU was organising a safety and security
congress for next year to involve all parties in finding a solution
to rural killings and violence. enditem

<HEADLINE> APEC Leaders Approve Manila Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 18 member
economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
today approved the landmark Manila Action Plan at an informal
meeting in Subic in the northwestern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan for APEC (MAPA) represents the first
step toward the achievement of the APEC goal of free trade and
investment in the region by the year 2010 for developed economies
and 2020 for developing ones.
</P>
<P>
The MAPA includes individual economy action plans, a collective
action plan and joint activities in economic and technical
cooperation -- the three pillars that serve as the foundation of
the Asia Pacific community.
</P>
<P>
In the MAPA, the APEC members promise to take significant
measures in the following areas:
</P>
<P>
1. Greater market access through progressively reducing tariffs
and non-tariff barriers to trade. The main commitments in the area
are:
</P>
<P>
-- Significant tariff reduction which provides greater market
access and predictability,
</P>
<P>
-- A reaffirmation of the standstill on new measures of
protection,
</P>
<P>
-- A commitment to reduce and/or eliminate non-tariff measures
which are inconsistent with the World Trade Organization and
affect trade,
</P>
<P>
-- Greater transparency of respective non-tariff measures and
</P>
<P>
effective liberalization.
</P>
<P>
2. Enhancing market access in services.
</P>
<P>
All members undertake to implement further liberalization in a
wide range of service sectors, including telecommunications,
transport, energy, tourism, retail trade and business/professional
services.
</P>
<P>
Eight economies outlined specific and time-bound measures to
open up their service sectors to foreign commercial presence,
particularly in the transport and financial services sectors.
</P>
<P>
3. Providing an open investment regime.
</P>
<P>
All economies submitted action plans on the investment area.
The undertakings vary from actions to liberalize the investment
regime to facilitation of investment through improved
transparency, technical assistance and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
4. Reducing the cost of business by means of trade and business
facilitation measures. The key initiatives in the area are:
</P>
<P>
-- Region-wide movement toward a paperless, computerized
customs system,
</P>
<P>
-- Concluding mutual recognition arrangements on conformity
assessments for standards and alignment with international
standards,
</P>
<P>
-- Providing information on and simplifying visa arrangements
for business travelers and continuing dialogue with businessmen on
ways to improve their mobility,
</P>
<P>
-- Ensuring transparency in government procurement policies and
procedures and for majority, government procurement opportunities,
</P>
<P>
-- Providing adequate and effective intellectual property
rights protection regimes,
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting effective use of mechanisms for settlement of
private/private and private/government disputes,
</P>
<P>
-- Taking collective action to identify and establish
appropriate cooperation arrangements on competition policy,
</P>
<P>
-- Publishing annual reports detailing deregulation measures
taken by each economy.
</P>
<P>
5. Building an open and efficient infrastructure sector.
</P>
<P>
The APEC members are committed to deepening the public-private
partnership to meet the infrastructure challenges in the region,
including through these measures:
</P>
<P>
-- Expand market access for foreign firms, remove foreign
exchange restrictions and review tax and immigration restrictions
on foreign suppliers,
</P>
<P>
-- Support an information technology agreement in the WTO,
</P>
<P>
-- Open up the telecommunications sector and adopt a set of
non-binding principles to increase cooperation in the energy
sector and guide formulation of domestic energy policies.
</P>
<P>
6. Strengthening economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The goals and guiding principles in this area are articulated
in the Manila Declaration on the Asia-Pacific Framework for
Strengthening Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
The declaration establishes six themes that will receive
priority attention:
</P>
<P>
-- Development of human capital,
</P>
<P>
-- Development of stable and efficient capital markets,
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening of economic infrastructure,
</P>
<P>
-- Harnessing of technologies for the future,
</P>
<P>
-- Safeguarding of the quality of life through environmentally
sound growth, and
</P>
<P>
-- Development and strengthening of small and medium
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Italian President to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro will start an official visit here Friday to expedite the
Middle East peace process and strengthen bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This was made public by Italian Ambassador to Egypt Francesco
Alouzi in an interview with local newspaper Al Akhbar, which was
also carried by Egypt's Middle East News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, the ambassador said the visit reflects
the historic and strong ties between the two countries and Italy's
deep respect for and appreciation of the efforts made by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in all domains.
</P>
<P>
The Italian president's visit comes as part of series of
visits by Italian senior officials to the African country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
During the past four weeks, Cairo has received Italian
ministers of defense and foreign affairs as well as the prime
minister, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two governments held identical views on the need for
reaching a just and overall peace in the Middle East region,
the Italian diplomat said, adding that Presidents Scalfaro and
Mubarak will deal with the latest developments of the peace
process during their meeting.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss means of promoting bilateral ties, he
said. Alouzi praised the ongoing economic reform in Egypt, saying
it succeeded in attracting foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Italian economic relations are excellent as the trade
between the two countries has reached two billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Italy is the second largest world importer of Egyptian
products and the third biggest exporter to Egypt, according to
the ambassador.

</P>
<P>
Clinton is to pay the visit after attending the Asia-Pacific

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses to Disarm Guerrillas before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
has stressed a refusal to disarm guerrilla groups fighting against
Israeli occupation in south Lebanon before Israel pulls its
troops out of the Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Lebanese army would not allow a
single bullet to be fired from the Lebanese land toward Israel's
borders after an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a televised question-and-answer session with some 200
journalists and university students in the Beirut Presidential
Palace Sunday night, the Lebanese president announced that he
would shake hands with Israeli leaders if "peace comes."
</P>
<P>
Expressing an optimism over an implementation of U.N.
Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for an
unconditional and full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, he
announced that his ambition was to "hand over to the next
president a Lebanon free of Israeli occupation."
</P>
<P>
He underlined the continuous Syrian-Lebanese coordination in
the peace talks with Israel, saying that Lebanon would be
the last Arab country signing a peace treaty with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether the Lebanese army was
capable of protecting the country, the Lebanese president said:
"Yes, the number of our army has become enough."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the army was short of equipment. "We
are not ready, and we do not have resources, to buy the equipment
because we are at the gate of peace and we are not prepared to
enter a war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi repeated the refusal to disarm the resistance groups
fighting the Israeli troops in south Lebanon because "this
means an end of the resistance against the Israeli occupation
and will create a big problem in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"When the Israeli army withdraws, I affirm that the
Lebanese army will not allow a shot be fired from the
Lebanese land toward the Israeli internationally-recognized
borders," the Lebanese president said.
</P>
<P>
Defending the government's economic policies, Hrawi said that
"Lebanon has achieved economic credibility."
</P>
<P>
He said this reality prompted U.S. President Bill Clinton to
call for a conference of Lebanon's friends, scheduled to convene
in Washington on December 16 to raise financial aid for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has invited some 30 countries to attend the
conference and about 20 of them would send foreign ministers
to participate.
</P>
<P>
"Is this not an indication of the confidence in Lebanon?" the
Lebanese president asked.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the renewed confidence in our economy would be
accompanied by political confidence," he added, clearly
insinuating Beirut's drive to end a U.S. travel ban imposed on
Lebanon nearly 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Lebanese politicians for dumping all their
domestic problems on Syria, saying "the Syrians are tired of
Lebanese politicians visiting Damascus almost every day. It is
time for us to deal with our own problems (by ourselves)."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's First Ebola Patient Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The first South African
Ebola patient died in Johannesburg Hospital on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today quoted Gauteng Provincial Health
Department spokeswoman, Jo-Anne Collinge, as saying that
Marilyn Lahana, a 46-year-old nurse and
a mother of two daughters, had been in a critical condition for
more than a week following multiple organ dysfunction caused by
the infection.
</P>
<P>
Lahana had been dependent on life-support systems by the time
she was transferred from the Sandton Clinic in northern suburb to
Johannesburg Hospital's isolation ward on November 16, when she
was positively diagnosed as having been infected with the deadly
Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
She showed no improvement during her treatment, said Collinge.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Johannesburg Hospital superintendent Trevor
Frankish said Lahana had died from a combination of organ
dysfunction and several bleeds into the brain on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Everything possible had been done to keep her life, but her
condition had been deteriorating progressively, said Frankish.
</P>
<P>
Lahana contracted the deadly Ebola virus while nursing a
Gabonese doctor, who had treated Ebola patients in that country.
</P>
<P>
The Gabonese doctor was admitted to a private clinic, where
Lahana worked, suffering from a high fever on October 27. He was
discharged after being undiagnosed as suffering from Ebola fever
on November 11.
</P>
<P>
Lahana fell ill and was immediately admitted to hospital on
November 6, and when she was diagnosed as having been infected
the Ebola, the Gabonese doctor was traced as a possible contact.
</P>
<P>
Blood samples taken from him revealed his fever had been
brought on by the deadly Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
However, by Sunday night about 350 people were still being
monitored by health workers who could have had contact with
Lahana. Fortunately, none was showing symptoms of Ebola fever so
far.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on APEC Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBIC, the Philippines, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China is
willing to open an environmental protection center in Beijing for
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members to strengthen
cooperation in this field, Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
"The center, which is equipped with advanced facilities, can
serve as a venue for training, research, discussion, information
exchange and joint research and development programs for APEC
members," said Jiang at the fourth APEC informal leadership
meeting, which opened today.
</P>
<P>
"It is the primary task of many developing countries including
China to speed up economic development and eradicate poverty at
the earliest possible date," the Chinese president said. "But we
are also clearly aware of the importance and pressing need for
environmental protection."
</P>
<P>
In his address, Jiang pointed out that the relatively high
economic growth rate maintained for years in the Asia-Pacific
region is also a new challenge -- "that is, how to prevent
pollution so that economic growth and environmental protection can
proceed in harmony, forming a virtuous circle."
</P>
<P>
"We in China describe polluting the environment as 'feeding off
our forefathers' bequest to us while depriving our children of
theirs,'" Jiang said, recalling that Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said two years ago that this generation of
leaders would have a responsibility towards the posterity over
what they do today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described the regional and international cooperation as
"imperative." "APEC members have their respective advantages in
environmental protection, which constitutes an important basis for
cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also voiced his support to the idea of including
environmental cooperation as a priority issue in the agenda of
next year's informal leadership meeting to be held in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president then expressed his sincere hope that APEC
can make concrete progress in environmental cooperation, saying,
"we will be doing a great service to the present and future
generations if we succeed in this regard."

<P>
"Today in Subic, we have deepened the spirit of community in
the Asia-Pacific region and have affirmed our commitment to
sustainable growth and equitable development," the declaration
said.
</P>
<P>
Though the reading of a joint declaration is rather ceremonial
at the annual informal leadership meeting, Ramos itemized the
details of the document which was approved by all the APEC leaders
today.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect of APEC activities, the Philippine president
cited Seattle, Bogor and Osaka as the three previous milestones.
</P>
<P>
"At Blake Island (Seattle) three years ago," he said, "we
committed ourselves to deepening our spirit of community based on
our shared vision of achieving stability, security and prosperity
for our peoples."
</P>
<P>
The APEC began in Bogor the process of realizing the Seattle
vision by committing its members to the goals of free and open
trade and investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
In Osaka, Ramos added, all members agreed on the framework of
their future work to reach their common goals built through trade
and investment liberalization, trade and investment facilitation
as well as economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In the joint assessment of the Manila Action Plan for APEC
(MAPA), the leaders agreed that the plan, worked out by the APEC
Senior Officials Meeting and Ministerial Meeting last week,
contains the first steps of an evolutionary process of progressive
and comprehensive trade and investment liberalization toward
achieving the Bogor goals by 2010 and 2020 in accordance with the
Osaka agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan has incorporated individual as well as
collective actions and joint activities in economic and technical
cooperation, all aimed at materializing the Seattle vision.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that our vision of community can be strengthened
only if our efforts benefit all citizens," Ramos read.
</P>
<P>
"As an essential complement to our trade and investment
liberalization agenda, economic and technical cooperation helps
APEC members to participate more fully in and benefit from an open
global trading environment, thus ensuring that liberalized trade
contributes to sustainable growth and equitable development and to
a reduction in economic disparities."
</P>
<P>
The APEC has set two deadlines at its 1994 meeting for trade
and investment liberalization and facilitation.
</P>
<P>
The developed members are required to liberalize their trade
and investment by the year 2010 while the developing ones are
given 10 more years to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The APEC now embraces 16 sovereign states including Australia,
Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico,
New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Republic of
Korea, Singapore, Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei joined APEC as regional economies.
</P>
<P>
The APEC has just decided not to admit any new members until
1998. Vietnam, Peru, Russia, India, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Ecuador,
Colombia, Panama, Macao, Pakistan and Laos have so far shown
interest in joining the bloc.
</P>
<P>
On hand to hear the reading of the Manila Declaration were
Australian Prime Minister John Howard, the Sultan of Brunei
Darussalam Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, Chilean President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
Yam-Kuen, Indonesian President Soeharto, Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, Republic of Korea President Kim Young-Sam,
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohammed, Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo, New Zealand Prime Minister James Bolger, Papua
New Guinea Prime Minister Julius Chan, Singapore Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong, Koo Chen-fu representing Chinese Taipei, Thai Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Curtains fell on the one-day informal leadership meeting after
the reading of the declaration and citizens in and outside the
Asia-Pacific region however have to wait and see whether the APEC
leaders will be in a position to honor their promises.
</P>
<P>
For now, at least, small talks that the Pacific-rim trading
bloc is nothing more than just a talking shop may somewhat be
hushed with the itemized steps and measures in the declaration
which are designed to materialize the APEC vision of community.
</P>
<P>
Canada is to play host to the APEC fora and the informal
leadership meeting next year before the annual event moves to
Malaysia in 1998 and to New Zealand the following year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, French Scientists Create New Method to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A new effective way to
detect rare metals in a type of rock known as apatite has been
developed by Israeli and French scientists.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Israel's Hebrew University, the Open
University and France's University of Lyon invented the new
method, which involves the use of "laser-excited, time-resolved
luminescence".
</P>
<P>
This new method will be discussed at the Israeli-French
Workshop on Apatites and Lasers which opens today at the
Jerusalem International Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Science Ministry and the universities, the
conference will gather 40 French and 100 Israeli researchers.
It will be co-chaired by Professor Renata Reisfeld of Hebrew
University and Professor Ya'akov Nathan of the Israel Geological
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Apatites are sediments comprising phosphates, calcium and
rare metals such as uranium.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-French team used lasers beamed at apatites to
produce various colors. Each color can be identified with a
specific metal.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Goal for Asset Evaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A standard evaluation system
should be developed for China's asset-appraising industry,
according to the State Administration of State Property.
</P>
<P>
The system should be designed to make asset evaluation an
intermediary trade that caters to the needs of the development of
a socialist market economy, an official at the industry watchdog
said.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the above goal, China will spare no effort to
establish a unified legal system for asset evaluation, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that priority will be given to modifying the rules on
the management of evaluation of state-owned property, which were
issued in 1991, as well as to drawing up regulations on certified
public assessors (CPA).
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to improve the qualification
examination for CPAs, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Changes in property rights and property transactions following
China's market economy drive since the 1980s have made property
assessment an increasingly important part of the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
Official data shows that China had over 2,500 asset-appraising
agencies by the end of last year, with the number of professionals
standing at more than 47,000. Asset evaluation in China has
covered both state-owned and non-state-owned sectors.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebels Abduct 300 into Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zaire-based rebels of the
the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) abducted at least 300 people
into Zaire on November 13 when they invaded Uganda from Zaire,
reported the local daily the New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
A victim who escaped and returned to Uganda was quoted as
saying the rebels have camps in the Bukyira, Lhume and Rugeze
area in Zaire and had received new weapons and fresh supplies.
</P>
<P>
The victim feared that the rebels might attack again because
the Zairean government had given them a period within which the
rebels must have returned to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''we were between 300-400 including women and
children when the attackers crossed with us to Zaire.''
</P>
<P>
Among the people kidnapped were local government officials, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added some of the kidnapped people were immediately taken
to another camp for military training after they were addressed
by a rebel officer, Fanahasi Kibaku. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on APEC Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBIC, the Philippines, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China is
willing to open an environmental protection center in Beijing for
the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members to
strengthen cooperation in this field, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"The center, which is equipped with advanced facilities, can
serve as a venue for training, research, discussion, information
exchange and joint research and development programs for APEC
members," said Jiang at the fourth informal APEC leadership
meeting, which opened today.
</P>
<P>
"It is the primary task of many developing countries including
China to speed up economic development and eradicate poverty at
the earliest possible date," the Chinese President said. "But we
are also clearly aware of the importance and pressing need for
environmental protection."
</P>
<P>
In his address, Jiang pointed out that the relatively high
economic growth rate maintained for years in the Asian-Pacific
region is also a new challenge -- "that is, how to prevent
pollution so that economic growth and environmental protection can
proceed in harmony, forming a virtuous circle."
</P>
<P>
"We in China describe polluting the environment as 'feeding off
our forefathers' bequest to us while depriving our children of
theirs,'" Jiang said, recalling that Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said two years ago that this generation of
leaders would have a responsibility towards the posterity over
what they do today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described the regional and international cooperation as
"imperative." "APEC members have their respective advantages in
environmental protection, which constitutes an important basis for
cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also voiced his support to the idea of including
environmental cooperation as a priority issue in the agenda of
next year's informal leadership meeting to be held in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president then expressed his sincere hope that APEC
can make concrete progress in environmental cooperation, saying,
"we will be doing a great service to the present and future
generations if we succeed in this regard."

<HEADLINE> SADC Supports Ivory Trade Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- All southern African countries
are now supporting Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia's proposal to
allow trade in ivory and other elephant products.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Herald at the weekend, Zimbabwe's
Deputy Minister of Environment and Tourism Edward Chindori-Chininga
said some southern African countries which were against the trade in
ivory were now supporting the proposal.
</P>
<P>
This means that Southern African Development Community (SADC)
countries will attend the convention on international trade in
endangered species to be held in Harare in June next year with one
voice.
</P>
<P>
In August this year, SADC heads of state and government met in
Maseru, Lesotho, where they supported the issue of downlisting of
African elephant populations from its current cites appendix i status
to that of appendix ii.
</P>
<P>
Wild animals in appendix i cannot be utilised, while those in
appendix ii can be sustainably utilised.
</P>
<P>
The SADC proposal means that if the African elephant is
transferred from appendix i to appendix ii, countries will be allowed
to export registered stocks of raw tusks.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe proposed that it will export to Japan 15 tonnes of ivory
in 1998 and another 15 tonnes in 1999.
</P>
<P>
On why Zimbabwe had chosen Japan as its only market,
Chindori-Chininga said Japan had a large internal market than most of
the countries.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Zimbabwe has ivory stocks of about 30 tonnes worth
millions of dollars, and the ivory is accumulating at about 5 tonnes
every year. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on APEC Economic and Technical Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBIC, the Philippines, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
President Jiang Zemin today stressed the need for closer economic
and technical cooperation (Ecotech) among members of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
"Ecotech bears on the future development of the Asia-Pacific
region," said Jiang in an address on science and technology
cooperation at the fourth APEC informal leadership meeting, which
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his hope that this meeting will become "a new
milestone for APEC in that it translates the consensus on Ecotech
into actions."
</P>
<P>
An important ingredient of Ecotech is science and technology
cooperation, said Jiang, adding that science and technology form
the primary productive force, and their integration with the
economy holds the key to economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president pointed out that "the biggest innovation
in putting research results of science and technology to work in
this century has been the creation of science and technology
industrial parks."
</P>
<P>
"Among the nearly 900 such parks worldwide, about 50 percent
are located in the Asia-Pacific region and they are playing an
increasingly greater role in the economic and social development
of APEC members," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the Chinese president proposed that a science
and technology industrial parks network be set up within APEC with
a view to promoting exchanges of experience and information, "in
order to accelerate the momentum of integration of science and
technology with the economy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China is ready to open some representative
state-level industrial parks from among its total of 52 for
expanding cooperation with other APEC members.
</P>
<P>
They will provide favorable conditions for hi-tech research and
development projects, commercialization of research results, and
industrial development activities, in where all APEC members hold
common interest, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a way of cooperation, based on mutuality with benefits
accruing to all participants, will facilitate linkages among APEC
members in the development of industrial science and technology,
and result in deepened cooperation under Ecotech among them,"
Jiang concluded.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice President Meets Finland's Top Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Rong
Yiren said today in Beijing that he hopes Sino-Finnish exchanges
in various fields, especially judicial circles, will be advanced
constantly.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement during a meeting with a delegation from
the Finnish Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court, led by
Pekka Hallberg, president of the administrative court.
</P>
<P>
Rong said China and Finland have witnessed a smooth development
in bilateral relations since diplomatic ties were forged over 40
years ago, with constant exchanges and cooperation in the fields
of politics, culture, trade and economy, as well as judiciary.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the current visit of the Finnish delegation
will help promote exchanges and friendly relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
For nearly two decades, many achievements have been made in
China's economic construction and reform, as well as its opening
up, which, according to the vice president, had much to do with
the enforcement of legal system.
</P>
<P>
Rong also briefed the guests on China's domestic economic
progress and the efforts made by the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, the country's top legislature, in economic
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Hallberg noted that judicial cooperation between Finland and
China has enjoyed a smooth development. He said he was very
interested in China's achievements in legislation, especially
economic legislation, such as corporation and banking laws which
were of major importance to a country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
He added that there are broad cooperation possibilities in
judicial areas between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Hallberg and his party arrived in Beijing on November 22, for a
week-long visit to Beijing, Changsha and Nanjing, at the invitation
of the Supreme People's Court.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Records Worst Quarterly Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand recorded the
worst quarterly trade deficit in history in the three months to
the end of October, Statistics NZ reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter, imports continued to outstrip exports,
resulting in a deficit of 845 million NZ dollars (one NZ dollar
equals 0.70 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although exports in October reached a record of 1.7 billion NZ
dollars, they were 200 million dollars less than the value of
imports of the month.

Exporters blamed the deficit to the consequences of the high

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Security Built Up in Sri Lanka Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Police and the three armed
services of Sri Lanka have been enforcing tight security across
the country since mid-November against possible attacks by Tamil
rebels in their "Heroes Week" between November 20 and 28.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) attacked military and civilian targets during the Heroes
Week to mark the birthday of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabahakaran
on November 26.
</P>
<P>
According to intelligence reports, the rebels have also planned
similar attacks during the Heroes Week this year.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting a 13-year guerrilla war for a
separate Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka, have
launched several attacks on military and police installations in
the Jaffna Peninsula in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The government has cautioned all VIPs against going to the
peninsula till the dangerous period is over.
</P>
<P>
However, military intelligence reports indicated that the most
vulnerable place in the country is Colombo, the capital, where
groups of suicide rebels are believed to be hiding with arms and
ammunition and planning to wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
Sources said police and security forces are all prepared to
foil any attack. At least 50,000 police personnel, together with
army units, are deployed in the city for this purpose, they
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Within the city, major combined search operations have been
carried out and as many as 180 rebel suspects had been rounded up
by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police and security personnel have been conducting careful
checks on persons and searching suspicious vehicles. Checking at
all entry points into the city has also been intensified since
November 22.
</P>
<P>
A rebel intelligence worker who was arrested in Colombo
disclosed that an attack on police stations in the city was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
Another rebel suspect revealed that the rebels were planning
massive raids on civilian and other targets during the Heroes Week
in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the police and armed forces have boosted security
measures in Colombo and its suburbs to prevent any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened particularly in schools, public
places, buses and trains since November 23.
</P>
<P>
Security in other major cities and towns across the country has
also been beefed up, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Police and the armed forces are confident that they are in full
control of the security situation in the country, but they did not
rule out the possibility of unforeseen eventualities, the sources
added.

<HEADLINE> Economic Ties Closer, More Extensive: Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- In both principle and practice, APEC economic and technical
cooperation is quite different from development aid in the
traditional sense. This cooperation is reciprocal, based on
equality, mutual benefit and complementarity. It calls for the
rich helping the poor, but also requires all members to make their
respective contribution within their means. It stresses the role
of government, but also encourages involvement of business
sector. It allows appropriate policy guidance, but also applies
market mechanism. It opens not only to members but also to
non-members. With such an approach, all participants will be able
to do their very best.
</P>
<P>
-- In order to ensure an effective economic and technical
cooperation, it is necessary to set a focus, namely, to define
certain priority areas. There is a high degree of complementarity
among APEC members in the realms of human resources development,
science and technology, environmental protection and
infrastructure. We should adopt effective measures to strengthen
exchanges and cooperation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
-- Since its establishment, APEC has accumulated some
experience in the course of practice and gradually come up with a
unique way of cooperation. This has come to be known as the "APEC
approach." It has such features as recognition of diversity,
emphasis on flexibility, gradual progress and openness, adherence
to mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, consensus and
voluntariness; and combination of individual and collective
actions. Guided by the collectively-defined common objectives,
APEC members are free to make their respective efforts in light of
their own circumstances. These principles and practices take into
account of differing development levels and resilience of partners
in cooperation, and thus strike an optimum balance among their
diverse interests and demands.
</P>
<P>
This approach shall also be adopted in the process of trade and
investment liberalization of APEC. The issue of information
technology as touched upon by us all is indeed very
important. However, because of the difference in the levels of
economic development in the member economies, it is very difficult
for the liberalization in this field to be pushed forward in
accordance with a time-table and enough flexibility is needed in
terms of the scope of products involved. Furthermore, the
promotion of the exchange of information technology is not an
issue that only concerns tariff cuts, but also requires efforts to
eliminate barriers to technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
APEC practice has shown that this approach is viable and
effective. Since the Osaka Meeting, all members have submitted
their Individual Action Plans (IAPs) on trade and investment
liberalization. In the context of their respective development
levels, many members, including China, have made tremendous
efforts to promote regional cooperation and trade and investment
liberalization. I have the pleasure to inform you that China has
reduced its average import tariff rate from 35.9 percent to 23
percent in the current year, and will bring it further down to
around 15 percent by year 2000. China will continue to support the
"APEC approach," actively participate in Asia-Pacific economic
cooperation and make its due contribution to the realization of
our common objectives.
</P>
<P>
There is no precedence which APEC can follow since ours is a
new type of economic cooperation. We should go forward, constantly
enriching and supplementing our experience of cooperation, so as
to blaze a new trail towards even closer Asia-Pacific economic
cooperation. May I conclude my speech by quoting Chinese thinker
and writer Lu Xun who said: "For actually the earth had no road
to begin with, but when many men pass one way, a road is made."
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Economic Ties Closer, More Extensive: Chinese President  (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBIC, Philippines, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin today delivered his address at the fourth informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum. The following is the full text of his speech:

Your Excellency President Fidel V. Ramos,
Excellencies,
</P>
<P>
I am delighted to be here at scenic Subic for the APEC
leadership gathering which I hope will give fresh impetus to
economic cooperation in our region. I would like to express my
heartfelt thanks to President Ramos for his kind invitation and to
the Philippine Government for its thoughtful arrangements for our
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region has steadily raised its economic
strength and scientific and technical level in recent years. Some
developing members of the region, in particular, have maintained a
momentum of rapid growth. However, the gains are rather uneven
among member economies. Particularly, there is still a big gap in
terms of economic level between the developing members and the
developed ones.
</P>
<P>
Economic ties between countries are becoming closer and more
extensive nowadays, which presents fresh opportunities as well as
new challenges for Asia-Pacific economic development. In order to
maintain a sustained economic growth, countries and areas in the
Asia-Pacific region need to continue tapping their own potentials
while reinforcing economic cooperation at the regional level.
</P>
<P>
Since the Bogor Meeting, APEC trade and investment
liberalization has got off on track gradually and made some
positive headway. One important contribution of the Osaka Meeting
was to begin placing equal importance on economic and technical
cooperation and trade and investment liberalization. Nevertheless,
we are yet to work out a consensus on how to push forward economic
and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
One opinion only emphasizes the importance of trade and
investment liberalization, while allocating a subordinate role to
economic and technical cooperation. I am afraid this opinion fails
to consider all sides of the matter. In fact, without a fruitful
economic and technical cooperation, trade and investment
liberalization cannot make much headway. In so far as developed
members are concerned, market is essential to their continued
growth as they must seek new outlets for their capital and
merchandise. Such a market will be very limited if economies of
the developing members remain stagnant. Economic and technical
cooperation will facilitate the growth of developing members,
thereby turning potential markets into real ones and widening the
growth horizon of the developed members.
</P>
<P>
I would like to make a few observations in this regard.
</P>
<P>
-- The basic objective of economic and technical cooperation is
to turn diversity into complementarity in the economic development
of all members, so as to achieve common prosperity. Hence, we
should step up cooperation in the technical field, facilitate the
diffusion of technology and know-how, and promote the development
and effective use of human and natural resources.

<P>
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a
nationwide high-capacity telecommunications networks based on
optical, microwave and satellite transmission technologies, and
has become one of the world's largest telecommunications consumers.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the central government show that China
now has 300,000 kilometers of optical cables, including 100,000 km
for long-distance communications, and a satellite telecom system
supported by 21 ground stations.
</P>
<P>
According to "China Consumers' Daily," the country has formed a
telephone switching capacity of 100 million lines, and signed up
62.31 million phone users both in cities and countryside.
</P>
<P>
The analog mobile telecom service has been extended to 279
cities and 1,410 counties, and both the national and international
roaming functions are available on digital mobile phone networks.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 Chinese cities and counties have access to
networks for data telecom and packet exchanges, which are
connected to 40 data webs abroad.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a rapid expansion of the scale of its
telecommunications network, the technical benchmark has also
largely improved, said a senior official with the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications. The whole telecom system of China
has been digitalized and equipped with the program-control
technology, and such value-added services as high-speed data
telecom and picture transmission are available on the network.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Prepares for Creation of Currency Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has begun technical
preparations for the setting up of a currency board in near future
to control the amount of currency in circulation, the Bulgarian
prime minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the World Bank will also take part in the preparations for this
board which will operate as the central bank, Prime Minister Zhan
Videnov said.
</P>
<P>
This move, initiated by representatives of the IMF early this
month, is a bitter but maybe efficient remedy aimed to handle
Bulgaria's financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Bulgarian lev devalued excessively and had lost
as much as 10 percent of its value in a single day, prompting the
Bulgarians to rush into banks to withdraw their deposits and buy
U.S. dollars although the one-year fixed deposit rate is as high
as 180 percent. Meantime, the prices skyrocketed and the inflation
rate stood high. Burdened by heavy debts home and abroad, the
country's international reserves has decreased to some 500 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suggested that the Bulgarian government start to have a
mortgage on its gold reserves; set a fixed currency rate in
accordance with the amount of lev in circulation, and foreign
exchange and gold reserves; keep the lev circulating amount stable
in the event of no increase in foreign exchanges; carry out an
austerity policy and limit the loans that the banks extend to the
public sector.
</P>
<P>
Videnov said the board would be run well even without foreign
experts since Bulgarians have more confidence in their own
specialists.
</P>
<P>
Up to now the first round of consultations on the board had
ended without controversy, he added.

extensive nowadays, which presents fresh opportunities as well as
new challenges for Asia-Pacific economic development. In order to
maintain a sustained economic growth, countries and areas in the
Asia-Pacific region need to continue tapping their own potentials
while reinforcing economic cooperation at the regional level.
</P>
<P>
Since the Bogor Meeting, APEC trade and investment
liberalization has got off on track gradually and made some
positive headway. One important contribution of the Osaka Meeting
was to begin placing equal importance on economic and technical
cooperation and trade and investment liberalization. Nevertheless,
we are yet to work out a consensus on how to push forward economic
and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
One opinion only emphasizes the importance of trade and
investment liberalization, while allocating a subordinate role to
economic and technical cooperation. I am afraid this opinion fails
to consider all sides of the matter. In fact, without a fruitful
economic and technical cooperation, trade and investment
liberalization cannot make much headway. In so far as developed
members are concerned, market is essential to their continued
growth as they must seek new outlets for their capital and
merchandise. Such a market will be very limited if economies of
the developing members remain stagnant. Economic and technical
cooperation will facilitate the growth of developing members,
thereby turning potential markets into real ones and widening the
growth horizon of the developed members.
</P>
<P>
I would like to make a few observations in this regard.
</P>
<P>
-- The basic objective of economic and technical cooperation is
to turn diversity into complementarity in the economic development
of all members, so as to achieve common prosperity. Hence, we
should step up cooperation in the technical field, facilitate the
diffusion of technology and know-how, and promote the development
and effective use of human and natural resources.

<HEADLINE> Economic Ties Closer, More Extensive: Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- In both principle and practice, APEC economic and technical
cooperation is quite different from development aid in the
traditional sense. This cooperation is reciprocal, based on
equality, mutual benefit and complementarity. It calls for the
rich helping the poor, but also requires all members to make their
respective contribution within their means. It stresses the role
of government, but also encourages involvement of business
sector. It allows appropriate policy guidance, but also applies
market mechanism. It opens not only to members but also to
non-members. With such an approach, all participants will be able
to do their very best.
</P>
<P>
-- In order to ensure an effective economic and technical
cooperation, it is necessary to set a focus, namely, to define
certain priority areas. There is a high degree of complementarity
among APEC members in the realms of human resources development,
science and technology, environmental protection and
infrastructure. We should adopt effective measures to strengthen
exchanges and cooperation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
-- Since its establishment, APEC has accumulated some
experience in the course of practice and gradually come up with a
unique way of cooperation. This has come to be known as the "APEC
approach." It has such features as recognition of diversity,
emphasis on flexibility, gradual progress and openness, adherence
to mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, consensus and
voluntariness; and combination of individual and collective
actions. Guided by the collectively-defined common objectives,
APEC members are free to make their respective efforts in light of
their own circumstances. These principles and practices take into
account of differing development levels and resilience of partners
in cooperation, and thus strike an optimum balance among their
diverse interests and demands.
</P>
<P>
This approach shall also be adopted in the process of trade and
investment liberalization of APEC. The issue of information
technology as touched upon by us all is indeed very
important. However, because of the difference in the levels of
economic development in the member economies, it is very difficult
for the liberalization in this field to be pushed forward in
accordance with a time-table and enough flexibility is needed in
terms of the scope of products involved. Furthermore, the
promotion of the exchange of information technology is not an
issue that only concerns tariff cuts, but also requires efforts to
eliminate barriers to technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
APEC practice has shown that this approach is viable and
effective. Since the Osaka Meeting, all members have submitted
their Individual Action Plans (IAPs) on trade and investment
liberalization. In the context of their respective development
levels, many members, including China, have made tremendous
efforts to promote regional cooperation and trade and investment
liberalization. I have the pleasure to inform you that China has
reduced its average import tariff rate from 35.9 percent to 23
percent in the current year, and will bring it further down to
around 15 percent by year 2000. China will continue to support the
"APEC approach," actively participate in Asia-Pacific economic
cooperation and make its due contribution to the realization of
our common objectives.
</P>
<P>
There is no precedence which APEC can follow since ours is a
new type of economic cooperation. We should go forward, constantly
enriching and supplementing our experience of cooperation, so as
to blaze a new trail towards even closer Asia-Pacific economic
cooperation. May I conclude my speech by quoting Chinese thinker
and writer Lu Xun who said: "For actually the earth had no road
to begin with, but when many men pass one way, a road is made."
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Network to Be Set Up in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Balkan
Culture and Art ended here today with a decision to set up a
"Balkan Cultural Network."
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, jointly sponsored by the Balkan
Cultural and Economic Center (BCEC) and the Albanian Ministry of
Culture, Youth and Women, was attended by representatives from
Albania, the host country, Greece, Turkey, Macedonia, Yugoslavia,
Bulgaria and Romania.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference was "Balkan culture: experience and
proposals on ways of cooperation and joint actions."
</P>
<P>
Participants shared the view that both problems inherited from
the past and today's existing ones should not obstruct the
cooperation in the Balkan region, and that culture should not be
fettered within a country's territory, but become a bridge
promoting friendly cooperation among peoples.
</P>
<P>
Emmannel Bills, director of the BCBE, said the creation of the
cultural network comes from the common needs of
good-neighborliness and mutual understanding and respect among all
peoples in the region.
</P>
<P>
The network is to help promote cultural exchanges and
cooperation in the Balkans, he added.

SUBIC, Philippines, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Talks that the
18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum is
nothing more than just a talking shop may well be hushed now as
the APEC leaders gathered here today to endorse the trading bloc's
action plan.
</P>
<P>
The 18 leaders arrived early to attend the fourth informal
leadership meeting during which they are to pin down the Manila
Action Plan, which maps out some of the passages for each APEC
member to exert certain efforts for free trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos is to announce later in the
day the Manila Declaration which summarizes the action plan.
</P>
<P>
At its 1994 meeting, APEC set aside two deadlines for trade and
investment liberalization and facilitation.
</P>
<P>
The developed members are required to liberalize their trade
and investment by the year 2010 while the developing ones are
given 10 more years to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
APEC now embraces 16 sovereign states -- Australia, Brunei,
Canada, Chile, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea,
Singapore, Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei joined APEC as regional economies.
</P>
<P>
The group has just decided not to admit new members until 1998.
Vietnam, Peru, Russia, India, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Ecuador,
Colombia, Panama, Macao, Pakistan and Laos have so far expressed
interest in joining the trading bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan, handed over to the APEC leaders late on
Sunday following the senior officials meeting and ministerial
meeting both held last week, comprises individual as well as
collective actions and joint activities in economic and technical
cooperation, all aimed at materializing the Seattle vision.
</P>
<P>
The APEC leaders enunciated a vision of a community of
Asia-Pacific economies in 1993 in Seattle, United States. In the
following year in Bogor, Indonesia, they articulated a goal of
free trade and investment by the years 2010 and 2020 for
industrialized and developing members respectively. They went on
to formulate a blueprint of action agendas last year in Osaka,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Ramos greeted the leaders of the other 17
APEC members in front of the Leaders' Hall at this former U.S.
military base.
</P>
<P>
The participants of today's meeting are Australian Prime
Minister John Howard, Sultan of Brunei Darussalam Haji Hassanal
Bolkiah, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Chilean President
Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Hong Kong
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-Kuen, Indonesian President
Soeharto, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, President of
Republic of Korea Kim Young-sam, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
bin Mohammed, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, New Zealand Prime
Minister James Bolger, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Julius
Chan, Philippine President Ramos, Singaporean Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong, Koo Chen-fu representing Chinese Taipei, Thai Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
At their closed-door meeting after the reception, the leaders
are to discuss trade agreements and plans to establish a free
trade community as well as vital issues affecting the APEC members
right now.
</P>
<P>
Each of the leaders is expected to deliver an address at the
meeting on issues of shared interests.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Ramos is scheduled to read out the Manila
Declaration before the one-day informal leadership meeting
concludes.
</P>
<P>
Canada is to play host to the informal leadership meeting next
year and the annual meeting moves to Malaysia in 1998 and to New
Zealand in 1999.
</P>
<P>
While the APEC leaders are meeting at the free port, thousands
of demonstrators are protesting outside the military base-turned
meeting spot by blocking the one major highway linking it to the
capital city of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators are protesting against the Philippines'
participation in the APEC liberalization and facilitation of trade
and investment, which they said will damage the domestic labor and
merchandise market.
</P>
<P>
Some demonstrators slept in their cars while others cooked
meals in the early hours by roadside as a bumper-to-bumper
motorcade jammed the two-lane highway. The motorcade sprawled for
at least eight kilometers, according to eye-witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Some of the reporters covering the Subic meeting had to be
ferried in by air instead of by car as planned.

SUBIC, Philippines, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President

to reinforce economic and technical cooperation in order to

<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Baishan City in the
hinterland of famous scenic Changbai Mountains, northeast China,
is developing towards its goal of becoming a state-level tourism
city.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Enxiang, secretary of Baishan city committee of the

the Changbai Mountains Nature Reserve, 110,000 hectares, are under
Baishan city's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Baishan city's forest coverage rate stands at 77 percent. Two
years ago, the 17,800-square-kilometer city was designated the
first state-level forest tourism zone in the country.
</P>
<P>
The city has 28 state scenic spots, forest parks and cultural
relics under state protection. It has also opened eight tourism
routes leading to scenic spots on the Changbai Mountains and to
the neighboring DPRK.

designated to receive overseas guests. As a result of the booming
tourism industry, the city has developed more than 300 kinds of
tourism products.

tourism industry, the city also holds a ginseng festival and the
Changbai Mountains' special products trade fair to attract
business people and tourists each year.

million yuan developing 53 tourism projects. A group of tourism
facilities, including hotels and animal and plant museums, are
under preparation or under construction.

<HEADLINE> APEC Informal Leadership Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBIC, Philippines, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the
18 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
gathered here today to endorse the trading bloc's action plan.
</P>
<P>
The APEC leaders arrived early today to attend the fourth
informal leadership meeting during which they are to endorse the
Manila Action Plan.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos is to announce the Manila
Declaration later in the day. The declaration summarizes the
action plan, which maps out some of the passages through which
each APEC member is to exert certain efforts for free trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
APEC has set aside two deadlines in its 1994 meeting for trade
and investment liberalization and facilitation.
</P>
<P>
The developed members are required to liberalize their trade
and investment by the year 2010 while the developing ones are
given 10 more years to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
APEC now embraces 16 sovereign states -- Australia, Brunei,
Canada, Chile, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea,
Singapore, Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei joined APEC as regional economies.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan, handed over to the APEC leaders late on
Sunday following the senior officials meeting and ministerial
meeting both held last week in Manila, comprises individual as
well as collective actions and joint activities in economic and
technical cooperation, all aimed at materializing the Seattle
vision.
</P>
<P>
The APEC leaders enunciated a vision of a community of Asia
Pacific economies in 1993 in Seattle, United States. In the
following year in Bogor, Indonesia, they articulated a goal of
free trade and investment by the years 2010 and 2020 for
industrialized and developing members respectively. They went on
to formulate a blueprint of action agendas last year in Osaka,
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Italian Lira Returns to ERM for Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Italian lira was
readmitted into the exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European
Monetary System (EMS) here today after over four years' absence
from it.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken to help Italy join the future European
Single Currency after the finance ministers or deputies and
central bank governors of the 15 European Union member states had
a "heated" talk of nearly nine hours in Brussels Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, organized by the European Commission (EC), was
decided that the new central rate for the lira, 1906.48 for one
ECU (some 1.3 U.S. dollars), and the intervention obligations of
the EMS relating to it, would apply as of November 25, 1995.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued Sunday, the EU said that the decision
was taken "by mutual agreement, in a common procedure involving
the Commission and the European Monetary Institute, and after
consultation with the Monetary Committee."
</P>
<P>
The ministers, the bank governors and those others who attended
the conference, including EC President Jacques Santer, welcomed
the resumption of the lira's full participation in the ERM, noting
that the decision has strengthened the monetary system.
</P>
<P>
The lira, which was suspended on September 17, 1992, returned
to the ERM in time to avoid speculation at the Tokyo exchange
market Monday, which as a result will possibly deal a
consequential blow to the European monetary market.
</P>
<P>
All other bilateral central rates and intervention rates within
the ERM will remain unchanged, according to the communique.
</P>
<P>
The Italian authorities said on their part that they would be
committed to intensifying their efforts to complete the adjustment
of their economy, adding that the efforts were recently given
expression in the government's budget proposals for 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Three aboriginal chiefs of the
French South Pacific islands of Wallis and Futuna today called on
President Jacques Chirac to send economic aid to their islands in
a 10-year development plan.
</P>
<P>
Chirac today granted a meeting in the Elysee presidential
palace to a delegation of aboriginal leaders from the two islands,
which was the first of its kind in history.
</P>
<P>
Chirac agreed in principle to the drafting of a law on economic
aid to the islands, which should be launched by 1998, the Agence
France Presse (AFP) quoted parliamentary deputy Kamilo Kata from
South Pacific as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are very much comforted by this meeting. The president has
given instructions to the Ministery of Overseas Territories and to
the prefecture (of French Polynesia) to follow very close all what
we have asked about the development," AFP quoted Keleto Lakalaka,
an official of the ruling RPR from the South Pacific, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lakalaka said that Wallis and Futuna were economically backward
when compared with other French South Pacific territories, such as
New Caledonia and French Polynesia.
</P>
<P>
The aboriginal delegation will hold talks with the Delegate
Minister for Overseas Territories, Jean-Jacques de Peretti, on
Monday on aid programs, including the proposal on opening an air
link between the two islands, said French officials.

SARAJEVO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Nato-led Implementation Force
(IFOR) has seized illegal weapons from a police station of the
Muslim-controlled town of Sanski Most in northern Bosnia, local
reports said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of 10 82 mm mortars, 45 rocket-propelled grenades
and other weapons was carried out late Saturday by IFOR's Canadian
troops.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of Dayton peace accords, IFOR is authorized to
seize and destroy any weapons which the former warring factions
fail to register or are deemed as dangerous to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The weapons seized on Saturday were not suitable for police's
tasks, IFOR spokesman Major Brett Boudreau said.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate its strength, IFOR has carried out several
full-blown operations, including the "Operation Volcano" in which
400 tons of unregistered mines and ammunitions were seized from
the Bosnian Serbs and destroyed later over the course of a week in
August.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, IFOR troops raided the headquarters of a
Muslim army brigade for its alleged involvement in a bloody clash
between Muslim refugees and Serb police.
</P>
<P>
The weapons seized from the 254th brigade included hundreds of
machine guns and two armored personnel carriers.

<HEADLINE> French Far Right National Front Knocked Out in City Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The attempt by the French far
right party, National Front (FN), to grasp the mayor's seat of
the city Dreux, 80 kilometers west of Paris, was foiled for a
second time today in the run-off of municipal election there.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing mayor Gerard Hamel, who represented the ruling
rightwing coalition, won 60.63 percent of the votes, against 39.37
percent obtained by Marie-France Stirbois, the FN candidate.
</P>
<P>
The two rivals won almost the same percentage of votes in the
run-off of municipal election of the city in June last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the FN candidate won most of the votes in the first
round of the both elections, and she was prevented from gaining
power by the shifting of votes of leftist supporters to Hamel.
</P>
<P>
Another FN candidate also entered the second round of polling
in the municipal election of the southern city of Gardanne last
month.
</P>
<P>
The continuous rising popularity of the FN, led by 68-year-old
Jean-Marie Le Pen, shows that many French people are disappointed
with the present socio-economic policy of the government.

<HEADLINE> 42 Schools in New York City Listed as Bad Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The New York State Education
Commission has listed 42 schools in the New York City as bad
schools because of their poor performance.
</P>
<P>
The move is regarded as the state's most far-reaching and
aggressive effort yet to force the city's poorly performing
schools to improve their students' achievements. The schools
singled out represent nearly 4 percent of all of the city's public
schools.
</P>
<P>
If these troubled schools do not get better, the state could
force them to close, Commissioner Richard P. Mills was quoted by
the New York Times on Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commissioner has ordered the New York City
School chancellor, Rudy Crew, to take direct control of 42 failing
schools and improve them. His actions could include replacing
principals, changing curriculums and creating several smaller
schools within a large school.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the schools have been on the state's list of
troubled schools for at least three years--some as long a seven
years--and they have not improved enough, according to a report of
the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
Schools are placed on the "watch list" based on the the
percentage of students who do not meet minimum competency
requirements on mathematics, reading or writing test.

<HEADLINE> Belarus's Referendum Valid Results, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The results of the nationwide
referendum being held in Belarus today over constitutional
amendments focusing on power-sharing between the president and the
parliament are valid, a high-ranking Belarus official said.
</P>
<P>
Lidia Yermoshina, acting head of the Central Electoral
Commission, told reporters that over 76 percent of 7.2 million
eligible voters voiced their opinion earlier today on referendum
questions proposed by both President Alexander Lukashenko and the
opposition-dominated parliament.
</P>
<P>
The key question of the referendum are two drafts of the
Belarus Constitution, suggested by Lukashenko and the legislature.
The presidential draft provides for broader power of the head of
state, the parliamentary draft does the opposite.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,751 polling stations were opened at 06:00 local
time (GMT 03:00) and closed at 23:00. Over 50 observers from 16
international organizations and a number of foreign countries
watched the referendum progress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a polling station in Minsk, Lukashenko said that
there will be no anticonstitutional actions on his part regardless
the referendum results, which are expected to become clear on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the parliament, which has been involved in a
confrontation with him over the constitutional amendments for
several months, will not be dissolved. He thinks he himself will
"reach an agreement" with the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Suez Canal Fees for 1997 Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Suez Canal Authority (SCA)
in Egypt announced today that transit dues for 1997 shall remain
unchanged for all types of ships as the tolls enforced since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Suez Canal Authority chief Ahmad Fadel made the announcement
today at a press conference held in port Ismalia, which is on the
midway of the Canal and about 120 kilometers east of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil tankers will enjoy a discount of 5 to 30 percent in
crossing fees for unloaded or loaded vessels of up to 3 million
metric tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a discount of 25 and 35 percent on Suez Canal dues
is to be granted to loaded or unloaded LNG's (liquefied natural
gas).
</P>
<P>
The new tolls are defined according to precise and daily
studies, taking into consideration of keeping the Suez Canal the
cheapest international trade waterway between the east and the
west, said the SCA chairman.
</P>
<P>
The 193 kilometers Canal is the lonest canal in the world
without locks. As the third largest foreign currency earner, it
garnered 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Suez canal is actually the first canal directly linking the
Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. It was opened for international
navigation on November 17, 1879 and Egypt nationalized it on
July 26, 1956.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other waterways, the percentage of accidents is
almost none due to its security measures, according to the SCA
chief.
