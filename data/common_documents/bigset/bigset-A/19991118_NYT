<P>
   Urged by Congress to get tough on abuse of taxpayers, a new team
of Treasury agents plans a sharp increase in investigations of
Internal Revenue Service employees for misconduct _ anything from
harassing taxpayers to theft. Indeed, the number of cases expected
to be opened against IRS employees will soon nearly equal the
number of cases against Americans suspected of tax crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The new Treasury inspector general for tax affairs has set a
goal for the fiscal year that began last month that would increase
by half the number of IRS workers who will be investigated, and he
plans to increase the goal by at least 25 percent more the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS goal has stirred worries even within the inspector
general's own staff that investigators are being forced to search
for far more misdeeds than may exist, will waste time on trivia and
will be pressured to trump up cases.
</P>
<P>
   IRS managers and union leaders say the intensified scrutiny will
distract many IRS agents as they defend themselves, making the
agency less potent in pursuing tax cheats. Such distractions,
following years of cuts by Congress in the ranks of auditors and
tax collectors, are one reason the IRS plans to slash audit rates
by a third next year.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts are coming even as a growing number of Americans are
using aggressive tactics to avoid paying taxes. Some are taking
advantage of new rules intended to protect taxpayers from
overzealous IRS workers and others are betting that with a shortage
of auditors and collectors, no one will pursue them.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the stepped-up efforts say they are important
to prevent abuses by IRS agents. ``The intention of the new office
and the new law is not a witch hunt, but to ensure that IRS
employees and taxpayers are treated civilly and that problems are
reviewed by an independent oversight entity,'' said Sen. William
Roth Jr., R-Del., who sponsored legislation that created the
inspector general's office last year.
</P>
<P>
   If the goals are met, 5,000 IRS employees, or nearly one in 28,
will be investigated in the next fiscal year for suspected
misconduct _ anything from harassing taxpayers to theft.
</P>
<P>
   Among front-line tax workers, like auditors and tax collectors,
the numbers are even more stark. As many as 1 in 9 will be
investigated. By comparison, inspectors general will investigate
fewer than 1 in 2,000 workers at the Agriculture Department and the
Health and Human Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 235 misconduct investigations have been completed, of
which 161, or about 68 percent, were found to lack merit. In 33
cases, or 14 percent, some form of misconduct was found; in most
cases employees failed to pay their own taxes or threatened a
taxpayer with an audit. In 20 cases, misconduct was found that did
not involve taxpayers; the remaining 21 cases involved non-IRS
employees, such as people impersonating tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The misconduct investigations are only one issue vexing the IRS.
Senior IRS executives, meeting in Washington last month, expressed
their own worries that the agency barely had the minimum resources
to maintain compliance.
</P>
<P>
   These officials attributed this to fallout from the IRS Reform
and Restructuring Act of 1998, which created the inspector
general's office as a unit of the Treasury Department with the
understanding that it would aggressively pursue complaints of
wrongdoing against IRS employees at all levels. That law mandates
the firing of IRS workers who commit any of 10 acts, some of which
employees say are part of their routine duties. For example, the
law mandates firing any tax worker who harasses a taxpayer, and tax
collectors say the standard is so broad that they can be discharged
if they go to a store to collect taxes owed by the owner and
customers witness the effort.
</P>
<P>
   IRS employees are ``walking on eggshells'' out of fear they will
be investigated, disciplined or even fired just for doing their
jobs, the official summary of the meetings said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner of Internal Revenue, Charles Rossotti, said he
does not share the concern of many of his executives about the
degree of scrutiny. ``It is critical that every allegation of
misconduct be investigated,'' he said in a statement, ``and in the
relatively small percentage of cases where misconduct has actually
occurred, employees should be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   David C. Williams, the inspector general, said his goals of
4,000 new cases this year and 5,000 next year are not quotas,
although he acknowledged that many of his own special agents were
skeptical, partly because one regional office did assign specific
numbers of cases to individual inspectors. Williams reversed that
directive.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the cases involve IRS workers. About 1,600 cases a year
involve people who have, for example, threatened or attacked IRS
employees.
</P>
<P>
   But in separate interviews, nine special agents in the inspector
general's office said they were told to press misconduct cases
after they had concluded they lacked merit and that managers seemed
fearful of dropping any investigation for fear of missing some
wrongdoing, however minor. But one special agent said inspections
were not aggressive enough. None of the 10 would speak without
being assured anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Quigley, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers
Association unit representing the Treasury inspector general's 445
special agents, praised Williams for his leadership, but said the
goals trouble investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numerical goals may allow the possibility of abuse, by
overzealous agents and by overzealous managers,'' Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators also think they are wasting time pursuing
harassment complaints that clearly lack merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already seen spurious allegations made that, in the
opinion of the investigators, were designed to thwart the
administration of the tax laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Williams, in e-mail to his staff, emphasized ``major cases and
high impact work,'' which is ``the most important element in
expressing our value to our stakeholders in Congress and the
Treasury.''
</P>
<P>
   That language has alarmed the National Treasury Employees Union,
which represents most IRS workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference between a goal and a quota?'' asked
Colleen Kelley, the union's president.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Frank Heffler, head of the union's New York chapter, said
anonymous accusations of minor misconduct, like leaving work early,
are treated as major cases. ``Your neighbors are asked if you are a
drug user or an alcoholic and your tax return is pulled,'' he said,
``so instead of finding people who aren't paying their taxes, you
are defending yourself from a charge that could have been proven
false in a minute by just looking at your time report.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Paul C. Light, who has studied inspectors general and is
director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington research organization, said the goal of 4,000 cases
``seems to me investigation run amok.''
</P>
<P>
   Light said he found it ``ironic that the very thing that sparked
creation of the IRS' inspector generalship, the setting of
arbitrary quotas on property seizures and the like, is now being
applied to the IRS itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the ``chance of someone filing a false allegation
to cause trouble is present and can be substantial from time to
time, and we do our best to find those and to make sure that no
harm comes to the person who is falsely accused.'' He added, ``We
now are receiving large numbers of allegations that are untrue and
we do factor that in and we understand that we have to be there for
the ones that are true.''

CABBY IS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO TAKE 2 WOMEN PASSENGERS CAPTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a time when many cabdrivers are worried about
being fined for not picking people up, one driver was arrested
Wednesday and charged with refusing to let his passengers go.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the cabby, Akhtar Bajwa, twice in the past few
weeks tried to kidnap women who hailed his taxi in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, on Nov. 2, the authorities said, Bajwa sped off
to Queens with a 30-year-old woman he had picked up at East 47th
Street and Third Avenue. The woman had asked to be dropped off at
her home on Manhattan's Upper East Side. But the police said Bajwa
refused to stop, ignoring the woman's screams, and drove across the
Queensboro Bridge. Once in Queens, the woman was able to escape
when the cab was forced to stop in traffic, the police said. She
provided the police with the driver's hack license and the police
began to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks later, on Monday, a 26-year-old woman got into
Bajwa's cab at West 47th Street and Sixth Avenue, en route to her
home on the East Side of Manhattan about 10:45 p.m., the police
said. This time he pulled over at Madison Avenue and East 40th
Street. Then, investigators said, he got out of the car and into
the back seat, where he tried to tie the woman's hands with a
scarf. But she broke away, slid across the back seat and ran out
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Neither woman was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The second woman was able to copy down the license plate number
of the cab and she called the Taxi and Limousine Commission on
Tuesday. Investigators said an alert clerk there, Alma Johnson,
remembered that detectives had called in several days earlier
looking for help in identifying the driver in a similar incident.
Ms. Johnson put the woman in touch with Detective Louis Donofrio of
the 17th Precinct, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time investigators arrived at the garage where Bajwa
leased his cab, he was already out driving a 12-hour shift. A
description of the cab was given to patrol units, and at about
12:35 a.m. Wednesday, officers from the Manhattan Street Crime Unit
spotted Bajwa's vehicle in Lower Manhattan and pulled him over.
</P>
<P>
   Bajwa, 45, of Brooklyn, was awaiting arraignment Wednesday night
on one charge of kidnapping and one of attempted kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Bajwa has been a licensed cabdriver for at least five years.
Investigators said he did not have a criminal record, although he
had been cited for driving without a license in March 1998. A
spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Allan J. Fromberg,
said Bajwa's taxi license has been suspended, pending the outcome
of the kidnapping cases.

WILLIAMS AND DAVENPORT NEED THREE SETS TO GAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES thruout with Williams win) 
(rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All systems appeared to be go for a scintillating
Chase Championships debut by Venus Williams. Her college homework
was up to date, there was no threat of another sibling uprising by
her younger sibling, Serena, the injured and absent U.S. Open
champion, and Venus' perforated blue tennis dress harmonized with
Madison Square Garden's interior as if they had been professionally
dyed to match.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that but the father/coach, Richard Williams, was calmly
chomping his toothpick on the sidelines, and Venus' veteran
opponent, Conchita Martinez, was nursing a nagging backache and a
nagging suspicion that Williams' firepower might be more than she
felt like handling at the end of another long year, Martinez's 12th
in tennis harness. Martinez forced Williams to struggle before
falling 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Something about the novelty of her first encounter with
Williams, clearly the people's choice with superior celebrity
drawing power, affected Martinez like a noseful of smelling salts.
She rallied after dropping the first set and struck the final ace
of the seesawing second set. Then, just when it seemed as if
Williams, who apparently had not studied Martinez along with her
schoolwork, was going to ride a 4-2 third set lead directly to the
finish line, Martinez insinuated herself back into the thick of
things by forcing an errant backhand from Williams at break point
of the seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams refused to be flustered by the Spaniard's
persistence, broke straight back for a 5-4 edge and earned a match
point when Martinez slashed a backhand volley just wide of the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was obviously hitting the ball better than she usually
hits it in other matches,'' Williams said about Martinez, whose
down-the-line passes rarely missed their target. The Spaniard's
crafty interplay of topspin line drives and off-pace floaters, the
ingredients that obtained her the 1994 Wimbledon crown at the
expense of Martina Navratilova, yanked Williams around the court
like a fish on a line.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, it was back to basics for Lindsay Davenport and Amelie
Mauresmo, a Chase ingenue thanks to a season that began with a
breakthrough run to the Australian Open final.
</P>
<P>
   They put aside their checkered past, that awkward January moment
when the disgruntled Davenport reacted to her semifinal surrender
to the then 29th-ranked Frenchwoman by accusing Mauresmo of hitting
the ball like a person of the wrong gender to be performing on the
WTA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport made peace by quickly penning a private note of
apology and publicly praised Mauresmo's rippling one-handed
backhand and rippling musculature as a strength and a weapon, not a
curiosity. By the time the hard-hitting duo hit the court Wednesday
night, their rivalry was evenly proportioned at 2-2, and the
second-seeded Davenport made it clear she didn't take this opponent
lightly. But she took awhile to demonstrate it.
</P>
<P>
   After an ineffectual opening set, where Mauresmo surged out to a
3-0 lead, Davenport, hobbled by a sore left thigh incurred in a
finals victory against Hingis on Sunday at Philadelphia, seemed
disinclined to play catch-up until Mauresmo served for the set at
5-1. Then Davenport, the defending Wimbledon champion, inflicted a
3-6, 6-3, 6-2 reversal of fortune on her challenger. ``Oh, it's
sore,'' Davenport said of her leg. ``But what can you do. It's the
end of the year. I'm not dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampered by a recurring wrist injury, Davenport admitted she had
been on the verge of calling it a year two weeks ago. ``But I
didn't want it to end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The morning match, watched by 2,000 customers, not all of them
paying, produced an upset: 17th-ranked Anke Huber, a 1995 Chase
finalist who barely squeaked into this year's event, ousted her
best friend, ninth-seeded Julie Halard-Decugis, 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Next for Huber is Davenport. ``Against Lindsay, I lost the last,
I don't know, five, six, seven times,'' Huber said. ``But now it
doesn't matter. I'll try to do my best. I played eight weeks in a
row, but I'm still alive and I'm trying.
</P>
<P>
   Huber reached a career-high fourth in the ranking five years ago
but has battled recurring injuries, and recurring ennui, in the
interim.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Rockets had just been blown out by the Dallas Mavericks, of all
teams. They had shot worse from the field and the line than they
had all season. They had allowed 37 fast-break points, 18 more than
in any other game. Point guard Steve Francis had been ejected in
the second quarter. They had fallen to 2-7.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich warned, things would get
tough.
</P>
<P>
   He said this to explain the importance of maintaining faith that
things can turn around. But typical of the Rockets' season, no
matter how dark it has been, fate seems to pull down the shade a
little further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys after the game, believe it or not, it's going
to get tougher,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I'm going to stick with this.
I still believe in them, still like them. For the breakthrough to
come, we have to be together.''
</P>
<P>
   After facing the 7-2 Sacramento Kings tonight, the Rockets play
six of their next seven games on the road. The one home game is
against the Mavericks, whose rout stretched their winning streak
against the Rockets to three games, including two straight at
Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   There was good news Wednesday: Francis was fined $5,000 for
Tuesday's takedown of Dirk Nowitzki but escaped a suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Tomjanovich made his renewed plea for unity in the
face of adversity, the message did seem to have been received.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work together and stay in there,'' Rockets center
Hakeem Olajuwon said. ``When everybody doubts us, we can do it.
When everybody criticizes us, we can do it. But we have to work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that well-intended sentiment, however, is that
it remains only a starting point. Two weeks into the season, the
Rockets remain in the starting blocks.
</P>
<P>
   They have, however, made progress.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich drew up a new play for Tuesday and, without a day to
practice, added it to the repertoire. It worked. He ran plays that
had been all but shelved. They worked. The Rockets looked for open
shooters and found them. They made the extra pass to get the ball
inside.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rockets still suffered their worst defeat of the season
by finding new areas in need of repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even teams that have been together do that,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``Not shooting the ball well is one thing. Then we're making
mistakes, little mental mistakes, that are costly. Right now, our
margin for error is so small, the mistakes are costing us games.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the mistakes that have hurt them, the Rockets have
reduced their chances to fourth-quarter make-or-break moments by
shooting terribly.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets are shooting just 42.2 percent from the field. They
rank 26th in the NBA in scoring, 22nd in field-goal percentage and
26th in 3-point percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is not all about shooting, but we've historically
been a high-percentage shooting team, especially when you factor in
3-pointers,'' Tomjanovich said. ``This year we're not even close.
Our regular shooting percentage is way down. Guys are in the low
40s. Guys are!y~ l!

JAZZ DEFEAT KNICKS, 98-90
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Since 1992 the New York Knicks have resolved to
leave with a victory. Innumerable players and lineups and three
different coaches have failed.
</P>
<P>
   When the Knicks look cross court at Karl Malone, the mammoth,
6-foot-9-inch, 256-pound power forward, they cringe. He may be 36,
but he still can dip his shoulder and mow them over.
</P>
<P>
   Malone scored 33 points on Wednesday night, making 13 of 15 free
throws and quelling every Knick run with a huge jump shot. His
partner in time, John Stockton, added 17 points, 11 assists and all
the hip checks imaginable as Utah knocked the wind out of New York,
98-90, at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz finally found some consistency in its game after a 3-3
start, parlaying its victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Monday
into another victory over a National Basketball Association
finalist. Utah once led by 20 and never completely let the Knicks
back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jeff Van Gundy's up-and-down team fell to 5-5 with
three games left on their Western Conference swing. They play the
Suns in Phoenix on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz and Knicks, two physical teams presumed to have trouble
adapting to the league's new rules, were whistled for more than 60
fouls. Utah lulled the Knicks into a wrestling match, and New York
took the bait, growing angry and finally disenchanted.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Knicks complained about Malone's receiving his
share of calls. The Knicks were whistled for 31 personal fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs left the game with 7 minutes 5 seconds remaining
when he collided with Stockton while crossing midcourt. He suffered
a laceration over his right eye and retreated to the locker room to
receive four stitches.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe for losing to Utah is time-tested by now for New
York: when the Knicks take their sweet time getting back on defense
and use their hands instead of moving their feet on defense, they
fall off of the map of upper-echelon teams.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell scored from nearly every angle, keeping the
Knicks in the game with 24 points. He made pull-up jump shots and a
monstrous dunk through the middle of the Jazz defense with less
than six minutes left. Yet with Allan Houston in foul trouble and
no one else able to assert himself on offense, it was not going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks put together a 12-4 run to creep within 6 points to
begin the fourth quarter. Larry Johnson's spinning layup around
Bryon Russell made the score, 77-71, and momentarily hushed the
vociferous crowd of 18,890.
</P>
<P>
   It was not so much that Sprewell found his range _ he did,
scoring 8 points in the fourth after a 4-for-13 start _ or that the
Knicks began to do something on offense other than settle for
20-foot jump shots. In the final minutes, they played defense as if
they cared, with Kurt Thomas and Johnson battling Malone inside and
the backcourt refusing to let the Utah guards beat them backdoor.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the Knicks could accomplish late, though, did
little to make up for how awful they looked in the beginning. Utah
opened with a flurry. With Stockton swiveling heads by whipping the
ball to open teammates, the Jazz made its first 10 shots and did
not miss until the Kentucky rookie Scott Padgett misfired inside
with 5:45 left in the opening quarter. Utah led by 19 in the first
quarter and 20 in the second, getting easy baskets while the Knicks
fell asleep in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow starts have been our downfall all season,'' Marcus Camby
said. ``We can't seem to pinpoint it. We've got to come out with
heart and effort. We weren't even getting back on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing that badly that early is an ill-advised thing for an
opposing team to do in the Delta Center. The rowdies start making
noise, the home team catches fire and before you look up, the game
is over.
</P>
<P>
   Houston could hardly help his teammates. He picked up his third
foul with 10:42 into the second period, played only seven minutes
in the half and attempted just three shots.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Knicks tried to get back in the game, they did it
by resorting to one-on-one forays. Sprewell, Marcus Camby and John
Wallace did their best to create scoring opportunities, but there
was little rhythm or symmetry to how the Knicks were playing. They
could never quite come all the way back, having dug themselves a
gaping hole the size of nearby Bryce Canyon.

   A suit accusing a shopping mall in suburban Buffalo, N.Y., of
causing a teenager's death through racist transportation practices
ended abruptly Wednesday with a settlement of $2.55 million.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved Cynthia N. Wiggins, a 17-year-old black
resident of Buffalo, who had taken a city bus to get to her job at
the mall's food court in December 1995. Because the mall had banned
city buses on some routes from dropping passengers on its property,
Ms. Wiggins had to cross a busy seven-lane highway, where she was
hit and crushed by a dump truck.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, the Wiggins family and other members of the
African-American community accused the mall, Walden Galleria in
Cheektowaga, of trying to use the highway as a moat to exclude some
city residents from the mall. The high-profile trial, which began
Nov. 8, was expected to build into an emotional affair, brimming
with images of racism.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, lawyers for both sides announced that the mall's
owner, Pyramid Companies of Syracuse, would pay $2 million of the
$2.55 million settlement, over time, to Ms. Wiggins' son, who is
now 4. It did not admit any wrongdoing. The Niagara Frontier
Transportation Authority, which operates the bus line, agreed to
pay $300,000; and the truck driver, John P. Bunch, agreed to pay
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we were winning,'' said Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who
represented the Wiggins family. ``But in the end, I think everyone
felt that it was time for a healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this trial had gone to a verdict, no side would have won,
and it certainly would have gone to an appeal,'' said Albert J.
D'Aquino, a Galleria lawyer. ``The judge felt that it would be a
divisive issue in the community.'' Both sides praised the judge,
Justice Jerome C. Gorski of state Supreme Court, for helping to
forge the settlement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before that happened, Cochran had begun to portray Ms. Wiggins'
story as one of frustration and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   On a dismal December day, with snow drifts of up to eight feet
high, Ms. Wiggins had boarded the Route 6 metro bus for the ride
from Buffalo's predominantly black and low-income east side to the
Galleria. Because the mall excluded Route 6 buses from its
property, Ms. Wiggins got off at an intersection with no crosswalks
or pedestrian signals, seven lanes of highway away from the mall.
</P>
<P>
   She made it past six lanes before she was struck. The truck
driver, Bunch, said that he never saw Ms. Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
   Later, officials from the Transportation Authority revealed that
they had, over several years, repeatedly asked the mall to allow
the bus onto the premises but that the mall had always refused,
fearful of rambunctious youths. Then, Cochran and numerous
organizations in Buffalo began to question why the Route 6 bus was
forbidden while charter buses were not.
</P>
<P>
   In response, defense lawyers said that bus passengers had always
had the option to transfer onto a bus that stopped closer to the
mall. They said that the Galleria, which is private property, was
not required to accommodate public transportation. And they noted
that Ms. Wiggins was jaywalking when she was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Ms. Wiggins' death, the mall changed its bus
policy, following the threat of a boycott by local civil rights
groups and the Buffalo teachers' union.

GALAXY'S MISSION: STOP EL DIABLO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder Danny Pena
remained quiet during Sunday's lunch at the Staples Center's Fox
Sports Sky Bar, concentrating on watching the wizardry of D.C.
United's Marco Etcheverry on television.
</P>
<P>
   Etcheverry dissected Columbus' defense, which set up three goals
and scored another to lead United to a 4-0 rout of the Crew in the
deciding game of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorizing MLS defenses is nothing new to the man known as ``El
Diablo'' in his native Bolivia _ a nickname given to him by his
brother-in-law for dribbling as if he's possessed by the devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they say, big players make big plays and the money players
play when it really counts,'' said United coach Thomas Rongen of
Etcheverry. ``Not just against Columbus, but throughout the year,
he is a great captain and leader for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Etcheverry goes, so goes United. His service to front-runners
Roy Lassiter and fellow Bolivian Jaime Moreno is the best in the
business. His 17 assists this year matched the Galaxy's Mauricio
Cienfuegos, but Etcheverry's deadly left foot on free kicks
provides another weapon to his arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   This is why many consider the 1997 MLS Most Valuable Player the
best player in Major League Soccer's four-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Set plays are a reflection of who's serving the ball and you
got one of the best in the game serving the ball in Marco
Etcheverry,'' said the Galaxy's Paul Caligiuri. ``And he's just so
smart. He will pick you apart if you let him.''
</P>
<P>
   Why was Pena observing Etcheverry so closely? Because he's the
one who will be asked to man-mark Etcheverry in Sunday's MLS
championship in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put any more pressure on myself than is
already expected,'' said Pena. ``He's not a player you can stop for
90 minutes. He's a player that, hopefully, I can contain for the
majority of the time and hopefully limit the service he's capable
of giving to his front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big part of their team, there's no doubt about that.
But I feel if I can do my job, 60 or 70 minutes of keeping him
under control, it's going to make the other guys on United have to
work a little bit harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too many have been successful containing Etcheverry, but
Pena is arguably the best man-marker in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one answer we have had for the last three years is Danny
Pena,'' said Caligiuri. ``He has been our one midfield general when
it comes to man-marking other teams' playmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about Danny, he really steps up to the
challenge and down deep I know he's relishing this chance in such a
big game. He really has a blue-collar work ethic and you're not
going to get a better performance out of a different player than
Pena.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we've always said we have the best defense in the
league, plus Danny Pena.''
</P>
<P>
   Etcheverry is a master at dragging man-markers around and
spinning them to the turf. He can split your vision and is
impossible to stop if given space to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to try and make him go backwards,'' said Pena. ``He's
not a player that you're going to swipe the ball away from as often
as you like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to stay by his side and not allow him to face the goal
where he can place those services up top.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have to be careful when I get near him, because he's a
player that get's a lot of fouls called (in his favor) from
referees.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a concern for Schmid. In the 1996 final, United scored
all three of its goals on set plays to beat the Galaxy 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players like him definitely have a bonus in this league,''
said Schmid. ``If he falls over, the chances of the whistle being
blown is much greater than if Clint Mathis falls over in the same
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it is everywhere else in the world with the
league's best players. So with Etcheverry, you just have to do a
good job of standing him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, who was in D.C. when United beat Columbus, said it might
take more than just the work of Pena to slow Etcheverry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbus' defending on Etcheverry was not very good,'' said
Schmid. ``They gave him too much space. We may have to mark him
zonally with Roy (Myers), Ezra (Hendrickson) and Clint (Mathis)
picking him up at times. Marco likes to pop deep and wide into
different places. You always have to be aware of him.''

PISTONS NIP NETS, 109-107 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ The New Jersey Nets looked across the
basketball court on Wednesday night and saw a vulnerable cast of
underachievers not unlike themselves. A talented yet somewhat
desperate club, the Detroit Pistons provided a grand opportunity
for the Nets to instill life into their dying season.
</P>
<P>
   And with seven seconds remaining, the chance for a small revival
was there. With the Nets trailing by 2 points, Stephon Marbury, the
hottest shooter on the floor, received an inbound pass from Johnny
Newman and began driving to the basket from the right wing. He went
airborne, met with Detroit's Christian Laettner and powered a layup
over Laettner's outstretched arms. The ball caromed off the rim.
Jamie Feick tipped it fruitlessly toward the basket, then Elliot
Perry grabbed the rebound and took a shot that was blocked by Grant
Hill. The buzzer sounded and the chance was lost. The Nets, losers
in their previous three games, fell again, 109-107, at the Palace.
</P>
<P>
   They are 1-7 heading into Friday's game against Boston and will
play five of their next six games on the road. While Coach Don
Casey talked about the positives _ his club's 47 percent shooting
and its ability to stay close throughout _ Feick, the blunt
forward/center who complained on Tuesday about being removed from
the starting lineup, again chose not to mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit was in the same position as us,'' said Feick, who was
contrite about his previous outburst, after grabbing a team-high 11
rebounds off the bench. ``They needed a win. We needed a win.
There's no excuse. We had it in our hands. We should have pulled it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to praise the Nets for their offensive fluidity
because Detroit (3-6) has one of the worst defenses in the league.
The Pistons entered allowing 107.3 points a game, second most in
the league, and allowing opponents to shoot 46 percent from the
floor. They were also coming off a tough, hard-fought loss in
Toronto. Pistons Coach Alvin Gentry did not hide what this victory
meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Super Bowl for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though, like the Nets, Detroit lacks a legitimate center, it was
hard to tell on Wednesday night. Casey had replaced Feick with the
7-foot-1-inch Jim McIlvaine for added defensive post presence, but
the Nets were destroyed in the paint, being outscored, 70-20.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets received strong performances from Marbury and Van Horn
(season-high 30 points, 9 rebounds). Marbury led all scorers with
35 points, including 24 in the second half and 10 in the fourth
quarter. He made six of eight 3-point attempts, gave out seven
assists and, after the Nets fell behind by 107-101 with 2 minutes
20 seconds remaining, made a 3-pointer to keep his team hopeful.
Van Horn followed with a foul shot.
</P>
<P>
   Laettner, who supported Grant Hill's 32-point performance with
20 points and 10 rebounds, answered with a driving layup and then
Marbury made a nice steal and layup to cut the deficit to 2 points
with 30 seconds left. Marbury was visibly miffed before making his
theft, as he thought he had been fouled on the previous trip
downcourt. The Nets followed with a stop of Jerry Stackhouse, which
set the stage for Marbury's near basket at the end. There was
definitely contact on Marbury's shot over Laettner, and Marbury
wondered after the game where the new no-touch rules had gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand the rules,'' Marbury said. ``It goes in
your favor the first, second and third quarters, but then at the
end of the game it's like, `We're going back to the old style.' I
was trying to score. There was contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who was visibly despondent before, during and after
Monday's loss to Seattle, entered the Palace with newfound joy.
Instead of focusing on the poor play by him and his team, he looked
at the big picture, smiled and said: ``I feel great. I have a great
life.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this season, Van Horn played the way he is
supposed to. He hit six of his first eight shots in scoring 13
first-quarter points as the Nets took a 35-25 lead. He had 20
points by halftime as the Nets held a 61-57 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn thought the Nets lost the game in the third quarter,
though, when their offensive execution and ball movement reverted
back to one-on-one play, and Detroit outscored them, 32-26, to take
the lead for good.

CONGRESS AGREES WITH WHITE HOUSE ON SPENDING CUTS
</HEADLINE>
  (UPDATES thruout with bill being worked out, prospects of bill in
Senate. REPLACES NIRELAND-TALKS as lede in paper) 
(rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Republican leaders in Congress
agreed in principle Wednesday to an across-the-board spending cut
to seal a deal on the overdue federal budget, then, after grappling
all day over how to make that cut, prepared to shake hands on it.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. C.W.
Bill Young, R-Fla., said he was ``filing the bill tonight,'' the
minute White House officials finished checking its fine print.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed in principle Wednesday morning on the last
piece of the puzzle: an across-the-board budget cut of 0.38
percent, out of about $610 billion in spending for federal
agencies. Then they argued all day about how to perform that fiscal
microsurgery, which would yield close to $1.3 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Their dispute was ``like when you go to buy a house, and you've
agreed on the price, and all that's left is a disagreement over the
color of the trim on the tool shed,'' said Robert Stevenson, a
senior aide to Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who is chairman of the
Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   While passage of the final bill by the House is expected to be
routine, another fight threatens it in the Senate. That involved a
battle over federal price controls for dairy farmers, an issue so
crucial to the combatants that they are threatening to shut down
the Senate, block any final budget bill and keep Congress in
session well into December.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., has placed a formal hold on the final
spending package in an effort to protect his state's 23,000 dairy
farmers from legislation favoring Northeastern milk producers.
</P>
<P>
   The budget cannot pass, and Congress cannot adjourn, until he
lifts that hold. That is because the legislation he opposes is in
the final spending package that will be filed in the House, voted
on and most likely passed on Thursday, before going to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to take the dairy out'' of the spending bill, said
the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. ``It will
blow it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lew, the White House budget director, said the dairy
dispute was so dire that it ``raises a real risk of a government
shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   This looming problem dismays many members of Congress. When the
House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, began talking
about it on the House floor Wednesday, members began to moo.
</P>
<P>
   The day's war of words began when the House speaker, Dennis
Hastert of Illinois, said President Clinton had agreed in a
telephone call from Turkey to an across-the-board cut of 0.38
percent in the budget, which is now 47 days overdue.
</P>
<P>
   That cut was a political do-or-die issue for the Republicans,
but only part of the financial solution. The final piece was
agreeing on how to impose it.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, representatives and White House aides coming and
going through the Senate's corridors for the negotiations looked
exhausted after 10 nearly nonstop days of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders were pressing them hard to finish their work
without spending more money. ``If I were king, I would have their
heads all cut off,'' the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was seeking every last new dollar it could
extract from Congress before shaking hands, including $100 million
for a program for disabled workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans needed nearly $7 billion in savings to allow
them to say that their spending bills would not dip into Social
Security surpluses _ a political point they have made daily, since
spring, but still have not formally fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The money would ``help them fill the hole they created'' with
new programs they wanted, along with new spending the White House
fought for and won, Lew said. So the White House brought nearly $7
billion to the bargaining table Wednesday, enough to cover the
Republicans demands without an across-the-board cut.
</P>
<P>
   Up to $3.5 billion would come from a one-time transfer from the
Federal Reserve's portfolio of government securities _ a strictly
bookkeeping device, since the money belongs to the government to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The rest would come from delaying government paychecks for
military personnel and many civilian employees for about 48 hours,
until just after 12:01 a.m. next Oct. 1, the start of the next
fiscal year. This would not actually save any money, but simply
shift more than $3.2 billion in spending into next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals remained in the final package, along with the
across-the-board cut. Both sides agreed to exclude military
personnel from the cut. Then came the stumbling block: how to
impose the $1.3 billion cut.
</P>
<P>
   The argument was over who would control the budget-cutting
scalpel, what programs could be protected and which ones could take
deep cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides described this as an issue of ``flexibility.'' Two
weeks ago, Clinton vetoed a 0.97 percent across-the-board cut that
Congress passed, almost exclusively with Republican votes, calling
it a ``blind'' and ``mindless'' exercise.
</P>
<P>
   To make such a cut seem sensible to Democrats, the White House
insisted on more flexibility to protect some programs from cuts.
</P>
<P>
   An across-the-board cut was a matter of principle for the
party's conservatives in the House, who wore big buttons on their
lapels Wednesday saying they had ``stopped the raid on Social
Security.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just as important to two Democratic senators are demands for
their home states.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia is threatening to filibuster
the final spending bills to protect his state's coal miners from a
federal court ruling barring them from dumping in valley streams.
Byrd has drafted last-minute legislation that would stop the court
ruling from taking effect for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The White House first supported Byrd's effort on behalf of his
state, then said it would veto any bill containing it. It appeared
to be striking a noncommital stance on the issue Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Kohl and the dairy dispute. It threatens the final
budget bill, containing five of the year's 13 spending measures in
a $390 billion package.
</P>
<P>
   This year the House approved a measure that lets a system
keeping the price of milk in New England artificially high to
remain in place for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has placed a hold on every piece of legislation pending in
the Senate, including the budget bill, to stop that measure from
becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw politics _ that's what originated it, and that's what
keeps it going,'' Kohl said in an interview Wednesday. He promised
to ``do everything I can'' to keep the cartel from being extended.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a provision of a 1996 farm bill that allowed the
formation of a cartel, called the Northeast Dairy Compact, which
puts a floor on the price of milk in the six New England states. It
keeps milk from Midwestern dairies out of New England, protecting
hundreds if not thousands of dairy farmers from those states.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl calls it ``diametrically opposed to everything this country
stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Authority for the cartel expired on Sept. 30, though a judge's
order has kept the pricing mechanism in place temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   In September the House voted, 285-140, to extend the system.
Then Hastert and Lott agreed this week to attach a two-year
extension of the cartel to one of the final spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The milk issue is ``all about economic self-interest,''
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said last month. Now it will be
decided in the closing hours of this Congress.

MORTON SAYS PREDICTION WAS MEANT TO FIRE UP TROJANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC tailback Chad Morton said he doesn't mind that
UCLA coach Bob Toledo is using him as motivational fodder, after
Morton predicted last summer that the Trojans would finally end
their losing streak against the Bruins at eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably have my face on a dartboard,'' Morton said.
``That's just part of football and college excitement. It's all
just fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton said his prediction was important for his teammates to
hear, even if it offended UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a big difference to our team to hear
`We're going to do it' instead of `We hope we do it,' '' Morton
said. ``It puts a little pressure on us and that's what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Professor Fox: Two weeks ago, quarterback John Fox started
working as a student-teacher at Edison Elementary school in
Glendale, but it wasn't until this week that his first-graders
finally realized who he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really surprised,'' Fox said. ``One of the kids came
up and said, `You didn't tell us you played soccer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ Simmons doubtful: Hackett said cornerback Antuan Simmons will
probably miss the game after back spasms forced him to spend
Tuesday and Wednesday nights at USC University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``His back is hurting him,'' Hackett said. ``Antuan Simmons is
out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But later, Hackett said, ``I'm kind of hoping he can play. He's
very doubtful.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons played 72 plays against Washington State, despite
hurting his back early last week.
</P>
<P>
   Without Simmons, 5-foot-8 freshman Darrell Rideaux would start.
After the Washington State game, Hackett joked about Rideaux's
pass-interference penalty that allowed the Cougars to have an extra
play after time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a guy who was 3-feet tall on a guy who was 8-feet
tall,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   So what would he think of Rideaux matching up against 6-4 Danny
Farmer of UCLA? ``We'll have to stack two guys on top of each
other,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lewis commits: Linebacker Traison Lewis of Rancho Cucamonga
High has orally committed to USC. Lewis (6-2, 231 pounds) was also
considering Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   He is rated as one of PrepStar magazine's Top 30 players in the
West. Lewis is the 10th player to commit to USC.
</P>
<P>
   __ Soward will rest: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward did not
practice Wednesday and will sit out today's practice to rest his
strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea (how much he'll play),'' Hackett said.
``He had a little setback Tuesday. Let's shut him down and wait
until Saturday. I expect him to make some big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Antoine Harris, who also has a strained hamstring, is
expected to start.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Egyptian government Wednesday escalated its
condemnation of U.S. officials investigating the EgyptAir crash,
saying that, by focusing suspicion on a backup pilot, they were
rushing to judgment about the cause. Egypt's principal spokesman
said that a statement attributed to a relief pilot in the cockpit
was being misinterpreted and did not show that he was about to
commit suicide by sending the plane into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism came as a federal official said that aviation
investigators were unsure of the significance of the utterance, in
Arabic, by the relief pilot as captured on the cockpit voice
recorder in the seconds before the Boeing 767 crashed into the sea,
killing all 217 on board.
</P>
<P>
   The chief spokesman for the Egyptian government, Nabil Osman,
said in a telephone interview in Cairo that the words that
investigators believe had been uttered by the relief pilot, Gameel
el-Batouty, was a Muslim prayer ``said in a time of crisis when a
person is facing a difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this prayer would never be said in terms of suicide,''
Osman said. ``It's definitely not to be said by someone who is
going to commit suicide, because suicide is against Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. investigators said Wednesday that despite confusion
about the Arabic phrase, they are still persuaded by information
from the voice and data recorders recovered from the ocean floor
that Batouty may have tried to crash the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said that they believed the cockpit's voice
recorders provided evidence that it was Batouty uttering an Arabic
expression that has been translated as ``I put my trust in God.''
</P>
<P>
   At Egypt's request, the U.S. government has delayed a decision
to label the inquiry a criminal investigation and to turn it over
to the FBI. James Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said that more study of the cockpit voice recorder
and data recorder was needed. The crash, U.S. officials said, was a
devastating blow to Egyptian pride. In addition, accusations that
an unstable Egyptian crew member caused it could have a serious
impact on tourism in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The swift agreement by the United States to delay a criminal
investigation reflects the exceptionally close relationship between
Washington and Cairo on a variety of issues, including the Middle
East peace process and counterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other senior Clinton
administration officials have telephoned their Egyptian
counterparts this week to assure them of close consultation between
Washington and Cairo as the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said that a group of experts, including representatives
from Boeing, which built the plane, Pratt &AMP; Whitney, which
manufactured the engines, the Federal Aviation Administration, the
FBI and the Egyptian government would begin work Thursday on a
transcript from the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Mamdouh Heshman, the head of the civil aviation section of
the Egyptian ministry of transport, and Capt. Mohsne el-Missiri,
the investigator in charge for Egyptair, are among the Egyptians
already in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts tell whether sounds and speech were picked up by the
microphone of the captain or the first officer, or one in the
middle, called the cockpit area mike. They also try to define
sounds, including alarms going off and levers or switches being
moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group expects to work through the weekend and will attempt
to complete this transcript next week,'' the board said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said Wednesday that a new interpretation
of the Arabic utterance could have some bearing on their initial
theory as to what happened to bring down Egyptair Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those investigators emphasized that the
interpretation of the utterance was not the only factor that had
led them to theorize that Batouty, a 59-year-old veteran of
EgyptAir who was serving as a relief pilot for the flight, might
have tried to crash the plane.
</P>
<P>
   According to that hypothesis, after the co-pilot left the
cockpit, the pilot, Capt. Ahmed el-Habashy, left, leaving Batouty
alone in control of the aircraft. Batouty then uttered the phrase,
``Tawakilt ala Allah,'' and someone turned off the autopilot.
Habashy then returned to the cockpit and remarked that something
was wrong and needed to be fixed. Seconds later, the plane began a
deep descent.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators said that their initial theory _ that one
pilot was trying to drive the plane into the sea and the other was
trying to save the jet by pulling the nose up _ was influenced by
the absence so far of any evidence of mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, safety investigators said that Wednesday they had
confirmed from the flight data recorder that an elevator on the
tail _ a kind of flap, controlled from the co-pilot's seat _ was in
the ``nose-down'' angle while the other elevator controlled from
the pilot's seat was in a ``nose-up'' position. The two elevators
are normally aligned. While they are usually controlled in unison,
it is possible for two pilots to push the sides in opposite
directions. Also, the safety board announced Wednesday that during
the descent the speed brakes, metal panels on top of the wings that
make the plane descend faster were deployed while someone was
trying to raise the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Senior law-enforcement officials said Wednesday night that while
their theory that Batouty intentionally caused the crash was
plausible and consistent with the evidence, they have not found any
reason why he would have committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Cairo's indignation and anger over the theory that one of its
pilots could have been responsible for the crash comes against a
background in which Egyptians and others in the Muslim world
believe that Westerners can be insufficiently sensitive to the
subtleties of Islam and too eager to attribute deadly events to
Islamic extremism.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prominent scholars of Egypt and U.S. diplomats who have served
in Cairo say they are concerned that U.S. investigators have been
too quick to rule out catastrophic mechanical failure as the cause
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are holes in this story that puzzle me,'' said Frank
Wisner, , who was U.S. ambassador to Cairo from 1986 to 1990.
``Egypt has one of the lowest suicide rates in the world. They are
not a suicidal people.'' He said that the utterance attributed to
the pilot is commonly used by all Egyptians in everyday settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egyptian expressions are constantly interposed with
communications to the almighty _ when you sit down to eat food,
when you move, you are constantly using the almight's name,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Shibley Telhami, who holds the Anwar Sadat chair for
peace and development at the University of Maryland, said the
Egyptian reaction was based on a heightened sensitivity that
Americans' first instinct in such an event was to think of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a case where the immediate instinct was to portray
whatever statement was made in the cockpit as a prayer and it was
immediately tied to the fear people have in the west of militant
Islam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said that another factor was that the Egyptian
government has found itself battling Islamic extremists and feels
it has been largely successful in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Mamoun Fandy of Georgetown University's Center for
Contemporary Arab Studies said Wednesday that the Egyptian
government is very proud of its efforts to combat terrorism and
``especially proud of its security procedures on EgyptAir which is
the national carrier.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even as U.S. and Egyptian investigators struggled to sort out
the cause of the crash, American lawyers who specialize in aviation
disasters said that they were planning lawsuits against EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Kreindler, a New York lawyer who has represented the
families of victims in several major jet crashes, said Wednesday
that he had already been retained by the family of one of the
EgyptAir victims and that he expected to represent several others
in lawsuits against the Egyptian carrier.
</P>
<P>
   He said that under international aviation agreements, it would
matter little if the plane had been brought down by a suicidal
pilot or a mechanical error in terms of EgyptAir's liability.
</P>
<P>
   Under international treaties, an airline is responsible for the
crash of one of its planes unless it can prove that it took ``all
necessary measures'' to avoid the crash, a legal hurdle that has
proved difficult if not impossible for airlines to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Kreindler said EgyptAir would certainly not meet the standard if
the cause of the crash was a pilot suicide. ``EgyptAir employed
that pilot, they had the opportunity to train him and test him,''
he said. ``The argument is not going to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he suspected that any effort by EgyptAir to point
investigators away from a conclusion of pilot suicide had nothing
to do with the airline's fear of legal liability. ``It's more of a
matter of honor and disgrace for them,'' he said.

DEVILS LOSE THEIR TOP LINE AS THEY TIE WITH BRUINS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Devils let a two-goal
lead slip away Wednesday night, but once again they found a way not
to let a two-game losing streak take hold. They grabbed and
clutched their way to a 2-2 tie with the Boston Bruins in a game
that had little to excite the crowd of 14,219 until overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The tie extended the Devils' undefeated streak at home to nine
games. They have seven victories and two ties in that stretch, and
their loss to Pittsburgh in the home opener remains the only defeat
of the season at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils (9-6-3) earned a point in the standings, but the game
may turn out to be costly because the three players that make up
what is considered their top line were not on the ice at game's
end. Petr Sykora left in the second period with a bruised knee and
did not return. Patrik Elias and Jason Arnott missed most of the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora said afterward that he did not think he would miss any
action, but he was quick to add that it all depended on how his
knee would feel in the morning. Elias said he got hit on top of his
foot with a puck and the foot was still painful. Arnott left
because he got hit in the mouth again; he had returned from a mouth
injury in the loss to Washington in the previous game.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were not happy afterward about squandering a two-goal
lead in the third period. The tying score came with 4 minutes 31
seconds left in regulation when Martin Brodeur allowed a soft goal
to Joe Murphy, who made his debut with the Bruins after walking
away from a tryout with the Rangers last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have buried them earlier and we didn't,'' said
Brodeur, who faced 31 shots, including three in overtime. ``We hit
the post a couple times and missed chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur was lucky when Jason Allison's shot in the overtime hit
the corner of the crossbar and the right post.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik was more critical of the way the Devils collapsed in
the third period. He blamed the Devils' inability to seal matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not having the killer instinct,'' Holik called it, as he stood
in front of his stall in the quiet Devils' dressing room. ``We
played their game, instead of finishing them off. We got a little
lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gomez and Sergei Brylin scored the goals for the Devils in
the first and second periods, before the Bruins rallied for goals
by Mikko Eloranta and Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Niedermayer, who has gone without a goal even though he
has played every game, assisted on both goals for the Devils. He
made the pass for Gomez's fourth goal of the season that opened the
scoring 5:55 into the game. Niedermayer then took a shot that
Brylin deflected for his fourth of the season with 1:10 left in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur made 29 saves, including one in the overtime, and
Boston's Robbie Dallas made 37 saves, including five in the
overtime.

ANGELS HIRE SCIOSCIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Former Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Mike
Scioscia will be introduced as the new Angels manager today in a
news conference at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia is believed to have received a three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement ends general manager Bill Stoneman's search
that lasted 2{ weeks since his hiring and included interviews with
seven candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, who will turn 41 this month, beat out Chris Chambliss,
Joe Maddon, Joel Skinner, Ken Macha, Bob Boone and Hal McRae for
the position.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia's primary task will be to bring together a clubhouse
that became so divided last season that manager Terry Collins
resigned Sept. 3. Stoneman focused on looking for someone he
thought would be able to manage people and gain the respect of the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I'm looking for) somebody who understands baseball is a team
sport and treats the job as such,'' Stoneman said during the
interview process. ``If somebody buys into that, we'll have a lot
more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month Scioscia resigned as manager of the Albuquerque
Dukes, the Dodgers' Triple-A team. After the Dukes finished the
season with a record of 65-74, Scioscia decided it was time to
pursue other opportunities in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, who caught more games for the Dodgers (1,395) than any
player in team history, played for the Dodgers from 1980-92 and
finished his playing career in 1994. He was the Dodgers'
minor-league catching coordinator in 1995-96, and the major-league
team's bench coach in 1997-98 before taking the post with
Albuquerque last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were the last team in the majors to hire a manager,
which meant they had no competition for candidates. However, the
search delayed other priorities, like trying to re-sign pitcher
Chuck Finley, hiring a scouting director and a major-league
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process was much more time consuming than I thought,''
Stoneman said. ``But it was time well-spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia becomes the 16th Angels manager (not counting interim
managers) in club history, and the fifth in the 1990s, following
Doug Rader, Buck Rodgers, Marcel Lachemann and Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Only three managers in Angels history _ Norm Sherry, Gene Mauch
and Rader _ have winning records with the club.

BRUINS KNOW GOMEZ IS BOSS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Erica Gomez, a 5-foot-9 UCLA point guard, yells at
6-4 post player Carly Funicello about how to play in the post.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever confuses Gomez for a post player, yet Funicello
listens as Gomez tells her to use her drop step.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the leader,'' Funicello said. ``She's been here five
years. You ask her about a player, she can tell you about their
strengths and weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a truth about this season's UCLA women's basketball
team: Gomez's influence is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Her demeanor is one of professionalism, not emotion. Same with
her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erica's not one to talk about her feelings,'' forward Maylana
Martin said. ``We don't want to make a huge deal about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In summer pickup games, Gomez chose the teams. No one questioned
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody,'' Funicello said, ``because Erica knows.''
</P>
<P>
   At the team's media day, everyone talked about Gomez. Ask a
teammate about the team's chances, she doesn't talk about holding
off Oregon or Arizona or beating USC. She talks about Gomez. Even
USC coach Chris Gobrecht, when UCLA is mentioned, invokes Gomez's
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can get the ball to anyone like I've never seen,''
Gobrecht said.
</P>
<P>
   There's great reason for this outpouring of references. Gomez is
sidelined until late December at the earliest as she recovers from
surgery to repair a torn labrum and fractured shoulder. She injured
herself playing on the beach with guys in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dang it,'' she said. ``I'm tired of sitting around. I try and
contribute as much as I can. For the first time, I feel like I can
help somebody. They understand I'm telling them something because I
want them to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. Gomez might be injured, but this is her team _
so much so that she returned for her senior year after considering
skipping it. Her reasons are numerous. First, she's the oldest
player, having turned 23 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm the grandma,'' she said. ``I feel so old. When
(teammates) are dancing and acting loud, I feel old: `Been there,
done that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Second, she's the point guard on a squad that won the Pacific-10
and reached the NCAA Elite Eight last season, returns almost
everyone and is ranked in the top five in just about every national
poll (it started fifth in AP but has moved up to 4th). Many believe
this UCLA team has the best chance since the 1978 national champion
to reach the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Third, she hurt her knee in the NCAA Tournament, and the way
Louisiana Tech bounced the Bruins out of the postseason didn't feel
right to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would've been a hard way to end her career like that,''
Martin said. ``I was hoping that would make a difference in her
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   So bring on the Pac-10 and the NCAA Tournament. Gomez is back _
even if that means being back in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Being the center of attention always has been difficult for
Gomez. She prefers staying to herself and rarely is seen at campus
sporting events. She hears the little girls shouting her name but
has difficulty acknowledging them. But she's working on it. While
she was typing on campus one day, a fan walked up to her and told
her he was sorry about her shoulder and he would pray for her.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez gave a perfunctory ``thanks'' and kept typing, barely
looking up.
</P>
<P>
   As the man walked away, Gomez realized she had been rude, so she
walked over to him and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing a lot of thinking,'' she said. ``Knowing how
much impact our team has on the kids. I ask myself, `How do I want
to be treated?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's more mature and she's seeing things in a different
way,'' UCLA coach Kathy Olivier said. ``She can do a lot for
women's basketball. She realizes that. I think it's awesome. I love
it. She'll feel that much better if she lets the fans in.''

DISRESPECT ANGERS MURRAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ You'd think the Los Angeles Kings lost by five
goals in one of the most horrific displays in hockey history.
</P>
<P>
   A day after watching his Kings get outshot 23-1 in the third
period, yet hang on for a 3-2 win against Chicago, coach Andy
Murray said his club needs to respect other clubs before it can be
a serious playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't feel we showed enough respect for our opponent
in the third period,'' Murray said. ``Who are we not to be
respecting our opponent? Who are we? They don't give you the
Stanley Cup for having 28 points in the middle of November.''
</P>
<P>
   The message: Doing it and getting away with it against Chicago
is one thing, but if it against the Phoenix Coyotes tonight at
Staples Center, forget about stealing a win.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reviewing the videotape of the third period debacle
against the Blackhawks, Murray talked with the Kings about why they
stopped working hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about this respect factor,'' Murray said. ``There
was nothing for us to learn (from watching) the third period
because it was so bad. We just didn't show them enough respect. We
can't accept it, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of our players has something to prove, as a team and
as an individual. I have something to prove. The coaches have
something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Remaining loyal: Even though Finnish import Jere Karalahti
may be ready to join the Kings as soon as today, Murray said the
24-year-old won't be his first choice if he makes a change on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Murray met with the team before Wednesday's practice and told
them he would remain loyal to the players who were there throughout
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quality player, but (I told them),`You guys are playing
right now,' '' Murray said. ``If I had a guy who couldn't play, I'd
put (Jaroslav) Modry in the lineup. I think you have to have that
loyalty to your players.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said the situation regarding Mattias Nordstrom was
different than Karalahti because Nordstrom spent the last
three-plus seasons with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   __ Slap shots: Modry, Jason Blake, Karalahti and goalie Marcel
Cousineau were slated to play for the Kings' IHL affiliate in Long
Beach on Wednesday. . . . Though Cousineau hasn't played yet this
season, Murray said he wouldn't hesitate to use him if the Kings
played back-to-back nights. If Stephane Fiset doesn't return for
back-to-back games against Colorado and Dallas next week, that
could happen. . . . Defensemen Garry Galley missed practice because
of a family medical situation, and Sean O'Donnell sat out with a
leg injury. Both should play against the Coyotes.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When Ladislav Kohn looked to the heavens after
scoring his first goal of the season, it was as though a prayer had
been answered for a Anaheim Mighty Ducks team that had been

</P>
<P>
   The rare Anaheim power-play goal with 6:49 left in the third

   It was hardly the most riveting game of the season, but all in
all it was a pretty special night for the Ducks, who also killed
off two penalties as they moved back to the .500 mark (9-9-2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's power play had managed just one goal in its last 25
chances before Kohn deflected a point shot by Paul Kariya that also
bounced off Steve Rucchin before it got to the Anaheim winger.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn's goal couldn't have been more timely, since it helped the
Ducks avoid overtime with a Flames team that has won all five of
its games in extra time.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary had tied the game at 11:41 on goal by Cory Stillman.
</P>
<P>
   After losing three in a row on the road the Ducks needed a good
start and they got just that _ with a little help from the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Tverdovsky's dump-in took an odd bounce off the end boards
and trapped Calgary goalie Fred Brathwaite out of the net. Marty
McInnis quickly pounced on the loose puck and slipped a pass to
Antti Aalto, who scored his third goal of the season into an open
net at 5:23.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim got a good bounce on the other end as well. With 12:45
left in the period, Stillman's blew a shot past Guy Hebert's glove
only to have it hit the right post.
</P>
<P>
   The second period offered little drama other than to see the
Ducks' woeful special teams at work.
</P>
<P>
   The power play, ranked No. 26 in the league, looked as tentative
as ever. Anaheim was 0 for 2 with the just two shots on goal. One
shot by Kariya that never reached the goal hit McInnis in the head,
but the Ducks winger didn't miss a shift.
</P>
<P>
   But the real buzz came when Pavel Trnka was assessed a very
questionable interference penalty midway through the period. That
meant Anaheim's NHL worst penalty killers would have to protect
their slim one-goal lead. After giving up six power-play goals in
the previous two games it was hardly a good bet. But the Ducks
killed off the penalty easily and seemed to gain momentum from the
rare successful kill.

CSUN STRESSES TOGETHERNESS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At every break in the action, the Cal State
Northridge players put their arms around each other. After a
timeout for water, they line up next to one another and cheer.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? Is this a college men's basketball team or
a self-help seminar?
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge Matadors, who ended their finest
Division I season with a frustrating loss in the Big Sky tournament
are trying to push aside grumbling and locker-room politics _ two
facets of last season that are just now coming to light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a change in attitude,'' CSUN head coach
Bobby Braswell said after a recent practice. ``Just take a look in
here right now. You don't see groups of guys who are `cliquing.'
You see them staying together and talking together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for (the coaches) to go into the dining
facilities here and see 10 of our players eating lunch together.''
</P>
<P>
   Braswell hopes that players who eat together win together as
CSUN begins the 1999-2000 season Friday at 7 p.m. against USC at
the Sports Arena. The Matadors have been picked by conference
coaches to finish third in the Big Sky Conference, behind Weber
State and Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN was 17-12 last season, including 9-7 in the conference. But
a 91-90 loss to Montana State in the first round of the tournament
exposed two significant weaknesses: defense and selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell said the defense can be fixed by more dedication in
practice. But the selfishness is something the eight returning
players worked to correct on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a closer-knit bunch than we were last year,'' said
senior forward Jeff Parris, who seems to be moving into the
leadership role left by Derrick Higgins, the team's only senior
last season. ``This year, we hang around a lot more. We go out
together instead of going out separately. You look at the Lakers.
They don't have a lot of team unity, and they don't win certain
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess team unity is a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one mentioned them by name, guard Greg Minor and
forward Rico Harris, who were both suspended late last season, were
assumed to be negative influences on the rest of the team. Although
Minor and Harris were juniors last season, neither returned to the
program: Minor came back for the Big Sky tournament, then declared
for the NBA Draft; Harris never came back after a one-season stint
at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all got the same goals in mind,'' said junior center
Brian Heinle, ``and that's to win ballgames. We just didn't know
how to win last year. We had a couple guys who didn't see the team
goals. (Now) we all know what we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Big Sky championship is a realistic goal. Although
CSUN didn't receive a first-place vote from the coaches or media in
the preseason polls, the Matadors have been named by nearly every
college basketball magazine as the conference darkhorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to sneak up on anybody,'' Braswell said. ``Now
people are expecting Cal State Northridge to finish in the top two
or three. We don't want to just knock on the door, we want to kick
the door in. Now is the time to step up and make some things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the Matadors, by position: &QL; 
GUARD
</P>
<P>
   The deepest position. Although sophomore Markus Carr (Palmdale
High) was the returning point guard, Braswell recruited Craig
Calloway (Long Beach Jordan High) and Marco McCain (Cerritos
College), who both can play the point.
</P>
<P>
   Carr has played well in two exhibition games and he should start
against USC. McCain can play either guard position, meaning he'll
get significant minutes. Calloway is talented, but he's adjusting
to the college game.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Carl Holmes will start at shooting guard. Holmes had a
great freshman season, then slumped a bit last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl is playing as well as he was as a freshman,'' said
Braswell, Holmes' legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
   With its depth of backcourt talent, expect CSUN to play a
three-guard lineup often this season. &QL; 
FORWARD
</P>
<P>
   Parris, a small forward, was the team's top shooter last year
(61 percent), but he took far fewer shots than the rest of the
starters. That could change this season. Parris scored 31 points in
the Matadors' two exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Larry was CSUN's best player in February. At 6-foot-9 and
205 pounds, he doesn't have the bulk of a traditional power
forward, but he has long arms and can rebound. Larry, a senior,
will miss the first two games _ USC and the Nov. 27 home opener
against Cal State Dominguez Hills _ because he participated in an
illegal summer league.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt Rolle, a senior from the Bahamas who averaged only 3.4
points last season, will probably start until Larry returns.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reserves, junior Jermar Welch is the only one with
CSUN experience, and he played only 48 minutes last season. &QL; 
CENTER
</P>
<P>
   Heinle (6-9, 225) is among the conference's top big men, and
he's one of the Matadors' top 3-point shooters. He's the top
returning scorer (12.6 points per game) and rebounder (5.7 per
game).
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Dan Read, Heinle's backup, is the Matadors'
tallest player at 6-10.

SKINS GAME SETTING: FROM PLUSH TO ARID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIO, Calif. _ This year,viewers of the 17th annual Skins Game,
now as much a Thanksgiving weekend tradition as leftovers, will see
something new: dsert.
</P>
<P>
   Honest to God, unyielding, unforgiving, civilization-resistant,
snake-hiding desert.
</P>
<P>
   This may be a shock for those who thought Palm Springs was this
green paradise surrounded by pretty mountains. It can be, but the
desert is never far away.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after 13 years of plush courses tucked away in tony
neighborhoods, the Skins Game is venturing into the badlands north
of Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   The new Landmark Golf Club, which just opened, next weekend
starts what its owners hope is a long and profitable association
with the tournament that sired what grew up to be golf's cash-flush
silly season. This is notable on two accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, two 18-hole layouts both more than 7,000 yards
long, was built in about a year. And it is a public, albeit
expensive, facility. It also borders public lands, so it won't have
that cushy country club feel. Landmark officials had to do a little
scrambling to pull it all off.
</P>
<P>
   ``On December 1st (last year), we were building a course for the
public to play. By Dec. 17th, we were building a course for the
Skins Game,'' said Johnny Pott, Landmark's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the course can be set up tough enough to
challenge the professionals, but high handicappers can have a fun
round.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to overpower the course might not be a good idea. Pott
said there are generous target areas, but hit a crooked shot and
your ball will be long gone.
</P>
<P>
   This year's field consists of defending champion Mark O'Meara,
world No. 2 David Duval, Spanish star Sergio Garcia and Fred
Couples, who was added to the field to replace the late Payne
Stewart. They will play for $1 million, which is how much money
Tiger Woods won in the season-ending World Stroke Play Championship
in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Garcia's first tournament appearance in Southern
California. It's also going to be new experience with an American
holiday tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't really televise the Skins Game in Spain,'' he said
during a conference call with reporters. ``But I did watch a couple
when I was playing in the states. It looks very enjoyable. It will
be nice to play one of these tournaments where you can have a
little bit of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that wasn't fun was dumping his caddie, Jerry
Higgenbotham, formerly employed by O'Meara's.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia fired him last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy, it didn't look like he was happy either. I
thought things weren't working, so it's time to move on,'' Garcia
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The Skins Game looks like it will be just one of many stops in
the states for Garcia, who plans to play 16 to 17 events here next
season with several stops possible in California.
</P>
<P>
   That might stimulate golf's next great rivalry, that is Woods
versus Garcia, whose popularity is already approaching Tigermania
proportions, especially in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing. The other day a guy almost broke his head trying
to get an autograph. It was almost scary,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio, wait until you get a load of the desert. Now that is
scary.

HACKETT EXPECTED TO BE KEY MAN IN 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As D.J. Hackett became stronger and faster, it was
tempting for the Cal State Northridge football coaches to play the
freshman wide receiver. But they held firm, sticking to the plan to
redshirt Hackett, a 6-foot-3, 180-pounder out of San Dimas High.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Hackett to make an impact at CSUN in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really, really hard for us not to play D.J. this
year,'' CSUN interim head coach Jeff Kearin said. ``He has really
worked hard in the weight room. I feel really good about D.J.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin said Hackett could move into a starting role next year,
because of the graduation of wideouts Aaron Arnold and Terrence
Jones. With the season ending this Saturday against Northern
Arizona, it's time to take a look at some Matadors who are being
looked upon, like Hackett, as stepping to the forefront next
season:
</P>
<P>
   __ Joe Gilliam, wide receiver. A freshman, he has been the most
promising offensive newcomer to the program this season. He has 22
catches for 234 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   __ Erik Gardner, defensive lineman. The junior stayed relatively
healthy for a full season for the first time since he came to CSUN
and the coaches are excited about his progress.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner (6-6, 240) has the size and quickness to become a great
pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   __ Johnny Acosta, offensive lineman. The junior came to
Northridge after being named honorable mention JC All-American at
Chaffey College. But he came to fall camp out of shape and has only
showed hints of being a great tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the season has gone on, (Acosta) has played himself into
better shape,'' offensive line coach Bobby Connelly said. ``He
needs to have a rigorous offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Acosta will be relied upon even more because freshman Nick
Longshore, who started the first half of the season at left tackle,
is going to begin serving his two-year Mormon mission in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hassan Abdul-Malik, defensive back. He earned the starting
free safety job last spring, but a pulled hamstring cut his '99
season to just two series in the opener against Western Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Malik, a sophomore, redshirted. He should form a potent
combination next year with safety Jeremy Golden, who was
academically ineligible this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Evaluations: Several NFL scouts have inquired about Arnold,
the school's all-time leading receiver, over the course of the
season. Here is some input from the scouts Kearin has received:
</P>
<P>
   ``They see a guy who's got tremendous numbers. That, coupled
with good size. His size is what makes the difference. . . . (The
scouts) like the fact that he's graduating; he's a `program' guy.
They see some toughness in him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Candidates: Some of the names being mentioned for the
head-coaching vacancy at Montana State are: Stanford offensive
coordinator Bill Diedrick, Purdue assistant head coach Scott
Downing and Eastern Washington head coach Mike Kramer.

CONGRESS AGREES WITH WHITE HOUSE ON SPENDING CUTS
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Republican leaders in Congress
agreed on Wednesday to an across-the-board spending cut to the
long-overdue federal budget, and then, after grappling all day over
how to make that cut, shook hands on it Thursday morning and made a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed on an across-the-board budget cut of 0.38
percent, out of about $610 billion in spending for federal
agencies. Then they argued all day about how to perform that fiscal
surgery, which would yield close to $1.3 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight on Wednesday they agreed to exclude
military personnel from the cut and to give the White House the
flexibility it sought on imposing the cut on the rest of the
government, said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who is chairman of the
Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Their daylong dispute was ``like when you go to buy a house, and
you've agreed on the price, and all that's left is a disagreement
over the color of the trim on the tool shed,'' said Robert
Stevenson, a senior aide to Domenici.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before midnight, the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., said he
planned to file the final spending package on the floor of the
House before dawn. The White House said at 1 a.m. on Thursday that
it was still reviewing the bill's fine print.
</P>
<P>
   The House will meet on Thursday morning to debate it. Congress
is operating under a 24-hour continuing resolution, keeping the
government running without a real budget until midnight. Under
expedited rules of procedure that members jokingly call ``martial
law,'' the House is expected to pass the final package, containing
the last five of the year's 13 spending bills, and send it to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Then another battle is likely in the Senate. It involves federal
price controls for dairy farmers, an issue so crucial to the
combatants that they are threatening to shut down the Senate, block
any final budget bill and keep Congress in session well into
December.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., has placed a formal hold on the final
spending package in an effort to protect his state's 23,000 dairy
farmers from legislation favoring Northeastern milk producers.
</P>
<P>
   The budget cannot pass, and Congress cannot adjourn, until he
lifts that hold, because the legislation he opposes is in the final
spending package that will be filed in the House, voted on and most
likely passed on Thursday before going to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lew, the White House budget director, said the dairy
dispute was so dire that it raises a real risk of a government
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   This looming problem dismays many members of Congress. When the
House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, began talking
about it on the House floor Wednesday, members began to moo.
</P>
<P>
   The day's war of words began when the House speaker, Dennis
Hastert of Illinois, said President Clinton had agreed in a
telephone call from Turkey to an across-the-board cut of 0.38
percent in the budget, which is now 47 days overdue. That cut was a
political do-or-die issue for the Republicans, but only part of the
financial solution. The final piece was agreeing on how to impose
it.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, representatives and White House aides coming and
going through the Senate's corridors for the negotiations looked
exhausted after 10 nearly nonstop days of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders were pressing hard to finish without spending
more money. ``If I were king, I would have their heads all cut
off,'' the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was seeking every last new dollar it could
extract from Congress before shaking hands, including $100 million
for a program for disabled workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans needed nearly $7 billion in savings to allow
them to say that their spending bills would not dip into Social
Security surpluses _ a political point they have made daily, since
spring, but still have not formally fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   So the White House brought nearly $7 billion to the bargaining
table on Wednesday, enough to cover the Republicans demands without
an across-the-board cut.
</P>
<P>
   Up to $3.5 billion would come from a one-time transfer from the
Federal Reserve's portfolio of government securities - _ strictly
bookkeeping device, since the money belongs to the government to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The rest would come from delaying government paychecks for
military personnel and many civilian employees for about 48 hours,
until just after 12:01 a.m. next Oct. 1, the start of the next
fiscal year. This would not save any money, but simply shift more
than $3.2 billion in spending into next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals remained in the final package, along with the
across-the-board cut. Both sides agreed to exclude military
personnel from the cut. Then came the stumbling block: how to
impose the $1.3 billion cut.
</P>
<P>
   The argument was over who would control the budget-cutting
scalpel, what programs could be protected and which ones could take
deep cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides described this as an ``issue of flexibility.'' Two
weeks ago, Clinton vetoed a 0.97 percent across-the-board cut that
Congress passed, almost exclusively with Republican votes, calling
it a ``blind and mindless'' exercise.
</P>
<P>
   To make such a cut seem sensible to Democrats, the White House
insisted on shielding some programs and cutting others more deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight, they won an agreement. Domenici said
that its terms allowed some programs within federal agencies to be
protected from the cuts; other programs could be cut by up to 15
percent to make up the difference and achieve the savings.
</P>
<P>
   That helps ``make it not really across the board, but driven by
policy,'' Lew said. ``With a little more room to concentrate, it
becomes a tool we can manage.''
</P>
<P>
   An across-the-board cut was a matter of principle for the
party's conservatives in the House, who wore big buttons on their
lapels today saying they had ``stopped the raid on Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as important to two Democratic senators are demands for
their home states.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia is threatening a filibuster to
protect his state's coal miners from a federal court ruling barring
them from dumping in valley streams. His last-minute legislation
that would stop the court ruling from taking effect for two years.
The White House first supported Bryd's effort, then said it would
veto any bill containing it. It appeared to be striking a
noncommital stance on the issue on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Kohl and the dairy dispute.
</P>
<P>
   This year the House approved a measure that lets a system
keeping the price of milk in New England artificially high to
remain in place for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has placed a hold on every piece of legislation pending in
the Senate, including the budget bill, to stop that measure from
becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw politics _ that's what originated it, and that's what
keeps it going,'' Kohl said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authority for the cartel expired on Sept. 30, though a judge's
order has kept the pricing mechanism in place temporarily. In
September the House voted, 285 to 140, to extend the system. Then
Hastert and Lott agreed this week to attach a two-year extension of
the cartel to one of the final spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The milk issue is all about economic self-interest,''
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said last month. Now it will be
decided in the closing hours of this Congress.

SEAHAWKS' SUCCESS HAS KENNEDY WALKING ON AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The new life that has been breathed into the Seahawks
has not gone wasted on Cortez Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, with a decade in the NFL, seven Pro Bowl appearances and
not a single Seahawks playoff game to relish, Kennedy is so
inspired this season he looks as weightless as a NASA experiment.
</P>
<P>
   It's not often you find a 306-pound defensive tackle
twinkle-toeing across the turf like Fred Astaire.
</P>
<P>
   The way Kennedy's playing, he had better watch out. The Arthur
Murray School of Dance might call him for tips on that feathery
little number he unveiled last Sunday night against the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, a buoyant Kennedy two-stepped over Denver
lineman Mark Schlereth, leveling the veteran as Kennedy went in hot
pursuit of quarterback Chris Miller. It was a gem of a play.
</P>
<P>
   After such moves, people are talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My friend) Richmond Webb from the Dolphins called me after
the game,'' Kennedy said Wednesday. ``He said, `Tez, you're 31.
You're supposed to be on your way out of this league. You're
playing like you're 21 or 22.' But I don't feel it. By body's
aching. I'm nicked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's why I'm so happy. I'm so happy in my 10th year, on
my way out of the league, and we're standing here 7-2. I figure I'm
on the three-year plan. I want to get to the playoffs and to the
Super Bowl and then quit. Maybe we'll do it in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual in the NFL, the way pain often accompanies good
things. Only in Kennedy's case, the scales have at times seemed
tipped too heavily in favor of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Here he is, playing some of his best football on what is the
best Seahawks team he's ever seen and he's thinking about winning
the big one soon so he can call it a career _ a complete career.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good reason for some of Kennedy's world weariness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the third-year pro from Miami reeled off an atomic
season and was voted the NFL's defensive player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a footnote to this outstanding achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Also in '92, Kennedy's Seahawks bombed in an embarrassing 2-14
campaign and, far worse, Kennedy was stung by the death of Jerome
Brown, his former Hurricanes' teammate, best friend and training
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tragedy,'' Kennedy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individually, it's been great. I've done a lot of things on
the football field and playing all these years with the Seahawks.
But I'm starting to feel I've been doing this a long time already.
My body's tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, as the Seahawks stand alone atop the AFC West with a shot
at playing a few important games in January, Kennedy is casting
these marvelous times as his swan song _ an interesting image
considering the source.
</P>
<P>
   But if the loss of Brown in '92 made Kennedy understand how life
is a weird mix of pain and happiness, he has been jarred again this
season by the loss of his agent and friend, Robert Fraley.
</P>
<P>
   Fraley, along with golfer Payne Stewart and four others, died in
a plane crash last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Robert died, that was really tough, especially when it's
someone you look up to,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things Robert said was: `Tez, you're going to make
the Pro Bowl (this season) because you're in great shape. I have to
play at Pebble Beach the week of the Pro Bowl, but after the Pro
Bowl, stay over in Hawaii for a week and we're going to come spend
some time with you,''' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Robert's wife the other day and I told her if I
get to the Pro Bowl, `I'm going to fly you over so we can get
together' and she said, `Tez, I'll fly myself over to see you
because Robert would have been so proud.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, though, has learned how to persevere _ a skill honed by
so many trying seasons in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, in the heart of the 10-year stretch of playoffless
seasons when former owner Ken Behring was attempting to move the
Seahawks to Los Angeles, Kennedy filed a lawsuit with other
teammates. The suit charged that the Hawks deserved to stay in
Seattle because that's what the players' contracts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably wanted to trade me after I filed that lawsuit,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Behring's son, David, ranted against Kennedy by calling
the career Seahawk ``fat, lazy and lacking in leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   After the season, Kennedy was presented with the Steve Largent
Award _ an award to the player who best exemplifies the spirit,
dedication and integrity of the Seahawks. David Behring had to do
the honors.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, the Behrings were gone and so was Dennis
Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kennedy is benefiting from the leadership of Mike Holmgren.
Tez is tasting sweet revenge for all those trying, numbing, losing
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the nine years I've been around, I've never been in a
situation like this. When it gets to be November and it starts
raining around here, it was the time we'd be losing and we'd all be
depressed. Now we're just happy and jolly and the rain doesn't
bother us anymore,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Holmgren comes up to me and says: `Tez, this is what
you've been waiting for,''' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him, `Coach, I will do whatever it takes to win.
I've tried it my way for nine years and it never did any good.' So,
he brought new life to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tez may be feeling like his body's done too many years of hard
labor, but the way he's playing, it's delightfully impossible to
tell.

NBC RATES MIGHTY LOW WITH LOYAL NASCAR FANS 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By John Sturbin 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the height of the Vietnam War, one of the tongue-in-cheek
suggestions offered for resolving the conflict was to televise it
live on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because it would get canceled in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Sunday's overnight ratings _ and the overnight
rantings and ravings sent to my voice and e-mails _ NBC's debut
coverage of the NASCAR Winston Cup Series had a similar chilling
effect upon television's fastest-growing sport.
</P>
<P>
   Very strange. And if you are Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC
Sports, very disconcerting in light of the ``milestone'' $2.4
billion contract signed between the stock-car sanctioning body and
its newest television partners last week.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural Pennzoil 400 drew a sellout crowd of 80,000 to the
Homestead-Miami Speedway in South Florida. But the preliminary, or
overnight, rating of 3.0 and 7 share was the lowest for a Cup race
this year. (Ratings measure the number of U.S. households with
televisions watching the event, and share is the number of
households with their TVs turned on and watching the event.
Overnight ratings measure the top 44 markets).
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR also reported that the rating was the lowest of any race
broadcast on network TV since it began compiling such information
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch! And again, very strange, considering that Winston Cup
points-leader Dale Jarrett _ a popular, second-generation driver _
went into the day poised to clinch his first series championship.
After keeping track of every lug nut and lap for 32 races, how
could any self-respecting NASCAR fan not tune in to watch that bit
of unfinished business?
</P>
<P>
   Well, plenty of loyal NASCAR fans found something better to do
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe the loyal NASCAR fans initially did tune in. And maybe
about halfway through one of the most boring races of the year, and
with Jarrett's position safe and sound, they decided it was time to
channel surf for a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Or wash their socks.
</P>
<P>
   Or otherwise register their displeasure with the quality of
NBC's broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Or demonstrate their disappointment at the impending departure
of their friends at CBS/TNN and ESPN/ABC from the broadcast scene
after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Choose your rationale. But the numbing numbers were recorded
only three days after NBC, News Corp.'s Fox Sports and Time Warner
Inc. unit TBS agreed to a landmark six-year, $400 million-a-year
contract with NASCAR. NBC, which was scheduled to televise the
Pennzoil 400 before the blockbuster contract was announced, will
team with TBS to show the second half of the schedule in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, NBC cannot be faulted for the fact that the race
was a snoozer. Blame that on the relatively flat, 1.5-mile
Homestead layout and its current one-groove personality. Rookie
sensation Tony Stewart did his best to liven up the afternoon with
a bit of paint-trading against teammate Bobby Labonte while
jockeying for the lead in the latter stages.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart then handed NBC a nice post-race story line with his
rookie-record third victory of the season. And Jarrett deservedly
did hoist the Cup, joining his father, Ned, as the second
father-son championship combination in NASCAR history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several fans leaving voice and e-mails at the office here
blasted NBC's coverage, labelling it ``pitiful'' and ``sanitized''
and ``god-awful.'' And stuff like that. In other words, they felt
the coverage was not up to the standards they have grown accustomed
to on the current network lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, some of the anger aimed at NBC was of the backlash
variety, directed at the performances of lead announcer Allen
Bestwick, color commentators Joe Gibbs and Mike Wallace, and host
Brian Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Primarily because they are not Bob Jenkins, Benny Parsons,
Ned Jarrett, Dr. Jerry Punch, Bill Weber, John Kernan, Buddy Baker,
Ken Squier, Mike Joy, Dr. Dick Berggren and all the familiar faces
and voices we have welcomed into our living rooms on race weekends
for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   No fans are more loyal than NASCAR fans, a fact NBC undoubtedly
banked on before it landed the lucrative contract. Judging by
Sunday's overnights, NBC learned that fan loyalty was not included
in the deal.
SPOTLIGHT ON... Team Rahal's Indy run hinges on fiscal sense Now
that he has reigning Indianapolis 500 champion Kenny Brack under
contract, CART team owner Bobby Rahal has an extra incentive to
return to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway next May.
</P>
<P>
   Team Rahal is among a group of prominent CART loyalists
seriously considering the purchase of Indy Racing League chassis
and engines in a one-off bid to compete in the 84th Indianapolis
500. Rahal, the 1986 Indy 500 champion, has joined the majority of
his CART brethren in boycotting the race since 1996 in a
philosophical disagreement with IRL founder Tony George.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's negotiations between George, who also is the
president of the IMS, and leaders of the Championship Auto Racing
Teams series helped thaw some of the lingering ill will. And CART's
2000 schedule neatly has provided an opening for those teams
longing to try to qualify and race at The Brickyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that we are going through the process of due
diligence toward participating at Indy,'' Rahal said. ``I wish it
was as simple as that. It's not as though it's an inexpensive
proposition. Having said that, I think open-wheel racing deserves
our doing everything we can to get back. For us to go back would
bring back the stature of Indy, and \Rcreate\S a halo effect over
open-wheel racing as a whole. Over the next several months, I'll be
talking with our partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to manage Kenny there and \Rteammate\S Max Papis; I
think he'd light the place up. While we're going through due
diligence and it would be nice, it cannot come at any expense of
our CART program. That's our primary goal: to win the CART
championship next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I had my druthers, we'd be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack, the 1998 IRL champion, won last year's race while driving
for four-time Indy 500 winner A.J. Foyt of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indianapolis is the world's biggest race ... if you look at
the attendance and everything,'' Brack said. ``I'm aware from a
driver's standpoint that I will never win a bigger race in my
career. My goal for next year is to win in the CART series. I would
obviously like to go back to Indy and defend the championship, but
I understand there are things that could make that not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal, who co-owns the team with comedian David Letterman, said
he has approximately 60 days to consider several issues concerning
Indy. Chief among them is budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to go to Indy, you've got to go to win _
meaning multiple cars, engines and crews,'' Rahal said. ``If you
think you're going to stroll in and blow anybody off, it wouldn't
be too smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal said the cost to cover purchase of IRL equipment would be
approximately $1 million per car _ one that would have to be
dissected and learned almost on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody would feel all you have to do is show
up,'' Rahal said. ``But there are good people out there that can
short-cut a lot of the learning curve on those cars. It's a big
demand on the CART teams to go forward on this. It's not like it's
a cheap or easy deal. In some respects it's a hardship to gear up.
But if in the long term open-wheel racing regains its positiveness,
you do everything you can to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other teams reportedly mulling a return to Indy are Newman/Haas
Racing with Michael Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi; Team Penske
with Gil de Ferran and Helio Castro-Neves; Chip Ganassi Racing with
reigning CART champion Juan Montoya and Jimmy Vasser; Team Kool
Green with Dario Franchitti and Paul Tracy; and the reunited 1992
Indy 500 winning combination of Al Unser Jr. and owner Rick Galles.
QUICK HITS Petty sets Cup debut Adam Petty, NASCAR's first
fourth-generation driver, plans to make his NASCAR Winston Cup
debut at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth in April.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a new three-year sponsorship agreement with Sprint,
Petty will attempt to qualify for the DIRECTV 500 on Friday, March
31. That would set up the possibility of Petty competing against
his father, Kyle, in the same Cup race also featuring the in-house
battle between seven-time series champion Dale Earnhardt and
rookie-of-the-year candidate Dale Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be difficult,'' said Petty, 19, who has charted
a five-race Cup program for 2000. ``I know from watching my dad and
granddad \RRichard\S that the Winston Cup Series is the toughest
competition there is. But we're ready for the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty completed his rookie season in the NASCAR Busch Grand
National Series at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Saturday. In his
most recent appearance on the 1.5-mile TMS quadoval, Petty finished
16th in the O'Reilly 300 NASCAR Craftsman Truck race in a Dodge
fielded by grandfather King Richard. Martin facing surgery Winston
Cup star Mark Martin is scheduled to have surgery on his
chronically ailing back Monday, the day after the season-ending
NAPA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The surgery will fuse two lower
vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dread it,'' said Martin, driver of the No. 6 Valvoline Ford
Taurus. ``I really dread being crippled again and having to rehab
again and fight my way back from being helpless. It takes a lot of
your manhood away when you're handicapped like that. It's just not
worth going on like I am right now if there's a chance I could get
better.'' Atlanta tickets remain Approximately 12,000 reserved
tickets in the East Turn and Weaver Grandstands are available for
Sunday's NASCAR Winston Cup season-ending NAPA 500 at Atlanta Motor
Speedway. Ticket office hours have been expanded from 8 a.m. to 7
p.m. Tickets also are available via Ticketmaster at
www.ticketmaster.com. Ray tests at Kentucky Reigning Indy Racing
League champion Greg Ray logged the first laps over 200 mph at the
new 1.5-mile Kentucky Speedway on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Team Menard were accompanied to Sparta, Ky., by Brian
Barnhart, the director of racing operations for the IRL. Barnhart
said Ray ran between 25 and 30 laps with a top speed of 208 mph in
an effort to get feedback on a surface that was finished last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to find the line on the racetrack,'' Ray said,
``and see if the seams where they patched the lanes together were
even and didn't bother the car. And find the bumps. It's probably
fine the way it is, but we gave them some suggestions, and I think
they agreed to do all those things.''
</P>
<P>
   The $152 million facility initially will seat 65,000. The track
is scheduled to play host to the inaugural The Belterra Resort Indy
300 on Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the track can be two-groove,'' said Ray, of Plano.
``There's probably one line that is faster, but I think you can run
three or four lines, and certainly at least two.'' Ray claims IRL
awards Greg Ray and team owner John Menard collected more than $1
million of the $2.8 million in bonuses and special awards presented
during the IRL's award ceremony in Indianapolis on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest payoff was a $1 million bonus for winning the season
championship. Ray earned $30,000 for leading a league-high 464
laps; $10,000 for winning four pole positions and $10,000 for
leading the most races at halfway.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harrington earned $50,000 as rookie of the year, and
motorcycle aficionado Scott Goodyear was presented a new
Harley-Davidson for winning the most-popular-driver award. Last
words ``It's important that things work for Fox or NBC or whoever,
because they are going to be the way the bulk of fans see and
perceive our sport.'' _ Kyle Petty, on the prime partners in
NASCAR's new TV deal
INSIDE THE NUMBERS Genuine Ford guys Ned and Dale Jarrett became
the second father-son combination to win NASCAR championships when
Dale clinched the 1999 NASCAR Winston Cup crown at Homestead-Miami
Speedway on Sunday. (Lee and Richard Petty were the first.) The

TEXAS RANGERS GENERAL MANAGER DESERVES PAT ON BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For now, Doug Melvin was right. And to prove it, he almost has a
bruised spine from all the congratulatory slaps on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow baseball executives spent last week toasting Melvin at
the general manager's meetings in California.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Paul Beeston, No. 2 man in the game behind
commissioner Bud Selig, told Rangers owner Tom Hicks, ``Your GM
should be arrested for grand larceny.''
</P>
<P>
   And the phone calls and e-mail at The Ballpark in Arlington ran
90 percent in favor of what Melvin did.
</P>
<P>
   All this over the trade two weeks ago of Juan Gonzalez. Count me
among those who agreed with Melvin on this one, but I darn sure
don't think the deal with Detroit was that cut-and-dried, or that
wonderful. The only dissent, however, over the moving of Juan seems
to have come from segments of the local media, plus a small
minority of fandom. Everywhere else, Melvin is being hailed as bold
and bright for this decision.
</P>
<P>
   But what you won't find is Melvin patting himself on the back.
``There was nothing easy about trading Juan, and with his
credentials, why should there be?'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   And by next August, or the August after that, once we receive a
definitive read on how the cargo from Detroit has performed for the
Rangers, then comes judgment day. Also in the equation is what
Melvin adds to the Rangers with the massive amount of short-term
and long-term payroll saved by trading Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Melvin was right, mainly because he was a jump
ahead on both the financial market and the talent market in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   With a glut of star-quality players becoming free agents after
the 2000 season (including Juan), Melvin correctly predicted six
weeks ago that the winter trade scene would become crowded and
therefore weaker as far as receiving value. Hence, the quick
trigger-finger with Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bottom-line aspect. ``If there's one crazy
contract by one team, it will blow the lid off,'' Melvin said the
day he dealt Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   There was. It did. Less than a week after the Gonzalez deal, the
dumbo Dodgers traded with Toronto for outfielder Shawn Green, then
signed Green for an astonishing $84 million for six years.
</P>
<P>
   If a Shawn Green is making $14 million a season, then what will
Gonzalez eventually want? Certainly much more than the $15 million
that the Rangers feared would be Juan's number.
</P>
<P>
   So Melvin got the fast break on everyone. His fellow GMs, many
of them facing the same headaches, were not hesitant to applaud him
during the California meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, a lot of clubs seemed to feel we had done the right
thing,'' said Melvin, low-keying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I really found encouraging, was the amount of
interest in the Detroit players we got,'' he added. ``All those
names came up in trade proposals last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as free-agent-to-be pitcher Andy Ashby, who the San Diego
Padres moved to Philadelphia. What the Padres wanted from the
Rangers was pitcher Francisco Cordero and outfielder Gabe Kapler, a
request Melvin nixed. Both Cordero and Kapler, of course, just
arrived from the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   It will be important, obviously, that the Gonzalez deal delivers
on-the-field value to the Rangers. But just as vital for a general
manager is the juggling of the budget on players' salaries. Melvin
made that kind of call in trading Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there are 15 percent of the players making 75
percent of the money in the major leagues,'' Melvin said. ``I've
never heard of a union intent on satisfying 15 percent of its
members, but the players have that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under that guideline, if our budget is $75 million, $50
million of that would go to four players. You can't put the right
team on the field if four players command 75 percent of your
budget. I didn't want to trade Juan, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin read the market correctly, and acted. And his current
read now centers on the slim pickings among free-agent pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an interest,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   But does he really? Lefty Chuck Finley reportedly has been
offered $27 million for three years by the desperate Indians. And
lefty Darren Oliver, the former Ranger, turned down four years at
$24 million from the Cardinals. Is Oliver nuts, or is this just
baseball?
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's own free-agent pitcher, Aaron Sele, is said to have an
asking price of $36 million for four years. Melvin sounded
confident of still being able to re-sign Sele, but bet this: Melvin
won't go for that asking price.
</P>
<P>
   And Kenny Rogers? Again, the Rangers have interest, and Rogers
has little bargaining power. But his demands could still be
outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin just jumped out of one financial fire with the Gonzalez
trade. But free agency now shoves him right back into the burning
house. Welcome to the financial inferno that is baseball.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-WORKERS (Beijing) _ Workers at an outmoded textile factory
in Beijing say the trade accord comes too late to help them _ their
factory is a likely casualty _ but they welcome it, railing against
their Communist Party-appointed managers. The big question is
whether the government can provide a safety net for them and
millions of others. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-THALIDOMIDE (Washington) _ In a serendipitous discovery that
grew out of the pleas of a lawyer whose young husband was dying of
cancer, scientists will report that thalidomide can slow the course
of a deadly bone cancer. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-LIFESPAN (Undated) _ Yielding a sharp insight into the
genetic reasons for death, a team of Italian scientists has
discovered a gene that controls lifespan in the mouse. In people,
where the gene was first found, the effects are unknown, but the
scientists and other experts in aging say they can envisage drugs
that affect the gene being used as an anti-wrinkle skin cream and
perhaps for less frivolous rejuvenation effects. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-JUPITER (Undated) _ Measurements from the Galileo spacecraft
suggest that Jupiter formed farther out in the solar system than
where it now orbits, and that it somehow moved inward, wreaking
havoc on theories of the early years of the solar system. By James
Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAMPAIGN _ (Moved in ``p'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GORE-JOURNALISM (Nashville, Tenn.) _ In September 1971, the
latest $95-a-week greenhorn, a shaggy-haired 23-year-old named
Albert A. Gore Jr., joined the Nashville Tennessean. The grizzled,
bourbon-swilling veterans presumed that the son and namesake of
Tennessee's recently deposed U.S. senator was looking to pad his
resume. But to their surprise, Gore stayed for nearly five years
and became a skilled investigative reporter. Many were caught off
guard when he abandoned the trade to run for Congress in 1976. By
Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TECH-WORKERS-SHORTAGE (San Francisco) _ Thanks to the booming
technology-based economy, companies' long-standing scramble for
qualified technical workers has taken on an air of desperation
lately. A severe shortage of engineers who design hardware and
software and create Web pages has led companies and their
recruiters to try all sorts of tricks, like one persistent
entrepreneur who repeatedly called a Web site here looking for
Nevil _ unaware that Nevil is a black Labrador retriever. By Matt
Richtel.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   IRS-WORKERS (Undated) _ Urged on by Congress to get tough on
abuse of taxpayers, the Treasury Dept. is formulating a plan to
subject IRS employees to more scrutiny than other federal workers.
But IRS managers and union leaders, and even some in the inspector
general's office, say intensified scrutiny will distract many IRS
agents as they defend themselves, making the agency less potent in
pursuing tax cheats. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Chinese stocks have zoomed since
the WTO agreement Monday. By Floyd Norris.

<P>
   (ART ADV: Graphic has been sent to NYT graphic clients.)
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-HYPERMARKETS (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ A little over a
year ago, the French food retailer Carrefour set up one of its
sprawling hypermarkets on the edge of Jakarta. If opening a fancy
modern grocery in a shrinking economy seemed risky then, it seemed
foolhardy a month later, when rioting mobs looted the new market.
But in the year that followed, the supermarket has been visited by
a different sort of mob, one bent on buying as much as it can. By
Wayne Arnold.

</P>
<P>
   COLE-LIRTHOGRAPH (Catskill, N.Y.) _ The limestone tablet was
lying face down, a mere doorstop in the dusty remains of Thomas
Cole's painting studio here. On a Saturday afternoon last month, an
architectural historian visiting the cobwebby old studio in back of
the house, picked it up and turned it over. ``I was astonished to
find a drawing on it,'' said Barksdale Maynard, who is researching
the life of Cole, one of the most famous artists of the Hudson
River landscape school. The ``drawing'' he discovered was in fact a
eerie rendering of a castle, done on a lithographic stone. ``Cole
died in the 1840s,'' he said. ``It's astounding that this artwork
would be just kicking around, for 150 years.'' By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   EAMES (Undated) _ At age 38, Eames Demetrios, grandson of the
influential designers Charles and Ray Eames, recalls visits to his
grandparents' house with a child's sense of adventure. Who wouldn't
relish rummaging through the vast storehouse of 901 Washington
Boulevard in Venice, Calif. _ the Eameses' trolley factory turned
studio _ with its countless totems and toys, musical contraptions,
models and banks of drawers stuffed with objects, from around the
world? By Tom Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   COLLECTIBLES-DISPLAY (Undated) _ Life just gets curiouser and
curiouser. With more than $10 billion in sales of manufactured
collectibles last year _ a category whose best sellers include
Beanie Babies, the beanbag toys; Precious Moments, porcelain
figures with inspirational messages; and Department 56, a line of
miniature buildings _ American furniture manufacturers have figured
out that adult collectors, who now number more than 36 million,
could use a place to put it all. By William L. Hamilton.

   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Los Angeles Galaxy defender Robin Fraser was
selected as Major League Soccer's Defender of the Year, edging D.C.
United's Jeff Agoos and last season's winner, Lubos Kubik of the
Chicago Fire.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, 32, who finished third in last year's voting, helped the
Galaxy become the first MLS team to allow less than one goal per
game (29 in 32 games) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The team captain has helped the Galaxy lead the league in least
goals allowed the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy arrived on Wednesday in Foxboro, where the game-day
weather forecast is in the 50's with a slight chance of showers. In
the 1996 final in Foxboro, torrential rains changed the pace of the
game as United won, 3-2, in sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember waking up that morning and seeing a monsoon,'' said
Agoos of MLS Cup '96. ``It became less of a soccer game, more of
how to survive. It should be a different environment this time. The
field looks as good as it's going to get. We should see more
attractive soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Both United and the Galaxy like to spread the field, but Foxboro
has one of the smallest fields in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the smallest field we've played on,'' said Galaxy coach
Sigi Schmid. ``It makes it easier to defend. Both teams have speed
up front. Short fields mean there's not that much space behind the
fence. The last time we played at Foxboro, we scored five goals.
Half that many would be great Sunday.''

STRONACH REVERSES STAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Santa Anita Park owner Frank Stronach reversed
his previous stand Wednesday and said his five race tracks will
continue paying dues next year to the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association, but at a reduced rate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, while attending the Breeders' Cup at
Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla., Stronach threatened to quit
paying dues to the struggling national organization. He has been
openly critical of the group for being ``buddy-buddy'' and
``clubish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stay in, but we will pay a reduced rate,'' Stronach
said in a telephone interview from his home in Vienna, Austria.
``Hopefully, we'll have some positive influence on the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   NTRA spokesman Chip Tuttle confirmed that Stronach indicated he
would like a reduction in dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no agreement on that,'' Tuttle said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Santa Anita, Stronach owns _ or is about to own _ Golden
Gate Fields near Berkeley, Thistledown in Cleveland, Remington Park
in Oklahoma City, Okla., and Gulfstream. In fiscal 1999, those
tracks paid dues totaling approximately $1.2 million to the NTRA.
The association has an annual operating budget of nearly $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   A mathematical formula that determines the dues of member tracks
is based largely on the track's handle _ the amount of money bet on
races run at that track. Santa Anita's contribution in fiscal 1999
was approximately $400,000, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly respect Mr. Stronach's investment in thoroughbred
racing and understand that he has made a significant investment in
the future of the sport,'' Tuttle said. ``We share a lot of common
ground and mutual areas of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach revised his stand on dues after a teleconference with
NTRA commissioner Tim Smith late last week. From Austria, he
renewed his criticism of the organization and called for a
democratic election of the NTRA board. NTRA board members, six in
all, are appointed by Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``(A lengthy) phone conversation with ... Smith was constructive
and cordial,'' Tuttle said. ``He indicated to us he was not going
to withdraw the tracks and we plan to continue discussions over the
next several weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Stronach's core beliefs is that thoroughbred horse racing
should be essentially unregulated in the United States and allowed
to operate unfettered. For example, he would like to see the
elimination of government-approved race calendars, so that tracks
could operate year-round if they wished. Stronach said the NTRA
should lobby federal and state governments for such diminished
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1998, the NTRA was formed to unify the horse
racing industry and develop marketing strategies to revive
struggling tracks. The league office in New York is headed by Smith
and his six hand-picked board members.
</P>
<P>
   One of those holding a chair in the boardroom is Doug Donn,
chairman of the Stronach-owned Gulfstream Park. Stronach may be
using the dues issue as a negotiating tool to get another seat on
the board _ perhaps for himself.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Stronach is not the first race track owner to
threaten a pullout. Several tracks on the East Coast are
considering similar action.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months the association has come under fire for its
fund-raising methods and for its hand in establishing the Los
Angeles-based Television Games Network. Many member tracks,
particularly in New York and Pennsylvania, believe the Oregon
gambling hub used by TVG competes with their own betting systems.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach himself doesn't support TVG and has not entered an
agreement with the network that would allow it to broadcast any
signal from Santa Anita in the Winter-Spring Meet, which begins
Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, his tracks will remain NTRA members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NTRA will be there and will be supported. It's a new
organization so let's reassess it,'' he said. ``The important thing
is we need a national organization that will promote (free
enterprise).''

DEFENSE ARRIVES JUST IN TIME FOR SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Perhaps the Sonics were a little too anxious to return
home.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of leaving behind a tie or belt or toothbrush after
their nine-day voyage back east, the Sonics apparently forgot to
pack their defense for the return trip.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the final buzzer drew near did it seem the Sonics had
been express-mailed their defensive schemes. That is when the
Sonics finally cooled the hot-shooting Golden State Warriors enough
to grab a 111-108 victory Wednesday night in KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had lost two of three games this season after giving
up more than 100 points. They avoided keeping with that trend in
spite of their own difficulties and an unusually overbearing
offense from the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State's point total was its season high and the
second-highest by a Sonics opponent. The Warriors (2-6) entered the
game shooting 39 percent, though they bombed the Sonics with a
52-percent outing.
</P>
<P>
   It took a frantic half-court trap with 6.4 seconds left to put
the Warriors away. Mookie Blaylock could have tied the score on the
game's final possession. But the Sonics somehow forced him to heave
a desperation shot as the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a lucky night,'' Sonics guard Gary Payton said.
``That's what I consider it _ luck. We should play better than we
did. If we played defense a little bit better than what we played
or even half of what we can play, we could have probably beaten
this team by a lot more and everybody could have rested for (the
Thursday's game).''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Sonics (7-2) play at Vancouver in their second set
of back-to-back games this season. They take a two-game winning
streak up north, but you would never know from their reaction over
beating the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those nights when a win was anything but
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the Sonics were entrenched in a seesaw battle
against the struggling Warriors. Even when the Sonics increased a
80-79 advantage late in the third period and led by 12 points in
the fourth, the game never seemed under control.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 103-93 with 5:55 left, the Sonics buckled as Golden State
smacked them with a 13-4 run. The Sonics later clung to a 109-106
lead when Horace Grant hit a pair of free throws with 37.1 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Cummings quickly responded with a 14-foot jumper. Then Vin
Baker shot an airball with the shot clock running down, and that
gave the Warriors hope until the end.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Antawn Jamison's game-high 27 points made him the
toughest Warrior to control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against guys like San Antonio and the (Los Angeles) Lakers, we
can't rely on playing 24 minutes and play 48 minutes,'' Grant said.
``We've got to play aggressive all the time. A win is a win. But as
a team, we can't go into a place like Vancouver, which is very
talented, and expect to win with the defense we played tonight.
We've got to play like we played in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the Sonics only played stingy defense in spurts. If
not for a huge third quarter that helped the Sonics open a 22-point
lead, the Sonics might not have been able to sustain the Nets' late
rally.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus Wednesday night was the Sonics' on-again,
off-again defensive effort is a nasty trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just concentration,'' said Vin Baker, who led the Sonics
with 23 points on 10 of 19 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Said guard Brent Barry: ``Guys are competitive enough to say
that we won, but we didn't win the way we wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry electrified the crowd and sparked the Sonics late in the
third. He flew baseline and threw down a dunk over Cummings. Barry
drew a foul and made the free throw to complete a three-point play
that put the Sonics ahead, 85-79.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, who had trailed by eight points in the first half,
took an 89-83 advantage into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Person came off the bench an hit two 3-pointers early in
the fourth. His last bomb put the Sonics ahead, 99-87, with 9:14
left in the game. Persons' baskets represented the first time the
Sonics had anyone score off the bench other than Vernon Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   Person (6) and Maxwell (8) combined for 18 points _ all the
Sonics could muster off the bench. The Warriors' reserves countered
with 36. That, plus a rebounding discrepancy, nearly doomed the
Sonics. The Warriors finished with a 40-33 edge on the glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a game I was really worried about because we come
back from a long trip like that and just have one day off,'' Sonics
coach Paul Westphal said. ``Sometimes you take these home games for
granted. We were a little flat defensively, but we still found a
way to pull the win out so it was a really good win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A win, yes. But `ugly' is probably the better adjective.

TIME HAS COME FOR MORGAN, 49ERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Wayne Morgan launches his fourth season
Saturday as Long Beach State's men's basketball coach, which may be
surprising to some since it was pretty well understood when he
started out Year 3 that it had best be a winning one.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. The 49ers came in at 13-15, and, looking back,
they're fortunate their record was that good. It took a
buzzer-beating basket by D'Cean Bryant at Loyola Marymount to get
into overtime, where the 49ers prevailed, and another last-second
shot by Charles O'Neal in order to beat UC Santa Barbara at home.
</P>
<P>
   There is no misunderstanding what's expected in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   As Athletic Director Bill Shumard put it, ``It is time for us to
win again.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan doesn't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have a winning season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And by ``winning season,'' neither of them are talking about
merely getting above .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us be in postseason play,'' said Shumard,
meaning the NCAA Tournament, or at least the NIT, not just the Big
West Tournament, where the 49ers are 1-3 the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in place. The 49ers return seven players from a year
ago, including all five of their starters two of them All-Big West
second team picks, Ramel ``Rock'' Lloyd and Mate Milisa, and
another, Antrone Lee, who was selected to the Bill West
all-tournament team and has displayed marked improvement already in
two exhibition wins.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, this time Morgan has everyone in place
from opening day. There will be no waiting around this season for a
key player to become eligible at midseason, as was the case three
years ago with Ike Nwankwo, and two years ago with Andy Betts, and
last year with O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the 49ers will start out this season, Morgan said, the
same way they finished last season, playing uptempo basketball,
taking advantage of their athleticism and speed.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings about the obvious question: What took so long?
</P>
<P>
   It's simply the belief, misguided perhaps, that the 49ers
thought they'd be a better rebounding team than they were. Now they
know better. So, the plan is to get the fastbreak rolling the
instant someone has his hands on the ball, whether it's off a
rebound or from out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only change I've made since the day I got here,'' Morgan
said, ``is that we run on makes and
</P>
<P>
   misses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a poor rebounding team,'' he acknowledged, noting the
49ers ranked 10th in rebounding last season in the Big West, ``and
people are playing a zone against us. One of the ways to beat that
is to get down there before they set up the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way is to beat a zone is by making 3-point baskets. The
49ers were 10th in that department, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, Morgan brought in 3-point specialist Brad Smith, who made 73
3-pointers last season at Cypress College, which is more than twice
as many as any 49er made and nearly half what all
</P>
<P>
   the 49ers made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good shooter,'' Morgan said of the 6-foot-4 Smith, who
was four for 10 shooting 3s in the two exhibitions. ``And he's got
a very quick shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Another newcomer is 6-9 forward James Williams, whom Morgan
describes as ``a very key guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to help us a lot,'' Morgan said of Williams, who
averaged 12.8 points and 7.6 rebounds last season at Dixie (Utah)
Junior College. ``He's very athletic ... and, from what I've seen
so far, he's our best rebounder'' Williams had 13 rebounds in
Tuesday night's exhibition romp ``and the runs the court better
than our other frontcourt players.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the cast is familiar:
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd, a preseason pick by no less than six national
publications as the Big West Player of the Year. He averaged 18
points a game last season, the fourth-best single-season scoring
average in Long Beach State history, and, says Morgan, ``On any
given night he's capable to being one of the best 2 guards in
America. What we've got to do is have him do that on a night to
night basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Milisa, the 6-11 center, the team's leading rebounder a year ago
(5.6 average), who, Morgan said, ``is bigger, stronger, more
mature, more comfortable with what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the 6-7 senior guard and forward, who, Morgan says, ``has
an incredible intellect for the game ... who would be an
all-conference player if he shows the same aggressive he did in the
tournament,'' when he scored 33 points against Idaho (14) and Boise
State (19).
</P>
<P>
   D'Cean Bryant, 6-6 forward from Lynwood, originally a Prop. 48
player who received another season of eligibility by earning his
bachelor's degree over the summer. It is Morgan's hope he'll
display his talents as he did in the 49ers' first exhibition game
when he scored 10 points over a 4{-minute span over a full 40
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Stone, 6-8 junior, playing his third season with the
49ers. ``He's improved a lot, he's playing very well right now,''
Morgan said. ``He knows all five positions on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Johnson, 6-1 sophomore guard. ``He has really improved,''
Morgan said. ``He worked extremely hard over the summer. He's a
very tough kid. And he can really jump.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, 6-3 senior guard, who Morgan says is another of the
49ers' ``keys'' to the season but missed Tuesday night's game
because of illness. ``He's an extremely talented player,'' Morgan
said. ``I'd like to see him have a string of good luck for a
change. No injuries, no sickness, no personnel problems. He's
probably one of the 20 best players in our conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other newcomers are guard Keith Felton ``who's a better
player than we thought,'' Morgan said and freshman Danny Horan, a
walk-on from Villa Park High. Another walk-on is 6-8 junior forward
Rory Clark, who averaged 16 points at Kaiser High in Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the season,'' said Morgan, who's 36-48
in his three years at Long Beach State and hasn't had a winning
season yet. ``It's the first year I've got veterans returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, we need to have a winning season. Learning how
</P>
<P>
   to win is a huge thing. First you have to learn how to compete,
then you have to learn how to win. When you do those two things,
and when you have carryover year to year ... that's what you call a
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hindsight being 20-20, yes, there are some things I would have
done differently, there are some things I should have done better.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know I can coach. Not only do I know I can coach, my
peers know I can coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Shumard, Morgan's boss, has given his coach a firm
timetable by saying it's time to win again. But he insists he
hasn't issued a ``win-X-number-of-games-or-else'' edict,
explaining: ``Basketball coaches put enough pressure on themselves.
There's additional pressure because he's the coach at Long Beach
State. We have a tradition. We expect to win. He doesn't need any
more pressure from me ... or anyone else involved in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable where's he's positioned the program. I think
we're on the threshold of some pretty great things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's set the table to win. We all expect to win. To what level
... I think we need to be careful. I've heard a few people say that
with this team in this league and with this schedule they ought to
win 20 games. And I'm quick to say, `Whoa, wait a minute.' Let's
take a look at the nonconference schedule, and at how balanced and
how competitive the Big West is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, our goal every year is to be in postseason play ...
and the time is right for that.''

RUNNING AROUND WITH OUR WALLETS ON EMPTY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ I'm not mad at banks because of ATM surcharges. I'm
mad because they got me addicted to ATMs in the first place.
<P>
   As with any drug, the suppliers gave it away until we got
hooked, then they started charging us more and more.
</P>
<P>
   Remember life before ATMs?
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally you'd run out of cash at a bad time and have to
hustle around _ borrow money from your neighbor, sell your hubcaps.
But most of the time, you planned ahead and did just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Now how often are you frantically scrambling and searching for
an ATM, because you haven't been to a cash machine in two hours and
you're running low? I go to baseball and football games and there
are hourlong lines at the ballpark ATM. Didn't these people realize
they were coming to a ballgame?
</P>
<P>
   Some days I think I spend more time staring at ATM screens than
at my own TV screen, and that worries me.
</P>
<P>
   We have become ATM-dependent, ATM junkies. We won't be happy
until they make a personal ATM the size of a Palm Pilot, which will
print out bills, deducting funds from our bank account and the U.S.
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the bills will have to be much smaller, about the
size of a Frito.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the government is making bills in varying sizes now
anyway, because I saw a sign in a store, ``Sorry, we don't accept
bills bigger than a $20.''
</P>
<P>
   I bet the new $500 bill is so big you can roll it up and use it
as a fungo bat.
</P>
<P>
   THE 49ERS are doomed to years of struggle, but at least the
Raiders have a decent team. In this age of NFL parity, it's
conceivable that they'll make it to Super Bowl, in which case:
</P>
<P>
   -- With the team cash-strapped due to poor ticket sales, the
players will have to hold bake sales to raise money for the trip to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Raiders won't sell their allotment of Super Bowl tickets,
so the game will be blacked out in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Raiders will win the Super Bowl and Los Angeles will
build them a stadium and lure them out of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   I think the Raiders and the 49ers ought to merge.
</P>
<P>
   The new team could play home games at the Giants' new ballpark.
There's no parking there, but everyone can park at the Oakland
Coliseum and ferry 'cross the Bay. With limited seating and a cool
ballpark, the games will all be sellouts even at obscenely inflated
prices, helping ease the financial burden the Raiders have heaped
on the taxpayers of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   There's enough talent on the two teams to make one really good
roster. The 49ers will get a top draft pick due to their crappy
record this season, and the Raiders' people can do the actual
drafting, since the 49ers' front office is currently clueless.
</P>
<P>
   What about a team name? We'll need one that retains the
character of both teams. Something from the Gold Rush era, yet
something that smacks of aggressive invasion of rights and
property.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gate Claim Jumpers.

   IT SNOWED at Tahoe, and the newspaper delivery was delayed, and
R.G. Lasson had nothing to read with breakfast, which happened to
be a sack of Pepperidge Farm Tahoe Chocolate Chunk Cookies.
</P>
<P>
   So Lasson did what any avid reader does when there's nothing to
read _ reads anything. In this case, the cookie package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tahoe ... An oasis in the majestic snow-topped Rocky
Mountains. The perfect name for an incredible cookie.''

   IF THE FBI takes over the investigation of the EgyptAir crash,
does Richard Jewell become the prime suspect?

<P>
   DO NOT DISTURB: The front entry to One Second Street, a building
scheduled for demolition, is home to a few homeless guys.
</P>
<P>
   George Seibert noticed that the lads have draped a red, white
and blue tarp over their little encampment. On the tarp is stamped
a corporate logo: ``Hyatt Resorts.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CHAINS are taking over, but the little guys are fighting
back with better business names. Sandy Mac Nab spotted a bakery in
Willits, Calif., called Baked to Differ, and an auto repair shop in
Eureka, Calif., named Honest Engine.
</P>
<P>
   IF OUR POLITICAL leaders are going to attack the ATM surcharge,
how about taking a whack at an even greater rip-off: The candy-bar
surcharge on change.
</P>
<P>
   You find yourself short of change for a parking meter or bus
fare or a Chronicle, you go into the corner market with your dollar
bill, and the reaction ranges from scorn to hostility to derisive
laughter. So you don't even try, you buy a pack of gum or a candy
bar in order to get the change.
</P>
<P>
   It's so humiliating to ask a merchant for change that whenever I
do it, I wear a ski mask.

TECH INDUSTRY WINS AGREEMENT ON EXTENDING R&AMP;D TAX CREDIT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The high-tech industry secured a victory on one of
its top legislative priorities Wednesday as Congress and the White
House agreed to a five-year extension of the research and
development tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   The tax write-off, which offsets the cost of developing products
ranging from software to drugs, had become entangled in a much
broader dispute over how to spend the anticipated federal budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans both support the tax credit, which is
worth about $2 billion a year to high-tech companies. But President
Clinton vetoed the tax credit in September when the GOP tied it to
a $792 billion tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of negotiations, administration officials and
congressional Republicans agreed on a $15 billion bill to extend
several expiring tax provisions, including the R&AMP;D tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   In order to put off the costs until the budget surplus swells,
the compromise will force high-tech companies to wait a year before
claiming the tax credit. Nevertheless, the agreement was hailed as
a major accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ecstatic,'' said Connie Correll, communications
director for the Information Technology Industry Council, which
represents some of Silicon Valley's largest firms in Washington.
``This is a tremendous boost for our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Congress has only  &LR; extended the tax credit only one
year at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years is a reasonable amount of time that provides some
predictability,'' said Ed Black, president of the Computer and
Communications Industry Association. ``We want it to be
stimulative, and if you can't put it into your planning for the
future, it doesn't accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley executives now have their sights on a permanent
extension of the tax write-off, an idea which has been endorsed by
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents contend that such tax breaks amount to little more
than corporate welfare and should be redirected toward either tax
breaks for individuals or social programs. But such complaints were
not heard Wednesday on Capitol Hill, where members have been
showered with record contributions from the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``R&AMP;D tax credits are good for all Americans, even though it
might go to companies that are doing research and development,''
said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of fact, as a result of that investment, it does
create more jobs, it helps America compete internationally,
technologically. I think it's a good investment of the people's
money in terms of a growing economy and the creation of more
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had their own words of praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research and development is the engine that drives our
country's economic growth,'' said Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Sacramento.
``This tax credit is a tremendous catalyst for companies who might
otherwise not take the risk of developing or improved &LR;   &LR; improving
technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech firms have made more than $3.8 million in political
contributions this year _ more than twice the amount during an
equivalent period last year, according to an analysis by the
nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one expected the credit to die after the president's
veto, there was concern that it might be limited to one year.
Several sources said the administration tried to limit the
extension to two years in order to keep costs down but was
ultimately persuaded to accept five years.
</P>
<P>
   The tax relief package is expected to sail through the House and
the Senate later this week. It also includes a provision to protect
more than 1 million families who take advantage of child-care
credits from being bumped into a higher tax bracket, and provides
tax credits for employers who hire welfare recipients and veterans.

INTERNET TRADEMARK ACT CRITICIZED BY LEGAL SCHOLARS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ With both major political parties in a headlong
rush to court the high-tech industry, Congress is about to expand
corporate rights to Internet domain names, at the expense, say many
legal scholars, of small businesses and individuals.
<P>
   Lawmakers and Internet experts alike widely condemn so-called
cybersquatting, a form of extortion that the Trademark Cyberpiracy
Prevention Act is intended to stop.
</P>
<P>
   A cybersquatter is an individual who registers a famous name of
a corporation or person as a Web site address and then offers to
sell the name back to the person or company.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow trademark owners to sue people who register
a domain name that is ``identical to or confusingly similar to'' an
existing trademark or who demonstrate a ``bad faith intent to
profit'' from the trademark. It would also protect the names of
famous people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, all my bill is doing is taking traditional
trademark law _ which has been recognized for almost our entire
nation's history _ and applying it to the Internet,'' said Rep.
James Rogan, R-Glendale, a former judge and law professor.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation sped through the House on October 26 on a voice
vote. A similar bill passed the Senate, and the final version is
expected to pass Congress this week and then be signed by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But other legal experts say the legislation represents a major
expansion of trademark law that sharply tilts the balance in favor
of large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the bill ``massive overkill,'' Michael Froomkin, a law
professor at the University of Miami, said the bill's $100,000 in
statutory penalties will allow large companies to threaten small
businesses and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major things it's going to achieve is that now you
can write these scary demand letters to mom and pop domain
registrants, and say, `Do what we say, or you risk being liable for
up to $100,000,' '' Froomkin said. ``Unless they go to a lawyer to
find out where they stand, they're just going to cave, because
that's a scary, big number for your average small-businessperson.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was pushed by Hollywood studios, which want more
protection for copyrighted names like Mary Poppins or Daffy Duck,
and by the trademark industry, including the American Intellectual
Property Law Association and the International Trademark
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Milton Mueller, director of the graduate program in
telecommunications and network management at Syracuse University,
said his research shows that the flip side of cybersquatting,
so-called reverse domain-name hijacking, is just as big a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when you as an individual user have a perfectly
legitimate registered domain name, and somebody with a trademark
sends you a mean note from a lawyer threatening you with a lawsuit
and all kinds of expenses and tries to take the name away from
you,'' Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with these bills is, typically, they are drafted
at the behest of the trademark owners and they don't contain
protections against abuse of the process by the trademark owners.''
</P>
<P>
   In two well-known cases, a 12-year-old boy registered his
nickname, Pokey, and was threatened by the maker of Gumby and Pokey
toys, and Archie Comics pursued a child named Veronica who
registered her name.
</P>
<P>
   The White House initially opposed the bill, saying it takes a
unilateral U.S. approach that interferes with efforts to develop a
worldwide process to resolve domain-name disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The government-sponsored Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers has a new international domain-name dispute process, in
coordination with the World Intellectual Property Organization, a
multilateral institution based in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe fundamentally we'd be walking down the wrong road
if we legislated a cybersquatting law and then the 200 or so
Internet countries around the world started legislating their own
rules and laws,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said last
month.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Domestic Trademark Law Pushed
</P>
<P>
   But Rogan said his bill applies only to domestic name
registrations, and that the White House wants to shift control over
Internet trademarks to an international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Americans have a right, and I think an obligation, to
enforce our laws within the four corners of our nation, and not ask
some international organization not based in the United States to
enforce American trademark law,'' Rogan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world would we want to surrender our sovereign
right to enforce domestic trademark law ... to some foreign entity,
oftentimes made up of members that compete with us in the economic
sphere?''
</P>
<P>
   To skirt White House objections, lawmakers attached the measure
to a satellite bill that the White House said President Clinton is
eager to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say current trademark law is already resolving many
cybersquatting problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts have been dealing with the more egregious cases of
real squatting by people who have no legitimate need or purpose for
getting a domain name other than to extort or extract some payment
from someone else,'' said David G. Post, a Temple University law
professor. ``But if this establishes a rule that in the case of a
conflict, the trademark owner always wins, that's a mistake. That's
bad policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller argued that electronic commerce has been growing by
leaps and bounds with minimal government interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there's some unruliness and a little bit of lawlessness
to the Internet,'' he said. ``But you can't rely on
special-interest industry lobbyists to say what's good for the
Internet economy. You have to take a little more long-term,
balanced approach. You have to make it a safe place for individuals
and small players as well the large companies that can afford to
lobby Congress.''

SITE'S USE OF DALLAS COWBOYS WEAVES TANGLED WEB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys long have been considered the NFL's sexiest
team, but this isn't what they had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site is using the Cowboys' name to promote
pornography and gambling online. A fan who accidentally reached the
site Wednesday while seeking the Cowboys' official site called the
NFL office in New York to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started looking at it, and needless to say, we're taking
the appropriate steps to stop them from using the Cowboys' name,''
said Brian McCarthy, the league's senior corporate communications
manager. ``A lot of people out there try to attach their name to
the NFL. There are two areas that the NFL would never promote, and
that is pornography and gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   The site has a small disclaimer disavowing association with the
``Dallas Cowboys Football Team.'' It offers no information about
the Cowboys or the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The site's goal it says is ``to provide the finest sports
information available while at the same time giving our customers
visual pleasure. Life is short, we try to live it ever \Rsic\S
chance we get. If you are offended by our selections please
leave.'' The site's Webmaster did not immediately respond to an
e-mail request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple said he was unaware of the site
and referred all questions to the league office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the ones who police that,'' Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is in the process of evaluating the site to find out
where it originates. McCarthy said NFL Properties, the licensing
arm of all 31 NFL teams, first will send a cease-and-desist letter
that threatens legal action for illegally using a trademarked name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fan who called was under the impression that it was a site
maintained by the Cowboys,'' McCarthy said. ``If you type in the
words Dallas Cowboys, you could easily end up at this site. We can
see how people could be confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-cybersquatting legislation, which seeks to protect
trademarks online, has been attached to the Satellite Television
Home Viewers Act. The controversial bill passed the House last week
and is awaiting a vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It would allow trademark holders to sue cybersquatters in the
nation where the domain name was registered and seek up to $100,000
in damages.

RANGERS INTERESTED IN HAVING FREE-AGENT FINLEY MAKE A VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Free-agent pitcher Chuck Finley, unlikely to
re-sign with the Anaheim Angels, is starting to visit other teams
and other cities. The Rangers are hoping The Ballpark in Arlington
will be one of his stops.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin, who met with Finley last week in
California, said yesterday he would like to bring the left-hander
to Texas some time later this month and is planning to discuss that
with his agent, Tim Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But only if he's really interested; you have to be careful,''
Melvin said. ``We brought in a big left-hander \RRandy Johnson\S
last year. ... We want to make sure we're attractive to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley is attractive to a number of teams, partly because right
now he's only looking for a three-year contract. Two other
free-agent left-handed pithers, Darren Oliver and Kenny Rogers,
could each command as much as a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Both Oliver and Rogers are former Rangers pitchers, and their
agent, Scott Boras, said both would be interested in returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren, as you know, still lives there, and Kenny enjoyed
living there,'' Boras said. ``But there are 17 teams looking for
No. 1 and No. 2 starting pitchers, and 14 teams are looking for
left-handed starters.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras worked out a five-year deal for Rogers with the New York
Yankees in 1995, but Melvin is reluctant to go even four years with
a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin has made a four-year offer to Aaron Sele, but it's only
the fourth time in five years as Rangers general manager that he
has offered a four-year contract to a pitcher. He also offered a
four-year deal to Rogers in 1995, John Wetteland in 1996 and
Johnson last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at a lot of four-year contracts on pitchers and a
lot of them are bad deals,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who will be 37 next year, is reportedly looking for a
three-year deal worth $27 million. He and his agent were in Phoenix
yesterday meeting with the Seattle Mariners and were unavailable
for comment. But Finley's asking price is why the Angels have
backed off in their attempts to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we're not,'' Angels president Tony Tavares told
the ``Los Angeles Times''. ``But at the numbers I'm hearing, I'm
not sure we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels aren't the only team scared by the high cost of
pitching. The St. Louis Cardinals are backing off re-signing Oliver
because of what they've heard it will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way beyond where we ever thought it would go,'' Cardinals
GM Walt Jocketty said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said, ``A lot teams are afraid of the cost of pitching. I
think that's why you see so many teams trading for pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile, Pat Hentgen and Andy Ashby are among the pitchers
who have been traded since the end of the season. The Rangers have
talked with the Toronto Blue Jays about David Wells and the Dodgers
about Darren Dreifort and Ismael Valdes, but are uneasy about what
it would take to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are especially interested in the Rangers' young relievers
_ Francisco Cordero, Jeff Zimmerman, Tim Crabtree and Mike Venafro
_ but Melvin is extremely reluctant give any of them up.
\Nsubheds:Zeile, McLemore at impasse The Rangers have reached an
impasse with free-agent third baseman Todd Zeile and free-agent
second baseman Mark McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   A source said Zeile is looking for a four-year deal; the Rangers
have offered a two-year contract with an option for a third year.
McLemore also wants a multiyear deal, but the Rangers are offering
only a one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he is continuing to talk to both players' agents.

THE TEN BASIC STEPS FOR BUYING AN SUV OR TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying an SUV or truck is just like buying any other vehicle.
You've done it before, but let's just do it by the numbers this
time as a countdown to happiness. (We hope.)
</P>
<P>
   10. Decide what you want, then figure out if you can afford it.
This sounds simpler than it is unless you're a high roller. If
that's the case, you can buy anything you want, and are probably
out driving your latest dream car to your vacation home now and not
reading this. For those of us who have to allot a big chunk of our
income to the auto industry, read on.
</P>
<P>
   Hint 1: SUVs come in three basic sizes: Small, regular, and
large (with a subcategory of truly humungous), most with a choice
of two- or four-wheel drive and an increasing number with an
all-wheel drive option.
</P>
<P>
   The small size includes Toyota RAV4, Subaru Forester, KIA
Sportage, Chevrolet Tracker, Honda CR-V, Suzuki Grand Vitara.
</P>
<P>
   The regular (big) size includes the Chevy Blazer/GMC Jimmy, Ford
Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Lexus RX300, Mercedes-Benz M-Class,
Toyota 4Runner, Isuzu Rodeo, Olds Bravada, and Mitsubishi Montero.
</P>
<P>
   In the large category are Ford Expedition, Dodge Durango, Chevy
Tahoe/GMC Yukon, Toyota Land Cruiser, Range Rover, Lexus LX470, and
biggest of the big, Ford Excursion, Chevy Suburban, and GMC Yukon.
</P>
<P>
   Hint 2: Wagons such as the Audi Quattro, Subaru Legacy, VW
Passat, Volvo 70-series, and Saab 9-5 are an attractive
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   9. If you can't afford what you want, decide what you like and
can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Hint 1: Auto manufacturers make a big profit on SUVs, especially
those loaded with expensive toys. If cost is your main
consideration, make your selection accordingly. Visit dealerships
to get a feel for what's out there, but it's way too early to make
a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Hint 2: Examine the family trees for the less-expensive version
of the same basic vehicle. (Prices mentioned here are for
lesser-priced four-wheel drive models.)
</P>
<P>
   a. Ford: The Mercury Mountaineer ($29,370) is a posh version of
the Ford Explorer ($23,070); likewise, the Lincoln Navigator
($45,860) is the upgraded Ford Expedition ($32,525).
</P>
<P>
   b. The Lexus LX450 ($59,005) is the fancy Toyota Land Cruiser
($50,828).
</P>
<P>
   c. The Chevy Blazer/GMC Jimmy are the basic car ($21,970 to
$28,470); The Olds Bravada ($31,498) is the gussied-up, all-wheel
drive version.
</P>
<P>
   d. You'll find the same relationship between the Isuzu Trooper
and Honda Passport; between the Nissan Pathfinder and Infiniti QX4.
</P>
<P>
   8. Now you have to decide whether to lease or buy. To figure out
if you're a good candidate to lease, ask yourself if you:
</P>
<P>
   a. Drive 12,000 to 15,000 miles per year.
</P>
<P>
   b. Keep your car in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   c. Like to change cars every three years.
</P>
<P>
   d. Don't mind having a car payment forever.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't answer yes to all of the above, think long and
hard about leasing. You're heading for extra payments.
</P>
<P>
   7. If you decide to buy, talk to your friendly loan officer to
find out what rate you'll be paying and get some approximate
numbers of how much it will cost you a week or month for various
loan lengths. If your employer has a credit union, payroll
deduction loans are a less painfull way to go.
</P>
<P>
   6. Do your research to find out the true cost (dealer's cost) of
the vehicle(s) you would like. Add about 3 percent for dealer
profit (after throwing out the destination charge). That's a
ballpark figure. Not many of us reach it no matter how much we brag
around the coffee machine.
</P>
<P>
   5. Take a deep breath and decide if you want to continue. After
all, it is your money.
</P>
<P>
   4. Now that you have an idea what you want, it's time to talk
dealerships. It's my feeling that they've changed a lot in the last
10 years. They've always wanted to sell you cars; now, they want to
make you a repeat customer and sell vehicles to your spouse,
family, friends, and neighbors. Visit a few and get a feel for the
atmosphere. Most want to be consumer friendly. They know they have
a good product (it's pretty hard to find a truly bad car these
days) and it's impossible to test drive an SUV without an office
visit. Later you can negotiate by phone or e-mail if you're not
comfortable dealing face-to-face and want to take time to think
about what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   3. Oh, you have a trade-in. Well, that can complicate things.
Get an idea of what it's worth, and how much it would cost to put
it in A-1 shape so it actually is worth that much. Then either fix
it or subtract the cost of the repairs. Make sure it's clean and
has been serviced relatively recently when you have the dealer give
you his estimate of what it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Hint: Know your bottom line, i.e. new car cost minus trade-in
value, when you negotiate. It sounds simple, but once numbers start
flying around take the time to do this simple math. If a dealer is
willing to meet your number, it really doesn't matter what values
he assigns to the new car and trade-in.
</P>
<P>
   2. Once the deal is struck, don't think you're done. You'll be
faced with a barrage of add-ons: alarms, warranties, insurance
deals, care-car systems, and the like. You may want an extended
warranty if you're planning on keeping the car for a long time.
Also beware of any unexpected dealer ``add ons'' or ``mark ups.''
Fight them.
</P>
<P>
   It is now time to say yes or no. If you have said yes, if you
have made your commitment, go on to No. 1. If not, go back to No.
10 and run the program again. You'll be amazed at what an expert
you've become and how much less threatening the process can be.
</P>
<P>
   1. Forget all the stuff that went on before. Just like a mother
forgets childbirth, you can put the tough parts of the buying
process aside. Goodness knows, you've worked and shopped hard for
this car. Now enjoy. And you don't have to do that by the numbers.
</P>

TRUCKS AND SUVS CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>

 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The SUV and truck industry is about people and vehicles. Folks
buy trucks and SUVs to take skiing, haul boats, lug kids and pets.
Manufacturers market them for active lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   But the SUV and truck phenomenon is also about numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, annual sales of SUVs in the United States have grown
from 900,000 to 3.1 million vehicles. Since the Econoline van was
introduced in 1960, Ford has sold more than 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, trucks continue to account for roughly half of all new
vehicle sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ford soon will have six different SUVs on the market and have
more than 50 variations of its trucks, starting with the
best-selling F-150 and moving up the size scale.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 25 SUVs on the market now with at least
another 20 expected to join in the battle for market share in the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan, being hammered elsewhere, continues to be a strong
player in the Northeast, which accounts for 25 percent of US sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company's hot new Xterra _ Motor Trend's sport/utility of
the year _ has zoomed past Nissan's goal of 52,000 sales with more
than 75,000 units sold. The larger Pathfinder has been a stong
seller and is expected to get a beefed-up V-6 during 2000 to
rectify a notable need.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for niches in the SUV market seems to have no end.
Mercedes is introducing the luxury ML55 AMG. It's got 342
horsepower, goes from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 6.4 seconds, features
18-inch tires and all the bells and whistles you'd expect for
$64,900.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum will be the sixth SUV in the
Ford lineup _ a challenger to Toyota's RAV4 in the small SUV
market. ``It'll be a little more carlike,'' says J.C. Collins,
Ford's SUV Group brand manager. No surprise, it, too, will have a
name beginning with Ex and carry high Expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been in the vanguard of truck and SUV sales, and
management intends to keep the company there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are time-starved,'' says Collins. ``But at the same
time, they're recreation-oriented and participate in the activities
that an SUV is geared to: Lugging skis and skiers into snow
country, mountain biking. The SUV and its capabilities play a big
part in these customers' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Ford's Explorer were 431,000 in 1998 _ higher even than
the best-selling Toyota Camry that year. With Ford introducing a
redesigned Explorer Sport, a new Explorer Sport-Trac, and the new
mini-SUV in the first half of 2000, the company has no plans to
relinquish its position as industry leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Sport-Trac will further close the dividing line between
pickup and SUV, adding a molded cargo area, and optional folding
and lockable tonneau cover, a bed extender, a power rear window and
power outlet in the cargo bed.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also is hitting the market with an new advertising campaign
called ``No Boundaries.'' Each ad is centered around active
lifestyles and features both the Ford brand name and a member of
the SUV lineup.
</P>
<P>
   It's all geared to tie into Ford's already established Ford
Tough and Ford Country campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a line between pickup and SUV.
</P>
<P>
   ``SUV buyers in general look to carry people and cargo inside
their vehicle,'' says Collins, ``whereas a pickup buyer may want
comfort in the cab with a cargo out back.'' The Sport-Trac may
diminish that dividing line a bit. ``Males like this one,'' says
Collins, ``and young and young-thinking females like the Explorer
Sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the big trend in pickup trucks is four-door crew
cabs.
</P>
<P>
   On display at the recent New England Auto Show were Nissan's
Frontier, the first to offer a four-door crew cab in a compact
pickup, and the Dodge Dakota Quad Cab that boasts the most power,
most towing and payload capacity, and seating for six. Soon to come
is Ford's F-150 SuperCrew, the first full-sized four-door pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've positioned ourselves to have the truck that will do the
job you need to get done,'' says Al Giombetti, Ford's truck group
brand manager. ``People still want the capability and versatility
that a pickup offers.''
</P>
<P>
   What's evident is what Collins says: ``It looks like the days of
super-high production runs of individual vehicles are over. We have
to be more responsive to the customer. They speak, we listen, and
the results are all these derivatives of several basic vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimobetti sees no end to the demand for trucks, either. ``Trucks
and vans are solid sellers. There's a huge loyalty factor with our
F-series.'' But he also knows things will continue to change.
``Today's innovations become tomorrow's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which keeps us writing and reading about the industry.

THE ALL-PURPOSE TRUCK GAINS IN COMFORT AND STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't just a truck anymore, or words to that effect, was the
prominent theme in GMC advertising not long ago. But now trucks are
hot, and GMC is putting the emphasis on building trucks. Period.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, anyone shopping for a truck these days will quickly
realize that trucks really aren't just trucks anymore. Although,
there are still some drivers who actually buy trucks to be used as
trucks, more and more people are buying them as a second ``car,''
or, in some cases, as the primary family vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what they say, all manufacturers are building trucks
with carlike handling features, including cab comfort and automatic
transmissions. With trucks capturing some 40 percent of the market,
and holding the two top places in Top 10 vehicle sales each year,
the manufacturers know they have to please a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   Which helps explain why manufacturers are producing more and
more trucks that can serve as the family vehicle. Lincoln is
expected to put into production its Blackwood, which was shown at
the Boston International Auto Show last week. The Blackwood is a
Lincoln Navigator with two rows of seating and a large, covered
pickup bed behind. You can travel in luxury, have the use of a
cargo bed, and have good towing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   More practical for most people might be the new Nissan Frontier
Crew Cab with four real doors and a full-sized backseat. This
compact V-6 truck comes in either two- or four-wheel drive
configurations. While the bed is short, a nice option is a hinged
tubular gate that when sitting on the bed can keep small items at
the cargo gate. Then if you need to carry a longer item, the
tubular gate can be swung out to rest on top of the flat cargo
gate.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing it can't do is carry a 4-by-8-foot sheet of
plywood. But when was the last time you needed to do that? Besides,
if you go to The Home Depot, they'll rent you a truck for that
specific need for less than $20. So, who needs an 8-foot cargo bed?
Very few.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Dakota is also featuring a Quad Cab in its compact
line, and like the Frontier, the doors are front hinged and the cab
is a short 5.3 feet vs. the standard 6.5-foot bed. Dodge is
packaging the truck with a new 4.7-liter 235-horsepower V-8 and a
four-speed automatic transmission that selects between one of two
second gear ratios. Dodge also offers the Dakota ($13,200 to
$19,500) in two bed lengths, regular cab, and a choice of engines
from a 120-horsepower four-cylinder up to a 250-horsepower V-8. The
full-sized Dodge Ram pickups are essentially unchanged for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet and GMC completely redid the Silverado and the Sierra
pickups last year ($15,355 to $32,500). The new trucks are more
rigid, have very roomy cabs, are easier to get into than previous
models, have more power, and brakes that will stop in shorter
distances. For 2000, the trucks will have a four-door extended cab
option. Other options include regular or extended cabs, and
Autotrac four-wheel drive that automatically transfers torque to
the front wheels if the rear wheels are slipping.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevy S10 ($12,108 to $20,192) is the only truck in its
class with standard four-wheel antilock brakes. It comes in two-
and four-wheel drive options, and in a variety of configurations,
including the Xtreme, which tells you all you need to know about
this model.
</P>
<P>
   The GMC Sonoma ($12,600 to $20,500), like the S10, comes in a
variety of configurations and with a choice of engines from a
120-horsepower four-cylinder to a V-8 with 190 horsepower. Manual
and automatic transmissions and two- or four-wheel drives are also
available.
</P>
<P>
   The best-selling vehicle in America is the Ford F-series truck
($15,000 to $30,000). The F-series tops not just truck, but car
sales as well. That alone sends a very positive message about this
line. These trucks come with two- or four-wheel drive, three engine
choices from a 205-horsepower V-6 to a 260-horsepower V-8, a short
or long bed, and regular or extended cab options. New for 2000 are
handy rear-access doors on SuperCab models.
</P>
<P>
   The compact Ford Ranger ($11,700 to $19,400) has been given
extensive equipment upgrades for 2000. Four-wheel drive Rangers
allow the system to be engaged on the fly, no stopping the vehicle
to go into four-wheel drive. Also, the Ranger, along with its
stablemate the Mazda B-series is the only compact to offer two
rear-access panels, for a total of four doors. But while these
compacts have space in the back of the cab, it's a tight fit.
</P>
<P>
   The real workhorse of the Ford line is the F-series Super Duty
($19,000 to $31,000). This new-for-'99 model is designed for
work-related jobs. The truck comes with heavy-duty engine choices
for this type of work including a Triton V-10 and the Navistar
7.3-liter turbo-diesel. While these models handle and ride more
like trucks, the cabs are quite civilized with all the goodies
you'd expect in a fine car.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota shook up the American truck market last year with the
introduction of the Tundra ($17,000 to $28,000), the first
full-sized pickup from a foreign maker. And this truck is a real
contender to steal sales from American manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra rides and handles superbly, comes in bed choices of
eight or 6 1/2 feet, regular or extended cabs, and two engine
choices: a 3.4-liter V-6 or 4.7-liter V-8 (the same one in the
Toyota Land Cruiser). For 2000, Toyota has added four doors to its
extended cab models, all with their own handles.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota also offers the compact Tacoma ($12,600 to $25,600). As
the price range suggests, this model can be had in many
combinations of cabs and beds, and two- or four-wheel drive
versions. Unlike other makes, the Tacoma's four-cylinder engine
gets high marks from enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Also available is the Isuzu Hombre ($11,500 to $21,200).
Basically, it is a Chevy S10 with Isuzu markings.
</P>
<P>
   While all these trucks will do a job, shoppers need to decide
what that job will be. Obviously, if a truck is going to be the
all-around family vehicle, a supercab model would be the first
choice. But then you need to decide how ``super'' the cab should be
in size and comfort. Then you must consider what your ``payload''
is going to be. Chances are you can do with a short bed, rather
than a long one, and you may not need a beefier full-sized pickup
if you are just doing normal hauling.
</P>
<P>
   Decide, too, if you really need four-wheel drive. Only the Chevy
Silverado/GMC Sierra has a system that can be used all the time.
While the V-6 engine is the most popular available on trucks,
buyers have choices that range from small four-cylinder engines to
heavy duty V-10s. For family-type driving, a V-6 or small V-8
should do fine.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks have a lower price tag than most cars, but load it up
with extras and the price can skyrocket.

TRUCKS, SUVS HIT THE TRACK AT 0 TO 60 IN SIX SECONDS, FLAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this a truck or a race car? There are times I feel I need a
harness to hold back all its horses. While I haven't timed it, I've
read the Ford Lightning can do 0 to 60 miles per hour in a flat six
seconds. And, I believe it.
</P>
<P>
   This is a truck, of course, a very fast one. It can beat out
most sports cars at the starting gate (or light), maybe even the
ML55 sports utility from Mercedes. Of course, the Lightning is not
as plush as that Mercedes, but it does go for less than half the
price of a ML55.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Lightning is an F150 4 x 2 with a 5.4-liter Triton
Supercharged Intercooled V-8 with a modified 4R100 four-speed
automatic transmission and lots of heavy-duty equipment from its
battery to its cooler. It's nicely equipped with 6-way power
driver's seat, leather interior, power windows and locks, fog lamps
and more. The only options on it are a towing hitch and 6-disc CD
changer bringing the $29,355 price to $30,450 including $640
destination charge.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a truck to haul things to the dump, it's for show.
You don't have to burn rubber at every light, or challenge a
Porsche. It's a truck to be appreciated for all that's hidden under
the hood.
</P>
<P>
   And to employ a loyal cadre of believers, Ford is building these
SVT (Special Vehicle Team) models with four key ``virtues:''
performance, substance, exclusivity, and value. For that, buyers
will find certified SVT dealers, a certificate of authenticity to
owners showing its production sequence number out of the total
produced each year, a magazine (the SVT Enthusiast), and a discount
at the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance.
</P>
<P>
   When I first drove the Mercedes ML320, I thought it was the best
SUV around. Since that time, it has won accolade after accolade as
outstanding. That model came with a V-6 engine that performed
superbly; it had great pickup, who could want anything more. Then
came the ML430, with V-8 power that literally took off.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mercedes is coming out with a 360-horsepower ML55 that will
do 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 6.3 seconds. Believe me, if the 430 challenged
my belief in the difference between a V-6 and V-8, the ML55 is
going to truly put it to the test. The only thing that puts us all
back to reality is the price tag: around $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   While speed is a selling factor for some trucks and SUVs, what
is really growing, especially in the sport utility field is the
outfitting of these vehicles to individual desires.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover is setting up dealerships that resemble an
outdoorsman's lodge, packed with not only Land Rover models but
also equipment that can be used for hunting, fishing, mountain
biking, you name it. Many of these dealerships also have outdoor
tracks so you can see just how the Discovery will do crossing logs,
or clinging to the side of a hill.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep is promoting a Jeep 101 course that travels from city to
city. They are an opportunity for both owners and prospective
buyers to test a Wrangler, Cherokee, or Grand Cherokee over a run
that includes rocks, log crossings, muddy paths, 30 degree
embankments, as well as some highway driving. If you want to
accessorize the Jeep, there's a whole line of goodies to do so. One
item that intrigued me was a tent that clips to the back of the
Jeep allowing access to the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is offering a full line of SUVs to meet anyone's needs from
the two-door Explorer Sport to the biggest SUV of all, the
Excursion.

   You think you know trucks. You're either a Ford Guy, a Chevy
Guy, a Dodge Guy. A solitary kind of guy. Think again.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, there's a good chance you're not even a guy.
There's a good chance your truck _ even a big, four-door V8 _ may
be none of the above. There's a good chance your truck may be
wrapped in the sheetmetal of a sport utility vehicle. And there's a
good chance your truck/SUV will be hauling not only tools and
materials to the job site, but kids to soccer, and dressed-up
parents to a fancy restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   These are times of great change in the truck/SUV market.
</P>
<P>
   You've got trucks, beds intact, that are more like SUVs. You've
got SUVs, looming presence intact, that are more like cars. Even
Cadillac and Lincoln will have pickup trucks in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   If, for the past couple of years, the truck/SUV world has been a
place of TRUCKS, Page G11 &QL; 
niches, auto anufacturers are now creating veritable crannies
within the niches. Consider the Chrysler PT Cruiser. Is it a car or
a replica 1930s panel truck?
</P>
<P>
   Will the Ford Escape Sport Wagon be a truck or an SUV?
</P>
<P>
   And what of those SUVs riding on car platforms: the Lexus RX
300, Toyota RAV4 (it will get even bigger by 2001), and the Honda
CR-V. How far removed are they, really, from station wagons such as
the Volvo Cross Country?
</P>
<P>
   And what of what will likely be this year's ultimate crossover
vehicle, the BMW X5 _ an SUV developed on the race track?
</P>
<P>
   We are buying pickup trucks _ particularly four-door,
many-passenger jobs _ and SUVs _ which are evolving faster than we
can buy them _ in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The registration of SUVs has about doubled since 1992, tripled
since 1987, according to the US Commerce Department's Census
Bureau. Based on projections from 1997 figures, there are more than
15 million SUVs registered today, up from 7.1 in 1992. There are
nearly 75 million trucks registered, up from 59.2 million in 1992.
That means there is one pickup truck for every five licensed
drivers; one SUV for every 14 licensed drivers.
</P>
<P>
   And in both cases, we are driving myriad vechicles.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive News classifies 2000 small pickup trucks as the
Chevrolet S pickups, Dodge Dakota, Ford Ranger, GMC Sonoma, Isuzu
Hombre, Mazda B series, Nissan Frontier (small, but four doors),
and Toyota Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Its large 2000 trucks are the Chevrolet Silverado, Dodge Ram,
Ford F Series trucks, Ford Super Duty, GMC Sierra, GMC Sierra
Classic, and Toyota Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   Noteable this year is that four doors are available on many of
them, as is seating for six, along with smooth, quiet rides. A
family affair.
</P>
<P>
   Making big news is the Toyota Tundra, a truck Toyota wishes it
had built three years ago. Now, the company has ``gone American''
by giving the Tundra a V-8, 245-horsepower engine, seating for six,
and a sedanlike ride. And, it is being built in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is coming out with an F150 SuperCrew that has four
conventional doors and is a foot longer than the SuperCab.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has seen sales of four-door pickups in its F-Series climb
from 5 percent in the 1996-'97 model years to 70 percent in 1999.
So while Ford has itself not only comfortably ensconced, but
expanded its line in four-door pickups, it is free to roam in more
esoteric fields.
</P>
<P>
   You've got the Roush F-150 _ that's Roush as in NASCAR's Jack
Roush, he of the screaming Mustang. It comes in various levels,
from outside wrapping, through upgraded suspension, wheels and
tires, to full-blown power _ a 5.4 liter, 335-horsepower,
supercharged V-8. Too tame for you? Consider, then, the SVT
Lightning. It's 5.4 liters, 360 supercharged horsepower, 0 to 60 in
about 5.4 seconds. See ya, Mr. Roush.
</P>
<P>
   But even small trucks can have four doors, and leading the way
is the Nissan Frontier Crew Cab. Compact, maneuverable, good to
haul folks and loads. Joining this act will be the Dodge Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet, which lost sales when it missed the four-door pickup
truck boom, is offering the four-door option on several models
including its C/K series.
</P>
<P>
   For Chevy fans, the big news is the new Silverado _ again,
offered with extended cab, four doors. It will be a powerful beast
with a base engine _ V-6, 200-horsepower _ that can be quickly
supplanted by V-8s that deliver 270 and 285 horsepower, a 6.0-liter
that cranks out 300 horsepower, or the 6.5-liter diesel at 215
horsepower, but loaded with torque.
</P>
<P>
   GMC follows its Chevy kin with the Sierra offering an extended
cab, four doors, and more horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Dakota four-door has front-hinged rear doors with
full-sized windows. And in the mainstay Ram, look for upgraded
suspension, steering and brakes _ and don't forget that popular
Cummins Turbo Diesel as an option.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of SUVs, the crossovers are even more fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how many there are now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   According to Automotive News, small SUVs include the Chevrolet
Tracker, Honda CR-V, Isuzu Amigo, Isuzu VehiCross, Jeep Wrangler,
Kia Sportage, Nissan Xterra, Suzuki Vitara, Suzuki Grand Vitara,
Toyota RAV4.
</P>
<P>
   At midrange are the BMW X5, Chevrolet Blazer, Dodge Durango,
Ford Explorer, GMC Jimmy and Envoy, Honda Passport, Infiniti QX-4,
Isuzu Rodeo, Isuzu Trooper, Jeep Cherokee, Jeep Grand Cherokee,
Land Rover Discovery, Land Rover Range Rover, Lexus LX 450, Lexus
RX 300, Mercedes M Class, Mercury Mountaineer, Mitsubishi Montero,
Mitsubishi Montero Sport, Nissan Pathfinder, Oldsmobile Bravada,
Toyota 4Runner, and Toyota Land Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   And largest are the AM General Hummer, Cadillac Escalade,
Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Tahoe, Ford Expedition, Ford
Excursion, GMC Yukon XL, GMC Yukon and Denali, and Lincoln
Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the biggest wake is the new Ford Excursion, perched atop
an F250 platform and easily the largest SUV roaming the roads.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevrolet Suburban, long the leader of the big boats, has
gotten rounder, and its sister, the GMC Suburban, is now known as
the Yukon XL.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the news is big.
</P>
<P>
   BMW is refusing to call its new X5 an SUV. Sport activity
vehicle is the preferred term. And if 0 to 60 mile per hour in 7.2
seconds and a top speed of 130 m.p.h. is your idea of activity in a
rig that looks like an SUV, then the $50,000 X5 may be your cup of
tea.
</P>
<P>
   But diversity being the name of the game in SUVs, there is
excitment farther down the economic scale.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at Gen-Xers is the Nissan Xterra, a sport ute based on the
Frontier pickup truck. Water resistant seats (kayaking); storage
bins atop the roof (hiking, other activities), it has action
written all over it. And at a base price of $17,500, it's got good
deal written all over it as well.
</P>
<P>
   These are days of rapid evolution in the world of trucks and
SUVs. The models you first meet this year may be radically
different three years from now.
</P>
<P>
   And it will get harder and harder to answer the question: ``Am I
driving a truck, an SUV, or a car?''
</P>

FORGET SUVS, HOW ABOUT A 1931 ROADSTER/PICKUP? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLESBORO, MAINE _ When the ever-efficient ferry Margaret Chase
Smith dropped us off on this island off the coast of Maine,
Vacation '99 was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the island itself changes little from year to year,
each visit brings greater understanding about how life is lived out
in the middle of Penobscot Bay. Arriving ``on island'' this summer,
I was ready for the annual rummage sale, the Ice Cream race, the
Island Forum programs, the Historical Society's annual meeting and
a few cocktail parties _ in short, your normal not-so-quiet
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   But what I probably enjoyed the most was the island auto show.
This unofficial collection of vehicles clearly reveals what a big
part trucks (and now SUVs) have played in island life over the
years. They deliver, haul, go over roads that aren't really roads,
and do heavy-duty work. And, apparently, it's been that way since
motorized vehicles replaced horses _ a good 20 years later on
island than on the mainland because the original ferries were
barges more suited for carrying four-legged, rather than
four-wheeled, cargo. Indeed, old pickups, Jeeps, and panel trucks
used to dot the seaside landscape before a huge environmental
cleanup a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour after disembarking from the ferry, we drove by
arguably the nicest '40 Ford pickup I've ever seen, parked in front
of Bob Leach's garage. That was quickly followed by a 1928 Ford
Model A station wagon delivery truck.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there was old friend Charlie Pendleton (for whom the
Charlie Pendleton Band is named) roaring by in his aquamarine 1966
Pontiac Catalina convertible that looks as nice as when it rolled
off a GM assembly line. But beecause it's not a truck, we'll talk
about his car another time.
</P>
<P>
   A generalization from 15 years of summer visits: Islanders love
full-size Chevy pickups, most likely because Dutch Chevrolet in
Belfast is the nearest dealership. Summer residents love SUVs, a
trend that started 15 years ago with Suburbans and VW buses and
continues today with an array of Cherokees, Explorers, Rodeos,
4Runners, Pathfinders, Bravadas, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Being a superstitious sort, I immediately decided to mix
business and pleasure, determining to track down the owners of the
vintage vehicles and do a story. In the process, yet another
interesting antique truck came out of its garage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The '28 Woody
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We found the '28 Woody wagon parked in front of Stan and Nancy
Van Horn's new gift shop, The Islesboro Artisans. The shop was
sensational, but the story behind the car was even more so.
</P>
<P>
   It was sold out from under, so to speak, it's original owner, an
``older woman'' in Blue Hill, Maine, when she was hospitalized. The
car _ and its owner _ had been around.
</P>
<P>
   The gear shift knob is a polo ball, courtesy of Will Rodgers,
and it sports a Virgin Islands inspection sticker from the days
when it was nicknamed ``double trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   On its trip to this island it encountered tire trouble on the
ferry and the aforementioned Bob Leach came to the rescue,
sandblasting a wheel to get a good seal for the tire.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The '40s pickup
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of which brings us back to Leach's garage and the '40 Ford
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you saw that, huh?'' says Leach, trying his best to
politely ignore this island newcomer (only 20 summers). ``Well it
belongs to one of our summer residents, and I really don't think
he'd want to talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   To make a long story somewhat shorter, it took a few phone calls
_ to (yet more hints) islanders Bud Mitchell, Ralph Gray, and Suki
Love, and the '40 Ford pickup's owner returned a call.
</P>
<P>
   He was more than happy to talk about his car. It had been
lovingly restored by a friend and was a ``hot rod'' for its time _
the flathead was bored out and it had high compression Offenhauser
heads. He graciously invited us to visit and photograph the '40
Ford while begging us not to reveal his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another hint: He wasn't John Travolta, even though that was
Travolta's Rolls in Leach's Garage on another day, but that isn't
part of this story and Bob Leach wouldn't confirm that identity,
either.
</P>
<P>
   When our subject said to please identify him only as a West
Coast entertainment executive, my wife asked, ``Couldn't that mean
he makes porn movies?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, but the movie ``Potrait of a Lady'' is among
his directing credits and we apologize if this spoils his ``cover''
for he truly is a gentleman, one who says that the island actually
is an ideal place to keep and drive an antique car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roads are such that you wind up driving between 25 and 40
miles an hour _ perfect for these cars.'' And the exhaust tone when
he fired up the Ford to move it for photos . . . well, it was to
die for.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more.
</P>
<P>
   Leach then unveiled a sister to the '40 Ford _ a 1931 Model A
roadster/pickup. It's just what the name suggests. A pickup with a
convertible roof over the cab.
</P>
<P>
   It, too, has been lovingly restored, the winner of every show in
which it has been entered.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing what Ford developed almost 70 years ago, makes me chuckle
when I see the new Ford Explorer Sport-Trac _ an SUV cab with a
pickup bed in back. It shows that today's trend to hybrid
combinations of cars and trucks is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   We're reinventing our wheels all the time.
</P>
<P>
   And making them better.

MAZDA'S REVAMPED MPV SETS NEW PACE FOR MINIVAN LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, Honda took the accolades for its Odyssey minivan.
It's still a winner, but this year, Mazda's all new MPV has some
innovative features that may just put it in your winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the $20,000 MPV apart is its use of ``theater seating,''
roll-down windows on the sliding doors, Side-by-Slide second-row
seating, and a Tumble-Under rear seat that folds flat on the floor
in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Side-by-Slide seating offers both captain's chairs and a
bench seat by moving fore and aft and side to side, something not
possible in other minivans. The rear seat, which is raised slightly
for ``theater seating,'' can also be flipped to the rear when the
liftgate is open for use at a picnic or tailgate party.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mazda is not the biggest of minivans, it claims its
OptiSpace design provides more foot room and better use of overall
space to create a feeling of roominess.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda Odyssey ($25,800 for the EX), last year's standout, is
still a winner from any angle. It has performance, styling, great
features including dual power sliding doors, and innovative seating
that includes a fold-away rear seat that can also double as a
picnic center.
</P>
<P>
   The General Motors family of minivans _ Chevrolet Venture
($23,195), Pontiac Montana ($23,895), and Oldsmobile Silhouette
($30,605 for the Premier) _ are all similar in ride, seating,
space, and power. There are, however, differences in options. The
Chevy, for example, has a well-designed built-in child's seat,
while the Olds and Pontiac have great on-board video systems
complete with hookups for video games. All the vans have lots of
storage bags, side-air bags, and an on-board air compressor to blow
up all the inflatables you need.
</P>
<P>
   For the most variations in minivans, no one beats
DaimlerChrysler, the company that invented the minivan, and is
still the sales leader. The Chrysler products offer two different
wheelbases and six different drivetrains. The Chrysler Town &AMP;
Country ($26,360) and the Dodge Caravan ($29,405) are the only
minivans with all-wheel drive. Dodge also offers a sport package
that includes AutoStick, an automanual transmission. The Plymouth
Voyager ($18,685) is the lowest-priced member of the family.
</P>
<P>
   If you're comparing minivans and looking for a benchmark, the
Dodge Caravan is the top seller in the country. About the only
thing it doesn't offer is a power sliding door.
</P>
<P>
   The Sienna ($27,700) is everything you'd expect from a Toyota.
It is refined, quiet, and offers good performance. The minivan
comes with V-6 power and is based on the Camry platform. The Sienna
comes with lots of standard safety equipment, and, like the Ford
Windstar and Honda Odyseey, has a five-star crash protection rating
from the National Highway Traffic Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury Villager ($25,015) and Nissan Quest ($22,160) are a
bit smaller than other minivans, but they offer a good, carlike
ride. Video entertainment systems for rear passengers will be an
option for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Windstar ($27,500) is one of the most spacious and best
performing vehicles in this category. It took a while for Ford to
add dual side doors, which are larger than most for easy access.
Power side doors are an option, and the Windstar includes sensors
on the rear to warn if something is in the way when backing up and
a ``conversation mirror'' that can help keep tabs on those in back.
</P>
<P>
   Minvans are great people and cargo haulers, but not all minivans
are created equal. Most claim carlike handling, but only you can
decide if a model feels more like a car than a van.
</P>
<P>
   Other things to consider when shopping for minivans include
engine noise, pickup and stopping time _ even within the same
family of minivans. Be sure to test a vehicle that is equipped the
way you'd like; adding lots of options can change the way the
vehicle handles.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Clinton has paid dues on abortion issue
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abortion-rights advocates are coming ritually unglued over the
compromise the Clinton administration agreed to in order to free up
funds to pay America's U.N. dues. They overreact. If they really
want to scare themselves, the advocates need to check out the Bush
campaign's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, a spokeswoman for George W. Bush suggested, does not
go far enough to harry and penalize foreign family-planning
organizations that support lawful abortion, or support merely
less-harsh anti-abortion laws.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Republican leadership holding U.S. participation
in the United Nations hostage to a rump of anti-abortion zealots,
the Clinton administration had little choice but to take the
compromise that pays our $926 million arrears and finally ends
Washington's embarrassing status as the world's biggest freeloader.
</P>
<P>
   The White House accepted a provision that bars U.S. funds from
family-planning efforts abroad if the agencies also perform
abortions or even support abortion. That cutoff has been the goal
of anti-abortion activists for years. President Clinton vetoed
previous efforts, but with the United States, after years of
domestic deadlock, on the verge of losing its U.N. vote over unpaid
dues, what was a president to do?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, to listen to the abortion-rights groups, go ahead
and lose our U.N. vote and as a result lose our purchase on
international leadership in general. Choice advocates are treating
the agreement as if it were not only a regrettable retreat from
principle on Clinton's part _ as it is _ but as if it presaged the
end of lawful abortion. It does not, at least not by the hand of
this administration.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise is more screwy than dangerous. It includes a
provision for the president to waive the prohibition. The penalty
would be $12.5 million cut from U.S. aid to family planning
overseas, with the money going to aid for children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to sign the waiver promptly. The loss from
the international family planning budget will be just 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By far the larger danger to free choice resides, not in this
forced and reluctant fudging by a president who has defended choice
stoutly, but by a Republican Party that continues in the thrall of
its plentiful anti-abortion absolutists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's people promised that the GOP nominee in waiting would
withhold by executive order all U.S. funds from any international
family planning agency that endorses abortion, as President Reagan
did, and as Clinton quickly undid.
</P>
<P>
   And GOP House leadership remains unable or unwilling to stop the
party's anti-abortion hotshots from undermining and outright
menacing major U.S. national interests to score even small but
showy points like this one.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that the issue worked against them in recent
elections, Bush and the GOP are trying to soft-pedal their standing
commitment to end lawful abortion, but the confrontation over U.N.
dues has smoked both out. Their opposition to legal abortion,
however demure it may be when circumstances allow, is intact.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Wifely three-step lag is baffling
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 21, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a question I often wanted to ask my wife for most of
our 46 years of marriage. Continually having her trailing three
steps behind me while walking in public is a great annoyance
inasmuch as I unceasingly am compelled to turn around to see if she
has stopped to window shop without signaling me or been carried off
by kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been times when I have walked more than 100 yards,
turned around and could not locate her, she having peeled off to
stop into a store. And what about those times when I thought she
was with me and I began talking aloud (and alone, much to the
amusement of passing strangers)?
</P>
<P>
   Our relationship has pretty much been 50-50, except for the
three-step lag. She takes no guff from me and I none from her. We
are independent people who usually like the same things and the
same people.
</P>
<P>
   The three-step lag should not be considered some manner of
subservience; Lord no! While some might think ours is a stormy
relationship, it is not. We understand, enjoy and appreciate each
other. Our marriage is solid.
</P>
<P>
   But to the question: I finally blurted it out the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, when we were standing in front of the rabbi on our wedding
day,'' I began, ``I stopped the proceedings for a moment and said
there was one stipulation that must be met _ and that was you would
have to walk three steps behind me for the next 46 years, what
would you have said?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy,'' she retorted. ``I would have thrown my wedding
bouquet in your face, said nothing and walked away from the
ceremony, you pig!''
</P>
<P>
   I don't doubt it. But the stipulation was not made because I did
not know at the time that she was a three-step lagger. Through the
years, in commiseration with other husbands, I have come to find my
wife's cadence is not unique. It seemingly is epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   (One person also reminded me that there are countries in which
women walk ahead of the men; countries peppered with land mines.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, the first analysis from the female side is that we males
walk too fast. I disproved that with a simple test. Walking at my
usual pace, my wife fell three steps behind me within seconds.
Continuing that pace, she still stayed three steps behind me.
</P>
<P>
   The only time we seemingly walk together is when it is raining
and we have but one umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how fast or slow I walk, she stays three steps behind
me, other than when she stops to window shop or is fighting off
kidnappers. How does she do that? It's like she's achieved some
sort of orbit and stays there. While it frustrates me, I admire her
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   She cannot explain this other than to grumble about having
shorter legs, which, I remind her, are just as short after she
falls three steps behind but stays on pace. Add that to the fact
that I have relatively short legs as well, and consistently am
passed up by swift, short-legged women while doing my daily hike in
the park. (On those rare days when my wife joins me in the park,
she stays three steps behind me. Baffling!)
</P>
<P>
   To compound this confounded situation, there are times when she
dashes past me like a greyhound chasing a rabbit. Those occasions
usually occur when I turn boorish for whatever reason men turn
boorish, and she wants to show her displeasure by whizzing past me
into a kitchen supply store.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, I make an effort to lag myself, slowing my walk
to a near standstill. And I look back. And she still is three steps
behind. ``How do you do that?'' I would demand of her, and she'd
just smile; you know, that sneering smile that tells you she is
woman and that you can't get inside her head.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other husbands, I am resigned to the three-step lag.
Nothing is going to change. I am going to continue looking over my
shoulder to find her.
</P>
<P>
   The good news about it is that she's usually there.

BACK IN '78, HE WAS A SUBURBAN PIONEER

<P>
   This is one time when I was ahead of the curve.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The day: February 6.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cold Monday, with off-and-on spitting snow. That night
I was at the college hockey Beanpot Tournament as the snow turned
into the Blizzard of '78.
</P>
<P>
   But that morning and early afternoon had been spent at Davy
Chevrolet in Danvers negotiating the trade of my 1976 Plymouth
Volare station wagon for a 1978 Chevy Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, the deal was done. I don't remember the
figures, but it was a very good deal. Of course, the sticker for a
Silverado Suburban (I still have it) was $8,381.70, with the
Silverado package accounting for $635. The 31-gallon fuel tank
cost, of all things, $31. Who says auto makers didn't have a sense
of humor?
</P>
<P>
   Friends thought I'd taken leave of my senses.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd had it with the Volare's drivability problems. (It
stalled most every time it was asked to take a sharp left turn from
a stop because its one-barrel carburetor needed regular replacement
of both accelerator pumps and floats).
</P>
<P>
   The Suburban (I called it a truck at the time, never having
heard of a sport utility vehichle) seemed like the perfect answer.
Here are the things I loved about the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution-control devices? It really didn't have any unless you
consider a PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) valve that sucked
crankcase fumes back through the carburetor. It delivered 15 miles
per gallon as long as the air cleaner was changed regularly, which
it was for 115,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Space? Unbelievable. When the twins (the same ones who were
married last month in a double wedding) couldn't get along with
their younger brother, one got the rear seat, the other the third
seat, and the third in the cargo area. You have to remember,
seatbelts weren't much in use in those days and car seats were just
coming into their own.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility. I didn't realize it when I was sitting in the
showroom, but this may have been the biggest advantage of this
vehicle. You sat way above the crowd when you were in a Suburban.
Trucks and SUVs didn't make up 25 percent of the traffic on the
Expressway as they do today, and you could see way down the road.
That is one thing I envy today whenever I'm stuck behind a truck or
SUV, and that's more often the case than not as they occupy an
increasing share of the roadways.
</P>
<P>
   Hauling capacity. Packing for vacation consisted of throwing
everything and anything we wanted to take in the back, putting five
bicycles on my homemade roof rack, and taking off. We never took
the kitchen sink, but we always brought a barbeque grill.
</P>
<P>
   Image. The Suburban was hardly a status symbol. It was big,
solid black, and menacing. You were accorded respect at
intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Foul weather capability. The best that can be said is that it
sat so high you didn't get stuck in deep snow. But it was two-wheel
drive and was tough to stop on packed snow and impossible on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Size. We felt safe. The hood was huge. The vehicle was heavy.
Fortunately, in eight years, the only accidents were minor: My
backing-up dent in the tailgate and Mrs. G's close encounter with a
parked VW in a local parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Uniqueness. For several years, we were an anomaly. A few folks
had conversion vans, but the truck revolution was still a long way
away.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to replace the Suburban, the price of a
similarly equipped vehicle had tripled making another one way out
of our price range.
</P>
<P>
   But, even though we were priced out of the new market, back in
1987 we had decided bigger was still better and the next two
Griffith family vehicles came out of the same mold: used Ford
Chateau Vans.
</P>
<P>
   The vans had the same advantages and kept hauling us on
vacations and delivered the aforementioned twins (and enough
paraphernalia for dorm rooms) to college in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, I was selling off part of the used-car lot that
our driveway had become and wound up selling the second Ford van
(still running and looking great with 127,000 miles on it).
</P>
<P>
   Today, I drive a sedan and cuss the SUVs in the passing lane
because I can't see around them.
</P>
<P>
   Davy Chevrolet and my original Suburban no longer exist. Of
course, memories of our Suburban remain. One of the best is from
the Great Blizzard. We'd closed the deal on Monday and were to pick
it up on Tuesday. Wrong. Instead, we sat home and dug out of the
snowy aftermath and finally took delivery 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's no longer a unique vehicle except for its size.
</P>
<P>
   And every manufacturer has an entry or three aimed at this share
of the market.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the SUV is here to stay.

COMPETITION IS FIERCE IN THE SUV MARKET

<P>
   Just when you thought there could be nothing new under the sun
in sport utility vehicles, along comes BMW with a novel twist _
design an SUV that performs like a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW X5 is officially listed as a truck, but BMW says it will
handle and have the power of a BMW car. It is equipped with a
32-valve, V-8 engine with 282 horsepower, and has a five-speed
automatic Steptronic transmission along with full-time
all-wheel-drive.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's new marketing stragegy took a different tack _ big is
better. The company is calling the Excursion the ``king of the
road,'' even if critics compare it to a huge ship _ Titanic.
Excursion, however, is in no danger of sinking. Ford already has
some 50,000 orders for the huge SUV. Since 1935, General Motors has
commanded this ``big'' field with its Suburban model. The Excursion
now takes the title, running 7.4 inches longer, 5 inches higher,
and 1.2 inches wider than the Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Size doesn't come without a price. Excursion, which will sell in
the mid $30,000 range, most likely won't fit in the garage. In
fact, it will be tough to park it almost anywhere. It also gets
terrible mileage: around 13 miles per gallon in city driving.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're looking to comfortably cart nine of your friends
and still have cargo space, and a 9,600-pound towing capacity, this
baby is for you. The Excursion is powered by a Triton V-10 engine
with 310 horsepower, the only V-10 in a sports utility.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors isn't sitting by idly. While not matching Ford
size for size, it is offering a new Chevy Suburban, while its twin,
the GMC Suburban now becomes the Yukon. Both vehicles have been
redesigned with new stiffer bodies. The monsters can pull up to
10,500 pounds, come in either four-wheel or two-wheel drive
versions, can carry up to nine passengers, and have lots of comfort
features like optional second-row reclining bucket seats.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's newest entry in the field is the Xterra, designed to
fit the lifestyles of active people. It can be used as an off-road
vehicle and is packed with storage spaces. The Xterra has features
such as a roofrack that can handle 125 pounds, and an optional
removable front basket that can carry up to 30 pounds of wet gear.
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle is also spacious _ bigger than a Jeep Cherokee or
Toyota RAV4 _ and has lots of storage area. The rear seat sits
higher, offering passengers a better view. When the seats are not
needed, the cushions can be removed to provide a flat cargo area
with the seats folded down.
</P>
<P>
   To design the vehicle, Nissan went to trail heads, surfing
spots, campgrounds, etc. to watch people using sport utilities.
What they found were people with sedans and trucks, not SUVs,
outfitted with bungee cords, racks, and compartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered a whole generation of young buyers who use their
vehicles like they use a good piece of sports equipment; and most
SUVs today are either too expensive or lacking the basic utility to
meet their needs,'' says Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan
Design International in California.
</P>
<P>
   His comments ring a bell with this non-SUV owner. Attending a
recent Jeep 101 program, I put a Grand Cherokee through its paces,
then tried a plain Cherokee. I told a Jeep representative I liked
the Grand Cherokee best. He said he preferred the plain Cherokee _
``it's $18,000 less,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ultimate sport utility for a hot rodder is the
Mercedes-Benz ML55, a souped-up version of its popular ML sport
utilities. The ML55 can do 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than 6.9
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   While its going to be the fastest on the road, Mercedes doesn't
recommend taking it off the road. (With a $60,000-plus price tag,
almost $21,000 more than a ML430, who wants to cause problems?)
</P>
<P>
   The sport utility category has become a major factor in most
company's total sales figures. Lincoln has outsold Cadillac on the
basis of its Navigator. Lexus has become the top-selling luxury
maker since it added the RX300. Even more companies are about to
jump in: Volkswagen and Porche are working jointly on producing
individual models. Hyundai will offer the Santa Fe next year, and
Ford is coming up with some new models and variations on present
models.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHAT'S THE LINE ON VIRTUAL VEGAS?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Nov. 21.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ A few years ago, an old pal whose name often appears
in the papers got a call from the district attorney's office in
Nassau County, a New York suburb. The cops said, we know you've
phoned a bookie 450 times to bet on sporting events, because the
line was tapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to talk to my lawyer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the prosecutors lost interest in my famous friend. And
he has lost interest in dealing with illegal bookmakers, if not in
gambling on the fortunes of the Giants and the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I place my bets on line through a site in Costa Rica,'' he
said the other day. ``It works like a charm.''
</P>
<P>
   A search engine reveals some 400 Web sites that offer gambling,
often from such Caribbean locales as Antigua and Curacao. All it
takes to get into the action is a credit card. Like Vegas, the
virtual casinos never close. Unlike Vegas, you're not expected to
tip the dealer if you win.
</P>
<P>
   There are no signs yet that the offshore sites pose a threat to
this gambling mecca, which is on track to host a record 34 million
visitors this year.
</P>
<P>
   There's another statistic, however, that the Las Vegas
Convention and Visitors Authority is considerably less eager to
publicize: In 1998, a typical year, players left behind $7 billion
in Las Vegas casinos.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, worldwide online gambling revenue is expected to
total $1.2 billion this year. Like just about everything else to do
with the Internet, people in the know expect business to boom.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a sop to local sensibilities, the just-ended fall
Comdex computer trade show, which drew 200,000 attendees, didn't
tout online gambling sales booths amid all the Internet fever.
</P>
<P>
   But the most recent issue of Casino Player, to be found in many
Las Vegas hotel rooms, features dozen of ads for online action. And
many of the Web sites are linked to various Vegas gambling
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, today's art-collecting gambling lords, as
the legitimate heirs of the Los Angeles mobsters who founded this
place, are claiming a piece of the cyberaction.
</P>
<P>
   They probably would agree with Tom Bell, of the libertarian Cato
Institute, who believes technology gives the gamblers a free ride.
Says Bell: ``The Internet's inherently open architecture already
hobbles law enforcement officials. Relentless innovation ensures
they they will only fall farther and farther behind.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't kept the feds from trying. In a test case brought in
New York, nine people charged with breaking the nation's wire laws
pleaded guilty. Cases against four others are pending, and seven
more remain fugitives. Two cases were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 1999 awaits
floor action in the Senate, with 23 current co-sponsors. A similar
House bill is moving forward. An aide to the chief Senate author,
Arizona Republican John Kyl, says it stands a good chance of
passage next year.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, don't bet against the odds that my celebrity
pal will be heavily ``comped'' with all kinds of Vegas-style
freebies as he continues to bet on his favorite teams _ on line or
off.

TRUCKS, SUVS HIT THE TRACK AT 0 TO 60 IN SIX SECONDS, FLAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this a truck or a race car? There are times I feel I need a
harness to hold back all its horses. While I haven't timed it, I've
read the Ford Lightning can do 0 to 60 miles per hour in a flat six
seconds. And, I believe it.
</P>
<P>
   This is a truck, of course, a very fast one. It can beat out
most sports cars at the starting gate (or light), maybe even the
ML55 sports utility from Mercedes. Of course, the Lightning is not
as plush as that Mercedes, but it does go for less than half the
price of a ML55.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Lightning is an F150 4 x 2 with a 5.4-liter Triton
Supercharged Intercooled V-8 with a modified 4R100 four-speed
automatic transmission and lots of heavy-duty equipment from its
battery to its cooler. It's nicely equipped with 6-way power
driver's seat, leather interior, power windows and locks, fog lamps
and more. The only options on it are a towing hitch and 6-disc CD
changer bringing the $29,355 price to $30,450 including $640
destination charge.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a truck to haul things to the dump, it's for show.
You don't have to burn rubber at every light, or challenge a
Porsche. It's a truck to be appreciated for all that's hidden under
the hood.
</P>
<P>
   And to employ a loyal cadre of believers, Ford is building these
SVT (Special Vehicle Team) models with four key ``virtues:''
performance, substance, exclusivity, and value. For that, buyers
will find certified SVT dealers, a certificate of authenticity to
owners showing its production sequence number out of the total
produced each year, a magazine (the SVT Enthusiast), and a discount
at the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance.
</P>
<P>
   When I first drove the Mercedes ML320, I thought it was the best
SUV around. Since that time, it has won accolade after accolade as
outstanding. That model came with a V-6 engine that performed
superbly; it had great pickup, who could want anything more. Then
came the ML430, with V-8 power that literally took off.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mercedes is coming out with a 360-horsepower ML55 that will
do 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 6.3 seconds. Believe me, if the 430 challenged
my belief in the difference between a V-6 and V-8, the ML55 is
going to truly put it to the test. The only thing that puts us all
back to reality is the price tag: around $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   While speed is a selling factor for some trucks and SUVs, what
is really growing, especially in the sport utility field is the
outfitting of these vehicles to individual desires.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover is setting up dealerships that resemble an
outdoorsman's lodge, packed with not only Land Rover models but
also equipment that can be used for hunting, fishing, mountain
biking, you name it. Many of these dealerships also have outdoor
tracks so you can see just how the Discovery will do crossing logs,
or clinging to the side of a hill.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep is promoting a Jeep 101 course that travels from city to
city. They are an opportunity for both owners and prospective
buyers to test a Wrangler, Cherokee, or Grand Cherokee over a run
that includes rocks, log crossings, muddy paths, 30 degree
embankments, as well as some highway driving. If you want to
accessorize the Jeep, there's a whole line of goodies to do so. One
item that intrigued me was a tent that clips to the back of the
Jeep allowing access to the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is offering a full line of SUVs to meet anyone's needs from
the two-door Explorer Sport to the biggest SUV of all, the
Excursion.

<P>
   This is one time when I was ahead of the curve.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The day: February 6.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cold Monday, with off-and-on spitting snow. That night
I was at the college hockey Beanpot Tournament as the snow turned
into the Blizzard of '78.
</P>
<P>
   But that morning and early afternoon had been spent at Davy
Chevrolet in Danvers negotiating the trade of my 1976 Plymouth
Volare station wagon for a 1978 Chevy Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, the deal was done. I don't remember the
figures, but it was a very good deal. Of course, the sticker for a
Silverado Suburban (I still have it) was $8,381.70, with the
Silverado package accounting for $635. The 31-gallon fuel tank
cost, of all things, $31. Who says auto makers didn't have a sense
of humor?
</P>
<P>
   Friends thought I'd taken leave of my senses.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd had it with the Volare's drivability problems. (It
stalled most every time it was asked to take a sharp left turn from
a stop because its one-barrel carburetor needed regular replacement
of both accelerator pumps and floats).
</P>
<P>
   The Suburban (I called it a truck at the time, never having
heard of a sport utility vehichle) seemed like the perfect answer.
Here are the things I loved about the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution-control devices? It really didn't have any unless you
consider a PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) valve that sucked
crankcase fumes back through the carburetor. It delivered 15 miles
per gallon as long as the air cleaner was changed regularly, which
it was for 115,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Space? Unbelievable. When the twins (the same ones who were
married last month in a double wedding) couldn't get along with
their younger brother, one got the rear seat, the other the third
seat, and the third in the cargo area. You have to remember,
seatbelts weren't much in use in those days and car seats were just
coming into their own.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility. I didn't realize it when I was sitting in the
showroom, but this may have been the biggest advantage of this
vehicle. You sat way above the crowd when you were in a Suburban.
Trucks and SUVs didn't make up 25 percent of the traffic on the
Expressway as they do today, and you could see way down the road.
That is one thing I envy today whenever I'm stuck behind a truck or
SUV, and that's more often the case than not as they occupy an
increasing share of the roadways.
</P>
<P>
   Hauling capacity. Packing for vacation consisted of throwing
everything and anything we wanted to take in the back, putting five
bicycles on my homemade roof rack, and taking off. We never took
the kitchen sink, but we always brought a barbeque grill.
</P>
<P>
   Image. The Suburban was hardly a status symbol. It was big,
solid black, and menacing. You were accorded respect at
intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Foul weather capability. The best that can be said is that it
sat so high you didn't get stuck in deep snow. But it was two-wheel
drive and was tough to stop on packed snow and impossible on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Size. We felt safe. The hood was huge. The vehicle was heavy.
Fortunately, in eight years, the only accidents were minor: My
backing-up dent in the tailgate and Mrs. G's close encounter with a
parked VW in a local parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Uniqueness. For several years, we were an anomaly. A few folks
had conversion vans, but the truck revolution was still a long way
away.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to replace the Suburban, the price of a
similarly equipped vehicle had tripled making another one way out
of our price range.
</P>
<P>
   But, even though we were priced out of the new market, back in
1987 we had decided bigger was still better and the next two
Griffith family vehicles came out of the same mold: used Ford
Chateau Vans.
</P>
<P>
   The vans had the same advantages and kept hauling us on
vacations and delivered the aforementioned twins (and enough
paraphernalia for dorm rooms) to college in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, I was selling off part of the used-car lot that
our driveway had become and wound up selling the second Ford van
(still running and looking great with 127,000 miles on it).
</P>
<P>
   Today, I drive a sedan and cuss the SUVs in the passing lane
because I can't see around them.
</P>
<P>
   Davy Chevrolet and my original Suburban no longer exist. Of
course, memories of our Suburban remain. One of the best is from
the Great Blizzard. We'd closed the deal on Monday and were to pick
it up on Tuesday. Wrong. Instead, we sat home and dug out of the
snowy aftermath and finally took delivery 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's no longer a unique vehicle except for its size.
</P>
<P>
   And every manufacturer has an entry or three aimed at this share
of the market.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the SUV is here to stay.

COMPETITION IS FIERCE IN THE SUV MARKET

<P>
   Just when you thought there could be nothing new under the sun
in sport utility vehicles, along comes BMW with a novel twist _
design an SUV that performs like a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW X5 is officially listed as a truck, but BMW says it will
handle and have the power of a BMW car. It is equipped with a
32-valve, V-8 engine with 282 horsepower, and has a five-speed
automatic Steptronic transmission along with full-time
all-wheel-drive.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's new marketing stragegy took a different tack _ big is
better. The company is calling the Excursion the ``king of the
road,'' even if critics compare it to a huge ship _ Titanic.
Excursion, however, is in no danger of sinking. Ford already has
some 50,000 orders for the huge SUV. Since 1935, General Motors has
commanded this ``big'' field with its Suburban model. The Excursion
now takes the title, running 7.4 inches longer, 5 inches higher,
and 1.2 inches wider than the Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Size doesn't come without a price. Excursion, which will sell in
the mid $30,000 range, most likely won't fit in the garage. In
fact, it will be tough to park it almost anywhere. It also gets
terrible mileage: around 13 miles per gallon in city driving.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're looking to comfortably cart nine of your friends
and still have cargo space, and a 9,600-pound towing capacity, this
baby is for you. The Excursion is powered by a Triton V-10 engine
with 310 horsepower, the only V-10 in a sports utility.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors isn't sitting by idly. While not matching Ford
size for size, it is offering a new Chevy Suburban, while its twin,
the GMC Suburban now becomes the Yukon. Both vehicles have been
redesigned with new stiffer bodies. The monsters can pull up to
10,500 pounds, come in either four-wheel or two-wheel drive
versions, can carry up to nine passengers, and have lots of comfort
features like optional second-row reclining bucket seats.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's newest entry in the field is the Xterra, designed to
fit the lifestyles of active people. It can be used as an off-road
vehicle and is packed with storage spaces. The Xterra has features
such as a roofrack that can handle 125 pounds, and an optional
removable front basket that can carry up to 30 pounds of wet gear.
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle is also spacious _ bigger than a Jeep Cherokee or
Toyota RAV4 _ and has lots of storage area. The rear seat sits
higher, offering passengers a better view. When the seats are not
needed, the cushions can be removed to provide a flat cargo area
with the seats folded down.
</P>
<P>
   To design the vehicle, Nissan went to trail heads, surfing
spots, campgrounds, etc. to watch people using sport utilities.
What they found were people with sedans and trucks, not SUVs,
outfitted with bungee cords, racks, and compartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered a whole generation of young buyers who use their
vehicles like they use a good piece of sports equipment; and most
SUVs today are either too expensive or lacking the basic utility to
meet their needs,'' says Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan
Design International in California.
</P>
<P>
   His comments ring a bell with this non-SUV owner. Attending a
recent Jeep 101 program, I put a Grand Cherokee through its paces,
then tried a plain Cherokee. I told a Jeep representative I liked
the Grand Cherokee best. He said he preferred the plain Cherokee _
``it's $18,000 less,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ultimate sport utility for a hot rodder is the
Mercedes-Benz ML55, a souped-up version of its popular ML sport
utilities. The ML55 can do 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than 6.9
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   While its going to be the fastest on the road, Mercedes doesn't
recommend taking it off the road. (With a $60,000-plus price tag,
almost $21,000 more than a ML430, who wants to cause problems?)
</P>
<P>
   The sport utility category has become a major factor in most
company's total sales figures. Lincoln has outsold Cadillac on the
basis of its Navigator. Lexus has become the top-selling luxury
maker since it added the RX300. Even more companies are about to
jump in: Volkswagen and Porche are working jointly on producing
individual models. Hyundai will offer the Santa Fe next year, and
Ford is coming up with some new models and variations on present
models.

<P>
   You think you know trucks. You're either a Ford Guy, a Chevy
Guy, a Dodge Guy. A solitary kind of guy. Think again.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, there's a good chance you're not even a guy.
There's a good chance your truck _ even a big, four-door V8 _ may
be none of the above. There's a good chance your truck may be
wrapped in the sheetmetal of a sport utility vehicle. And there's a
good chance your truck/SUV will be hauling not only tools and
materials to the job site, but kids to soccer, and dressed-up
parents to a fancy restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   These are times of great change in the truck/SUV market.
</P>
<P>
   You've got trucks, beds intact, that are more like SUVs. You've
got SUVs, looming presence intact, that are more like cars. Even
Cadillac and Lincoln will have pickup trucks in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   If, for the past couple of years, the truck/SUV world has been a
place of TRUCKS, Page G11 &QL; 
niches, auto anufacturers are now creating veritable crannies
within the niches. Consider the Chrysler PT Cruiser. Is it a car or
a replica 1930s panel truck?
</P>
<P>
   Will the Ford Escape Sport Wagon be a truck or an SUV?
</P>
<P>
   And what of those SUVs riding on car platforms: the Lexus RX
300, Toyota RAV4 (it will get even bigger by 2001), and the Honda
CR-V. How far removed are they, really, from station wagons such as
the Volvo Cross Country?
</P>
<P>
   And what of what will likely be this year's ultimate crossover
vehicle, the BMW X5 _ an SUV developed on the race track?
</P>
<P>
   We are buying pickup trucks _ particularly four-door,
many-passenger jobs _ and SUVs _ which are evolving faster than we
can buy them _ in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The registration of SUVs has about doubled since 1992, tripled
since 1987, according to the US Commerce Department's Census
Bureau. Based on projections from 1997 figures, there are more than
15 million SUVs registered today, up from 7.1 in 1992. There are
nearly 75 million trucks registered, up from 59.2 million in 1992.
That means there is one pickup truck for every five licensed
drivers; one SUV for every 14 licensed drivers.
</P>
<P>
   And in both cases, we are driving myriad vechicles.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive News classifies 2000 small pickup trucks as the
Chevrolet S pickups, Dodge Dakota, Ford Ranger, GMC Sonoma, Isuzu
Hombre, Mazda B series, Nissan Frontier (small, but four doors),
and Toyota Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Its large 2000 trucks are the Chevrolet Silverado, Dodge Ram,
Ford F Series trucks, Ford Super Duty, GMC Sierra, GMC Sierra
Classic, and Toyota Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   Noteable this year is that four doors are available on many of
them, as is seating for six, along with smooth, quiet rides. A
family affair.
</P>
<P>
   Making big news is the Toyota Tundra, a truck Toyota wishes it
had built three years ago. Now, the company has ``gone American''
by giving the Tundra a V-8, 245-horsepower engine, seating for six,
and a sedanlike ride. And, it is being built in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is coming out with an F150 SuperCrew that has four
conventional doors and is a foot longer than the SuperCab.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has seen sales of four-door pickups in its F-Series climb
from 5 percent in the 1996-'97 model years to 70 percent in 1999.
So while Ford has itself not only comfortably ensconced, but
expanded its line in four-door pickups, it is free to roam in more
esoteric fields.
</P>
<P>
   You've got the Roush F-150 _ that's Roush as in NASCAR's Jack
Roush, he of the screaming Mustang. It comes in various levels,
from outside wrapping, through upgraded suspension, wheels and
tires, to full-blown power _ a 5.4 liter, 335-horsepower,
supercharged V-8. Too tame for you? Consider, then, the SVT
Lightning. It's 5.4 liters, 360 supercharged horsepower, 0 to 60 in
about 5.4 seconds. See ya, Mr. Roush.
</P>
<P>
   But even small trucks can have four doors, and leading the way
is the Nissan Frontier Crew Cab. Compact, maneuverable, good to
haul folks and loads. Joining this act will be the Dodge Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet, which lost sales when it missed the four-door pickup
truck boom, is offering the four-door option on several models
including its C/K series.
</P>
<P>
   For Chevy fans, the big news is the new Silverado _ again,
offered with extended cab, four doors. It will be a powerful beast
with a base engine _ V-6, 200-horsepower _ that can be quickly
supplanted by V-8s that deliver 270 and 285 horsepower, a 6.0-liter
that cranks out 300 horsepower, or the 6.5-liter diesel at 215
horsepower, but loaded with torque.
</P>
<P>
   GMC follows its Chevy kin with the Sierra offering an extended
cab, four doors, and more horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Dakota four-door has front-hinged rear doors with
full-sized windows. And in the mainstay Ram, look for upgraded
suspension, steering and brakes _ and don't forget that popular
Cummins Turbo Diesel as an option.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of SUVs, the crossovers are even more fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how many there are now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   According to Automotive News, small SUVs include the Chevrolet
Tracker, Honda CR-V, Isuzu Amigo, Isuzu VehiCross, Jeep Wrangler,
Kia Sportage, Nissan Xterra, Suzuki Vitara, Suzuki Grand Vitara,
Toyota RAV4.
</P>
<P>
   At midrange are the BMW X5, Chevrolet Blazer, Dodge Durango,
Ford Explorer, GMC Jimmy and Envoy, Honda Passport, Infiniti QX-4,
Isuzu Rodeo, Isuzu Trooper, Jeep Cherokee, Jeep Grand Cherokee,
Land Rover Discovery, Land Rover Range Rover, Lexus LX 450, Lexus
RX 300, Mercedes M Class, Mercury Mountaineer, Mitsubishi Montero,
Mitsubishi Montero Sport, Nissan Pathfinder, Oldsmobile Bravada,
Toyota 4Runner, and Toyota Land Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   And largest are the AM General Hummer, Cadillac Escalade,
Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Tahoe, Ford Expedition, Ford
Excursion, GMC Yukon XL, GMC Yukon and Denali, and Lincoln
Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the biggest wake is the new Ford Excursion, perched atop
an F250 platform and easily the largest SUV roaming the roads.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevrolet Suburban, long the leader of the big boats, has
gotten rounder, and its sister, the GMC Suburban, is now known as
the Yukon XL.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the news is big.
</P>
<P>
   BMW is refusing to call its new X5 an SUV. Sport activity
vehicle is the preferred term. And if 0 to 60 mile per hour in 7.2
seconds and a top speed of 130 m.p.h. is your idea of activity in a
rig that looks like an SUV, then the $50,000 X5 may be your cup of
tea.
</P>
<P>
   But diversity being the name of the game in SUVs, there is
excitment farther down the economic scale.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at Gen-Xers is the Nissan Xterra, a sport ute based on the
Frontier pickup truck. Water resistant seats (kayaking); storage
bins atop the roof (hiking, other activities), it has action
written all over it. And at a base price of $17,500, it's got good
deal written all over it as well.
</P>
<P>
   These are days of rapid evolution in the world of trucks and
SUVs. The models you first meet this year may be radically
different three years from now.
</P>
<P>
   And it will get harder and harder to answer the question: ``Am I
driving a truck, an SUV, or a car?''

TRUCKS AND SUVS CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The SUV and truck industry is about people and vehicles. Folks
buy trucks and SUVs to take skiing, haul boats, lug kids and pets.
Manufacturers market them for active lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   But the SUV and truck phenomenon is also about numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, annual sales of SUVs in the United States have grown
from 900,000 to 3.1 million vehicles. Since the Econoline van was
introduced in 1960, Ford has sold more than 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, trucks continue to account for roughly half of all new
vehicle sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ford soon will have six different SUVs on the market and have
more than 50 variations of its trucks, starting with the
best-selling F-150 and moving up the size scale.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 25 SUVs on the market now with at least
another 20 expected to join in the battle for market share in the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan, being hammered elsewhere, continues to be a strong
player in the Northeast, which accounts for 25 percent of US sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company's hot new Xterra _ Motor Trend's sport/utility of
the year _ has zoomed past Nissan's goal of 52,000 sales with more
than 75,000 units sold. The larger Pathfinder has been a stong
seller and is expected to get a beefed-up V-6 during 2000 to
rectify a notable need.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for niches in the SUV market seems to have no end.
Mercedes is introducing the luxury ML55 AMG. It's got 342
horsepower, goes from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 6.4 seconds, features
18-inch tires and all the bells and whistles you'd expect for
$64,900.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum will be the sixth SUV in the
Ford lineup _ a challenger to Toyota's RAV4 in the small SUV
market. ``It'll be a little more carlike,'' says J.C. Collins,
Ford's SUV Group brand manager. No surprise, it, too, will have a
name beginning with Ex and carry high Expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been in the vanguard of truck and SUV sales, and
management intends to keep the company there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are time-starved,'' says Collins. ``But at the same
time, they're recreation-oriented and participate in the activities
that an SUV is geared to: Lugging skis and skiers into snow
country, mountain biking. The SUV and its capabilities play a big
part in these customers' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Ford's Explorer were 431,000 in 1998 _ higher even than
the best-selling Toyota Camry that year. With Ford introducing a
redesigned Explorer Sport, a new Explorer Sport-Trac, and the new
mini-SUV in the first half of 2000, the company has no plans to
relinquish its position as industry leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Sport-Trac will further close the dividing line between
pickup and SUV, adding a molded cargo area, and optional folding
and lockable tonneau cover, a bed extender, a power rear window and
power outlet in the cargo bed.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also is hitting the market with an new advertising campaign
called ``No Boundaries.'' Each ad is centered around active
lifestyles and features both the Ford brand name and a member of
the SUV lineup.
</P>
<P>
   It's all geared to tie into Ford's already established Ford
Tough and Ford Country campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a line between pickup and SUV.
</P>
<P>
   ``SUV buyers in general look to carry people and cargo inside
their vehicle,'' says Collins, ``whereas a pickup buyer may want
comfort in the cab with a cargo out back.'' The Sport-Trac may
diminish that dividing line a bit. ``Males like this one,'' says
Collins, ``and young and young-thinking females like the Explorer
Sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the big trend in pickup trucks is four-door crew
cabs.
</P>
<P>
   On display at the recent New England Auto Show were Nissan's
Frontier, the first to offer a four-door crew cab in a compact
pickup, and the Dodge Dakota Quad Cab that boasts the most power,
most towing and payload capacity, and seating for six. Soon to come
is Ford's F-150 SuperCrew, the first full-sized four-door pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've positioned ourselves to have the truck that will do the
job you need to get done,'' says Al Giombetti, Ford's truck group
brand manager. ``People still want the capability and versatility
that a pickup offers.''
</P>
<P>
   What's evident is what Collins says: ``It looks like the days of
super-high production runs of individual vehicles are over. We have
to be more responsive to the customer. They speak, we listen, and
the results are all these derivatives of several basic vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimobetti sees no end to the demand for trucks, either. ``Trucks
and vans are solid sellers. There's a huge loyalty factor with our
F-series.'' But he also knows things will continue to change.
``Today's innovations become tomorrow's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which keeps us writing and reading about the industry.

<P>
   ISLESBORO, MAINE _ When the ever-efficient ferry Margaret Chase
Smith dropped us off on this island off the coast of Maine,
Vacation '99 was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the island itself changes little from year to year,
each visit brings greater understanding about how life is lived out
in the middle of Penobscot Bay. Arriving ``on island'' this summer,
I was ready for the annual rummage sale, the Ice Cream race, the
Island Forum programs, the Historical Society's annual meeting and
a few cocktail parties _ in short, your normal not-so-quiet
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   But what I probably enjoyed the most was the island auto show.
This unofficial collection of vehicles clearly reveals what a big
part trucks (and now SUVs) have played in island life over the
years. They deliver, haul, go over roads that aren't really roads,
and do heavy-duty work. And, apparently, it's been that way since
motorized vehicles replaced horses _ a good 20 years later on
island than on the mainland because the original ferries were
barges more suited for carrying four-legged, rather than
four-wheeled, cargo. Indeed, old pickups, Jeeps, and panel trucks
used to dot the seaside landscape before a huge environmental
cleanup a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour after disembarking from the ferry, we drove by
arguably the nicest '40 Ford pickup I've ever seen, parked in front
of Bob Leach's garage. That was quickly followed by a 1928 Ford
Model A station wagon delivery truck.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there was old friend Charlie Pendleton (for whom the
Charlie Pendleton Band is named) roaring by in his aquamarine 1966
Pontiac Catalina convertible that looks as nice as when it rolled
off a GM assembly line. But beecause it's not a truck, we'll talk
about his car another time.
</P>
<P>
   A generalization from 15 years of summer visits: Islanders love
full-size Chevy pickups, most likely because Dutch Chevrolet in
Belfast is the nearest dealership. Summer residents love SUVs, a
trend that started 15 years ago with Suburbans and VW buses and
continues today with an array of Cherokees, Explorers, Rodeos,
4Runners, Pathfinders, Bravadas, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Being a superstitious sort, I immediately decided to mix
business and pleasure, determining to track down the owners of the
vintage vehicles and do a story. In the process, yet another
interesting antique truck came out of its garage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The '28 Woody
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We found the '28 Woody wagon parked in front of Stan and Nancy
Van Horn's new gift shop, The Islesboro Artisans. The shop was
sensational, but the story behind the car was even more so.
</P>
<P>
   It was sold out from under, so to speak, it's original owner, an
``older woman'' in Blue Hill, Maine, when she was hospitalized. The
car _ and its owner _ had been around.
</P>
<P>
   The gear shift knob is a polo ball, courtesy of Will Rodgers,
and it sports a Virgin Islands inspection sticker from the days
when it was nicknamed ``double trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   On its trip to this island it encountered tire trouble on the
ferry and the aforementioned Bob Leach came to the rescue,
sandblasting a wheel to get a good seal for the tire.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The '40s pickup
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of which brings us back to Leach's garage and the '40 Ford
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you saw that, huh?'' says Leach, trying his best to
politely ignore this island newcomer (only 20 summers). ``Well it
belongs to one of our summer residents, and I really don't think
he'd want to talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   To make a long story somewhat shorter, it took a few phone calls
_ to (yet more hints) islanders Bud Mitchell, Ralph Gray, and Suki
Love, and the '40 Ford pickup's owner returned a call.
</P>
<P>
   He was more than happy to talk about his car. It had been
lovingly restored by a friend and was a ``hot rod'' for its time _
the flathead was bored out and it had high compression Offenhauser
heads. He graciously invited us to visit and photograph the '40
Ford while begging us not to reveal his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another hint: He wasn't John Travolta, even though that was
Travolta's Rolls in Leach's Garage on another day, but that isn't
part of this story and Bob Leach wouldn't confirm that identity,
either.
</P>
<P>
   When our subject said to please identify him only as a West
Coast entertainment executive, my wife asked, ``Couldn't that mean
he makes porn movies?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, but the movie ``Potrait of a Lady'' is among
his directing credits and we apologize if this spoils his ``cover''
for he truly is a gentleman, one who says that the island actually
is an ideal place to keep and drive an antique car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roads are such that you wind up driving between 25 and 40
miles an hour _ perfect for these cars.'' And the exhaust tone when
he fired up the Ford to move it for photos . . . well, it was to
die for.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more.
</P>
<P>
   Leach then unveiled a sister to the '40 Ford _ a 1931 Model A
roadster/pickup. It's just what the name suggests. A pickup with a
convertible roof over the cab.
</P>
<P>
   It, too, has been lovingly restored, the winner of every show in
which it has been entered.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing what Ford developed almost 70 years ago, makes me chuckle
when I see the new Ford Explorer Sport-Trac _ an SUV cab with a
pickup bed in back. It shows that today's trend to hybrid
combinations of cars and trucks is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   We're reinventing our wheels all the time.
</P>
<P>
   And making them better.
</P>

MAZDA'S REVAMPED MPV SETS NEW PACE FOR MINIVAN LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, Honda took the accolades for its Odyssey minivan.
It's still a winner, but this year, Mazda's all new MPV has some
innovative features that may just put it in your winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the $20,000 MPV apart is its use of ``theater seating,''
roll-down windows on the sliding doors, Side-by-Slide second-row
seating, and a Tumble-Under rear seat that folds flat on the floor
in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Side-by-Slide seating offers both captain's chairs and a
bench seat by moving fore and aft and side to side, something not
possible in other minivans. The rear seat, which is raised slightly
for ``theater seating,'' can also be flipped to the rear when the
liftgate is open for use at a picnic or tailgate party.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mazda is not the biggest of minivans, it claims its
OptiSpace design provides more foot room and better use of overall
space to create a feeling of roominess.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda Odyssey ($25,800 for the EX), last year's standout, is
still a winner from any angle. It has performance, styling, great
features including dual power sliding doors, and innovative seating
that includes a fold-away rear seat that can also double as a
picnic center.
</P>
<P>
   The General Motors family of minivans _ Chevrolet Venture
($23,195), Pontiac Montana ($23,895), and Oldsmobile Silhouette
($30,605 for the Premier) _ are all similar in ride, seating,
space, and power. There are, however, differences in options. The
Chevy, for example, has a well-designed built-in child's seat,
while the Olds and Pontiac have great on-board video systems
complete with hookups for video games. All the vans have lots of
storage bags, side-air bags, and an on-board air compressor to blow
up all the inflatables you need.
</P>
<P>
   For the most variations in minivans, no one beats
DaimlerChrysler, the company that invented the minivan, and is
still the sales leader. The Chrysler products offer two different
wheelbases and six different drivetrains. The Chrysler Town &AMP;
Country ($26,360) and the Dodge Caravan ($29,405) are the only
minivans with all-wheel drive. Dodge also offers a sport package
that includes AutoStick, an automanual transmission. The Plymouth
Voyager ($18,685) is the lowest-priced member of the family.
</P>
<P>
   If you're comparing minivans and looking for a benchmark, the
Dodge Caravan is the top seller in the country. About the only
thing it doesn't offer is a power sliding door.
</P>
<P>
   The Sienna ($27,700) is everything you'd expect from a Toyota.
It is refined, quiet, and offers good performance. The minivan
comes with V-6 power and is based on the Camry platform. The Sienna
comes with lots of standard safety equipment, and, like the Ford
Windstar and Honda Odyseey, has a five-star crash protection rating
from the National Highway Traffic Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury Villager ($25,015) and Nissan Quest ($22,160) are a
bit smaller than other minivans, but they offer a good, carlike
ride. Video entertainment systems for rear passengers will be an
option for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Windstar ($27,500) is one of the most spacious and best
performing vehicles in this category. It took a while for Ford to
add dual side doors, which are larger than most for easy access.
Power side doors are an option, and the Windstar includes sensors
on the rear to warn if something is in the way when backing up and
a ``conversation mirror'' that can help keep tabs on those in back.
</P>
<P>
   Minvans are great people and cargo haulers, but not all minivans
are created equal. Most claim carlike handling, but only you can
decide if a model feels more like a car than a van.
</P>
<P>
   Other things to consider when shopping for minivans include
engine noise, pickup and stopping time _ even within the same
family of minivans. Be sure to test a vehicle that is equipped the
way you'd like; adding lots of options can change the way the
vehicle handles.

THE ALL-PURPOSE TRUCK GAINS IN COMFORT AND STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't just a truck anymore, or words to that effect, was the
prominent theme in GMC advertising not long ago. But now trucks are
hot, and GMC is putting the emphasis on building trucks. Period.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, anyone shopping for a truck these days will quickly
realize that trucks really aren't just trucks anymore. Although,
there are still some drivers who actually buy trucks to be used as
trucks, more and more people are buying them as a second ``car,''
or, in some cases, as the primary family vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what they say, all manufacturers are building trucks
with carlike handling features, including cab comfort and automatic
transmissions. With trucks capturing some 40 percent of the market,
and holding the two top places in Top 10 vehicle sales each year,
the manufacturers know they have to please a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   Which helps explain why manufacturers are producing more and
more trucks that can serve as the family vehicle. Lincoln is
expected to put into production its Blackwood, which was shown at
the Boston International Auto Show last week. The Blackwood is a
Lincoln Navigator with two rows of seating and a large, covered
pickup bed behind. You can travel in luxury, have the use of a
cargo bed, and have good towing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   More practical for most people might be the new Nissan Frontier
Crew Cab with four real doors and a full-sized backseat. This
compact V-6 truck comes in either two- or four-wheel drive
configurations. While the bed is short, a nice option is a hinged
tubular gate that when sitting on the bed can keep small items at
the cargo gate. Then if you need to carry a longer item, the
tubular gate can be swung out to rest on top of the flat cargo
gate.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing it can't do is carry a 4-by-8-foot sheet of
plywood. But when was the last time you needed to do that? Besides,
if you go to The Home Depot, they'll rent you a truck for that
specific need for less than $20. So, who needs an 8-foot cargo bed?
Very few.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Dakota is also featuring a Quad Cab in its compact
line, and like the Frontier, the doors are front hinged and the cab
is a short 5.3 feet vs. the standard 6.5-foot bed. Dodge is
packaging the truck with a new 4.7-liter 235-horsepower V-8 and a
four-speed automatic transmission that selects between one of two
second gear ratios. Dodge also offers the Dakota ($13,200 to
$19,500) in two bed lengths, regular cab, and a choice of engines
from a 120-horsepower four-cylinder up to a 250-horsepower V-8. The
full-sized Dodge Ram pickups are essentially unchanged for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet and GMC completely redid the Silverado and the Sierra
pickups last year ($15,355 to $32,500). The new trucks are more
rigid, have very roomy cabs, are easier to get into than previous
models, have more power, and brakes that will stop in shorter
distances. For 2000, the trucks will have a four-door extended cab
option. Other options include regular or extended cabs, and
Autotrac four-wheel drive that automatically transfers torque to
the front wheels if the rear wheels are slipping.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevy S10 ($12,108 to $20,192) is the only truck in its
class with standard four-wheel antilock brakes. It comes in two-
and four-wheel drive options, and in a variety of configurations,
including the Xtreme, which tells you all you need to know about
this model.
</P>
<P>
   The GMC Sonoma ($12,600 to $20,500), like the S10, comes in a
variety of configurations and with a choice of engines from a
120-horsepower four-cylinder to a V-8 with 190 horsepower. Manual
and automatic transmissions and two- or four-wheel drives are also
available.
</P>
<P>
   The best-selling vehicle in America is the Ford F-series truck
($15,000 to $30,000). The F-series tops not just truck, but car
sales as well. That alone sends a very positive message about this
line. These trucks come with two- or four-wheel drive, three engine
choices from a 205-horsepower V-6 to a 260-horsepower V-8, a short
or long bed, and regular or extended cab options. New for 2000 are
handy rear-access doors on SuperCab models.
</P>
<P>
   The compact Ford Ranger ($11,700 to $19,400) has been given
extensive equipment upgrades for 2000. Four-wheel drive Rangers
allow the system to be engaged on the fly, no stopping the vehicle
to go into four-wheel drive. Also, the Ranger, along with its
stablemate the Mazda B-series is the only compact to offer two
rear-access panels, for a total of four doors. But while these
compacts have space in the back of the cab, it's a tight fit.
</P>
<P>
   The real workhorse of the Ford line is the F-series Super Duty
($19,000 to $31,000). This new-for-'99 model is designed for
work-related jobs. The truck comes with heavy-duty engine choices
for this type of work including a Triton V-10 and the Navistar
7.3-liter turbo-diesel. While these models handle and ride more
like trucks, the cabs are quite civilized with all the goodies
you'd expect in a fine car.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota shook up the American truck market last year with the
introduction of the Tundra ($17,000 to $28,000), the first
full-sized pickup from a foreign maker. And this truck is a real
contender to steal sales from American manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra rides and handles superbly, comes in bed choices of
eight or 6 1/2 feet, regular or extended cabs, and two engine
choices: a 3.4-liter V-6 or 4.7-liter V-8 (the same one in the
Toyota Land Cruiser). For 2000, Toyota has added four doors to its
extended cab models, all with their own handles.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota also offers the compact Tacoma ($12,600 to $25,600). As
the price range suggests, this model can be had in many
combinations of cabs and beds, and two- or four-wheel drive
versions. Unlike other makes, the Tacoma's four-cylinder engine
gets high marks from enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Also available is the Isuzu Hombre ($11,500 to $21,200).
Basically, it is a Chevy S10 with Isuzu markings.
</P>
<P>
   While all these trucks will do a job, shoppers need to decide
what that job will be. Obviously, if a truck is going to be the
all-around family vehicle, a supercab model would be the first
choice. But then you need to decide how ``super'' the cab should be
in size and comfort. Then you must consider what your ``payload''
is going to be. Chances are you can do with a short bed, rather
than a long one, and you may not need a beefier full-sized pickup
if you are just doing normal hauling.
</P>
<P>
   Decide, too, if you really need four-wheel drive. Only the Chevy
Silverado/GMC Sierra has a system that can be used all the time.
While the V-6 engine is the most popular available on trucks,
buyers have choices that range from small four-cylinder engines to
heavy duty V-10s. For family-type driving, a V-6 or small V-8
should do fine.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks have a lower price tag than most cars, but load it up
with extras and the price can skyrocket.

THE TEN BASIC STEPS FOR BUYING AN SUV OR TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying an SUV or truck is just like buying any other vehicle.
You've done it before, but let's just do it by the numbers this
time as a countdown to happiness. (We hope.)
</P>
<P>
   10. Decide what you want, then figure out if you can afford it.
This sounds simpler than it is unless you're a high roller. If
that's the case, you can buy anything you want, and are probably
out driving your latest dream car to your vacation home now and not
reading this. For those of us who have to allot a big chunk of our
income to the auto industry, read on.
</P>
<P>
   Hint 1: SUVs come in three basic sizes: Small, regular, and
large (with a subcategory of truly humungous), most with a choice
of two- or four-wheel drive and an increasing number with an
all-wheel drive option.
</P>
<P>
   The small size includes Toyota RAV4, Subaru Forester, KIA
Sportage, Chevrolet Tracker, Honda CR-V, Suzuki Grand Vitara.
</P>
<P>
   The regular (big) size includes the Chevy Blazer/GMC Jimmy, Ford
Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Lexus RX300, Mercedes-Benz M-Class,
Toyota 4Runner, Isuzu Rodeo, Olds Bravada, and Mitsubishi Montero.
</P>
<P>
   In the large category are Ford Expedition, Dodge Durango, Chevy
Tahoe/GMC Yukon, Toyota Land Cruiser, Range Rover, Lexus LX470, and
biggest of the big, Ford Excursion, Chevy Suburban, and GMC Yukon.
</P>
<P>
   Hint 2: Wagons such as the Audi Quattro, Subaru Legacy, VW
Passat, Volvo 70-series, and Saab 9-5 are an attractive
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   9. If you can't afford what you want, decide what you like and
can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Hint 1: Auto manufacturers make a big profit on SUVs, especially
those loaded with expensive toys. If cost is your main
consideration, make your selection accordingly. Visit dealerships
to get a feel for what's out there, but it's way too early to make
a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Hint 2: Examine the family trees for the less-expensive version
of the same basic vehicle. (Prices mentioned here are for
lesser-priced four-wheel drive models.)
</P>
<P>
   a. Ford: The Mercury Mountaineer ($29,370) is a posh version of
the Ford Explorer ($23,070); likewise, the Lincoln Navigator
($45,860) is the upgraded Ford Expedition ($32,525).
</P>
<P>
   b. The Lexus LX450 ($59,005) is the fancy Toyota Land Cruiser
($50,828).
</P>
<P>
   c. The Chevy Blazer/GMC Jimmy are the basic car ($21,970 to
$28,470); The Olds Bravada ($31,498) is the gussied-up, all-wheel
drive version.
</P>
<P>
   d. You'll find the same relationship between the Isuzu Trooper
and Honda Passport; between the Nissan Pathfinder and Infiniti QX4.
</P>
<P>
   8. Now you have to decide whether to lease or buy. To figure out
if you're a good candidate to lease, ask yourself if you:
</P>
<P>
   a. Drive 12,000 to 15,000 miles per year.
</P>
<P>
   b. Keep your car in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   c. Like to change cars every three years.
</P>
<P>
   d. Don't mind having a car payment forever.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't answer yes to all of the above, think long and
hard about leasing. You're heading for extra payments.
</P>
<P>
   7. If you decide to buy, talk to your friendly loan officer to
find out what rate you'll be paying and get some approximate
numbers of how much it will cost you a week or month for various
loan lengths. If your employer has a credit union, payroll
deduction loans are a less painfull way to go.
</P>
<P>
   6. Do your research to find out the true cost (dealer's cost) of
the vehicle(s) you would like. Add about 3 percent for dealer
profit (after throwing out the destination charge). That's a
ballpark figure. Not many of us reach it no matter how much we brag
around the coffee machine.
</P>
<P>
   5. Take a deep breath and decide if you want to continue. After
all, it is your money.
</P>
<P>
   4. Now that you have an idea what you want, it's time to talk
dealerships. It's my feeling that they've changed a lot in the last
10 years. They've always wanted to sell you cars; now, they want to
make you a repeat customer and sell vehicles to your spouse,
family, friends, and neighbors. Visit a few and get a feel for the
atmosphere. Most want to be consumer friendly. They know they have
a good product (it's pretty hard to find a truly bad car these
days) and it's impossible to test drive an SUV without an office
visit. Later you can negotiate by phone or e-mail if you're not
comfortable dealing face-to-face and want to take time to think
about what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   3. Oh, you have a trade-in. Well, that can complicate things.
Get an idea of what it's worth, and how much it would cost to put
it in A-1 shape so it actually is worth that much. Then either fix
it or subtract the cost of the repairs. Make sure it's clean and
has been serviced relatively recently when you have the dealer give
you his estimate of what it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Hint: Know your bottom line, i.e. new car cost minus trade-in
value, when you negotiate. It sounds simple, but once numbers start
flying around take the time to do this simple math. If a dealer is
willing to meet your number, it really doesn't matter what values
he assigns to the new car and trade-in.
</P>
<P>
   2. Once the deal is struck, don't think you're done. You'll be
faced with a barrage of add-ons: alarms, warranties, insurance
deals, care-car systems, and the like. You may want an extended
warranty if you're planning on keeping the car for a long time.
Also beware of any unexpected dealer ``add ons'' or ``mark ups.''
Fight them.
</P>
<P>
   It is now time to say yes or no. If you have said yes, if you
have made your commitment, go on to No. 1. If not, go back to No.
10 and run the program again. You'll be amazed at what an expert
you've become and how much less threatening the process can be.
</P>
<P>
   1. Forget all the stuff that went on before. Just like a mother
forgets childbirth, you can put the tough parts of the buying
process aside. Goodness knows, you've worked and shopped hard for
this car. Now enjoy. And you don't have to do that by the numbers.

 &HT;    Slavery issue at the heart of secession
 &HT;    By James L. Roark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In February 1861, Georgian Alexander Hamilton Stephens called
slavery the Confederacy's ``cornerstone.''
</P>
<P>
   As vice president of the Confederate States of America, he spoke
with some authority. The ``foundations are laid, its cornerstone
rests,'' he said, ``upon the great truth that the negro is not
equal to the white man; that slavery . . . is his natural and
normal condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, a significant number of Southerners deny that slavery
had much to do with Southern secession. They point to states'
rights, self-determination, liberty, protection of hearth and home,
everything but slavery. No historical event as vast as the creation
of a Southern nation can be explained in monocausal terms. But
there can be no doubt about the centrality of racial slavery to the
creation of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no slavery, no Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern struggle to preserve slavery was as old as the
United States. In 1787, Southerners embedded slavery in the
Constitution. By the 1820s, Southerners had aggressively built the
largest slave society in the New World. As they raced westward,
they spread cotton, slavery and plantations halfway to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Slaveless whites joined slaveholders in supporting slavery and
opposing black equality. As the antebellum Georgia legal scholar
Thomas R.R. Cobb observed, every white citizen of the South ``feels
that he belongs to an elevated class. It matters not that he is no
slaveholder; he is not of the inferior race; he is a freeborn
citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1850s witnessed rising sectional consciousness and hardening
sectional suspicion. Increasing numbers of whites in the South came
to believe that an abolitionized North was taking aim at slavery in
the South, despite the protections of the Constitution. Abraham
Lincoln's election without a single Southern electoral vote
convinced many more Southerners that they could no longer remain
Americans and protect slavery. As Catherine Edmonstron of North
Carolina declared, ``Union now means Conquest _ and Conquest,
Confiscation. So we go.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Southerners rejected secessionist logic. ``I consider
slavery much more secure in the Union than out of it if our people
were but wise,'' Stephens countered. White Southerners were united
in their determination to defend slavery but divided about whether
Lincoln's election made it necessary to secede. Only in South
Carolina did the ``fire eaters'' (insistent secessionists) win
easily. In every other state in the lower South, including Georgia,
the vote was close. But secession prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Confederate President Jefferson Davis argued that secession and
the war that followed were about Southern rights and liberties. But
precisely what rights and liberties? The right of Southerners to
own slaves; the liberty of Southerners to take slaves into national
territories; and the freedom of Southerners to quit a union that
jeopardized those rights and liberties.
</P>
<P>
   When the war came, white men across the South marched off to
protect the life they knew. They fought for home, family, freedom,
their land, racial supremacy and more. But the motives that
compelled individuals to fight Yankees from 1861 to 1865 can
obscure the purposes that brought the Confederacy into being. The
new nation owed its political existence to white Southerners'
determination to preserve slavery and the society they had built
upon it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Southerners who reject the argument for slavery's role in
the origins of the Confederacy claim that the Southern cause
enjoyed a ``rainbow coalition'' of supporters. They point to the
thousands of ``black Confederates,'' slaves who worked on the
fortifications, drove rebel wagons and nursed sick soldiers in
Southern hospitals. They also lift up the willingness of the
government in Richmond in the last weeks of the war to free some
slaves for military service.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, voluntary Confederates were almost entirely pale
skinned. After the Emancipation Proclamation of Jan. 1, 1863, put
the Union squarely on the side of freedom, 100,000 black
Southerners donned blue uniforms to fight a war of liberation. And
the Confederate government's desperate experiment with limited
black freedom generated little enthusiasm on the home front.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Edmondston responded that Southerners had ``hitherto
contended that slavery was Cuffee's (African-Americans') normal
condition, the very best position he could occupy, the one of all
others in which he was the happiest and to take him from that and
give him what we think misery in the place of it, is to put
ourselves in the wrong essentially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' she cried. ``Freedom for whites, slavery for Negroes,
God has so ordained it!''
</P>
<P>
   An assessment of the role of slavery in the making of the
Confederacy does not necessarily answer all the questions that we
face about how we choose to remember the Southern nation, but it is
the starting place for reasonable discussion.

 &HT;    What we really need to know about candidates
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Just think. We have only 11 1/2 months
until the next presidential election. I can hardly wait. It seems
as if the candidates have been running since the Berlin Wall fell _
and a few have, such as Al Gore and Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest brouhaha came when a cheeky television reporter from
Boston surprised Texas Gov. George W. Bush with a pop quiz, asking
if he could name the leaders of Taiwan, Chechnya, India and
Pakistan. He got one right. That's one more than I would have
gotten right. I could name former leaders of three of those
countries _ the exception being Chechnya, which hasn't been a
country long enough for most of us to have any but the vaguest idea
where it is, let alone who's in charge. It's somewhere near Russia,
if you're wondering.
</P>
<P>
   A vast hue-and-cry arose from Bush backers and even those who
are still skeptical of his ability to run the Greatest Nation on
Earth, concerned that the pop quiz was ``gotcha journalism.'' Well,
yeah, it was a bit tacky, but it's likely Bush will survive this
tempest in a teapot with little trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the notion of making all presidential candidates take a
quiz has some appeal. It could give voters a notion they're voting
for someone who thinks like they do, which is a feeling you just
don't get from warm-and-fuzzy television commercials of Gore
dressed in earth-tone chinos and a golf shirt, or of George Dubbya
riding a horse. In the interests of civic journalism, I have
compiled my own quiz of questions I would like the candidates to
answer before I decide how I'll cast my ballot. My answers are
below each question. Here goes:
</P>
<P>
   1.) Do you eat beans with your chili, and is there such a thing
as chili that's too hot?
</P>
<P>
   My answer to Part A is yes. I am no purist. I like beans in my
chili, and I like Frito corn chips on the bottom of the bowl and
shredded cheese on top. No doubt Frank X Tolbert, the late writer
and chili impresario for the Dallas Morning News, would have me
strung on a cactus in downtown Terlingua, but there you go. And no,
there is no such thing as too-hot chili. It's like the country song
that claims ``There's no such thing as too much fun.'' I've come
close to having too much fun before, and my last batch of chili
came perilously close to being too hot, leaving me drenched with
sweat. I froze the remainder, hoping a few weeks of being turned
into lumpy brown ice will somehow cool it down a tad.
</P>
<P>
   2.) Who's your favorite Beatle?
</P>
<P>
   Any Beatle save Ringo is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   3.) Do you believe the designated hitter rule used in the
American League should be abolished?
</P>
<P>
   This is critical to my deciding who shall run our country. The
designated-hitter rule is an abomination of nature, and any
potential chief executive who promises to issue an order hastening
its demise has my vote.
</P>
<P>
   4.) What did you think of ``The Blair Witch Project?''
</P>
<P>
   There's only one wrong answer here, and that's to say that you
liked the movie. Not having watched it is acceptable, even
preferable. I'm of the opinion that this movie, filmed for a mere
$35,000 if memory serves correctly and overpriced at that, ranks up
there with ``The Legend of Boggy Creek'' as one of the worst movies
of the 20th century. I've seen scarier episodes of ``Sesame
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   5.) Who's the greatest female country singer of all time?
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of great ones, but there was only one Patsy
Cline. I would give partial credit for picking Tammy Wynette and
take off points for naming any of the Mandrell sisters.
</P>
<P>
   6.) Which type of barbecue do you prefer: beef or pork?
</P>
<P>
   The only bad answer is if a candidate actually confesses to not
liking barbecue at all.
</P>
<P>
   7.) Do you believe in extraterrestrial beings?
</P>
<P>
   Answering no implies a lack of imagination, which would bother
me.
</P>
<P>
   8.) Can you recite the theme song to ``The Beverly
Hillbillies''?
</P>
<P>
   Extra credit goes for also knowing the words to the ``Flipper''
theme song.
</P>
<P>
   9.) Do you have any idea who shot the deputy (as in the song,
``I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy''), or what
exactly Billy Jo McAllister tossed off the Tallahatchie Bridge?
</P>
<P>
   I've been wondering about those two events for years.
</P>
<P>
   10.) Which of your opponents would have a tough time getting
through the first two rounds of ``So You Want to be a
Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Watch this show some time. You'll feel really smart for at least
the first three or four rounds. Here's an actual question in the
early round, and remember that these are multiple choice: ``On a
car with an automatic transmission, what does the `N' stand for?''
</P>
<P>
   Nitwit?
</P>
<P>
   I realize that my quiz doesn't address the really serious
questions of state, such as free trade, immigration, nuclear
disarmament and such. But as Dubbya said, whoever's elected has
``experts'' to worry about those matters. I just want someone I'd
feel comfortable drinking a beer with _ and who could at least get
through the first three levels with Regis Philbin.

 &HT;    Fangs for writing, fangs for reading
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Letters, I get letters ...
</P>
<P>
   A recent column on snakes brought a variety of responses.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee Windham, of Hemphill, Texas, related a similar
encounter of mistaken identity:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your story about the black snake you mistakenly thought was a
hose brought back memories. I thought someone had left a short rope
on my kitchen floor and I picked it up. I don't know which of us
was the more surprised, but neither of us stayed around to find
out. I dashed to the living room and the snake scooted under the
dishwasher, picking up speed as he wriggled through a weep-hole in
the bricks and onto the side yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the snake was as round on one end as the other, I
think that it wasn't poisonous but we were both glad to part
company.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no lack of opinion on snakes in Hendersonville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Von Hoene, who recently retired to the mountains of western
North Carolina writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised in the city suburbs of the north and have had a
long-standing fear of snakes. I think this began when was I was 12
years old and on a Boy Scout excursion. During the night it seemed
too cold to venture forth to the woods so I went to the bathroom
through a knot hole in the floor of the cabin. The next day an
extremely large and thoroughly angry black snake was pulled from
underneath the structure by some older boys. This experience
initiated years of nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had forgotten all about snakes until retiring last year. I
was lighting our water heater in the crawl space under our house
and on my back with a flashlight and butane torch when two feet
from my nose a beaded glistening reflected the skin of a snake. I
thought it was heart attack time. In short order I realized that it
was just the skin and a local tradesman later told me he had killed
the snake a few months earlier while working for the previous
homeowner and that it was ``large but harmless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I spilled all my renewed fears out to my barber, a kind of
folksy Oracle at Delphi who is native to the region and he replied
something such as, ``Well ... if ya'll are afraid of snakes, ya
didn't study things out good enough as we have more snakes here
than anywhere's else. I've lived in these hills all ma life and
don't know anyone who died from snake bite so the odds are looking
good for ya.''
</P>
<P>
   Reece Mitchell, of Hendersonville, writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately our local paper carried your humorous but not
funny article `Only good snakes are the dead snakes.' Destroying
without reason the living things that make our earth habitable by
humans is a major reason the planet is in trouble. There are
volumes of data supporting the need to maintain biodiversity, but
I'll mention only one example.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know someone who suffers from arthritis, that person
probably takes a medication that was first discovered in the venom
of a viper.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, from The Lamberts of Hendersonville comes this
venomous retort:
</P>
<P>
   ``I found Murray's negative attitude toward all snakes
reprehensible, and I believe his publishing such ignorant attitudes
in a newspaper column was irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is if I ever find myself in the North Carolina
town of Hendersonville, it won't be the snakes I'll be watching out
for.

 &HT;    Democrats powwow on state strategy
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Less than two months before the 2000 filing
deadline, Democrats have no credible candidate to go against
Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one symptom of the malaise in the Texas Democratic
Party that caused several Democrats, ramrodded by former state Sen.
Carl Parker (D-Port Arthur) to gather last Thursday, Nov. 11, at
the Hill Country ranch of one of their biggest patrons, Beaumont
trial lawyer Walter Umphrey. They hoped to figure out ways to
re-energize the moribund Democratic Party _ but didn't get around
to discussing an opponent for Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   Former Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes confirmed he was among the two dozen
who attended, along with House Speaker Pete Laney, Democratic Sens.
Judith Zaffirini of Laredo, Rodney Ellis of Houston and Gonzalo
Barrientos of Austin, former Comptroller John Sharp and Texas
Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said a major problem is that Democrats no longer stress
passionately enough issues that appeal to lower-income people, such
as education. They stood by while Gov. George W. Bush took credit
for a tax cut in excess of $1 billion, while teachers pleaded for
more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have surpluses and we don't do the responsible thing,
and the Democrats are not standing on the floor of the Legislature
fighting for those things, what is the reason for minorities in
Houston and South Texas to vote for a Democrat rather than a
Republican?'' Barnes asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying the Democrats aren't for that,'' he said. ``I'm
saying they didn't communicate it to voters. And I think that (1998
lieutenant governor nominee) John Sharp and (comptroller nominee)
Paul Hobby didn't communicate themselves particularly to minority
voters on those points.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, only 3.7 million of 11.5 million registered Texas
voters cast ballots in November. Meanwhile, Sharp and Hobby lost to
Republicans _ Sharp by less than 69,000 votes, Hobby less than
21,000. Democrats say that with even 100,000 more minority voters,
both would have won.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Wendler Sr., a longtime progressive Democrat who wasn't
invited to the meeting, said Democratic slippage in recent
elections happened partly because groups that lobby the
Legislature, which are a principal source of election financing,
won't spend money against incumbents of either party.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans have grown in number _ to a 16-15 majority in the
Senate and a 78-72 deficit in the House _ Democrats' hopes of
recapturing some ground have given way to efforts to keep Democrats
in place in those bodies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The late Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock and current House Speaker Laney
were elected as Democrats. But to preserve their leadership
positions, both included Republicans on their teams in the name of
bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Republican policies of cutting taxes and limiting government
generally please business owners, so, given a choice, they support
Republicans _ unless the Democrats are incumbents. And the groups
that do support Democrats as a rule don't finance challengers to
Republican incumbents, Wendler said.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Democrats fight hard only for incumbents under fire
or for Democrats running for open seats. In areas where there's not
a tough fight, other Democrats on the ballot are hurt _
particularly statewide candidates, said Wendler _ who watched
former law partner Garry Mauro get just 31.2 percent against
Republican Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultants also concentrate on reliable voters and
compete for Republican and independent voters rather than appeal to
people registered to vote who don't, Wendler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``An overwhelming number of Texans old enough to vote are people
who would vote Democratic if they voted _ because they are people
of modest means,'' Wendler said. ``That is because the Democrats
have historically been for things that helped people of modest
means.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the last decade or so ... there's no effort by what we
say, by what we stand for, to emphasize that, and our campaigns
make no effort to move out in that big majority of people of modest
means who are not voting,'' Wendler said. ``They vote in smaller
and smaller percentages all the time _ because they can't see why
it would make a difference for them to vote.''

HIGH ART CAN BE NEWS, COLUMBIA STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is a quintessential big arts story in the late '90s? New
York mayor Rudolph Giuliani's attempt to shut down the Brooklyn
Museum of Art's controversial ``Sensation'' exhibit _ where high
culture mixed with political intrigue _ fits the bill.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the ideas inside ``Reporting the Arts: News
Coverage of Arts and Culture in America,'' the new study by
Columbia University's National Arts Journalism Program. The report
_ which analyzed articles in 15 metro dailies and The New York
Times, USA Today, and The Wall Street Journal during October 1998 _
concluded that ``high art . . . presented . . . in a way that made
it engage a mainstream audience, attracted the most . . . prominent
coverage of all artistic categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the report's findings were predictable. Event listings
occupy close to 50 percent of the space devoted to arts and
entertainment; the pop arts of television, movies, and music
generate much more coverage than the visual arts, architecture, and
dance; and institutions ``that have mastered the technique of
blockbuster presentation win prominent coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as newspapers struggle to maintain resources to cope with
the cultural boom of the '90s, the arts journalism program's
associate director Andras Szanto is optimistic, noting that ``as
newspapers increasingly lose their franchise in breaking news, one
forum they can maintain the franchise in is culture.''
</P>
<P>
   And nodding to the Brooklyn Art Museum flap, research analyst
Andrew Tyndall says that ``when high art enters the culture, that
trumps everything.'' Speaking for himself, Tyndall says arts
editors might want to focus on using reporters _ ``arts
generalists'' _ to go ``sniffing out for the combustion'' at that
intersection of the esoteric and mainstream.

 &HT;    Japanese animator drawn into contradiction
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Japanese animation has exploded into the American
mainstream, most notably with last week's colossal opening of
``Pokemon: The First Movie.'' The heavily promoted children's movie
about battling ``pocket monsters'' grossed $50.8 million, setting a
five-day record for animated features.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese imports such as ``Pokemon'' and ``Dragon Ball Z'' rule
kiddie TV ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's something we should be proud of,'' said
Hiyao Miyazaki, one of Japan's leading animators, as well as one of
the most respected figures in animation in the world. ``Once you
reach critical mass, however good it may be, it becomes toxic.''
</P>
<P>
   Miyazaki is revered by fans of Japanese animation _ or anime _
for such films as ``Kiki's Delivery Service'' and ``My Neighbor
Totoro.'' His latest feature, ``Princess Mononoke,'' topped ``E.T.
_ The Extra-Terrestrial'' as the highest-grossing film in Japan
before it was surpassed by ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter at the Toronto International
Film Festival, where ``Princess Mononoke'' made its North American
premiere, the 58-year-old director was critical of anime's booming
popularity at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that Japanese pop culture has gone well beyond
that critical mass, and in a way what we do in the business simply
chews up children and their consciousness,'' Miyazaki said. ``And
the fact that we in Japan cannot control this kind of output, but
it's simply spreading to the Western world is certainly not
something I can hold my head up proudly about.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of all films produced in Japan are animated,
ranging from children's fairy tales to complex adult epics. That
group is the most profitable segment of the industry. Anime also
accounts for a sizable portion of Japanese television programming,
more than half of which is based on comic books, known as manga.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, annual rental revenue for anime videos is
estimated at $80 million. Anime video sales revenue ranges between
$75 million and $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Anime accounts for 75 percent to 80 percent of the video rentals
at Bookery Fantasy in Fairborn, Ohio, according to manager Steve
Bates. More than half of the store's video stock is anime, from
all-ages to adults-only viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing real well with all of the Japanese animation,''
Bates said. ``It's not just `Pokemon' and `Dragon Ball Z'.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many schools of anime, from innocuous children's
programming such as ``Pokemon'' to lyrical, yet intense, tales with
historical settings, such as ``Princess Mononoke.'' Other popular
styles include mecha, or robot anime, and hentai, which is sexually
explicit.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. audiences typically equate animation with Disney features
and Saturday-morning cartoons. ``There's no stigma attached to
seeing an animated film in Japan,'' Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' is a sophisticated ecological fable, based
loosely on Japanese folklore, about a war between encroaching
civilization and the beast gods of the forest. The lavishly
animated epic won the 1998 Best Picture Award at Japan's equivalent
of the Oscars and drew record ratings earlier this year when it
aired on Japanese television.
</P>
<P>
   The film's record-setting $150 million gross is remarkable given
that Japan has one-half the population of the United States and
less than one-tenth the number of movie screens.
</P>
<P>
   The English-language version was adapted by ``Sandman'' creator
and fantasy novelist Neil Gaiman and features the voices of Claire
Danes, Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian
Anderson and Jada Pinkett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' contains mature themes and violent images,
and it lacks straightforward heroes and villains. The title
character, a feral child raised by wolves, confronts the forces of
industry invading the forest paradise that is her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, we've made many films in the past and our goals
with those films has been to send a message of hope and the
possibility of happiness to growing children,'' Miyazaki said.
``But the truth is that all those children ... are confronted with
the terrible dilemmas of modern life and of humanity. The truth is
that they are worried about the direction of humankind. They're
worried about the continuation and the future of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   By continuing to make movies that only taught children about
hope and happiness, the director felt he would be turning a deaf
ear to their urgent needs and pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we made this film knowing that we would need to step
outside the boundaries of what you call entertainment,'' Miyazaki
said. ``We made this film with a sense of mission. The success of
the film was never in our sights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' ``has some very intense moments,'' said
Deborah Brown, president of D-Anime, the Dayton Animation Club.
``It has things in it that make you think.''
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual component of anime such as ``Princess
Mononoke,'' an example of the wabi-sabi school, is a big part of
the appeal for Brown. ``There's also the sheer beauty of the art,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   D-Anime has about 20 regular members who meet the first and
third Saturdays of the month at the Miami Valley Unitarian
Fellowship in Oakwood to watch and discuss Japanese animation. The
wide range of anime styles is reflected by the group's varied
tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all devotees of the art form, but we all have our
particular preference,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese anime blossomed as an industry in the 1950s and '60s.
The first significant works were inexpensively produced for
television by cutting the standard 24-frames-per-second animation
format of Hollywood cartoons to as few as 10- to
five-frames-per-second. ``Astro Boy'' became an international hit,
paving the way for later series such as ``Gigantor,'' ``Kimba the
White Lion'' and ``Speed Racer.''
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical release in the '90s of adult-themed anime films
such as ``Akira'' and ``Ghost in the Shell'' brought the art form
to a larger, more sophisticated audience.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Pokemon,'' a new generation has discovered anime. Warner
Bros. reportedly paid about $5 million for the rights to the
Japanese ``Pokemon'' film, which was dubbed into English, with a
new musical soundtrack. A sequel is being readied for summer
release, although it may hit theaters sooner to capitalize on the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   You can be certain it's not one that pleases Miyazaki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, our work is filled with many contradictions,'' the
director said. ``When we made `Totoro,' I made it so that I could
encourage little children to walk out into the woods and pick up
acorns. Instead, I get letters from them telling me about the
dozens of times that they've watched the film, which means that
they're sitting in front of their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I have an opportunity, I speak out about this. But
it seems that on this question it's very difficult for my voice to
be heard.''

 &HT;    New bed-and-breakfast a pleasant, relaxing getaway
 &HT;    By Jan Tuckwood
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When we plan a family trip, we steal a tip from
Eloise: ``Getting bored is not allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   You know Eloise, the 6-year-old scamp who lives on the top floor
of The Plaza hotel in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She became famous for the first time in 1955, when Kay
Thompson's ``Eloise'' came out, and she's famous again now. She's
scampering to an FA0 Schwarz near you with new toys and re-releases
of all of her books.
</P>
<P>
   So when we decided to take our four daughters _ ages 19 to 9 _
to New York, we consulted Eloise. Nothing gets a girl psyched for
the big city like a (somewhat bratty) role model.
</P>
<P>
   And I wanted them psyched. Not because they were going to their
idea of heaven _ the home of MTV's ``Total Request Live'' _ but
because they were going to mine: The Manhattan of the Gilded Age.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to turn their clocks back to a more refined time, to
educate them in the architecture of Stanford White, the technique
of high tea, the importance of the right hat.
</P>
<P>
   A history lesson? Sounds boooooring, right?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. When I peppered our travels with tales of fabulous gals
like Eloise and Edith Wharton, Evelyn Nesbit and Elsie de Wolfe, we
skittered right back in time, full of fascination all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Who are Eloise, Edith, Evelyn and Elsie, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   A subjective assessment: They're simply the world's luckiest
little girl, the world's best woman writer, the most beautiful
woman of the century and the world's first Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Eloise, who lives only in the heads of fanciful
folks, the other three ladies lived, loved and created at the end
of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   To know them is to know New York of the Gilded Age.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST STOP: Tea at The Plaza
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows about The Plaza, especially kids who have read
the Eloise books or seen ``Home Alone II: Lost in New York.'' I
didn't even need to point out the hotel. When my 9-year-old saw the
doormen and the famous double P sign at the corner of 59th and
Fifth, she bounded up the stairs and into the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Her first question: Where's Eloise?
</P>
<P>
   We took a walk through the magnificent hotel, built in 1907, and
soon found her: Hilary Knight's famous painting of Eloise, star of
Kay Thompson's books, hangs right by the Palm Court, where
civilized ladies love to sip tea.
</P>
<P>
   Civilized we were not. But place a china teacup in front of a
little girl and even the most dedicated tomboy can master a perfect
pinkie lift.
</P>
<P>
   My 12-year-old, Kate, is a high-tea pro, having sipped Earl Grey
at Brown's Hotel in London. But tea at The Plaza was a first for
Tess, 9, who promptly fell in love with cucumber sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   We sipped, nibbled and carried on a dignified conversation for
an hour. It seemed proper to do a little name-dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-crumpet, I dished: Did you know that the Vanderbilts were
just about the richest family that ever lived when this hotel
opened? Did you know that they had a mansion right next door? And
that Albert Vanderbilt, great-grandson of Cornelius, the one who
made all the money in railroads, was the very first guest at The
Plaza? Oh, and did you know that designer Gloria Vanderbilt got
engaged at this very hotel?
</P>
<P>
   The girls sat spellbound, rapt with these society snippets, the
scones and the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Gossip _ even very old gossip _ sticks with a gal, much like a
passion for clotted cream.
</P>
<P>
   For this pleasant memory with my daughters, I happily shelled
out $29 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Like Eloise, we said: ``Charge it, please! And thank you very
much!''
</P>
<P>
   MORE GOSSIP: Who was the real Lady Mendl?
</P>
<P>
   We enjoyed a spot of tea the next day, too, this time in a place
steeped with the memory of real women: Lady Mendl's Tea Salon at
the Inn at Irving Place.
</P>
<P>
   We took a taxi downtown to Gramercy Park _ a park so wonderful
and private that only people who live around it (including Julia
Roberts) have a key to the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Gramercy, I told the girls, attracted some of the most prominent
writers of the 19th century: Edith Wharton, O. Henry, Herman
Melville and Stephen Crane all lived in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   If you were alive 100 years ago, I told them, and if you were
very witty and charming, you might have visited the very spot where
we're going _ 17th Street and Irving Place, a few blocks south of
Gramercy.
</P>
<P>
   Just walking down this street brings back the rush of history.
It looks much as it did when horse-drawn carriages brought fair
ladies to the steep steps of their brownstones.
</P>
<P>
   The Inn at Irving Place, two meticulously restored townhouses
built in 1834, has no sign, just a tiny picture of a teacup by the
door.
</P>
<P>
   We opened the door and gasped: Dark wood. A grand staircase.
Intricate fireplaces. Welcome to the Gilded Age of the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   A formally dressed fellow ushered us into Lady Mendl's Tea
Salon, just off the entryway.
</P>
<P>
   We took our seats on the Victorian-style couch, poured our tea
from a sterling samovar and thought about the ladies who once lived
like this.
</P>
<P>
   Who was the real Lady Mendl? She was Elsie de Wolfe, a 5-foot-2
dynamo decorator who popularized chintz, vanity tables and cocktail
parties. She _ not Martha Stewart _ was the first marketer of the
gracious lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Elsie was born around 1865. ``I was an ugly child, and I lived
in an ugly age,'' she wrote in her memoirs. ``From the moment I was
conscious of ugliness and its relation to myself and my
surroundings, my one preoccupation was to find my way out of it. In
my escape, I came to the meaning of beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   She got rid of the gloomy Gothic look and brought in cheery
fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Elsie was famous for her pronouncements: ``Plates should be hot,
hot, hot; glasses cold, cold, cold; and table decorations low, low,
low.'' And, ``I believe in optimism and white paint!''
</P>
<P>
   Elsie and her companion, Bessie Marbury, lived directly across
from the townhouses that are now the Inn at Irving Place. Their
famous salons attracted the sharpest wits of the day: Oscar Wilde,
Sarah Bernhardt, Ethel Barrymore.
</P>
<P>
   When Elsie was 61, she married Sir Charles Mendl and became a
real Lady.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Edith Wharton, Elsie's friend, shared her passion for
decor _ and also for purse dogs. Both Edith and Elsie carried
around small dogs.
</P>
<P>
   No dogs or doggie bags allowed at Lady Mendl's Tea Salon,
though.
</P>
<P>
   After five fabulous courses that set us back $30 per person, we
wandered back out onto the streets of this literary neighborhood
and learned about another one of Elsie's pals: architect Stanford
White.
</P>
<P>
   LOVERS' TRIANGLE: Stanford, Evelyn and Harry
</P>
<P>
   The Gramercy Park neighborhood is full of the memory of Stanford
White, who was called ``the greatest designer that this country has
ever produced'' by Vanity Fair magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He lived here and designed many notable buildings here,
particularly a lavish pleasure palace known as Madison Square
Garden. White's Madison Square, opened in 1890, featured a nude
statue of the goddess Diana atop its tower. But a nude Diana wasn't
half as shocking as the life and death of Stanford White. He loved
beautiful women, particularly Evelyn Nesbit, the stunning actress
who became the model for the Gibson Girl.
</P>
<P>
   In 1906, while watching a revue at Madison Square Garden, White
was shot three times by crazy millionaire Harry K. Thaw, Evelyn's
husband.
</P>
<P>
   A headline in Vanity Fair after his death: ``Stanford White,
Voluptuary and Pervert, Dies the Death of a Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   White's Madison Square Garden is long gone _ the New York Life
Insurance Company (with its golden pyramid roof) now stands on the
site _ but many of his buildings live on.
</P>
<P>
   To get a good look at his work, visit the New York Palace Hotel
at 50th and Madison. The hotel rises from the Villard Houses, a
stunning Gilded Age mansion White built in 1882. Inside the Villard
Houses is the famous restaurant Le Cirque _ too fancy and expensive
for my kids, but they did get a chance to ogle the original marble
fireplace in the hotel lobby.
</P>
<P>
   LADY LIBERTY and
</P>
<P>
   New York's most historic block
</P>
<P>
   All American children should climb to the crown of the Statue of
Liberty at least once. We waited two hours just for the chance to
spend 90 minutes climbing up 354 stairs.
</P>
<P>
   The climb itself is dull until you make it past the 11-story
pedestal into the skirt of Miss Liberty. She's made of 310 copper
plates riveted together and held with iron bars, sort of an Eiffel
Tower with a thin copper skin.
</P>
<P>
   It was worth it: My children, each armed with a disposable
camera, used most of their film inside Liberty's crown.
</P>
<P>
   If you visit the statue in the summer or on a holiday weekend,
like we did, you must take the first ferry of the day to guarantee
a chance to climb.
</P>
<P>
   If you visit in the fall or winter, you'll have time after the
statue to walk from the ferry dock to Hanover Square, the most
historic block in New York. This block, full of 18th- and
19th-century buildings, is surrounded by the glass skyscrapers of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The original Delmonico's restaurant, where high-society dined,
is still here, on Beaver Street, with a big script ``D'' engraved
in the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Owners have changed many times in the past 170 years, but it's
currently open Monday through Friday and serving the Wall Street
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The next best place to have a drink: Harry's at Hanover Square,
which feels like walking into another era.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK DOWN: At old Manhattan
</P>
<P>
   New York grew from the southern tip of the island northward, so
to get a bird's-eye view of the oldest buildings, head to the top
of the tallest, the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   From the 107-floor observation deck, we could see New York's
original City Hall, Trinity Church (designed in 1846) and the
stunning Woolworth Building, built in 1913. And lots more, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   The Empire State Building observatory has a better view of
skyscrapers, but the World Trade Center gives you the best look of
old New York.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know which the kids liked better: The view or the sheer
terror of being up that high. For a truly scary experience, go up
to the open-air deck. It's like being on the wing of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Cost to go to the top: $12.50 for adults, $9.50 for seniors and
$6.25 for children 12 and under.
</P>
<P>
   Our reward: A stunning sunset over a city the girls had come to
know, thanks to Eloise, Edith, Evelyn and Elsie.
</P>
<P>
   If Eloise had been there, she might agree: It was all rawther
exciting.

 &HT;    Eddie Fisher's book seems to stretch truth
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember a singer named Eddie Fisher?
</P>
<P>
   I do. Vaguely. The main thing I recall about him is that he was
marred to Elizabeth Taylor when she ran off with Richard Burton. It
was in all the papers back then. Oh yeah, he'd left Debbie Reynolds
to run off with Liz before that. That was in all the papers, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you're old enough, you probably remember something about both
those magnificent episodes. Like I said, it was in all the papers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Fisher has recently come out with a book telling the
details behind those and other scandals of bygone days, and nights.
It's titled ``Been There, Done That'' (St. Martin's Press). And boy
hidee! is his story a humdinger! Somehow or another, though, I
can't quite swallow it all as the truth and nothing but the truth.
</P>
<P>
   As some of you know, I don't ordinarily write here about books I
didn't like as I read them. I'm making an exception this time. I'm
not sure why. Maybe because this particular book outraged me so
that I want to make sure you don't bother to read it. It's
certainly not worth the $24.95 price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some may rush right out and buy it because I declare
it unworthy, particularly since its unworthiness has to do with its
vulgarity. There is a lot of ``sex-and-tell'' in it, but the
vulgarity that struck me is in the attitude of the author.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensively, the author is, of course, Fisher, but there is a
ghost writer in the mix. His name also happens to be Fisher, David
Fisher, but apparently he is not kin to Eddie. At least there is no
mention of a kinship in the jacket notes that tell us the ghost
writer has previously ghosted books for Ed McMahon, George Burns
and ``several sports figures.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what is it about this so-called memoir that offends me so?
It's mainly the attitude, which I attribute to Eddie Fisher, the
singer/man-about-town/self-styled woman magnet and greatest singer
to come down the pike.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he says on page one chapter one: ``The gift in my
throat. ... made me a star, one of the most successful singers in
American history ... I had more consecutive hit records than the
Beatles or Elvis ...''
</P>
<P>
   As I said, I remember Eddie Fisher and some of his songs, ``Oh,
My PopPa,'' for example, but I don't recall him causing anything
even nearly equal to the excitement caused by the Beatles or Elvis,
nor any one of several other singing stars of the '40s, '50s and
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   And the women! He has nothing but insults for the women who
supposedly chased him day and night until they caught him, then did
him dirty. He does say a few complimentary things about Taylor, the
one who treated him like a slave and humiliated him publicly
something fierce by having an open affair with Richard Burton
during the filming of ``Cleopatra'' in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he is a dedicated masochist. That would explain a lot in
his book. But nothing can excuse the way he talks about Debbie
Reynolds, his wife when he ran off with Liz, and Ann-Margaret, and
even his male friends, including Robert Wagner and William Holden,
both of whom he describes as sobbing like babies when they
discovered their loved ones were having affairs with other men.
Gee, thanks, Eddie, I'm sure they thought, ``that's just what I
want my public to know about me.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene he describes when Ann-Margaret surprises him in his
dressing room after a show was embarrassing for me and I don't even
know Ann-Margaret. ``She fell immediately to her knees to show me
how much she'd missed me ...''
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a couple of Fisher's former wives and girlfriends
interviewed on TV since his book came out and they were less than
complimentary and called him a liar. I'm inclined to believe them
after skimming through this book-length tabloid trash. Come to
think of it, the publisher is the same one who had to recall that
so-called bio of Texas Gov. George W. Bush after finding out the
author was a convicted felon.

that slavery had much to do with Southern secession. They point to
states' rights, self-determination, liberty, protection of hearth
and home, everything but slavery. No historical event as vast as
the creation of a Southern nation can be explained in monocausal

   DOGGIE _ ATLANTA _ As portion sizes in restaurants get bigger
and bigger, more and more folks are getting extra mileage out of
those meals by doggie-bagging it, according to a new survey. We
look at what's driving the trend, who's doing it and why. We also
look at how restaurants are encouraging it by using fancier,
improved packaging. (Kessler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

of a rash of business books that take a bunch of quotes from famous
people and put them together to look like a leadership manual)

together some of the ones the author left out - and they're a lot
more insightful, we think. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BARGAINS _ If your holiday social calendar exceeds your clothing
budget, don't worry. You can still put together a festive wardrobe
that's versatile enough for parties and family gatherings without
spending a small fortune. We show you three different holiday looks
that cost less than $150. All it takes is an eye for style and a
couple of core pieces that you can mix and match. (Hill, Atlanta

Manhattan (the historic Delmonico's, Harry's at Hanover Square and
Fraunces Tavern); peek in the windows of Stanford White's
Metropolitan Club, wish we were rich enough to have dinner at Le

(Erstein, Palm Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   TORREYEA-PARK (36 inches) _ Torreyea State Park is one of the
best views in Florida, simple, solitary, splendid. The eye wings up
over tranquil miles of tufted forests, fading from green to blue in
the distance, to a horizon of rain-washed pure air. Hundreds of
feet below, beyond a steep tumble of trees and shrubs, the
toffee-colored Apalachicola River runs

   WITH: VIEWING LISTS _ List of shows that are popular with Latino

   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS _ As shaggy as it is shagadelic, ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' is really just an excuse to revel

Service) Art includes an 18-pica color photo from ``Austin Powers:
The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>

Boys and Fiona Apple. (Staff, Cox News Service) art includes a
6-pica color photo of Fiona Apple.
</P>
<P>

Ashes'' (based on the popular book), Ang Lee's ``Ride With The

team of Gilbert and Sullivan), ``Cider House Rules'' and, of
course, ``Toy Story 2.'' Plus we detail the latest buzz on other
coming films, including Denzel Washington's ``The Hurricane,'' Matt
Damon's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' Jodie Foster's ``Anna and the

</P>
<P>
   WITH: N.Y. TIMES BEST SELLERS LIST
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-HILLARY _ Maybe it's her we should be building a library
for, not her husband. It probably goes without saying that Hillary
Rodham Clinton has broken the mold when it comes to U.S. first
ladies. It's still about 18 months until her husband leaves office,
and yet some 40 books already have been written largely or
completely about her. (Even the relatively controversial Nancy
Reagan barely hit double figures _ well after leaving the White
House.) And apparently, the deluge is just beginning. Last month it
was ``Bill and Hillary _ The Marriage.'' Come November it will be
publication of dueling tomes (including one from ``Passages''
author Gail Sheehy) purporting to take us inside Hillary's head.
And don't even get us started on the writers who've already signed
contracts to produce books about the all-but-declared Hillary
Clinton-Rudy Giuliani Senate race. A look at the phenomenon of
Hillary Literature and speculation on when _ and if _ it will ever
end. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   Moving in (e) entertainment and (p) politics categories.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-GATES _ Henry Louis Gates Jr. cannot help being disarming
and ingratiating in the same breath. He is that way in public and
in private, a self-confessed ``race'' man who doesn't believe in
race, a man who ``loves everything about African-American culture''
but wears a neatly pressed white shirt every day, a black man who
had a white girlfriend in elementary school, another in high school
and today is married to a white woman. If they are contradictions,
they help to explain why Skip Gates has rapidly become a black man
for all seasons, showing up on PBS, in The New Yorker, on the op-ed
page of the New York Times and, now, on book tours promoting
``Wonders of the African World,'' the companion volume to the PBS
series, and ``Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African
American Experience.'' (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-GATES-BIO _ Bio box on Skip Gates. (Skube, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-GATES-LIST _ Recommended reading: Books by Skip Gates.
(Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-DUBNER _ ``Turbulent Souls'' author Stephen Dubner
wrestles free of his parents' adopted Catholicism to reclaim
Judaism. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-CARTER _ Interview with Buddy Carter about his new
biography of his father Billy Carter. Contrary to popular belief,
the First Brother was not just a beer-guzzling service station
owner. He was an avid reader, shrewd businessman and a complex
character. Buddy talks about his differences with his father and
how they reconciled. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   EYMAN-ON-BOOKS _ A look at ``Hitchcock Poster Art.'' Weekly
books column by Scott Eyman. (Eyman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-WEASEL _ James Patterson has successfully managed to
transcend the beach books and become a brand name writer. Review of
the book ``Pop Goes the Weasel,'' by James Patterson. (Eyman, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-STORM _ Few can comprehend the power of a big storm like
the one that hit Galveston, Texas, in 1900. Even weather service
employee Isaac Cline had no idea. Review of the book ``Isaac's
Storm'' by Erik Larson. (Reid, Palm Beach Post) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-APPELFELD _ NEVASSERET ZION, Israel_ Author who survived
Holocaust has new fears for America. ``The book is about escaping
Judaism and how you cannot escape it,'' Appelfield says, ``And this
is a tragedy.'' (Engelhardt, Palm Beach Post) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-CRICHTON _ A conversation with Michael Crichton, the
writer who makes science fun and (for himself) incredibly
lucrative, inspiring such films and TV shows as ``Jurassic Park,''
``E/R'' and ``Disclosure.'' His newest novel, ``Timeline,''
shuttles to parallel universes of different centuries along the
wormholes of quantum physics. (Hulbert, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-NOTES _ The latest Stephen King, available only on
audiotape and read by the author, is _ no surprise _ a collection
of horror stories. The twist is, these stories are all about the
horrors of tobacco, and the nightmares smokers go through for
another puff on the noxious weed. ... Also, former Miami Herald
journalist Tannarive Due plans to finish a project Alex Haley
started, a novel about Madam C.J. Walker, the first black
millionaire. ... Amazon.Com users pick their favorite books, etc. .
. What does Don Imus' decision to drop Imus Book Awards mean to
Barnes &AMP; Noble and the publishing world? (O'Briant, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-MILNER _ Remember a singer named Eddie Fisher? I do.
Vaguely. The main thing I recall about him is that he was marred to
Elizabeth Taylor when she ran off with Richard Burton. It was in
all the papers back then. (Milner, Cox News Service) MOVED

   SLAVERY-COMMENTARY _ A significant number of Southerners deny
that slavery had much to do with Southern secession. They point to
states' rights, self-determination, liberty, protection of hearth
and home, everything but slavery. No historical event as vast as
the creation of a Southern nation can be explained in monocausal
terms. But there can be no doubt about the centrality of racial
slavery to the creation of the Confederacy. In fact, no slavery, no
Confederacy. (Roark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   DOGGIE _ ATLANTA _ As portion sizes in restaurants get bigger
and bigger, more and more folks are getting extra mileage out of
those meals by doggie-bagging it, according to a new survey. We

look at how restaurants are encouraging it by using fancier,
improved packaging. (Kessler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BOOKS-HILLARY _ Maybe it's her we should be building a library
for, not her husband. It probably goes without saying that Hillary
Rodham Clinton has broken the mold when it comes to U.S. first
ladies. It's still about 18 months until her husband leaves office,
and yet some 40 books already have been written largely or
completely about her. (Even the relatively controversial Nancy
Reagan barely hit double figures _ well after leaving the White
House.) And apparently, the deluge is just beginning. Last month it
was ``Bill and Hillary _ The Marriage.'' Come November it will be
publication of dueling tomes (including one from ``Passages''
author Gail Sheehy) purporting to take us inside Hillary's head.
And don't even get us started on the writers who've already signed
contracts to produce books about the all-but-declared Hillary
Clinton-Rudy Giuliani Senate race. A look at the phenomenon of
Hillary Literature and speculation on when _ and if _ it will ever
end. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BOOKS-GATES _ Henry Louis Gates Jr. cannot help being disarming
and ingratiating in the same breath. He is that way in public and
in private, a self-confessed ``race'' man who doesn't believe in
race, a man who ``loves everything about African-American culture''
but wears a neatly pressed white shirt every day, a black man who
had a white girlfriend in elementary school, another in high school
and today is married to a white woman. If they are contradictions,
they help to explain why Skip Gates has rapidly become a black man
for all seasons, showing up on PBS, in The New Yorker, on the op-ed
page of the New York Times and, now, on book tours promoting
``Wonders of the African World,'' the companion volume to the PBS
series, and ``Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African
American Experience.'' (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

wrestles free of his parents' adopted Catholicism to reclaim
Judaism. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post)

   BOOKS-CARTER _ Interview with Buddy Carter about his new
biography of his father Billy Carter. Contrary to popular belief,
the First Brother was not just a beer-guzzling service station
owner. He was an avid reader, shrewd businessman and a complex
character. Buddy talks about his differences with his father and
how they reconciled. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   EYMAN-ON-BOOKS _ A look at ``Hitchcock Poster Art.'' Weekly

transcend the beach books and become a brand name writer. Review of

   BOOKS-STORM _ Few can comprehend the power of a big storm like
the one that hit Galveston, Texas, in 1900. Even weather service
employee Isaac Cline had no idea. Review of the book ``Isaac's
Storm'' by Erik Larson. (Reid, Palm Beach Post) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-APPELFELD _ NEVASSERET ZION, Israel_ Author who survived
Holocaust has new fears for America. ``The book is about escaping
Judaism and how you cannot escape it,'' Appelfield says, ``And this
is a tragedy.'' (Engelhardt, Palm Beach Post) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-CRICHTON _ A conversation with Michael Crichton, the
writer who makes science fun and (for himself) incredibly
lucrative, inspiring such films and TV shows as ``Jurassic Park,''
``E/R'' and ``Disclosure.'' His newest novel, ``Timeline,''
shuttles to parallel universes of different centuries along the
wormholes of quantum physics. (Hulbert, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-NOTES _ The latest Stephen King, available only on
audiotape and read by the author, is _ no surprise _ a collection
of horror stories. The twist is, these stories are all about the
horrors of tobacco, and the nightmares smokers go through for
another puff on the noxious weed. ... Also, former Miami Herald
journalist Tannarive Due plans to finish a project Alex Haley
started, a novel about Madam C.J. Walker, the first black
millionaire. ... Amazon.Com users pick their favorite books, etc. .
. What does Don Imus' decision to drop Imus Book Awards mean to
Barnes &AMP; Noble and the publishing world? (O'Briant, Atlanta

<P>
   BOOK-MILNER _ Remember a singer named Eddie Fisher? I do.
Vaguely. The main thing I recall about him is that he was marred to
Elizabeth Taylor when she ran off with Richard Burton. It was in
all the papers back then. (Milner, Cox News Service) MOVED

<P>
   KASHGAR, China _ This exotic Silk Road city doesn't look, smell
or sound like China.
</P>
<P>
   Mosques jut elegant minarets above the low skyline, calling
faithful to prayer in a Turkic-based tongue. Succulent,
cumin-scented lamb chunks broil on sidewalk grills. And wall clocks
in restaurants and shops brazenly herald the hour _ two hours off
official time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Beijing's best efforts to tame this wild western region
of the world's last communist empire, resentment still simmers
against Chinese rule here. At times, it heats into explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Xinjiang ranks with Tibet and Taiwan as China's most worrisome
political flashpoints. Today, Beijing suffers even greater angst
after watching ethnic rebellions spread elsewhere in the world _
Chechnya, East Timor and most of all Kosovo, where NATO intervened
on behalf of ethnic Albanian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility is most widely and quietly marked here on the clocks
and watches of ethnic Uighurs (pronounced ``WEE-gurs''), the
Muslim, Turkic-speaking descendants of the Huns. They live two
hours behind Beijing time, following the rhythm of the sun instead
of the central government's mandate that all China observe the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps the only safe protest allowed in this region 1,800
miles west of Beijing that has convulsed periodically in riots,
bombings and killings staged by Uighur activists. They are fighting
for independence and full religious freedom in this land of
mountains and desert that comprises one-sixth of all China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had the struggle against separatist activity
throughout our history. It has never ceased,'' acknowledged Ablait
Abdureschit, governor of the Xinjiang (pronounced ``SHIN-jyan'')
Uighur Autonomous Region, and himself a Uighur who is loyal to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never allow splittists to separate Xinjiang from our
motherland,'' Abdureschit said in a recent interview in the modern
regional capital Urumqi, echoing the determined declarations of
officials from the bottom of the bureaucracy to the top guns in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China's two-pronged approach to subduing Xinjiang focuses on
economic development, which is aimed at eliminating dissatisfaction
with Chinese rule, and on strong-arm security aimed at eliminating
those who express discontent anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Shi Shaolin, a Han Chinese and deputy commissioner of Kashgar
prefect, is proud of the changes Chinese have brought to this city
of 350,000 and to the still backward countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``After liberation the central government invested lots of money
in this district,'' he said, referring to the 1949 founding of
China's communist regime. ``We paved roads connecting every
township and brought electricity into every town.''
</P>
<P>
   New China also brought millions of Chinese, who both helped
develop the region and diluted the ethnic mix. In 1949, the
non-Chinese population was 93 percent, mostly Uighur, and Chinese
were about 7 percent. By 1997, the more than 17 million population
was 47 percent Uighurs, 42 percent ethnic Chinese, and 11 percent
Kazak and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Chinese got the best jobs in government and industry,
and now with their experience elsewhere are making inroads in
commerce, or so the Uighurs complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Uighur people have little chance to learn new things,
like computers. Uighurs just work in trade. Or they are farmers,''
said one Uigher who did not want his name published for fear of
arrest. He said computers are limited to high government offices,
which rarely are staffed by Uighurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things change very slowly here for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively high-paying oil industry is one example. The
major oil fields of China National Oil Company employ some 4,000
people, but only about 300 of them are Uighurs, according to vice
president Jia Chengzao.
</P>
<P>
   Irritation is palpable among Uighurs who refuse to go into
Chinese restaurants or snigger in Uighur about Chinese officials
who don't understand the language.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese leaders proclaim they respect the local culture
and traditions, they sometimes show little understanding of either.
</P>
<P>
   Two female government officials, both Han Chinese who grew up in
Xinjiang, laughed at a foreign female guest who hurried to buy a
scarf at the bazaar before walking into a mosque. The Chinese went
bareheaded into the cavernous prayer room to meet with the chief
imam.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries they would not be permitted to enter a mosque
bareheaded, but here no one objected. One Uighur Muslim quietly
thanked the foreign visitor for respecting Islam by wearing a
scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Uighurs know that protesting can cost them dearly. Simply
speaking to a foreign visitor without authorization has sent some
Uighurs to jail.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the second tactic of Beijing's strategy here.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said
it documented 190 executions in Xinjiang from January 1997, through
last March, or an average of one execution every 4.3 days.
Thousands more have been detained, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The last large-scale protests erupted in 1997, resulting in mass
arrests and as many as 100 deaths. But security forces have kept
occupied with smaller agitations, such as the six Uighur gunrunners
executed in mid-September, and with preventing big ones.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 28, Xinjiang's public security defused an
anti-government ``political rebellion'' planned to coincide with
China's Oct. 1 national day in Khotan, a center of unrest in south
Xinjiang, according to Abdul Aziza, director of Kashgar's
administration of religion and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year before Oct. 1 we have a meeting to keep alert for
this kind of riot,'' said Aziza, blaming the separatist activities
on an ``East Turkistan group'' related to an ``Islamic party'' that
he said has branches in every county.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   East Turkistan is the name around which independence-minded
Uighurs rally. Two short-lived Republics of East Turkistan were
proclaimed to exist here in Kashgar in 1933 and in Ili in the north
in 1944, but both fell quickly to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   While the practice of Islam is permitted, it is strictly
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Its presence is obvious in the working mosques dotting the
countryside, and the mostly older women who cover their heads and
sometimes faces with brown, burlap-like cloths.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of religious suppression during China's Cultural
Revolution the central government in 1977 started rebuilding
destroyed mosques and allowed Islam to re-emerge. But freedoms were
constricted again in the late 1980s, by Chinese leaders apparently
fearing unmanageable growth and radical influences from neighboring
Islamic countries of Central
</P>
<P>
   Asia that split off from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic imams, or leaders, deemed insufficiently patriotic were
purged, mosque construction halted and schools teaching the Koran,
the Muslim bible, were either outlawed or tightly monitored. At
Kashgar's central Id Kah Mosque, for example, a line of rooms once
used to give Koranic instruction now sit dark and empty.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For now, China looks solidly in control here.
</P>
<P>
   The Uighurs are not so lucky as the Tibetans, who have their
Dalai Lama to center their cause and celebrities like actor Richard
Gere to publicize it in the West. Exiled Uighur activists have 50
Internet Web sites, but the Uighurs are neither united under a
single leader nor do they enjoy the support of any famous Western
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Many Uighurs have made their peace with China, gladly accepting
the railroads and water systems and any new jobs offered.
</P>
<P>
   However, should China suffer the same kind of economic downturn
that led to the Soviet collapse, all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think China is in danger of falling apart. So in that
sense China has over-reacted (to the separatists),'' said Dru
Gladney, a China-watcher at Honolulu's Asia-Pacific center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if China should run into (economic) trouble,'' he said,
``there would be these ethnic fault lines.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KASHGAR, China _ This exotic Silk Road city doesn't look, smell
or sound like China.
</P>
<P>
   Mosques jut elegant minarets above the low skyline, calling
faithful to prayer in a Turkic-based tongue. Succulent,
cumin-scented lamb chunks broil on sidewalk grills. And wall clocks
in restaurants and shops brazenly herald the hour _ two hours off
official time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Beijing's best efforts to tame this wild western region
of the world's last communist empire, resentment still simmers
against Chinese rule here. At times, it heats into explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Xinjiang ranks with Tibet and Taiwan as China's most worrisome
political flashpoints. Today, Beijing suffers even greater angst
after watching ethnic rebellions spread elsewhere in the world _
Chechnya, East Timor and most of all Kosovo, where NATO intervened
on behalf of ethnic Albanian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility is most widely and quietly marked here on the clocks
and watches of ethnic Uighurs (pronounced ``WEE-gurs''), the
Muslim, Turkic-speaking descendants of the Huns. They live two
hours behind Beijing time, following the rhythm of the sun instead
of the central government's mandate that all China observe the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps the only safe protest allowed in this region 1,800
miles west of Beijing that has convulsed periodically in riots,
bombings and killings staged by Uighur activists. They are fighting
for independence and full religious freedom in this land of
mountains and desert that comprises one-sixth of all China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had the struggle against separatist activity
throughout our history. It has never ceased,'' acknowledged Ablait
Abdureschit, governor of the Xinjiang (pronounced ``SHIN-jyan'')
Uighur Autonomous Region, and himself a Uighur who is loyal to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never allow splittists to separate Xinjiang from our
motherland,'' Abdureschit said in a recent interview in the modern
regional capital Urumqi, echoing the determined declarations of
officials from the bottom of the bureaucracy to the top guns in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China's two-pronged approach to subduing Xinjiang focuses on
economic development, which is aimed at eliminating dissatisfaction
with Chinese rule, and on strong-arm security aimed at eliminating
those who express discontent anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Shi Shaolin, a Han Chinese and deputy commissioner of Kashgar
prefect, is proud of the changes Chinese have brought to this city
of 350,000 and to the still backward countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``After liberation the central government invested lots of money
in this district,'' he said, referring to the 1949 founding of
China's communist regime. ``We paved roads connecting every
township and brought electricity into every town.''
</P>
<P>
   New China also brought millions of Chinese, who both helped
develop the region and diluted the ethnic mix. In 1949, the
non-Chinese population was 93 percent, mostly Uighur, and Chinese
were about 7 percent. By 1997, the more than 17 million population
was 47 percent Uighurs, 42 percent ethnic Chinese, and 11 percent
Kazak and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Chinese got the best jobs in government and industry,
and now with their experience elsewhere are making inroads in
commerce, or so the Uighurs complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Uighur people have little chance to learn new things,
like computers. Uighurs just work in trade. Or they are farmers,''
said one Uigher who did not want his name published for fear of
arrest. He said computers are limited to high government offices,
which rarely are staffed by Uighurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things change very slowly here for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively high-paying oil industry is one example. The
major oil fields of China National Oil Company employ some 4,000
people, but only about 300 of them are Uighurs, according to vice
president Jia Chengzao.
</P>
<P>
   Irritation is palpable among Uighurs who refuse to go into
Chinese restaurants or snigger in Uighur about Chinese officials
who don't understand the language.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese leaders proclaim they respect the local culture
and traditions, they sometimes show little understanding of either.
</P>
<P>
   Two female government officials, both Han Chinese who grew up in
Xinjiang, laughed at a foreign female guest who hurried to buy a
scarf at the bazaar before walking into a mosque. The Chinese went
bareheaded into the cavernous prayer room to meet with the chief
imam.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries they would not be permitted to enter a mosque
bareheaded, but here no one objected. One Uighur Muslim quietly
thanked the foreign visitor for respecting Islam by wearing a
scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Uighurs know that protesting can cost them dearly. Simply
speaking to a foreign visitor without authorization has sent some
Uighurs to jail.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the second tactic of Beijing's strategy here.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said
it documented 190 executions in Xinjiang from January 1997, through
last March, or an average of one execution every 4.3 days.
Thousands more have been detained, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The last large-scale protests erupted in 1997, resulting in mass
arrests and as many as 100 deaths. But security forces have kept
occupied with smaller agitations, such as the six Uighur gunrunners
executed in mid-September, and with preventing big ones.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 28, Xinjiang's public security defused an
anti-government ``political rebellion'' planned to coincide with
China's Oct. 1 national day in Khotan, a center of unrest in south
Xinjiang, according to Abdul Aziza, director of Kashgar's
administration of religion and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year before Oct. 1 we have a meeting to keep alert for
this kind of riot,'' said Aziza, blaming the separatist activities
on an ``East Turkistan group'' related to an ``Islamic party'' that
he said has branches in every county.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   East Turkistan is the name around which independence-minded
Uighurs rally. Two short-lived Republics of East Turkistan were
proclaimed to exist here in Kashgar in 1933 and in Ili in the north
in 1944, but both fell quickly to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   While the practice of Islam is permitted, it is strictly
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Its presence is obvious in the working mosques dotting the
countryside, and the mostly older women who cover their heads and
sometimes faces with brown, burlap-like cloths.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of religious suppression during China's Cultural
Revolution the central government in 1977 started rebuilding
destroyed mosques and allowed Islam to re-emerge. But freedoms were
constricted again in the late 1980s, by Chinese leaders apparently
fearing unmanageable growth and radical influences from neighboring
Islamic countries of Central
</P>
<P>
   Asia that split off from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic imams, or leaders, deemed insufficiently patriotic were
purged, mosque construction halted and schools teaching the Koran,
the Muslim bible, were either outlawed or tightly monitored. At
Kashgar's central Id Kah Mosque, for example, a line of rooms once
used to give Koranic instruction now sit dark and empty.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For now, China looks solidly in control here.
</P>
<P>
   The Uighurs are not so lucky as the Tibetans, who have their
Dalai Lama to center their cause and celebrities like actor Richard
Gere to publicize it in the West. Exiled Uighur activists have 50
Internet Web sites, but the Uighurs are neither united under a
single leader nor do they enjoy the support of any famous Western
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Many Uighurs have made their peace with China, gladly accepting
the railroads and water systems and any new jobs offered.
</P>
<P>
   However, should China suffer the same kind of economic downturn
that led to the Soviet collapse, all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think China is in danger of falling apart. So in that
sense China has over-reacted (to the separatists),'' said Dru
Gladney, a China-watcher at Honolulu's Asia-Pacific center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if China should run into (economic) trouble,'' he said,
``there would be these ethnic fault lines.''

   These are just two of the many responses from editors across the
country who have published ``Ain't Done Yet: A Newspaper Novel
About the So-Called End of the World'' _ 29 suspenseful
installments, by ROY PETER CLARK, the Poynter Institute senior
scholar and well-known writing coach. It's available exclusively
from The New York Times Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   The novel tracks a doomsday cult with a charismatic,
wordplay-loving leader and explosive plans for New Millennium Eve.
It features an unforgettable cast of characters. Mystery. Romance.
Spine-tingling suspense. Tears. Laugh-out-loud laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't Done Yet,'' commissioned as a millennium project by The
New York Times Regional Newspaper Group, is an exceptional
editorial/marketing opportunity that can start working for your
newspaper immediately.

</P>
<P>
   _ It is written to be read in short, digestible, six-minute
chapters.

   _ It combines an action-packed narrative with
spiritual/philosophical themes that make it a
holiday/turn-of-the-century special event _ a natural for
imaginative advertising sponsorships. (The novel ends minutes after

 &HT;    NATIONAL 'Y2K CZAR' PREPS FOR HIS MOMENT OF TRUTH
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here it comes again; the same question, asked for
the umpteenth time at the umpteenth press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you be willing to fly on Dec. 31st?''
</P>
<P>
   And once again, John Koskinen, head of the White House effort to
crush Y2K bugs, replies that he will be flying round-trip from
Washington to New York at 7 p.m. EST, the moment when 2000 arrives
for pilots and air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Because airlines operate on Greenwich Mean Time to avoid
time-zone confusion, 2000 will begin in the aviation world when
midnight strikes in Greenwich, England, five hours before the ball
drops at New York's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The usual airline schedule cutbacks on New Year's Eve have made
it hard for Koskinen to schedule his promised flight. But he will,
he vows.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who have followed Y2K issues for months have heard
Koskinen explain his travel plans repeatedly. But as Jan. 1 draws
closer, the number of reporters assigned to the story keeps
growing. And at each press conference, scheduled almost daily now,
a new reporter asks the old airplane question.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen answers not just with patience, but with enthusiasm.
His consuming mission is to educate every American about Y2K, the
software flaw that exists because many older computer programs and
chips recognize only the last two digits of the year. When 2000
arrives, those computers may misinterpret ``00'' as 1900 and cause
equipment malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   Since February 1998, Koskinen has been in charge of the
President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion. So far, the job
has required him to fill two roles: scold and comforter.
</P>
<P>
   On the scolding side, he has had to badger industry and
government officials to take Y2K seriously. At the same time, he
has had to project cool confidence about the date rollover. One
poorly worded answer to a question about the soundness of the
financial system, and he could trigger a run on banks.
</P>
<P>
   With less than six weeks left to prepare for Y2K, Koskinen's
role is changing. The time to urge people to fix computers has
passed. The message today is to make contingency plans for doing
jobs manually should computers fail.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Koskinen's time is spent preparing the Information
Coordination Center, the high-tech office two blocks from the White
House where he will pull together Y2K updates and tell Americans
what is happening on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   He seems well suited to the job, an extremely smart man with a
trim, athletic body, at once relaxed and intense. Born in
Cleveland, Ohio, in 1939, he graduated magna cum laude from Duke
University. A Phi Beta Kappa member, he then went to Yale Law
School and did post-graduate work at Cambridge University in
England.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Palmieri Co., he spent two decades
overhauling financially failing corporations, including Penn
Central Transportation Co. and Levitt and Sons. In the mid-1990s,
he served as deputy director of the federal Office of Management
and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   In his current job, he is the subject of innumerable conspiracy
theories, spun by people who believe the government is lying about
Y2K dangers. He also is mocked by those who think Y2K amounts to
media hype. But those in Congress and industry working on Y2K
issues widely regard him as just the right man for the midnight
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting recently about his personal preparations, Koskinen said
he has gotten his flu shot. He added that he soon will start
avoiding crowds to dodge cold viruses. In training mentally and
physically for Dec. 31, Koskinen is readying to have billions of
eyes from around the world look to him for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the flight attendants give him extra peanuts and two
pillows on that 7 p.m. flight.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am building some floor-to-ceiling wood shelves on one wall
in my family room and want to make sure that the vertical sides
will be absolutely plumb and vertical.
</P>
<P>
   Because the walls, as well as the floors and high ceilings in
this old house, are not really level I cannot simply measure in
from a corner of the room to draw a truly vertical line on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   How can I plumb the vertical ends of my built-in bookcase
without having to go out and buy an expensive long spirit level of
some kind?
</P>
<P>
   A: The simplest way to draw a vertical line that is absolutely
plumb is to snap a chalk line on the wall by using a plumb bob and
length of chalked line as shown here.
</P>
<P>
   The line should be coated with chalk powder by rubbing it over a
piece of chalk or by passing it through powdered chalk (sold in
hardware stores).
</P>
<P>
   Tie a plumb bob to the bottom end of this line and tie the top
end to a nail driven into the wall up near the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Allow the line to hang free until the weighted plumb bob down
near the floor stops swinging, then pull the string tight while
holding the plumb bob steady at the bottom with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   With the other hand pull the center of the string out an inch or
two from the wall, then allow it to snap back against the wall.
This will create a chalked line on the wall that will be exactly
plumb.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The exhaust fan in our bathroom rattles when it is running.
Can you tell me if this rattle can be corrected, and if the fan
really should exhaust bathroom odors?
</P>
<P>
   A: The rattle is probably due to one of two things: the fan
blade could be loose on its shaft, or the blade could be hitting
something inside the housing when it is spinning.
</P>
<P>
   This can be determined by pulling off the housing or grill that
covers the fan, then turning off the power and rotating the fan
blade by hand while observing what happens as the blade spins.
</P>
<P>
   As for the fan's use _ most home bathroom fans in general are
intended to exhaust moisture when bathing. They do help to exhaust
odors, but most are not really large enough to do a thorough job of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The aluminum siding on my house was originally brown, but now
the color is dull and faded.
</P>
<P>
   When I accidentally spilled some linseed oil in one area near
the garage, I noticed that the oil made the color look darker and
more like its original color.
</P>
<P>
   Since I like the appearance, and since this was accomplished
without painting, I wonder if it would be possible to do this on
all the siding on that side of the house?
</P>
<P>
   A: The trouble with linseed oil is that it is very susceptible
to mildew _ it will usually turn dark and blotchy looking in time.
Most oils will have this same affect on dark colors, but the color
will not last as long as paint.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you want try this, then don't use linseed oil.
Instead, use a product like Penetrol, or one of the clear
penetrating wood sealers that are sold in all paint stores.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our family room and kitchen windows get lots of afternoon
sun, which makes these rooms uncomfortably warm during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   I have installed window shades, but these tend to darken the
rooms and kill our outside view.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a special glass or some kind of clear film we can
install that will help solve this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are transparent window films that can be applied to
window glass to greatly cut down on the amount of heat that will
come through that glass. Some are clear but the most efficient ones
are slightly tinted (usually an amber cast).
</P>
<P>
   Most create a ``mirror'' effect on the outside during daylight
hours (you can see out, but outsiders can't see in). At night the
effect is the opposite: if interior lights are on, you cannot see
out, but those outside can see in.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``PLUMB LINE'' goes with this column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Chalked plumb line will mark vertical line on wall when
snapped lightly after pulling plumb line tight.

 By SALLY BOWEN and DOUGLASS STINSON, with BETH RUBENSTEIN in Buenos
Aires and JAMES WILSON in Panama City 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LIMA, Peru _ Blanca and Jaime Gorenstein consider themselves
part of Latin America's middle class, ``or at least we did,'' says
Blanca. When they married, Jaime's three-employee business had been
importing car parts for three years. But for the better part of
this decade, business has gone from good to bad, a bit better and
then terribly worse. Finally, he shut it down.
 &HT;    Now Jaime helps out a couple of friends in a sales job, but his
salary is variable and the $400 Blanca brings in monthly from her
part-time secretarial job is essential. Friends who were also doing
reasonably well are now selling property for working capital to
keep their businesses going.
 &HT;    ``There's only enough for necessities,'' says Blanca. The
Gorensteins closed their checking accounts and have no credit
cards, save one for frugal shopping at a local department store.
They have to think hard to recall their last major household
purchase. ``In the past six or seven years, nothing,'' says Blanca.
``On the contrary, we were robbed three years ago and we couldn't
replace the large television set. We just keep watching the little
one.''
 &HT;    The portrait of the Latin American middle class has not turned
out as first sketched. Over the last decade, reformers behind
economic liberalization from Argentina to Mexico claimed their
programs would shrink poverty and create jobs _ effectively
shifting the subsistence working masses in the region upward into
the ranks of consuming middle-class citizens. Ten years of
accumulated evidence shows otherwise. The gap between the ``haves''
and the ``have-nots'' is growing faster than ever. Unemployment
hovers at record levels in a number of countries.
 &HT;    The LATIN TRADE Consensus Forecast shows that the region's
economies, after bottoming out this year, should begin to recover.
But the modest gains forecast _ no more than around 4 percent GDP
growth in Chile and Peru _ do not rival the double-digit and
high-single-digit growth rates posted at the beginning of the
decade. Furthermore, population growth continues to outstrip
economic performance, leaving more people to share less pie.
Profiles of middle-class families (see sidebars) add fuel to the
notion that individuals are feeling the squeeze.
 &HT;    Researchers at Strategy Research, a market research firm focused
on the region, say many companies mistook the burst of consumer
spending that took place in the early 1990s as a sign that Latin
America's middle class was coming of age. '' 'Growing middle
class,' that's what everyone wants to hear,'' says John A.
Holcombe, vice president of Strategy Research. ``We say you have to
understand the market.'' The run on everything from cars to washing
machines to big-screen televisions owed much to pent-up demand
combined with a burst of stability, consumer confidence and easy
credit.
 &HT;    In the United States, fully half of household income goes to
either rent or mortgage payments plus transportation costs _
usually car loans, insurance and maintenance. Latin Americans are
free of many of those costs: Young families live with parents, use
public buses more readily and do not bother with such things as
health insurance. That leaves more money free in the flush times,
like the early 1990s, to buy long-denied ``luxuries,'' that
middle-income U.S. families would take for granted _ say, an
electric dryer or stereo system.
 &HT;    The reality, says Holcombe, is that Latin purchasing power is
still hovering around the same levels as in the mid-1970s. For
consumers, Latin America's lost decade, in fact, threatens to
blossom into the misplaced quarter-century. ``In Latin America, the
problem is that people don't have any money,'' said Jose Gonzalez
of CLSA Global Emerging Markets at a recent conference on economic
prospects.
 &HT;    Governments have responded to the situation as governments will:
by jiggering the statistics. With few options other than the
belt-tightening and privatization mandated by the financial
markets, governments have sanitized the socioeconomic fallout by
redefining poverty levels and the definition of unemployment,
seeming to create dramatic drops in both categories across the
region.
 &HT;    That has improved the overall macroeconomic outlook, but has
done little to companies' bottom lines. Businesses that depend on a
healthy middle class, such as retail chains, purveyors of pay TV,
and automobile manufacturers, to name a few, in recent years are
not hitting the numbers as fast as they had originally hoped. While
auto sales have plummeted in Brazil and Argentina this year, for
example, companies have tried to put a brave face on billions in
investment, telling all comers that the costly endeavors are a must
for establishing brand recognition for the sure-to-come boom.
``It's definitely a viable market,'' says Ivette de Reubens,
regional marketing manager for Microsoft. ``Just not as developed
as the United States.''
 &HT;    The corporate success stories of this decade come from companies
that sell products that everyone needs and can afford.
Colgate-Palmolive and Procter &AMP; Gamble sell small, cheap packages
of shampoo and detergent. Unilever sells many more ice cream bars
than gallon containers of chocolate. The low-priced products are
within consumers' reach and, conveniently, have healthy margins.
 &HT;    Mexican retailer Elektra went another route: financing expensive
white goods in small monthly payments that allowed even the poorest
consumers to buy a refrigerator or television. With interest rates
often over 100 percent a year, such plans made financing appliances
more lucrative than selling them.
 &HT;    Across Lima from the Gorensteins' house, stockbroker Charles
Fyfe has what would seem the quintessential job for a developing
middle-class society. But selling Peru's blue chip equities to
investors is just his day job. Fyfe holds stakes in a number of
small ventures oriented toward the plastic-razor-buying market,
like a company that distributes one-use sleeves of shampoo to
Lima's shantytowns. ``If you want to get rich in these countries,
you've got to sell things to poor people,'' he says. He waxes
poetic over an old school buddy who has made his fortune selling
building materials _ cement and roofing _ in small lots by driving
trucks into the shantytowns and selling each brick on a cash basis.
 &HT;    In October 1994, American Demographics published an article
headlining Mexico's ``bulging'' middle class. A few short months
later, in December 1994, the peso crisis suddenly gobbled up all
the gains. Everyday Mexicans watched their savings devalue and
their credit card debts soar. Suddenly they were back to a beans
and tortillas diet and struggling to find a second job to help
cover costs.
 &HT;    Nearly five years later, Mexico seems back on track and families
are once again starting to buy their version of the American Dream.
Meanwhile, South America suffers mightily under the constraints of
the Asian contagion, depressed commodities prices and the bust of
the Brazilian real.
 &HT;    Argentine entrepreneur Ruben Gonzalez has seen earnings drop by
half at his two laundromats. The vagaries brought about by
uncertain economics have kept him a conservative man. A bachelor,
he lives in a small house and keeps things simple. His car is 15
years old and he says he doesn't waste money on luxury goods. His
clients, however, seem to be deciding that paying to clean their
clothes is also a luxury. ``A few years ago, the laundry business
was better. Now, people like to borrow their family's washing
machines because the extra money spent on laundry is a burden,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Recessions have halted the growth needed to increase the middle
class across the continent. Gains are on hold in Argentina, Peru,
even scrappy Chile, while Brazil and smaller economies like Ecuador
have lost ground. Analysts say Brazil is rebounding faster than
expected from its devaluation, but in many ways, consumers are
blighted with the same process that took Mexicans five years to
slog through.
 &HT;    Brazilians are entering what economists call the ``informal
economy'' in droves. A more accurate term might be urban
subsistence, similar to the way rural peasants grow their own crops
and survive outside the money economy. In cities, however,
desperate job seekers sell whatever they can to their neighbors and
friends. Impromptu, in-home beauty salons and lunch counters, and
door-to-door salespeople are cropping up to replace lost jobs or
supplement incomes after hours. No overhead means such goods and
services are cheaper than traditional companies can offer, but they
chip away at the tax base.
 &HT;    The boombust cycle over the last few years has at once raised
hopes and caused people to resign themselves to a life of greater
effort for diminishing gains. No one complains about the end of the
era of hyperinflation. At least that has allowed Latin Americans to
take a breather from ever-escalating prices.
 &HT;    The missing ingredient, of course, is growing purchasing power
for the masses. For that to happen, the region will have to put
together a string of years of strong growth, not just
flash-in-the-pan results. ``They need stability and balanced
budgets for 10 or 15 years before a broad base of consumers
emerges. Think what happens when you create a middle class in Latin
America that can buy goods,'' Merrill Lynch analyst Eduardo Cabrera
says. ``The potential is tremendous.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, a class of consumers that cannot buy goods is
``middle'' only as in ``middle of nowhere.''

 Por SALLY BOWEN y DOUGLASS STINSON, con BETH RUBENSTEIN en Buenos
Aires y JAMES WILSON en Panama 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features)  &HT;    LIMA _ Blanca y Jaime Gorenstein se consideran de clase media.
``O por lo menos nos considerabamos asi,'' dice Blanca. Cuando se
casaron, el negocio de Jaime, que tenia tres empleados, llevaba
tres anos importando piezas para automoviles. A principio le fue
bien, pero la situacion se deterioro hasta que tuvo que cerrar el
negocio.
 &HT;    Ahora Jaime trabaja en ventas, pero su salario es variable y los
US$400 mensuales que Blanca gana de secretaria son esenciales. Los
amigos a quienes les va mejor venden propiedades para conseguir
capital y mantener sus negocios.
 &HT;    ``Solo hay para las primeras necesidades,'' dice Blanca. Los
Gorenstein cancelaron su cuenta corriente y no tienen tarjetas de
credito, solo una cuenta frugal en la tienda por departamentos de
la localidad. A Blanca le cuesta trabajo recordar cual fue la mayor
compra que hizo para la casa. ``En los ultimos seis o siete anos no
hemos comprado nada. Al contrario, nos robaron hace tres anos y no
pudimos reponer el televisor grande; seguimos viendo el chico.''
 &HT;    El retrato de la clase media latinoamericana no ha salido como
se penso al principio. En la ultima decada, los partidarios de la
liberalizacion economica afirmaban que sus programas reducirian la
pobreza y crearian empleos, elevando a las masas que trabajaban
solo para subsistir a la categoria de consumidores de clase media.
Diez anos de evidencias indican otra cosa. La brecha entre ricos y
pobres crece con mas rapidez que nunca. En varios paises el
desempleo ha llegado a niveles record.
 &HT;    El Pronostico de Consenso de LATIN TRADE muestra que las
economias de la region, tras tocar fondo este ano, deben iniciar un
proceso de recuperacion. Pero los modestos pronosticos de
crecimiento (no mas del 4 por ciento de crecimiento del PIB en
Chile y Peru) estan muy por debajo del crecimiento de casi el 10
por ciento logrado a principios de la decada. Ademas, el aumento de
la poblacion sigue superando al rendimiento economico, y los
perfiles de familias de clase media refuerzan la percepcion de que
los individuos sienten la crisis en carne propia.
 &HT;    Los expertos de Strategy Research, una firma de investigacion de
mercado que se especializa en Latinoamerica, afirman que muchas
companias malinterpretaron la avalancha de gastos del consumidor
que tuvo lugar a principios de los anos 90 y pensaron que era una
senal de que la clase media latinoamericana habia madurado. ``El
crecimiento de la clase media, eso es lo que todo el mundo quiere
oir,'' dice John A. Holcombe, vicepresidente de Strategy Research.
``Pero les decimos que tienen que entender el mercado.'' El alud de
compras de articulos como autos, lavadoras, televisores grandes,
etc., se debio a la demanda reprimida, combinada con un auge de la
estabilidad, la confianza del consumidor y las facilidades de
credito.
 &HT;    En Estados Unidos, la mitad de los ingresos familiares se
destina al pago del alquiler o la hipoteca y a los costos del
transporte, generalmente al prestamo, el seguro y el mantenimiento
del auto. Los latinoamericanos no tienen que cubrir muchos de estos
gastos: los matrimonios jovenes viven con los padres, usan el
transporte publico y no se preocupan de cosas como el seguro de
salud. Por eso, cuando llegan tiempos de auge economico, como a
principios de esta decada, tienen mas dinero para comprar articulos
de lujo, que las familias norteamericanas de ingresos medios
consideran normales, como una secadora o un estereo.
 &HT;    La realidad, dice Holcombe, es que el poder adquisitivo en
America Latina es hoy similar al de mediados de los anos 70. Para
los consumidores, la decada perdida de America Latina amenaza con
extenderse. ``En Latinoamerica, el problema es que la gente no
tiene dinero,'' dijo Jose Gonzalez, de CLSA Global Emerging Markets
refiriendose a las perspectivas economicas.
 &HT;    Los gobiernos han respondido como casi siempre: manipulando las
estadisticas. Como practicamente no tienen mas alternativa que
acatar la orden de los mercados financieros de privatizar y
apretarse el cinturon, los gobiernos han disfrazado el fracaso
socioeconomico cambiando la definicion del nivel de pobreza y de
desempleo, con lo que lograron dar la impresion de que ambos
indices se habian reducido notablemente en toda la region.
 &HT;    Esa maniobra mejoro la perspectiva macroeconomica, pero no las
ganancias empresariales. Los negocios que dependian de una clase
media saludable, como las cadenas minoristas y los fabricantes de
autos, no han tocado las cifras que habian previsto. Aunque las
ventas de autos se han desplomado en Brasil y Argentina este ano,
por ejemplo, las companias justifican los miles de millones en
inversiones afirmando que son imprescindibles para alcanzar el
reconocimiento de la marca cuando finalmente llegue el auge. ``Es
un mercado viable,'' dice Ivette de Reubens, gerente regional de
mercadeo de Microsoft. ``Solo que no tan desarrollado como en
Estados Unidos.''
 &HT;    Los exitos de esta decada los han cosechado empresas que venden
productos que todo el mundo necesita y puede pagar.
Colgate-Palmolive y Procter &AMP; Gamble venden paquetes de champu y
detergente pequenos y baratos. Unilever vende muchas mas paletas de
helado que galones de chocolate, pero los margenes de ganancias de
este tipo de producto barato al menudeo son saludables.
 &HT;    El minorista mexicano Elektra tomo otra ruta: financiar
electrodomesticos caros con bajos pagos mensuales que permitian
hasta a los mas pobres comprar un refrigerador o un televisor. Con
tasas de interes que a menudo sobrepasan el 100 por ciento anual,
es mas lucrativo vender los articulos a plazos.
 &HT;    En el extremo de Lima opuesto a la casa de los Gorenstein, el
corredor de bolsa Charles Fyfe tiene lo que parece ser el empleo
tipico en una sociedad de clase media en vias de desarrollo. Pero
vender acciones de companias peruanas a los inversionistas es su
trabajo de dia. Fyfe tambien tiene intereses en varias empresas
pequenas orientadas al mercado de los articulos baratos de higiene
personal, como una compania que distribuye pequenos envases de
champu en los barrios marginales de Lima. ``Si uno quiere hacerse
rico en estos paises, tiene que venderle a los pobres,'' afirma.
Cuenta la anecdota de un companero de estudios que hizo fortuna
vendiendo materiales de construccion en pequenas cantidades.
Llevaba los ladrillos en camion a las barriadas pobres y los vendia
en efectivo.
 &HT;    En octubre de 1994, American Demographic publico un articulo
sobre la gran expansion de la clase media de Mexico. En diciembre
del mismo ano, la crisis del peso devoro subitamente todo lo que se
habia ganado. Cada dia los mexicanos veian devaluarse sus ahorros y
crecer su deuda de tarjetas de credito. Tuvieron que regresar a la
dieta de tortillas y frijoles y buscar un segundo empleo para
cubrir los costos.
 &HT;    Casi cinco anos despues, Mexico parece estar en vias de
recuperacion y las familias abrigan nuevas esperanzas. Entretanto,
Sudamerica sufre el contagio de la crisis asiatica, la caida de los
precios de los productos basicos y el derrumbe del real brasileno.
 &HT;    El empresario argentino Ruben Gonzalez ha visto bajar a la mitad
los ingresos de sus dos lavanderias. Los altibajos de la incierta
economia lo han convertido en un hombre conservador. Es soltero,
vive en una csa pequena y tiene costumbres frugales. Su auto es de
hace 15 anos y no gasta en lujos. Pero sus clientes parecen pensar
que lavar la ropa fuera de casa tambien es un lujo. ``Hace unos
anos, el negocio de las lavanderias iba mejor. Ahora la gente va a
lavar a la casa de algun familiar que tenga lavadora para evitar el
gasto adicional de la lavanderia,'' dice.
 &HT;    La recesion ha frenado el crecimiento necesario para desarrollar
la clase media en todo el continente. En Argentina, Peru y Chile no
se gana terreno, mientras Brasil y economias menores como la de
Ecuador han dado marcha atras. Los analistas dicen que Brasil se
recupera con mas rapidez de la esperada de la devaluacion, pero en
muchos sentidos los consumidores deben sufrir lo mismo que los
mexicanos durante cinco anos.
 &HT;    Los brasilenos se incorporan por miles a lo que los economistas
llaman la economia informal. Un termino mas exacto seria la
subsistencia urbana, un fenomeno muy parecido al de los campesinos
que cultivan sus parcelas para autoabastecerse y viven fuera de la
economia monetaria. En las ciudades, gente desesperada vende lo que
puede a vecinos y amigos. Por todas partes aparecen vendedores a
domicilio y expendios de comida y salones de belleza improvisados
en las casas para compensar la perdida del empleo o redondear el
sueldo. Estos productos y servicios son mas baratos, pero al mismo
tiempo se reduce la base tributaria porque las empresas informales
no pagan impuestos.
 &HT;    Los altibajos de los ultimos anos han creado esperanzas y a la
vez han hecho que la gente se resigne a una vida de mas trabajo por
menos dinero. Nadie se queja del fin de la hiperinflacion, que al
menos le ha dado un respiro a los latinoamericanos.
 &HT;    Desde luego, el ingrediente que falta es el aumento del poder
adquisitivo de las masas. Para que eso suceda, la region tendra que
disfrutar de varios anos seguidos de un vigoroso crecimiento; no
basta con resultados efimeros. ``Necesitan estabilidad y
presupuestos balanceados durante 10 o 15 anos para que aparezca una
vasta base de consumidores. Imaginense lo que sucederia si se crea
una clase media en America Latina que pueda comprar productos,''
dice Eduardo Cabrera, analista de Merrill Lynch. ``El potencial es
enorme.''
 &HT;    El problema esta en que el surgimiento de esa clase de
consumidores todavia parece un suceso muy remoto.

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WASHINGTON -- After a decade-long struggle between Catholic
theologians and the hierarchy led by Pope John Paul II, Catholic
bishops have gained the upper hand.
 &HT;    By a vote of 223-31, American bishops approved new rules
requiring every theologian to be approved by his local bishop if
they are to continue to teach at the nation's 235 Catholic colleges
and universities which educate 670,000 students.
 &HT;    While the measure includes assurances of academic freedom,
Catholic institutions of higher education were urged to hire a
president and a majority of faculty, staff and trustees who are
''Catholics committed to the Church.''
 &HT;    And theologians teaching ''authentic Catholic doctrine'' must
request a ''mandatum,'' or mandate of approval, from their Catholic
bishop.
 &HT;    In 1990, the pope issued a paper, Ex Corde Ecclesiae (From the
Heart of the Church) which attempted to define the relationship
between the church and Catholic institutions of higher learning.
John Paul, a former university professor with two earned
doctorates, was concerned that Catholic theologians -- particularly
in Europe -- were defying traditional Catholic teaching.
 &HT;    Each national group of bishops was asked to draft a plan to
implement Ex Corde Ecclesiae. U.S. bishops approved a less rigid
plan in 1996. But the Vatican rejected it as too vague. Last year
the bishops had a new draft, but a vote was delayed pending more
dialogue with presidents of Catholic institutions. More changes
were made.
 &HT;    ''But the institutional presidents are still objecting to the
specifics of the document that they feel may be attempting to turn
colleges and universities into grammar schools,'' wrote Tim
Unsworth in National Catholic Reporter. Indeed, the presidents of
Notre Dame and Boston College called the document ''profoundly
detrimental to Catholic higher education'' and an ''obvious threat
to academic freedom.''
 &HT;    But they have no vote at the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops.
 &HT;    In a 90-minute debate this week, Bishop Edward Braxton of St.
Louis said, ''It is important that we support and pass this
document.'' He recalled that Harvard, Yale and Princeton all began
as theological schools, ''but have moved out of their
ecclesiastical setting. I have taught at Harvard and Notre Dame.
The original Harvard seal said, `Veritas, truth in Christ and
church.' But `in Christ and church' have been removed.''
 &HT;    Some professors at Catholic institutions ''think theology should
not be related to Christ but are free entrepreneurs in seeking
veritas,'' he said.
 &HT;    However, Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland, one of the few
bishops left who was elevated to his position by John Paul's
predecessor, declared, ''Passing this document now will create a
pastoral disaster for the Church in the U.S.A. The tensions between
the hierarchy and theologians now are the highest I have ever seen
it in my 36 years as a superior.
 &HT;    ''Theologians will be ever more defensive and have less trust.
Their reputation and their livelihood are at stake. They are also
not just afraid of being at the whims of individual bishops, but
also the object of vigilante groups,'' raising the specter that
students who think their professors are heretical will write to the
bishop to complain, with a copy sent to Rome.
 &HT;    Cardinal Roger Mahoney of Los Angeles, one of four cardinals to
speak, asserted, ''To the presidents of Catholic colleges and
universities, you have nothing to fear from us as your bishops and
pastors. This is a new moment, an exciting new moment.''
 &HT;    Father Tom Reese, editor of America and a former professor at
Georgetown, profoundly disagreed: ''Trust cannot be legislated. It
can only be done through persuasion, conversation and dialogue.
Does this mean the bishop will say who can teach and who can't? It
will torpedo the kind of dialogue that is essential to preserve
Catholic identity.''
 &HT;    Bishop John Leibrecht of Springfield, Mo., chairman of the
report's drafting committee, emphasized flexibility in the text. He
noted, that the rules state the majority of trustees and professors
should be Catholic ''to the extent possible,'' adding that
non-Catholics on campus were told that they are ''deeply
appreciated and needed.''
 &HT;    The new policy has to be approved by Rome, and then it will be
enacted in a year. But it gives bishops and theologians two years
to establish the mandatum.
 &HT;    Details are surprisingly vague. There are no specific criteria
for granting or withholding approval. What happens if a theologian
does not apply for the mandatum? The bishop does not have the power
to fire a professor. The university will have to decide whether to
defend his academic freedom or to fire the professor, sparking a
likely lawsuit. Even if the lawsuit is won, such a case could cost
$50,000.
 &HT;    Catholics are moving into an era of high conflict.

`WORLD' REALLY IS NOT ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:  2.5 stars  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've seen it before and you've seen it done better. But if
you're a Bond fan, that probably doesn't matter, does it? Because
you could say the same thing about the last dozen entries in this
tired series, and yet 007 keeps chugging along, recycling the same
chase scenes and martini recipes for new generations of moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough,'' the 19th official entry in the most
profitable series in film history, has its fun moments, but they're
few and far between. It's not nearly as enjoyable as the last Bond
film, ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' which benefited greatly from the
invigorating presence of Hong Kong martial arts star Michelle Yeoh.
In this ``World,'' everything _ the villains, the babes, the stunts
_ merely seems adequate. You will be neither shaken nor stirred.
</P>
<P>
   While familiarity does not breed contempt for this venerable
series, it does take away some of the enjoyment _ unless you come
up with some interesting twists on the formula. Director Michael
Apted, best-known for dramas like ``Nell'' and ``Coal Miner's
Daughter,'' doesn't show any inclination to put his own stamp on
the series, and the screenplay (credited to three writers) creaks
at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bond's success has rarely had much to do with the
writing. Indeed, ``World'' opens with a thrilling, 15-minute,
pre-credits chase sequence that's one of the best in its long
history. The prologue finds Bond (Pierce Brosnan) in Spain at Frank
Gehry's new Guggenheim Museum, looking to collect a large sum of
money recovered from a dead agent. Complications, naturally, ensue
and soon 007 is jumping out a high-rise window and, a little later,
pursuing a hot babe on the Thames in a wild speedboat chase.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen the boat race before (``Live and Let Die''), but this
is the one instance where ``World'' rewrites history to fine
effect. But once the credits roll, it's all downhill with
uninspired set pieces, tedious plot developments and groaningly bad
acting.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the latter comes courtesy of Denise Richards, who plays
Dr. Christmas Jones, a nuclear physicist given to wearing hot pants
and a tank top. To be fair, Richards and the movie are in on the
joke, but that doesn't explain all the unintentional laughter
coming from the audience every time she opens her mouth. Even
playing a Bond bimbo, she's out of her league here.
</P>
<P>
   Richards' more experienced co-stars include Sophie Marceau,
playing a rich heiress whom Bond must protect. Marceau pulls off
some nice shadings in the role and has some potent chemistry with
Brosnan. The usual alphabetical suspects are also on board: M (Judi
Dench) and Q (Desmond Llewelyn), who are joined by a protege, R
(John Cleese, criminally underused). Robert Carlyle fills the silly
villain's shoes, surprisingly to no particular effect.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan, like his predecessors, will never escape the shadow of
Sean Connery, but he delivers a polished, if somewhat overly
serious, performance. It's not his fault the 007 franchise is stuck
in a rut. But if the series' caretakers don't shake things up soon,
it will be Austin Powers, not James Bond, who will wear the mantle
of superspy in the 21st century.

FORCING THE ISSUE IS A MUST

<P>
   There is no mystery about what happens to the Patriots when they
lose this year.
</P>
<P>
   They lose the battle along the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   They can't run against a good defense. They can't stop the run
against a decent running game.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL season stats get right to the point.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 AFC teams, including the expansion Cleveland Browns,
the Patriots rank 14th in rushing . . . and, surprise, they're 14th
in trying to stop the run.
</P>
<P>
   The fans and reporters can talk all they want about the
Patriots' coaching whenever the team fails, but that is not the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   So they went for a touchdown with a yard to go in the first
quarter Monday night against the Jets, trailing just 7-0, and
didn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   So they threw the ball with one minute left in the first half,
trailing, 14-3, and the Jets intercepted it and cashed in for a
quick touchdown. That's not the reason the Patriots lost to the
Jets, or the Chiefs or Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   In every one of those games, they've been outhit on both sides
of the line of scrimmage. The other teams just played tougher. The
Patriots are just not a physical team. And football is still a game
of blocking and tackling.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy football types want to make more out of it than that,
but when you want to be one of the best in the NFL, sooner or later
you have to match the opposition physically or go home a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Miami and Buffalo are tougher teams. The Patriots have to try to
win in both of those places the next two weeks, and if they decide
to play ``soft'' like they did Monday night, they'll lose both
games.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the players to take a little inventory and find
out if they have the heart to win the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe is the best quarterback in the game right now. This
is not just the opinion of your humble reporter; every coach who
has faced him this year says the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   When he has time, he just eats up the opposition. Monday night,
he didn't have a chance. The Jets had someone in his face all
night. They knocked him down 12 times. When they backed off after
going ahead, 24-3, Bledsoe got two quick scores. Then the Jets came
charging back, and in the final three possessions, just one
touchdown away from tying the game, the Patriots had a net of minus
1 yard in 11 plays.
</P>
<P>
   The stats show Miami always plays tougher at home. Coach Jimmy
Johnson blistered the team in Buffalo after the Bills embarrassed
his players, 23-3, Sunday. He's been on their backs all week.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be even more difficult for the Patriots to beat
the Bills in Buffalo in two weeks. Their defense is outstanding,
the AFC's most physical.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots lose to both Miami and Buffalo, then chances are
they'll be on the road in the playoffs trying to get to the Super
Bowl as a wild card. That doesn't happen very often. The Patriots
did it in 1985, and that team did it with heart and courage more
than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins assistant head coach Dave Wannstedt said the key to
winning Sunday is to contain the Patriots' passing game. Wannstedt:
``We will play a lot better than we did in Buffalo. That was just
one of those games. Actually, our defense didn't play that bad.
It's just that our offense didn't do much to help us out. Damon
(Huard) was a little nervous in that situation, and we didn't have
a good day on offense. As a team, we are healthy. We know the key
will be to keep Bledsoe and those wide receivers from making big
plays. I watched the Jets game, and I was surprised. The Jets did a
great job on defense. They did a lot of good things. When you can
stop that passing game, you have a good chance at beating the
Patriots.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He still stops to clear his throat every few minutes,
reminding you why he woke up Monday morning and told his boss he
couldn't come to work. After Rick Pitino got the news about Paul
Pierce's weak stomach and sore throat, the coach said Pierce was
``doubtful'' for Wednesday's game against the Cavaliers. But Pitino
has been around the 23-year-old man from Los Angeles for two
seasons now. He knows it takes more than that to keep the
6-foot-7-inch guard out of a game. And not just a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce considers himself a sportsman. He has a putter inside his
locker. He has a pool table in his basement (``My game is real
nice,'' he said with a smile). He has the same agent as dynamic
tennis sisters Venus and Serena Williams, so Pierce likes to think
he can play that sport, too. ``Oh, I'm good at tennis,'' he said.
``When you see this 6-7 frame rushing the net, watch out.'' One
thing his sickness confirmed for him is this: He's not a television
watcher. ``I don't watch it that much; it corrupts the mind,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His sports options limited, Pierce showed up at the FleetCenter
and helped the Celtics beat the Cavs, 114-103. He finished with 30
points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 steals . . . and 7 turnovers. If
you weren't one of the 14,140 people inside the arena, you would
have agreed with Pierce's TV analysis if you watched his first
half. Mind corruption? Certainly. He didn't look good. And he was
cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building was cold or something,'' he said. ``One time, I
was shaking my hand and my fingers were numb. That's how cold it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that ended in the third quarter, when Pierce went for 14
points. The Celtics still trailed by 7 entering the fourth, but
that was a lot better than the 15-point deficit they had faced in
the game's first six minutes. The new-look Cavs _ they even had new
uniforms with ``Cavs'' printed on their backsides _ were framing
themselves a blowout. Pierce talked afterward about the advantage
he had over 6-5 Cleveland guard Bob Sura, but in the first 30
seconds, there was Pierce attempting a shot and Sura blocking it.
Pierce looked around for a whistle and, amazingly on this night (60
personal fouls), there wasn't one.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Pierce had seven points and four turnovers. In the
locker room, Pitino made a few adjustments while Pierce made a deal
with whomever controls the FleetCenter thermostat. Or at least it
seemed that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air wasn't as cold in the second half,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He took 10 shots in the second half and made six of them. One of
his biggest came 2 1/2 minutes into the fourth. He took a pass from
Walter McCarty, lined up in the corner, and sank a 23-foot
3-pointer. That was big because it gave the Celtics a 1-point lead.
The Celtics hadn't led since scoring the first hoop, nine seconds
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Pierce knows how to play when he is sick. He also
knows how to play shooting guard, which was questioned before the
season began. He said there isn't much difference in what he is
asked to do. The only change is the faces he looks into. He now
sees thin guards who are often his size or smaller. He is excited
about that aspect of the new gig because he often finds he can
dominate the smaller men. How many shooting guards do you see with
11 rebounds?
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' win and Pierce's recovery masked some other
unpleasant storylines. One of them was the play of Cleveland rookie
point guard Andre Miller. He played only 19 minutes and had 13
points and 4 assists, but it is obvious that he is going to be a
very good point guard. People in Cleveland have seen Mark Price,
Kevin Johnson, Terrell Brandon, and Brevin Knight direct Cav
offenses since 1986. Some in the organization believe Miller can be
better than all of them. Why is this unpleasant? Miller was the
player the Cavs took with the gift first-rounder the Celtics handed
to them. (Just in case I haven't been blunt enough, I think Vitaly
Potapenko and a $30-plus million contract for Andrew DeClercq and
Miller was a terrible deal for the Celtics. But we'll revisit that
another time.)
</P>
<P>
   This also wasn't the best night for Antoine Walker. The captain
is in a 3-point shooting rut right now. That is, he is taking too
many of them. His 3-point attempts are dangerously similar to his
free-throw attempts. That should scare Walker, Pitino, and you (if
you care about the Celtics). Consider that Walker is 6-9 and close
to 250 pounds. Now consider that Bennett Salvatore, Ron Olesiak,
and Jason Phillips were virtually calling fouls on players who
exhaled too dramatically. With that in his favor, Walker did not
attempt a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   That's something Pitino and his staff will certainly discuss
during practice. But for now, they can point to the refreshing
story of Adrian Griffin (23 points, 11 rebounds). They can talk
about a game that began as if it would be an awful loss and wound
up as a double-digit win. And even better, they now know what it
takes to heal their sick shooting guard. All they have to do is
challenge him to a game. Any game.

 &HT;    Now and again, a television show comes out of nowhere that looks
and feels different, that captures the imaginations of viewers and
compels them to think as they're being entertained.
 &HT;    ``Star Trek'' did that, once upon a time. So did ``The
X-Files.'' To that list, you can add this season's freshman hit
``Now and Again.''
 &HT;    ``At the risk of sounding cocky, and I really don't mean to
sound that way, `Now and Again' is a show I would watch,'' actor
Dennis Haysbert says.
 &HT;    Haysbert, who's won critical praise on the big screen in the
``Major League'' movies and opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in 1992's
``Love Field,'' now plays the enigmatic, nattily dressed Dr.
Theodore Morris, a government scientist who keeps a tight rein on
his creation, superhuman Michael Wiseman (Eric Close).
 &HT;    Written by ``Moonlighting'' creator Glenn Gordon Caron, the
series is the story of a superpowered secret agent with a
bioengineered body and the brain of the ``late'' Michael Wiseman _
played by John Goodman in the pilot. Despite his powers, the new
Wiseman can't forget his wife (Margaret Colin) and teen-age
daughter (Heather Matarazzo), even as he faces off against
terrorists and other assorted threats to truth, justice and the
American way.
 &HT;    ```Now and Again' has a little bit of everything,'' Haysbert
says by cellular telephone from a New York taxi on his way to a
costume fitting. ``And it puts everything in there very seamlessly,
at least in my opinion and, apparently, in the opinion of the
people who have embraced it. The show has action, comedy, drama,
sci-fi and romance all rolled into one, and it literally jumps back
and forth from scene to scene.''
 &HT;    It's the first time in a decade that the actor has appeared in a
television series.
 &HT;    ``I was really making a conscious effort to stay away from
television, because I always thought the speed of it undermined the
quality,'' Haysbert says. ``But that's simply not the case here.
The writing by Glenn Gordon Caron and his staff is incredible. The
actors I'm working with are great. We all have very, very unique
characters to play, and somehow we all blend.
 &HT;    ``I think that's all unusual, especially on television today,''
he says. ``Very few shows have so much going for them, but those
few shows seem to be doing great.''
 &HT;    On a personal level, Haysbert sees ``Now and Again'' as a
character study about two men who come to rely on and trust one
another. Morris respects Wiseman, is proud of him and wants to
protect Wiseman's family, but must maintain a certain emotional
distance. After all, he is the boss.
 &HT;    And, while Morris may occasionally break out in song, he's
commanding and formidable without ever raising his voice.
 &HT;    ``That comes from his great confidence and his intelligence,''
Haysbert says. ``There is no need to yell and scream. If he were to
yell and scream, he'd lose some power. It's just not for him to do.
 &HT;    ``He's so much in control,'' the actor says, ``and I think
Michael depends on him. There's a lot of smart-aleck repartee, but
that's just Michael's way of trying to keep up.
 &HT;    ``And I think Theo actually enjoys that,'' he adds. ``He enjoys
that Michael has a mind of his own, that Michael can ruffle him a
little bit, but he's always in control.''
 &HT;    Haysbert is no stranger to science fiction, having appeared in
1999's ``The Thirteenth Floor'' and, earlier, the 1993 cult
favorite ``Suture,'' in which he played the twin brother of a white
man (Michael Harris) who tries to frame him for their father's
murder. Among his other credits are the recent ``Random Hearts''
and 1995's ``Waiting to Exhale.''
 &HT;    Prior to beginning ``Now and Again,'' Haysbert completed two
films, both due out next year: ``Love and Basketball,'' a
relationship drama co-starring Omar Epps and Alfre Woodard, and
``What's Cooking?,'' a slice of life about four Los Angeles
families, one black and the others Korean, Jewish and Hispanic.
 &HT;    Although he's been working steadily on the big screen, Haysbert
says that he saw ``Now and Again'' as the kind of career
opportunity that justified leaving his native Los Angeles and
relocating his family to Manhattan.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to get into something that gave me some
responsibility and that also spoke to my abilities,'' the actor
says. ``I don't think that I was being utilized as well and as
thoroughly as I could or should be in feature films.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to get into a television show that was special, that
would show off my versatility and what I can do,'' he says. ``Films
weren't allowing me to do that.
 &HT;    ``And `Now and Again' does.''

WHEN PEOPLE LIVED LOCALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)Nana, what does this word mean?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Local? Well, it means things that are close to you, in your
neighborhood or in your town.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Why would anyone use a word like that?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Well, a long time ago, people actually concentrated on things
that were local. If you looked in their heads, most of their
thoughts and energy were concentrated on things that were happening
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Like what?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Well, for example, Marblehead once had a local movie theater.
Your grandfather and I used to walk there and home, talking a mile
a minute. The owner, whose dad and granddad had run the theater
before him, picked movies that fit the town, good foreign films and
thoughtful independent movies. But even more important, say you
went to the movies alone. You'd always meet someone you knew and
have someone to sit with. Say you went with your husband. You'd run
into another couple and maybe go out for coffee afterward and it
would be a social occasion, not a solitary one. Life was much less
lonely when there were places where you ran into people without
having to make a formal date.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)My mother says never talk to anyone at the movies. You
didn't talk to strangers, did you?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's the odd thing, hon. The person in front of you in
line might seem to be a stranger, but it would turn out that you
had mutual friends, or a child in the same school, or you'd crossed
paths somewhere before. There really aren't any strangers when you
live locally.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Why did the movie theater go out of business?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Well, people believed it was important to see the very newest
movies the minute they came out, so they went to the malls. Or they
watched videos. I think people just got used to feeling lonely.
There's so much emphasis on getting what you want as an individual
that being part of a community no longer enters our minds as a way
of being happier.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)How did that happen?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Well, before the chains took over, a town newspaper used to be
filled with articles about that town. When your mom was little, I
wrote for our local paper _ about projects teachers were doing in
the schools, about interesting citizens, and one time, even what it
was like to work on a lobster boat. Most people back then read the
paper, knew what was happening, and as a result, had strong
opinions, so it was easy to start conversations. Back then folks
had time to participate in local affairs _ by voting, by joining
groups, by getting to know the people they read about. Now, with
one owner, the suburban papers all look the same. People are too
busy working or using the Internet to get involved in local issues,
so they don't care that the paper's full of articles that could
apply to any town in America. Most of them don't bother to read it
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Was anything else local, besides the movie and the
newspaper?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   You won't believe this, but the people who worked in local shops
knew my name and would ask how my family was. Not only did I run
into friends while I was shopping, but the people behind the
counter were like friends. The waitress at the coffee shop knew how
I took my coffee, and the pharmacist at the drugstore would ask
about my health. Now, of course, everyone patronizes chains because
they're cheaper, but nothing personal ever happens in them.
Faceless employees are more efficient. If you're in a hurry,
conversations slow you down.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Did you like living locally, Nana?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, hon, I don't know if I can even explain the kind of
connection we felt with one another. You called the place you lived
``your hometown'' for a reason. There's nothing in modern life that
compares with walking into a public place and being greeted with a
smile. Even if you were just running errands, you never felt
invisible. You were recognized everywhere you went. You had the
feeling you mattered to the people you met. Your town belonged to
you, and there was a special place for you in it as well. If
something wasn't going the way you liked, you didn't move. You got
together with other people who shared your concerns and actually
changed it. Is that enough information for your history paper?
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Thanks, Nana. You've been a big help.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Any time, sweetie. You know I'm here at the computer whenever
you want to chat.
</P>

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Online magazines cover lots of turf 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Read any good Web sites lately?
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't, you should. You can sit in front of your
computer and peruse a wide variety of outstanding articles, essays
and opinions. Don't believe the folks who tell you people don't
want to sit at computers reading things. That's baloney. If you
have the attention span to sit and read the stupid e-mail jokes
your relatives and co-workers send, you certainly have the stamina
to take on headier stuff.
</P>
<P>
   When you mention online magazines, most people just assume you
mean Salon (www.salon.com). Salon is a great online magazine with
great writers tackling topics ranging from racism to sex, politics
and raising kids. But you already know that, so let's move on to
some other online reading material.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a bad week for Microsoft, but its online magazine
Slate (www.slate.com) has never been in finer form. After many
sputters and misfires, including wordy articles, silly theme music
and even an online subscription plan, it's nice to see Slate settle
down and learn to love the online medium.
</P>
<P>
   Slate found its voice in political coverage that ranges from
presidential politics to foreign policy to parent company
Microsoft. Last week, the magazine ran a provocative story about
Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush titled ``Do Dim
Bulbs Make Better Presidents?''
</P>
<P>
   The article cited an article from The New Yorker offline
magazine, which touted Bush's less-than-stellar academic record at
Yale in the mid-1960s. The thoughtful essay wondered if one really
needs to be able to finish The New York Times' Sunday crossword
puzzle or name each and every Third World leader to be a good
president, and the answer was ``not necessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, you could run out and get The New Yorker magazine to read
the original article and see a reprint of the younger Bush's
college report card, but why bother when you can read Slate's
analysis and opinion at your computer? (Wake-up call to The New
Yorker: Get some essays and a few original Roz Chast cartoons
online and people will be reading your articles online instead of
reading better articles about them online.)
</P>
<P>
   This past week brought another bit of controversy in a
discussion of Michael Lind's ``Vietnam: The Necessary War.''
There's also a refresher course for presidential contenders and
others who skipped geography class, called ``How to Tell Armenia
From Azerbaijan,'' which is as easy to read and understand as the
maps and glossaries ABCNews.com has built its reputation on.
</P>
<P>
   Feed magazine's founders, Steven Johnson and Stefanie Syman,
have yet to get rich with their online magazine (www
</P>
<P>
   .feedmag.com), but it's certainly not for lack of intelligence
or trying. Feed may be short on money, but it's never short on
ideas. Last week's commentary on the end of the Microsoft era was
as good as anything published about the software maker.
</P>
<P>
   The only real criticism of Feed is that it can sometimes be too
self-consciously hip and intellectual. But then they make up for it
with a series of offbeat interviews with people you'd never think
to interview, like a boy-crazy editor at Seventeen magazine.
</P>
<P>
   We also refuse to give up on fledgling publication Way South
(www.waysouth.com). This journal of Southern literature from mostly
unknown writers is worth reading whether or not you live in the
South. Publisher Grayson Hurst Daughters recently sold a story to
the folks at Salon, which hopefully will drive some traffic back to
Way South and give the magazine the boost it needs.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York magazine, Feed is trying to partner with
online magazines of similar size and financial predicament to form
a portal site for small, hip Web publications.
</P>
<P>
   This, they believe, will be the key to success and the
inevitable initial public offering. But before anybody gets rich,
they need readers. So take the next logical step up from e-mail and
read something interesting online today.

 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In parts of this city's Dorchester neighborhood, home
to as many as 20,000 Vietnamese-Americans, trappings of the
homeland are visible in each shop window and on every street
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Stores crowding Dorchester Avenue offer videotapes of cai luong,
traditional Vietnamese folk opera, as well as foods like canned
rambutan, jackfruit chips, and prawn crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductions of the red-striped yellow flag of the former
Saigon government, which fell to communist forces in 1975, are
prominently displayed in homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And looming over all of this, some believe, is a perceived image
of Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese communist leader, painted in the
blue stripe of an abstract rainbow adorning the Boston Gas tank on
Dorchester Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But many Vietnamese immigrants call Ho Chi Minh a pariah in
their neighborhood. It is one of Boston's most curious ironies for
members of this staunchly anticommunist community that in their
midst sits the 73,000-square-foot rainbow in which many discern the
face of Ho.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the Vietnamese in Dorchester left their homeland to
escape the communist regime that imprisoned them, appropriated
their businesses, and shuttered their churches when it occupied
South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Chi Minh, who founded and led the country's communist
movement until his death in 1969, personifies tyranny in the eyes
of most Vietnamese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ho Chi Minh and me are enemies,'' Phanreil Thach, 46, on his
way to shop at the Vien-Dong Far East Supermarket, said in a
typical comment.
</P>
<P>
   Corita Kent, the late artist, pacifist, and former nun who
designed the prize-winning peace rainbow in 1971, denied that the
image of the man known in Vietnam today as ``Uncle Ho'' is embedded
in the mural.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Vietnamese believe that, in Big Brother fashion,
Uncle Ho is watching.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about the gas tank's hidden face have passed along
Dorchester Avenue as the Vietnamese community has burgeoned in
recent years. The story is repeated over banh mi thit sandwiches
and cups of ca phe sua, Vietnamese coffee served with sweetened
condensed milk.
</P>
<P>
   Some consider the rainbow an insult. Others are indifferent,
uninterested in any reminder of the turbulent past. Many simply do
not believe that Ho's image overlooks the Vietnamese beauty salons
and travel agencies from a mere three blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   The range of reactions represents the conflicting emotions that
pull at the Vietnamese community about whether to continue waging
the ideological battles of the past or to leave politics behind in
pursuit of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   Dorchester pharmacist Tuan Q. Tran and his 20-year-old daughter,
Mai Khanh, are typical in their feelings. Tran lectures tirelessly
about the evils of communism in a tone reminiscent of his former
life as a high school teacher in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, born in the United States and now in college, has
no interest in the subject of communism or, by extension, the gas
tank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Tran joined a group of Vietnam veterans protesting the
silhouette of Ho Chi Minh, whose facial features and long beard
they see outlined on the left side of the blue stripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot bring Hitler into the Jewish community and see how
they respond,'' Tran said. ``It's the same thing to bring Ho Chi
Minh into the Vietnamese community.''
</P>
<P>
   Tran, 55, is a small man with a coarse mustache and tiny stubble
on the chin of his round face. At the pharmacy, he wears a dress
shirt and tie with New Balance sneakers, dispensing prescriptions
amid rows of Asian nonperishable foods.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-class teacher in his youth, Tran was drafted into the
Saigon government's army in 1968. After 1975, because of his
military service, he spent four years in what the communists called
``reeducation camp.'' Tran calls it prison.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was fed a starvation diet, made to clear minefields
with his bare hands, and force-fed Marxist-Leninist ideology. It
was an experience shared by thousands of other South Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Vietnamese immigrants in America, Tran undertook a
perilous escape by boat. He left with his wife, who was eight
months pregnant, and friends. One man's baby died during the 13-day
journey without food or fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Communism, Tran said, ruined the prosperity of South Vietnam and
brought years of suffering to him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   In South Vietnam, ``we had freedom. We were practicing a
democracy,'' Tran said. ``Suddenly, the communists came in and we
cannot talk; we cannot move; we cannot stand up and raise our
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk, however, means little to Mai Khanh Tran, 20, who
studies finance at Bentley College, or to her three sisters, none
of them born in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know too much about it, and I'm not too interested,''
she said. ``We would rather (our father) didn't impose his beliefs
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mai Khanh doesn't understand why Boston Gas has to upset
her father and the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put a little blue paint on the beard or something,'' she said.
``I don't see how that would bother anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a move is out of the question, according to Boston Gas,
because Kent's creation is a copyrighted work of art _ the largest
in the world. Kent died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will read whatever they want into many things,'' said
Kathleen Hearn, director of public and government relations at
Boston Gas. ``We absolutely do not agree that it has anything to do
with Ho Chi Minh at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of Dorchester's Vietnamese take Boston Gas at its word.
Henry Hiep Tran, 46, calls the image a fantasy of agitated Vietnam
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the vets, after the war, they have memories; they
imagine things,'' said Tran, tapping his temple to indicate that Ho
is all in the head. So Tran, a former South Vietnamese helicopter
gunner who escaped in 1975, is not bothered, though he calls Ho Chi
Minh ``a cheat and a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Vietnamese-Americans would rather not talk about the past,
saying that constant recriminations drain energy away from building
a prosperous life in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't remind me of Ho Chi Minh,'' said Martin Khoi Pham, who
spent 14 years in a reeducation camp because he had been a colonel
in Saigon's army. ``I don't want to remember. When the communists
took over, I lost everything. I've already lost too much of my
life.''

Hi-tech toys designed with girls in mind 
By James Cummings  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At least in the world of toys, there are times
when boys will be boys, and girls will be girls.
</P>
<P>
   Radica Games Limited, a Dallas-based company best-known for its
hand-held games, has a line of products sold under the name Girl
Tech designed to meet the unique desires of preteen girls. The
products add technology to such pursuits as keeping a diary,
hosting pajama parties and paying tribute to whoever is this week's
``best friend forever.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the products is the Password Journal, a plastic box that
opens only for its owner thanks to a voice recognition module.
Password Journal has compartments for trinkets and slots for pens
and paper. It's small enough to carry around and sells for $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Another Girl Tech gadget that uses voice recognition technology
is the Door Pass. Attach it to a door and it will ask for a
password any time the door is opened. Unless the owner speaks her
password, the Door Pass, which costs $19.99, sounds an alarm. The
Keepsake Box comes with a remote control, and the box will only
open when the owner punches in a secret code. The Keepsake Box is
supposed to show up in stores later this month and will sell for
$19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Also do out this month is Bug 'Em, a listening device. The user
places a ladybug-shaped microphone in the room she wants to monitor
and listens on a receiver from a nearby room. It is to sell for
$19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Girl Tech devices are sold through major retailers, and online
through EToys.com and Amazon.com.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ How high-tech is Play-Doh? After all, it's just
Play-Doh, right? If you believe this, you haven't seen the new
Play-Doh, the super-duper, high-tech Play-Doh. The kind of Play-Doh
you find in Play-Doh's Seaside Playworld ($30). In this new
Play-Doh set, kids build a 3-D beach scene with a new lineup of the
pliable and reusable clay. Here you'll find a wet-and-sandy-feeling
Play-Doh and two slimy ocean-scented colors (smelling oddly similar
to Body Works' Sea Spray and Sea Weed bubble baths). The scented
and textured Play-Dohs add a bit of realism to the seascape and
help kids develop the senses. The set includes a pail to make sand
castles, a two-piece fish mold and lots of other ocean shapes.

   `CRASH' WORTH THE CASH
</P>
<P>
   You're sick of the shooter games. You're sick of the sports
games. You want a race game, but the adult racing games can be so
boring. Really, who wants to be in a NASCAR race and go around an
oval 80 times? That's when you find Sony's Crash Bandicoot's Crash
Team Racing ($50) and you think, ``Cool! Finally a racing game for
me!'' In Crash Team Racing, you take on the persona and drive the
car of any of your favorite characters, including Crash, Tiny or
Cortex. In the adventure mode, you try to win races in order to
solve the mystery of Aku-Aku. Tracks can be anywhere from the polar
ice cap to the Amazon rainforest. The game is fun for the whole
family and is especially entertaining in the head-to-head mode.

Baseball's case vs. Pete Rose on Web 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pete Rose has always been guilty of having bad
haircuts. But when it comes to whether he is guilty of anything
else _ like betting on major-league baseball while managing a team
_ people are less certain.
</P>
<P>
   Fan reaction to Jim Gray's recent interview on NBC of baseball's
all-time hit leader is proof of one of two things: Either the news
media, as with the President Clinton/Monica Lewinsky affair,
misjudged public outrage, or people actually believe Rose when he
says he did not bet on baseball while managing the Cincinnati Reds
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can judge for yourself. The Dowd Report, the findings of
the baseball commissioner's former special counsel, John W. Dowd,
is available at www
</P>
<P>
   .dowdreport.com.
</P>
<P>
   On the site, Dowd said he made the report available because of
the renewed interest in the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page site includes images of the five-page agreement
signed 10 years ago last August by Rose and then-commissioner Bart
Giamatti. The documents are available in Adobe Acrobat Reader
format. If you don't have the software on your hard drive, it can
be downloaded free from the site.
</P>
<P>
   RATING THE STARS' WEB SITES
</P>
<P>
   Cindy's done it, and so have Daisy and Francis Ford. But is
there anything of substance to Web sites that bear the name of
someone famous?
</P>
<P>
   The premiere issue of eshopper, a magazine from the editors of
Yahoo Internet Life, takes a look at celebrity Web sites. The chart
ranks the sites of such luminaries as Cindy Crawford, Daisy Fuentes
and Francis Ford Coppola by what they sell, whether it's useful and
how much it seems to stroke the star's ego.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes, a television personality, sells purses, tote bags,
clothing and jewelry from her well-reviewed site. The magazine says
the site is ``refreshingly low-key'' and the stuff for sale is
``tasteful, inexpensive and solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's site sells books, photos and the model's workout
videos. The magazine ranks Cindy.com fairly high on the ego meter:
``Cindy's lovely mug stares at you from every page. This site is
all about controlling the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola, the movie director and budding winemaker, sells his
wine, his movies, pasta bowls and a fancy corkscrew. The products
are considered useful: ``Who can't use a night of wine, pasta and
`The Godfather'?''
</P>
<P>
   The December issue also tries to help you steer clear of
Internet scams, and it ranks the 300 best shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS STUFF GALORE
</P>
<P>
   Spend an hour on your drive home listening to a call-in sports
talk show on the radio. Then spend some time at ESPN.com or
SportsLine.com or any team's Web site and see the amount of
information devoted to sports, both college and professional.
</P>
<P>
   Sports information sources have expanded almost as fast as some
of the leagues. And some might say the growth is diluting the
quality of information on these sites as much as it has the quality
of play (see also: Florida Marlins and Cleveland Browns).
</P>
<P>
   One site, www.rivals.com, is hoping to become the site people
turn to for sports information on the Internet. Rivals.com has
attracted $30 million in venture capital to finance the effort. The
site contains links to more than 350 Web sites devoted to teams and
sports and related topics such as recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Features include team and player statistics, on-demand digital
video of games and player interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company was formed in 1998. Investors include
Hummer Winblad Venture Partners and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM ...
</P>
<P>
   Radio Shack has decided to join them. Since more people are
online during work hours and the holidays are near, the company has
decided to make it easier for its employees to shop online.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas-based company said last week it will start letting its
3,000 employees shop at Web sites on company computers during
breaks and before or after work. The company will even allow
employees to have packages sent to their work addresses to avoid
the risk of friends, loved ones and burglars spotting incoming
gifts.

SPY BLUNDER DRAWS CRITICISM IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ Secret-service agents may find themselves sifting
landfills for Canada's lost secrets amid one of the worst spy
scandals in the country's history, one in which indulging the
national passion for hockey led to a spectacular breach of
security.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Intelligence Security Service is now confirming
that a top-secret document _ reportedly containing key operational
plans of the agency for the upcoming year _ was stolen from the
back of a spy official's minivan last month. The culprits are
believed to be smash-and-grab thieves, not secret agents from enemy
powers, but there is still fear that the document might wind up in
the wrong hands, compromising Canada's security.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has triggered a huge political controversy and
damaged the reputation of the Intelligence Security Service,
Canada's CIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fiasco and national embarrassment,'' said
Conservative parliament member Peter MacKay. ``It's like something
from an Austin Powers episode, not a front-rank intelligence
service.''
</P>
<P>
   It all started early last month when an intelligence analyst
removed the highly-classified material from spy agency
headquarters, apparently to study up on operations in hope of
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of material was a major violation of security rules
made worse when the analyst headed off for Toronto, the material on
the back seat of her minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Her destination was Toronto's Air Canada Center, home of the
Maple Leafs. But as she cheered on the hockey team, thieves were
smashing out a window of the vehicle, left in a public parking lot
outside the arena. And Canada's top secrets vanished into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has launched an internal investigation of the
analyst, who remains at work. Her name was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Several days after the theft, and apparently at the urgent
behest of the spy agency, Toronto police launched a manhunt in
mid-October, and apprehended a trio of ``druggies.'' According to
the Globe and Mail newspaper, which broke the story, the three
substance abusers admitted stealing the briefcase, but said they'd
been so disappointed with the haul they'd simply tossed the
briefcase _ and its ultra-classified contents _ into a dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, none could remember the exact location of the
dumpster. The thieves led detectives to several bins. All were
found to be empty; and the best hope now for Canada's spymasters is
that the stolen secrets are simply rotting in some landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the material to be irretrievably lost,'' said Dan
Lambert, spokesman for the spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the agency has come under attack from politicians,
editorialists and other critics for allegedly seeking to conceal
the blunder, or at least not reporting it to the federal
intelligence watchdog committee with much alacrity _ the committee
learned of the loss from press reports.
</P>
<P>
   The material, which the agency describes only as an
``operational planning document,'' is believed to outline
counterintelligence and counterterrorism priorities, including
codenames of targets and informants.
</P>
<P>
   The Intelligence Service conceded in a statement: ``We consider
the loss of this document to be a serious matter of national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are calling it the most damaging internal security breach
since the Canadian Security Intelligence Service was founded in
1984. It was the country's first fulltime professional spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence analysts said the worst fallout may be damage done
to the service's reputation among Britain's MI-6 and the CIA, which
shares much sensitive material with its northern ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be noted, and remembered, in Washington and
London. For Canada, that's the real problem,'' said Wesley K. Wark,
professor of history at the University of Toronto and president of
the Canadian Association for Security and Intelligence Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada has always had a `holier-than-thou' attitude about its
ability to protect secrets,'' Wark said. ``In order to share with
important allies it must convince them it remains cautious and
secure.''

New genealogy programs have different strengths 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Step right up, family researchers, it's genealogy time
again.
</P>
<P>
   We have two new genealogy programs, Generations V.6 from Sierra
and Family Origins V.8 from Parsons. Without further ado I'll turn
the podium over to my wife, the genealogist.
</P>
<P>
   She says:
</P>
<P>
   If I could combine the depth and breadth of the reports that
Family Origins generates and the ease of entry and screen of
Generations, I would have a contender. As it is, I'll probably stay
with Family Tree Maker.
</P>
<P>
   Entering information in Family Origins feels dated _ there seem
to be more keystrokes than necessary. The family view screen
includes children and parents of both mother and father, but birth,
death and marriage information on just one of the spouses. I would
prefer smaller type and information on both on the same screen.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, however, are the best of any program I've seen. In
addition to the usual charts and reports _ family group sheets,
pedigree charts, hourglass charts, etc. _ Family Origins gives you
lists that range from addresses for mailing labels to unlinked
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   I found the Place list particularly useful. It tells me what
event I have recorded where _ if I ever make it to a library in
Lancaster County, Pa., I know to look for Andreas Kauffman, who
died there in 1743, Jacob Ringer, who was born there in 1757, and
Ulrich Longenecker, who died there in 1759. This would be
particularly helpful to anyone who takes the scatter-gun approach
to genealogy, looking for everyone at once. If you are dealing with
enough generations, it can be difficult to remember who lived in
what county when.
</P>
<P>
   The Problem list is also helpful, pointing out that Derick Op
den Graeff probably didn't live to be 332 and that Mary Lind
probably didn't marry at age 6. Programs such as Family Tree Maker
point out the problems when you enter the material, but mistakes
can slip in.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were interesting, although the average age at
death for males (65) may have been somewhat skewed by Derick Op den
Graeff.
</P>
<P>
   Family Origins has no manual, but is so intuitive that it
doesn't need one. The beauty of Generations is that the material is
available on a single screen. It profiles both mother and father,
with date and place of birth, death and marriage, as well as names
and dates of parents and children, and divorce, if any. The screen
also shows occupation, religion, education and notes. Entry is
easy, although somewhat more complicated than Family Tree Maker.
</P>
<P>
   Generations comes with 15 CDs. They include the Social Security
Death Index, Civil War muster rolls for both Union and Confederacy,
1870 census digital microfilm for counties in Ohio, Illinois and
Georgia and the World Name Index. I found Daniel Reitz in the 16th
Ohio Infantry but couldn't find Robert McDonald, who died within
months of joining the Georgia infantry.
</P>
<P>
   Generations transfers reports into your word processor. They are
fine as far as they go, but don't go as far as Family Origins.
</P>
<P>
   Generations has an excellent manual and also comes with an
informative book, ``Netting Your Ancestors _ Genealogical Research
on the Internet,'' by Cyndi Howells. Howells owns Cyndi's List
(www.CyndisList
</P>
<P>
   .com/), the starting place for genealogy on the Internet. She
has also served as an adviser to Generations.
</P>
<P>
   Further information and ordering data on Generations may be
obtained from www.sierra.com/sierrahome
</P>
<P>
   /familytree/. If you go to www
</P>
<P>
   .learningco.com/brands/default
</P>
<P>
   .htm, you can branch off to information on both Family Origins
and Family Tree Maker.

Better products are created in marketplace, not courts 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I was glad that I wasn't a parent the night the
preliminary Microsoft antitrust findings came down.
</P>
<P>
   I knew, if I were a parent, I'd have to try to explain the
revised American dream. I'd have to tell my kids that it is OK to
succeed but that it is against the rules to succeed wildly and
completely.
</P>
<P>
   I'd explain that Microsoft is a company that dominates the
software market. I'd explain that _ like the Rockefellers, the
Carnegies and Henry Ford _ Bill Gates built a company that got a
lion's share of the market. And that, largely on the shoulders of
Microsoft, America became the dominant player in the software
business. While we no longer are the undisputed world leaders when
it comes to automobiles, steel or oil, America leads the world when
it comes to creating software. Now the government is worried that
Microsoft has done too well, succeeded too completely.
</P>
<P>
   That's where explaining the opinion gets more complicated,
because no one is completely pure in this case _ not the
government, not Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have to explain that Microsoft has competed hard in a tough
business and done well. And that a judge believes that it has
become a monopoly. While there have been charges of tough and even
mean-spirited actions, Microsoft has not been charged by the court
with any illegal acts, not yet at least. But there is evidence that
_ as it became a giant _ it also became a bully, using its market
power to squash competition.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to teach a kid that it's OK to succeed at any
price. But the world isn't black and white, it's gray. And then I'd
have to tell the kids that America wasn't built by wimps. That
without tough and driven business leaders and businesses America
would have never emerged as a world power, a leader.
</P>
<P>
   The people who built America played tough. But ultimately, to
dominate their business niche, tough isn't enough _ the Fords, the
Rockefellers and Bill Gates sold something that people wanted to
buy and was in more demand than the products that competed against
it. In what may be the best demonstration of democracy I know,
people and businesses voted with their money.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft grew from a tiny company with a single product called
MS-DOS, an operating system for PCs. Microsoft didn't invent DOS.
Gates bought it for a song. But Microsoft did _ through a deal with
IBM _ nourish and promote DOS until it defeated the established
operating systems of its day. If you think that Microsoft and DOS
were dominant players in those days, go back and reread the books
that chronicle those times. Neither the company nor the products
were dominating.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Windows. The first versions of Windows were so
bad they were jokes.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, there was strong competition from Macintosh,
which had a much superior operating system, and from IBM, which
also offered a better operating system, OS/2. Microsoft was a
powerhouse by then but not yet so big and powerful that it could
roll over an IBM or an Apple. Instead, it did a better job of
selling. That's allowed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it did such a good job that Windows became the main way
people used personal computers. That's true today. And, over time,
what had been a mediocre product became one that is _ arguably at
least _ better. Macintosh enthusiasts will say that Apple still
leads the way. Linux backers will say that operating system is the
best _ much more stable, much less demanding of system resources.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that the Mac folks or the Linux folks are right.
But the marketplace has voted for Windows so far. It has that
right.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where being a country boy from Arkadelphia, Ark., may
handicap me. I honestly believe that if these products are better,
and sold smarter, that the marketplace will respond, long term.
There are early signs of that. Linux is growing fast (with no help
from the courts). And look at what's been happening with Apple.
People gave it up for dead, but Apple didn't roll over. It created
products that the marketplace wanted. The iMac is probably the
trendiest computer around today.
</P>
<P>
   None of this was done by court order. In fact, had there been a
court order that reduced the clout of Microsoft, the need to
innovate and make a better product wouldn't have been so desperate,
so important. Apple would have rolled along without innovation. The
marketplace, not the courts, creates better products.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's not popular _ and it sounds naive in the dwindling
days of the century _ but I believe the world works best when the
government stays out of the marketplace and lets the strongest
survive.

Y2K MOVIE NOT REALISTIC, BUT A HEALTHY SCARE, EXPERTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MARILYN GEEWAX  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Y2K: The Movie'' is an ``irresponsible'' spark
that could light a panic among many Americans. But it also could do
some good if it leads people to take sensible precautions for Jan.
1 computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   That was the split verdict among a dozen government and industry
officials who gathered with a reporter this week to watch a preview
copy of the NBC suspense-thriller, which airs at 9 p.m. EST Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In two hours, the movie manages to hit virtually every Y2K panic
button, from planes falling from the sky to nuclear reactors
melting down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very irresponsible,'' said Delta Air Lines Captain Bill
Watts, a Y2K expert and pilot who plans to be flying Dec. 31 during
the rollover to 2000. After scribbling two pages of notes on the
technical inaccuracies in the movie, Watts declared the
aviation-related plot twists ``comical.''
</P>
<P>
   John Castagna, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a
trade group for power companies, said the movie will ``reinforce
beliefs'' among those who think Y2K will be a disaster, even though
the power outages portrayed in the movie are ``very, very
unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House subcommittee
that studies Y2K, agreed that the script contains many implausible
scenarios, but said the movie could be ``very useful'' if it spurs
people to prepare for Y2K now, rather than at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   If too many people ignore Y2K until late December, they might
start a New Year's Eve panic at the grocery store and bank, as they
do in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those things could happen,'' Horn said. His
subcommittee has long urged people to stock up on enough food,
water, batteries, blankets and prescriptions to last through
several days of Y2K-related disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The movie depicts chaos spreading across the globe as the new
year moves from one time zone to the next. As midnight passes from
Asia to Europe, all sorts of computer-controlled equipment begins
to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Parisians panic as the City of Light goes dark. When 2000
arrives at New York's Times Square, throngs riot as the electric
power grid collapses along the Eastern Seaboard. Grocery stores
start rationing food and ATMs refuse to dispense cash.
</P>
<P>
   Before the long night is over, federal troops shoot and kill an
innocent man protecting his property and millions are ordered to
evacuate their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie stars Ken Olin, who plays a systems-failure expert
working for the federal government. The plot revolves around his
efforts to get planes out the air and water into an overheating
nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the movie, alarms sound, things blow up and people
die, but the trouble-shooter stays calm. Meanwhile, Olin's wife,
children and father must wait for their hero to save the world and
get home.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with big-budget movies, the special effects seem
cheesy. Still, with an explosion of some sort between every set of
commercials, action-movie fans will find something to like.
</P>
<P>
   A disclaimer at the movie's start says it is not based on fact.
But concerns are very real about the Y2K bug, a software flaw that
exists because many older computer programs and chips recognize
only the last two digits of the year. When 2000 arrives on Jan. 1,
those computers may misinterpret ``00'' as 1900 and trigger massive
equipment malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, government and industry representatives
have spent two years monitoring efforts to fix computers, and last
week, President Clinton said the nation's basic infrastructure
would work well throughout the date rollover.

REAL ESTATE: CLICKING ONTO REAL-ESTATE AUCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Real-estate auctions have found their way to the
computer screen in the hands of several auction companies, amid
some skepticism in the industry over the extent to which
computerized auctions are likely to replace traditional auction
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential is gigantic even if just 15 percent of real
estate is sold over the Web,'' said Kevin Hickey, president of
Homebid.com (www.homebid.com), an Internet real-estate auction
company based in Scottsdale, Ariz., that specializes in residential
property.
</P>
<P>
   Homebid.com is not alone. Other Internet real-estate auctioneers
include R-buy.com (www.rbuy.com), a World Wide Web site based in
Denver that offers commercial and residential property. Another is
eProperty (www.eproperty.com), a Web site owned by Kennedy-Wilson
International, a real-estate company in Beverly Hills, Calif., that
offers commercial and residential property.
</P>
<P>
   But the process is less than a year old, and Internet
auctioneers say that so far only about 200 properties _ almost all
of them homes and condominium apartments offered individually
rather than in packages of properties _ have actually been
transferred to new buyers after being auctioned online.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those sales were in January from a single auction of
property around Hartford, Conn., owned by the federal Department of
Housing. In that auction, Homebid.com offered 148 homes and
apartment buildings in individual lots. A nearly even mix of
families and investors eventually closed on 109 of the properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just as exciting as being at a real auction,'' said
Tracy Ogrodnik, an accountant from Durham, Conn., who, with her
husband, Walter, were the top bidders at $30,000 for a federally
owned town house in Meriden, Conn., 30 miles south of Hartford. The
Ogrodniks are investors who took title to the house in January,
upgraded it, and resold for $55,000 in May to a buyer who moved in.
</P>
<P>
   The Ogrodniks have previously bought houses at traditional
ballroom auctions. ``But this was better because you could be sure
what the bids were,'' Mrs. Ogrodnik said. ``There wasn't any noise
and you didn't have to drive far or deal with a room jammed full of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In an online auction, potential buyers bid on property from
their home or office computers. The auction takes place within a
specific time, sometimes as long as a few days, and all the bidders
are electronically informed by the auctioneer about what others'
bids are. The bidders do not see whom they are bidding against.
</P>
<P>
   To become approved as a bidder, the participant must first
register on the Web site by disclosing such information as name,
Social Security number and real estate agent, required for all
bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Payment for the auction service will eventually come from the
agent's commission if there is a sale, and there will be no charge
if there is no sale. The fee can range from .50 percent of a
property's sale price for a simple auction to nearly 6 percent in
cases when the auctioneer also acts as a broker.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of Internet auctions say that they hope to create
greater interest in homes, land and commercial buildings by making
bidding more convenient. But some real-estate consultants question
whether online auctions have a large enough appeal to be successful
and say that in some cases property may be more profitably sold by
traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that you would be hard-pressed to see a deep use of
the Internet for resale homes, because it is such a personal
sale,'' said Richard Gollis, cofounder of Concord Group, a
real-estate consulting company in Newport Beach, Calif. But
compared with traditional real-estate auctions, they may have the
advantage of generating more offers, which can be especially
desirable for sellers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants also say that buyers might fear that some of the
bidding is fraudulent and designed merely to push prices up,
although they note that this would require the cooperation of the
real estate agent and could be punished by law. Participants in the
auction must judge for themselves whether the auction companies
through which they are doing business provide enough safeguards to
ensure that there is no fraud, the consultants say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several traditional real-estate auctioneers _ among them Ayres
Auction and Real Estate, based in Jacksboro Pike, Tenn., and Hudson
&AMP; Marshall, of Macon, Ga. _ have not started online sales, though
they do not rule out Internet service in the future. ``It's the
next natural step,'' said Monte Marshall, owner of Hudson &AMP;
Marshall. ``The problem is that people are a little leery of it,
and in most cases it would take some time for them to get
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The real-estate auction _ whether online or in a room _ differs
from conventional auctions in that the buyer does not immediately
pay and walk away with the product. The winning bidder and seller
must get in contact through their real estate agents to arrange the
signing of bank, real estate and title documents that are subject
to the usual problems that may ultimately kill a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Homebid.com, the only company to have a substantial number of
sales, said that nearly 80 percent of its winning bidders actually
closed the deal in the end. Those houses sold for an average of 98
percent of their estimated value, Homebid.com said. The company has
auctioned nearly 650 properties on line, most of them detached
homes or town houses, leading to about 150 closings, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two residential auctions held by Homebid.com in Phoenix and Las
Vegas in June and July, mostly for homes in those areas, were
relatively slow. Only 65 out of about 500 properties offered
eventually sold. Hickey, Homebid.com's president, said that this
indicated that buyers of private homes preferred the greater
latitude they have in traditional negotiations with sellers. As a
result, he has adjusted the company's Web site to allow for longer
bidding periods and sealed online bidding, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the property being auctioned, good deals may be
difficult to find, said Matt Shanaberger, vice president for Robert
Charles Lesser &AMP; Co., a real-estate consulting company in Los
Angeles that has no ties to online real-estate auctions. He expects
bids to stay near market levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't going to see a $125,000 house going for $250,000 or
the other way around,'' Shanaberger said. ``There's not going to be
a huge spread in prices. There are far too many experienced
players.'' Shanaberger also said that it remained to be seen
whether there were enough people willing to bid via computer to
keep the industry alive.
</P>
<P>
   Selling property on the Internet is not necessarily new. For
example, property owners have offered land and houses for sale on
eBay.com (www.ebay.com), an all-purpose auction site, for the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   But real-estate consultants say that Web sites with such a wide
scope are risky to use for such large transactions as real estate
because it is difficult to know whether the buyers or sellers are
just teen-agers having some fun.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no safeguards against this, they said that most
of the Web sites that specialize in real estate at least have the
backing of companies that have been in the real-estate industry for
several years. ``We're not some new cyberspace company,'' said
James Peterson, president of eProperty, the commercial property and
residential estate auction Web site. ``We have years of
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But many real-estate auction companies remain cautious about
launching Internet-only auctions. Steve Good, chief executive
officer of Sheldon Good International, a real-estate auction
company based in Chicago, said some bidders preferred to attend
auctions in person to gauge their competitors by looking at the
``whites of their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   That is partly why Good's company continues to offer auctions
that bidders can attend in person. But in September, his company
for the first time allowed people to bid in those auctions via
computer. ``Where online auctions are going, I don't know,'' Good
said. ``But we haven't had any resistance so far.''

MAKING SENSE OF A BROTHER'S MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
A BOOK OF REASONS 
By John Vernon 
Houghton Mifflin, 272 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When elegant prose describes disgusting things, readers are
caught in the middle. The lyricism of the writing compels one to
continue even as the subject matter repels, and the tension becomes
a third element that traps readers in a kind of morbid fascination.
Such is the case with John Vernon's ``A Book of Reasons,'' a
beautiful, horrible book that _ like that tension _ keeps circling
around its subject, unresolved and uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   The subject that has so bewitched Vernon, a novelist, is his
brother's life. A recluse, seemingly incapable of forming lasting
relationships, Paul Vernon lived his final years in a run-down old
house in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   As this memoir opens, after Paul's death, his brother is heading
toward the house to clean it up and sell it _ and, ideally, come to
terms with the strange and lonely man his brother was at life's
end. What he finds confounds his imaginings of what any person,
particularly a once-beloved brother, could become. The house is
unheated, broken down, and filthy beyond belief; its very walls
reeking with the human and animal excrement and animal corpses
within. Although John Vernon allows that he has drifted from his
brother, he cannot get his mind around the idea that the boy he
remembers and the man he used to know could have lived like this.
</P>
<P>
   At first, John Vernon wants to believe the filth has been left
by vandals since his brother's death, but he soon dismisses this
excuse as fantasy: The debris is too deep and too old. But that top
layer of denial, like the first load of trash, is only a start, and
this book is Vernon's intellectual excavation. Unfortunately, in
his search for answers _ the ``reasons'' of the title _ what he
primarily unearths are more questions.
</P>
<P>
   In his four novels, Vernon has used his writing to explore, if
not explain, the lives of historical figures, including Baby Doe
Tabor and the explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. In this, his
first nonfiction book, the author seems compelled to do the same.
The result, while frustrating, is often fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   To make sense of his brother's apparent madness, Vernon reaches
out to the great thinkers of the past, evoking the reasons of
history and philosophy to explain his unreasonable relative. A
visit to Wal-Mart becomes a religious experience, for example, as
the search for the perfect thermometer (which, he convinces
himself, will make Paul's wreck of a house appear normal) turns
into a quest for truth. Descartes, Pascal, Cardinal Richelieu, and
Samuel Beckett all end up joining the shopping expedition, though
Vernon has the sense to keep them in perspective with a healthy
disrespect for both his own philosophizing and our much less
intellectual time: ``In the twenty-first century we'll hold up
happy faces to ward off vampires,'' he writes, reflecting on
contemporary iconage.
</P>
<P>
   Recollections of Paul's funeral bring out Goethe, Lincoln, and
Tod Browning's cult film classic ``Freaks,'' which climaxes with
the circus sideshow acts chanting: ``One of us, one of us,
ooga-booga, one of us.'' And when philosophy falls short, the
history of science comes into play: We may not learn why Paul's
house lacked an outdoor thermometer, but we learn of the simple
tool's invention and the religious controversy it caused.
</P>
<P>
   These historical flights, however, do not serve as adequate
escapes, the excavation unearths no explanatory truth, and Vernon
keeps returning _ and returning us _ to his brother's house, where
there is no reason or poetry or science. Veering like his prose
between the reasonable past and the unpalatable present, the author
himself appears to be trapped. Unable to accept the lack of reason
in his brother's life, the sheer randomness of decay or illness, he
worries at it the way he worries at the house, ineptly building
stairs and haphazardly hiring cleaning and disposal crews who steal
as much as they discard.
</P>
<P>
   He seems aware of his dilemma, writing: ``Reasons are not
answers. Reasons are recipes for making sense of the world's
arrangements and accidents.'' However, we are stuck watching the
novelist in thrall to this most futile, and common, endeavor of
healthy relatives of the mentally ill: that of trying to understand
the irrational behavior of his brother in rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   By our nature, we seek to understand that which we do not,
Vernon says over and over in a variety of guises. We have always
sought out the logic behind the natural world's workings. But in
this case, no matter how far back Vernon reaches into history or
scientific theory he can find no causal link, no logic. Which
leaves him, and us, without resolution. When the author drives back
to his wife, his thumb swollen from his inept hammering, he may
have come to terms with the histories of science and religion, but
not with his brother. His acceptance is uneasy at best, and leaves
us as we last see him: sleepless, beguiled, and a little afraid.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic commerce companies have long been accused of wishful
thinking. Now it appears they're selling it.
</P>
<P>
   Wishlist.com, Wishclick.com, and OhIWish.com have joined a
lineup of other e-commerce start-ups in the suddenly cluttered
field of online gift registries, where people post lists of their
preferred gifts in hopes that friends and relatives will take their
not-so-subtle hints.
</P>
<P>
   The element of wishful thinking in this trend goes beyond the
obvious pun, however. For these sites to succeed, they will have to
convince consumers to scrap the traditional mode of receiving
mystery gifts gracefully _ no matter how awful they are _ and
instead announce to the world exactly what gifts they want, down to
the sizes, colors and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Purveyors of gift registry sites argue that consumers are, in
fact, ready to make that change _ are prepared, in effect, to push
present-giving closer to barter, as in ``give me this, and I'll
give you that.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also admit that consumers will need a bit of monetary
incentive to test this new approach. And the amounts gift
registries are shelling out to users are testimony to how much they
and their e-commerce partners stand to gain if this bit of consumer
behavior can be altered.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, online gift registries have been confined to wedding
sites _ like The Knot and Williams-Sonoma's Wedding and Gift
Registry _ or specific retailers like Recreational Equipment Inc. _
better known as REI _ and Crate and Barrel. In recent months,
however, several all-occasion registry sites have emerged that
amass products from multiple retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, users post their wish lists on the registry site,
which offers different mechanisms to disseminate the lists to
friends and family _ an e-mail greeting card is the most common
approach.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on Della.com, which last week expanded from a
wedding registry to an all-occasion site, users send e-mail
greeting cards to potential givers with messages like ``All modesty
aside, here's what I want'' and ``Here's what I sent to Santa ...
hint, hint'' along with their lists.
</P>
<P>
   Gift buyers can then either go directly to the gift registry
site to buy the goods, or follow links to retailers affiliated with
the registry. When an item is bought, the buyer is usually
responsible for eliminating that item from the list on the registry
site.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-financed companies in this category, Della.com
offers items from eight well-known retailers, including the Gap,
REI and Amazon.com, which owns a 20 percent stake in the company.
It plans to have 50 retailers by mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Users click on items on the site to add them to a ``wish
center,'' a page on Della.com's site that lists a person's wishes,
hobbies, clothing sizes and favorite colors. Or they can select an
item from far-flung Web retailers and post the item's address on
the list. Once someone has bought a gift, he or she can delete the
item from the list.
</P>
<P>
   For retailers and registries, at least, there is a lot to like
about this approach to gift buying. The gift registries collect a
referral fee from retailers each time someone buys a gift from a
retail partner. Those fees _ in the range of 1 percent to 15
percent _ mirror those of affiliate programs, whereby sites make
money by sending customers to e-commerce partners. But because
registry sites include multiple retailers, that money can quickly
amount to meaningful revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, meanwhile, acquire customers for a fraction of what
they pay through other means, like advertising or paid placement on
Yahoo, Lycos or other portal sites.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have also embraced the idea because it helps reduce
one of their biggest headaches: returns. Internet retailers who
continue to struggle with fulfillment issues exult at the prospect
of shipping a package with a virtual guarantee that it will not be
dropped back on their doorstep a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, gift registries collect data about specific items
that consumers want; the sites can then share that information with
retailers and marketers if users agree to allow it. Even if
consumers do not agree to share their personal information,
however, registry sites can collect statistics about what products
their customers like, giving them bargaining leverage with
potential retail partners and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction for consumers, industry executives say, is that
the services make buying gifts easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why it'll catch on is that it solves a fundamental
problem,'' said Rebecca Patton, chief executive of Della.com.
``People want to buy better gifts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like other gift registries, Della.com faces two basic obstacles
to instant consumer adoption: getting customers to register and
getting them to circulate their wish lists. And like other gift
registries, Della.com has a simple strategy to overcome those
hurdles: money. Those who create a Della.com wish list are entered
into a weekly sweepstakes for $2,300 worth of items they have
registered for, and those who refer 10 people to Della.com receive
a $20 gift certificate for purchases at Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Wishclick.com, meanwhile, gives users a $50 gift certificate
when they persuade 10 people to register on the site _ and those
people get $10 gift certificates for joining. IveBeenGood.com gives
users a $25 gift certificate for sending their list to five people.
</P>
<P>
   Online registry executives admit that money will only get them
so far _ particularly this holiday season. ``I think it'll be a
while before lots of people register for their birthdays and send
the list to everybody they know,'' said Ms. Patton, of Della.com.
``Right now, this is usually initiated by the person who's buying
the gift, so this builds on existing behavior. So this season will
be for introducing people to it. Next year it'll grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravi Gururaj, president of IveBeenGood.com, is slightly more
bullish. ``Our research shows that consumers are yearning for
technology like this,'' he said. ``I think it's like e-commerce in
general. We'll see a certain amount of growth this Christmas, but
next year it'll be almost ubiquitous.''
</P>
<P>
   Registry executives also said the rate of adoption would be
increased by well-known e-commerce sites, like EToys and Victoria's
Secret, that have added wish list features on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Amazon.com has also just added a wish list feature,
Scott Sangster, chief executive of Wishclick.com, said that
``almost 100 percent of consumers somehow create a wish list _ be
it verbally, written or e-mailed. So they get it. Now they're just
looking to improve on the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts tend to agree. ``These sites are viable, there's no
question,'' said David Sanderson, head of Bain &AMP; Co.'s e-commerce
practice. The practice of consumers registering for wedding and
baby gifts ``is absolutely transferable to other events,'' he said,
adding, ``The reason people shop online is convenience, so if there
is a more convenient way of dealing with gifts, customers will come
and they will respond to that.''

RE&AMP;C NOT FOR SALE, CHIEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some on Wall Street believe a quick fix for Raytheon Co.'s
ongoing cash crunch would be to sell its relatively obscure
engineers &AMP; constructors division.
</P>
<P>
   But Raytheon says it is not seeking a buyer for the heavy
industrial design and construction unit known as RE&AMP;C, which has
been losing money. Instead, Shay Assad, the division's new chief
executive, says RE&AMP;C is in the midst of a turnaround and should
make a profit next year on revenue of around $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Assad wouldn't rule out a sale of his
division. But he insists the unit is back on track after red ink
last year and so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see the fruits of what we set out to do,''
Assad said.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, part of Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon since the
1960s, specializes in big projects such as power plants,
refineries, and demilitarization facilities for chemical weapons.
Last year its work produced about 10 percent of the beleaguered
defense contractor's revenue of about $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But RE&AMP;C's work seems to offer few synergies with Raytheon's
better-known bomb and missile lines, and many analysts believe a
sale would help Raytheon focus on that core military business.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that if they get the right price, they'll sell
(RE&AMP;C),'' said Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette analyst Joe Nadol.
</P>
<P>
   Into this picture last year marched Assad, a 21-year Raytheon
veteran. Since then Assad says he has made the unit more selective
in bidding on construction contracts.
</P>
<P>
   He's shifted or replaced 28 of the 35 top executives at RE&AMP;C,
and brought in veterans from rivals such as Fluor Corp. to oversee
human resources, procurement, and other functions.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has also scaled back RE&AMP;C's ambitions overseas, where it
once dreamed of making big profits building dams and power plants
that could be floated into harbors on barges.
</P>
<P>
   He calls many such projects too risky, and instead touts work
such as the $1.1 billion, three-year contract RE&AMP;C announced last
week from Sithe Energies Inc. to build power plants in Everett and
Weymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Next year Assad expects RE&AMP;C to earn about 75 percent of its
revenue from domestic work, compared with 60 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sithe vice president John O'Brien won't say whether Raytheon's
bid to build the plants was lower than those from competitors such
as Stone &AMP; Webster Inc., but says he isn't concerned by talk of a
possible sale of RE&AMP;C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are a lot of talented individuals'' at RE&AMP;C who
could complete projects even under a new owner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to spin off RE&AMP;C have dogged Raytheon ever since it bulked
up the business line early in the 1990s. The division has drawn
special scrutiny as a spinoff candidate lately because of
lower-than-expected profit margins at Raytheon's defense units,
sending shares of the parent company tumbling more than 50 percent
since July.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Raytheon chief executive Daniel Burnham has
authorized companywide layoffs and a broad restructuring in which
he apparently considers everything on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham is cryptic about his intentions for RE&AMP;C. ``The first
priority for Raytheon Engineers &AMP; Constructors is to fix the
business,'' he said through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But in an industry known for price competition, Assad insists he
can still improve RE&AMP;C's prospects despite losses this year and
last, with better service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got ourselves in trouble when we were building plants and
facilities in parts of the world we weren't familiar with,'' Assad
said. ``It's a lot easier to solve problems when the project team
is in Cambridge and the plant is in Everett, vs. when the plant is
in the middle of India and eight hours away from the nearest
airport.
</P>
<P>
   RE&AMP;C's renewed domestic focus comes amid a boom in building
gas-fired power plants in the United States, helping position the
company to increase revenue 31 percent to about $2.7 billion this
year, from $2.065 billion in 1998. Assad said he expects revenue in
2000 will be within 5 percent of 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   RE&AMP;C has promised recoveries before, however, only to fall
short. For the first nine months of this year it lost $65 million,
primarily related to delays at four overseas projects Assad calls
``the bane of my existence.''
</P>
<P>
   These include problems at power projects in Britain, India and
Thailand, and at a metals facility in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Assad wouldn't be more specific, but says the rest of the
company's roughly 40 other big projects are on track. The company
employs about 8,000 people worldwide, down from 9,800 at the start
of 1998 after layoffs, buyouts and divestitures.
</P>
<P>
   A Fall River native, Assad was named to head RE&AMP;C last year to
replace Charles Q. Miller, who quit as the company was disclosing
layoffs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is perhaps best known within Raytheon for negotiating a
$1.3 billion deal with Brazil to build a monitoring system in the
Amazon basin, a contract finalized in 1997. He is familiar with
RE&AMP;C operations as well, having spent 18 months in the unit's
Denver office overseeing work on a rocket launch tower.
</P>
<P>
   RE&AMP;C now has about 840 people in Denver and major offices at
Princeton, N.J. and in Birmingham, Ala. In Cambridge, the company
has about 300 people at a Kendall Square facility known as the
Badger building after a predecessor company, a facility that
employed 1,700 at its peak in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   So is Raytheon shopping RE&AMP;C around? ``There's no truth'' to
that idea, Assad said. Even if the division were to be sold
eventually, a buyer might want to keep RE&AMP;C intact because of its
reputation. ``If it was sold, it's not like it's going to be broken
apart and disintegrate,'' he said.

A TALE OF TWO MARKETS AND THEIR WIDENING GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've got two stock markets at the moment: a broader market that
is doing OK and a technology market that is doing spectacularly.
The gap between the two gets bigger every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polarization is more extreme than anything we have ever
seen,'' says Thomas O'Neill, chief investment officer at
FleetBoston Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence for the gap shows up practically everywhere you look.
Consider: The average mutual fund is up 15 percent this year,
according to Lipper Analytical Services. The average science and
technology fund is up 76 percent. The Nasdaq index, home to all the
big technology stocks, is up 50 percent for the year compared to a
gain of 15 percent for the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   The story is much the same closer to home. In April, EMC Corp.,
a Hopkinton maker of storage equipment, passed Gillette to become
the Massachusetts company with the greatest market value. It was a
symbolic changing of the guard, the new economy supplanting the
old.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, EMC was worth $85 billion and Gillette was
worth $37 billion _ a spread of better than two to one.
</P>
<P>
   Can the new world really be that much greater than the old one
or is the growing gap in valuation a sign of a market that has gone
bonkers?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, quite a few money managers and economists say
there is a method to the market's madness. While they concede that
there are plenty of signs of excess in technology investing, they
say there are also fundamental reasons for the triumph of the tech
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Like what? The bulls point to three things. They include:
</P>
<P>
   --The tremendous growth in high-tech earnings. According to Syl
Marquardt, research director at John Hancock Funds, the technology
firms in the S&AMP;P 500 will boost their earnings by 40 percent this
year. Earnings for the 500 companies overall will grow 17 percent.
Although it is true that the tech sector sells at a higher
price-to-earnings ratio than the market overall, that price premium
looks more reasonable when future earnings growth is figured in,
says Marquardt.
</P>
<P>
   --The US economy is hooked on technology. America is in the
midst of a capital spending boom that shows no sign of ending.
Business spending on information equipment and software has been
growing at a 16 percent annual clip since 1991, according to Mark
Zandi, chief economist at RFA Dismal Sciences, a Pennsylvania
forecasting firm. Corporate America is buying computers,
telecommunications gear, and the software and the services that
come along with them.
</P>
<P>
   --The rest of the world is playing catchup. Technology is not a
fad that countries can choose to ignore. It is an imperative.
``Everyone else is going to have to substitute technology for labor
if they want to stay competitive,'' says Allen Sinai, chief
economist for Primark Decision Economics in Waltham. In other
words, other countries will have to hike their spending on
computers, telecommunications gear, and software, and chances are,
much of it will be supplied by American high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going on is real,'' says Zandi, who in the next breath
adds, ``but some of it is also surreal.'' The surreal parts are the
incredible prices that many technology stocks have reached,
especially the start-ups with no track record. Yet even some of the
established tech companies sell at price-to-earnings ratios that
can cause noosebleeds.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, whose stock seems to go up every day, trades at a
p/e ratio of 101; the comparable number for EMC is 81. The entire
market trades at a ratio of just over 30. The higher the ratio the
greater the expectation of future profits. ``These prices don't
leave much room for a slowdown,'' says Marquardt of Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   A slowdown could come as a result of a weaker US economy, a
distinct possibility in the coming year. It could also come if
technology buyers decide to pause and digest all their old
purchases before buying new stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas O'Neill thinks there could be a technology correction
even without any change in fundamentals. He points out that there
have been other technology booms in the past _ the personal
computer boom of the early 1980s was a famous one _ and that booms
have a way of ending in busts.
</P>
<P>
   The technology doesn't go away, but only a few of the companies
will survive and thrive. ``This thing will end badly for the vast
majority of stocks,'' he warns.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill calls the current infatuation with tech stocks a mania
and describes the current valuations as mindboggling. Says O'Neill,
``I can't remember a time when the pendulum has swung so far to
excess.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he right? Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Goldman Sachs speaks, people listen.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in CMGI, the Andover, Mass. Internet company, climbed 20
percent Wednesday after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of the
company with a strong recommendation. The stock also got a boost
from a Prudential Securities analyst who raised his price forecast
on CMGI.
</P>
<P>
   The stock climbed 20 7/8 to 124.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI has provided financing for a slew of Internet companies
including Lycos, a portal, and GeoCities, a Web page hosting
service. GeoCities was bought by Yahoo earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's stock price jump made CMGI chief executive David
Wetherell about $300 million richer. Even in the world of the
Internet that qualifies as a good day.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT MICROSOFT? ANTITRUST EXPERTS OFFER OPINIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Groups of experts from a score of universities
nationwide are preparing recommendations for the government as the
Justice Department and 19 states prepare for the penalty phase of
the Microsoft antitrust trial early next year.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson finds Microsoft
guilty of antitrust violations _ as his exhaustive findings of fact
published nine days ago indicate he will _ a new proceeding will
determine what should be done to be sure Microsoft can no longer
illegally wield monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   A committee led by Timothy Bresnahan, a Stanford University
economist, is preparing recommendations for the Justice Department,
and a professor familiar with the panel's work said it was likely
to call for changes that would restructure Microsoft or its
products in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert and law professor at the
University of Iowa, is among the academics and consultants working
for the states. In an interview last week, he said, ``If the
findings show significant abuse of monopoly power, then the
appropriate remedy is to break up the monopoly _ not to hobble the
company or try to regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said he would
like to settle the case and would be willing to consider any
settlement proposal that protects the company's ability to add any
features it wants to the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the issue of Time magazine that reaches
newsstands Sunday, Gates was asked whether he might accept one
oft-mentioned idea for a remedy _ forcing Microsoft to publish the
source code for Windows so that competitors could create operating
systems that were compatible with the vast library of software
written for Windows. Gates said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that we know for sure would be bad for
consumers is anything that blocked us from being able to innovate
Windows, or anything that made it so that when people buy Windows
they don't know what is in it. Beyond that we'll be as pragmatic as
we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, The New York Times interviewed five other
academic authorities or former government officials who maintain a
direct professional interest in the case but are not attached to
either Microsoft or the government. All have followed the case
closely and have studied the judge's findings of fact.
</P>
<P>
   Each was asked what remedy he would choose, if he were given the
power to impose a solution. Three called for structural remedies.
Two said they believed remedies that kept Microsoft intact but
forced the company to modify its behavior would be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   But all agreed on one point: Any remedy should be
``self-executing,'' as several of them put it. In other words, once
imposed it should not require further oversight or interference
from the courts or the government. On that point, at least, the
Justice Department, the state attorneys general and, most likely,
the judge agree.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Economides, professor of economics, New York University
</P>
<P>
   Economides teaches economics, including antitrust issues, and
computer networking. He has written academic papers on the case,
but avows, ``I am not now and have never been involved in any
litigation involving Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Economides would put remedies in place that correct the specific
allegations raised in the government's case but that would have
little effect on future behavior because, he said, ``one has to be
very careful to be sure that the remedy is not worse than the
present situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes himself as an admirer of Microsoft, adding, ``I
don't see how consumers were hurt when they were given a browser
free, and Microsoft has not raised the price of its operating
system.'' A key conclusion in the judge's findings is that
Microsoft's decision to tie its Web browser to the Windows
operating system was an anticompetitive act.
</P>
<P>
   Economides would force Microsoft to rewrite its contracts with
many or all of its partners, customers and suppliers, ``to be sure
that the violations in the suit,'' such as Microsoft's restrictive
contracts with online service providers, ``will not happen again.''
Of the concern that Microsoft might find a way to evade contract
restrictions, Economides said, ``I have confidence that smart
lawyers will be able to work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would require Microsoft to publish many of the
software codes known as application programming interfaces that
allow other software companies to ``hook their programs to
Windows.'' Netscape and other companies have accused Microsoft of
withholding those as a penalty for failing to comply with requests
from Microsoft. But he would force Microsoft to publish the codes
only for Netscape and the other companies that were part of the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies facing similar problems in the future would have
to make their own cases in court, he said. If stronger remedies
were imposed, Economides averred, ``consumers would lose.''
</P>
<P>
   William Baer, former director, Bureau of Compliance, Federal
Trade Commission
</P>
<P>
   The trade commission shares antitrust enforcement with the
Justice Department, and Baer ran the agency's enforcement office
until last month. He supervised the commission's antitrust
investigation of Intel, which ended with a settlement last March.
But Baer was not working for the agency when it last investigated
Microsoft, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   While Baer said he had not steeped himself in the merits of the
specific remedies under discussion, he is clear on the principles
he would work to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start with a monopoly company that has unlawfully
limited competition,'' he said, ``the goal of any remedy has to be
more than telling them, `Go out and sin no more.' That approach
would allow the monopolist to maintain the benefits it has gained
from illegal use of its monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you want to do is move the market back in the direction
it would have gone but for the unlawful conduct. So the remedy has
to be something structural.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was not willing to suggest a specific solution, he did
say: ``It would be something like licensing their source code,
spinning off part of the company. Whatever it is, it should be
self-executing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my key point is this: What kind of lesson does a
monopolist take if he is told, `Please don't do this anymore,' and
is allowed to keep all of his ill-gotten gains? If the judge found
that Microsoft obtained its position illegally, then Microsoft
should have to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A structural remedy also sends a signal to any possible future
monopolists that they don't want to go down this road.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hall, economist, Stanford University
</P>
<P>
   Hall comments on and writes about the case but says, ``I enjoy
the position of being neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his proposed remedy, he says: ``I can't claim that it will
solve every problem. But the real issue is being sure that the
remedy does more good than harm. So I think it needs to be
conservative and clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he ``admired the quality of the economic arguments in
the judge's findings.'' And one good way to address them, he added,
would be to prohibit Microsoft from ``conditioning the sale of
Windows licenses to computer manufacturers on anything other than
the manufacturers' ability to pay for the license and to respect
Microsoft's intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence presented during the trial showed that Microsoft
threatened to withhold Windows from IBM and Compaq when those two
companies engaged in other actions Microsoft did not like.
</P>
<P>
   ``A remarkably large number of problems shown in the suit would
be resolved with this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he would also force Microsoft to revise its contracts
to prevent predatory or exclusionary dealings with other companies.
That would ensure that Microsoft did not condition its dealings
with other companies on their willingness to support other
Microsoft products or ventures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall acknowledged that his proposed remedies are ``modest.''
But, he added, ``I think this whole system is gong to work _ and
work without strangling Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Litan, director of economic studies, Brookings
Institution
</P>
<P>
   While deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice
Department's antitrust division, Litan negotiated the consent
decree with Microsoft that resulted from the department's previous
antitrust investigation of the company, in 1995. The present case
began when the Justice Department charged that Microsoft had
violated that 1995 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Litan now says he believes another conduct remedy of the sort
agreed to in 1995 ``just invites more lawyering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft lawyers would immediately go to work going around
it,'' he said. ``It's like a dam. Leaks would spring, and you'd
constantly be trying to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So my proposal,'' he added, ``would start with breaking the
company in two _ one operating system company and another with
everything else. But if you stop there, it'll be fraught with all
kinds of problems. You'd have to continually be supervising the
operating system company'' to make sure it did not pursue other
anticompetitive practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``So therefore I'm attracted to the idea of breaking the
operating system company into three equal companies _ all with
identical properties and activities. And then you let these three
operating system companies loose to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, Microsoft's chairman, would choose which company he would
lead _ one of the three operating-system companies, or the fourth
one holding all of Microsoft's other products and services.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's other senior leaders could not go with Gates.
They would have to be spread among the other new companies. And the
$18 billion in cash reserves Microsoft holds would be divided among
the four new companies, too.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of this idea, or variations of it, say they worry that
consumers would soon be faced with incompatible operating systems.
Litan said that would not occur in the short term because the
companies would start with the same operating system code.
</P>
<P>
   And if, as expected, the systems diverged in the future, other
companies would spring up to write what he called ``bridging
programs'' that would allow software for one operating system to
work with the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these companies competing with each other, you'd get more
innovation, and that's the goal,'' he said. ``It may be that the
trade for that'' is the risk of incompatibility.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Litan concluded, ``the operating system market will
probably collapse over time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be just one left, one winner,'' he said. ``But
whoever won would be severely chastened by this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Salop, professor of economics and law, Georgetown
University
</P>
<P>
   Salop has worked as a consultant for many computer and software
companies, including some of Microsoft's competitors. He has also
written about the case. And to him, ``the record is sufficiently
strong to support a strong structural remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that a conduct remedy _ forcing the company to rewrite
contracts or modify its behavior _ ``is too intrusive and
regulatory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in the interests of the economy, or of Microsoft,''
he said. ``What they want is to get this behind them once and for
all so they get on with what they say they want to do, and that is
_ innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   So Salop advocates ``a hybrid remedy'' _ exactly the same
proposal Litan offered for dividing the company into four parts.
</P>
<P>
   He rejects the idea long favored by the states of forcing
Microsoft to auction the source code for Windows so that other
companies could use it to develop competing operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The source code is not well documented,'' he said. ``It's not
like the recipe for the new Coke. There are 30 million lines of
code. You need access to information from Microsoft employees. So
these new companies would start with a real technological
disadvantage. Microsoft would leave them in the dust.''
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of his idea, he said, is that it is one-time and
clean. ``And we'd have competition in the operating system
market.''

SETBACK FOR A WEB SITE IN COPYRIGHT CASE 
 DAMAGE CONTROL AT THE LOS ANGELES TIMES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a case that pits the push by newspapers for
online revenues against the free-for-all nature of cyberspace
debate, a federal judge here says she intends to rebuff the
assertion of a conservative Web forum that it has a right to post
articles from two newspapers to foster discussion.
</P>
<P>
   In a copyright infringement lawsuit filed last year, The Los
Angeles Times, owned by the Times Mirror Co., and The Washington
Post accused the Web site, FreeRepublic.com, of reducing traffic on
their own Web sites and undercutting revenue from readers, who pay
to view archived stories, and from advertisers, who pay based on
the number of Web users who visit the sites.
</P>
<P>
   FreeRepublic's owners asserted they have a ``fair use'' and
First Amendment right to post the articles because the issues
covered in the stories _ and sometimes the stories themselves _
become the subject of written debate and criticism on the site.
</P>
<P>
   They also contended that the site had increased Web traffic to
the Post and the Times, citing testimony from a witness who
determined that FreeRepublic was responsible for 20,000 so-called
referral hits on the newspapers' Web sites each month.
</P>
<P>
   An important issue has been whether the FreeRepublic Web site is
a commercial venture. It receives donations from users to keep it
running, though Jim Robinson, one of the owners, insisted there
were no profits. But in a tentative ruling, U.S. District Judge
Margaret M. Morrow found that the solicitations, as well as
advertisements for another business owned by Robinson, made the
site a for-profit enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Siding with the newspapers, Morrow rejected FreeRepublic's
request to dismiss the suit. She found the site is commercial in
nature, and she ruled that its effect on revenue to the newspapers'
Web sites and the fact that many of the articles were reprinted in
full undercut the fair-use argument.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers have argued that links to sites would be
acceptable but FreeRepublic's owners have said that would be an
inconvenience to their readers.
</P>
<P>
   FreeRepublic was founded in Fresno, Calif., by Robinson, 53, and
his son, John 27, in 1996 ``to combat the erosion of the
Constitution,'' Robinson said in an interview. It posts news
articles from a wide array of media outlets, as well as government
reports, speeches and other material related to the government, so
its 20,000 registered users may debate what they read or even
compare the way different news agencies cover the same story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using it to critique the government, and to critique the
media itself, which is supposed to be a watchdog over the
government,'' Robinson said. ``So we feel we're an ideal case for
fair use.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are now awaiting a final ruling from the judge.
Robinson said he would appeal.

   Damage Control at The Los Angeles Times
</P>
<P>
   Mark H. Willes, chief executive of Times Mirror, last week sent
the staff of The Los Angeles Times a lengthy, e-mailed post-mortem
about the decision to share the profits from an issue of the
magazine devoted to coverage of a downtown arena with the
management of the same arena, the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly has not been our finest hour,'' he wrote. ``It is
important for us to reflect deeply and carefully on what happened,
what we have learned and what we should do going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn M. Downing, whom he named to succeed him as publisher in
June, won his praise for her quick acceptance of full
responsibility for the decision to share profits with the Staples
Center. ``I admire her courage,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Times is fortunate to have her as its publisher,'' he
added. ``She has my full and complete confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Downing was at ground zero as critical fire poured in the
last three weeks from journalists at The Los Angeles Times and
readers of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Ms. Downing was the subject of open speculation in
the newsroom as was that of the editor Michael Parks, whom Willes
praised as ``an astute, talented and courageous editor.''
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, he pointed out that the business executives at
the newspaper had worked ``tirelessly and creatively to provide the
resources necessary to underwrite what the editorial side does.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Willes, cultural differences divide the
newspaper's journalists from its business executives. ``Journalists
must be independent to do their jobs,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the business side, teamwork and collaboration are
critical,'' he continued, adding, ``Both sides are right from their
particular vantage point.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer? ``Appropriate conversations between both sides must
take place on a regular basis.'' Loosely translated: don't be too
quick to rebuild a wall between the business and news operations.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The key reason Amgen Corp. is the nation's
largest biotechnology company is its anti-anemia drug,
erythropoietin, or EPO, which is expected to generate $1.8 billion
in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   But when Amgen looks over its shoulder, it sees a midget,
Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. of Cambridge, nipping at its heels.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard F. Selden, the founder and president of
Transkaryotic Therapies, says he can make an improved and less
expensive version of the drug without violating Amgen's five
patents.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen says he can't. So next April, both companies _ along with
TKT's partner, Hoechst Marion Roussel, the large European
pharmaceutical company _ will square off in US District Court in
Boston to decide if TKT and Hoechst can sell an anemia drug that
would rival Amgen's drug.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile legal battle, which began 2 1/2 years ago, is
being closely watched in biotech and legal circles because of its
implications for patent law. So far, TKT and Hoechst have been
allowed to test the drug, but the court has yet to decide whther
the company may legally market it. Amgen claims its two rivals are
violating its patents and should be stopped from marketing it, even
if it gains US Food and Drug Administration approval.
</P>
<P>
   TKT maintains it has developed a new manufacturing process that
does not infringe on Amgen's patents.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology industry specialists are divided on the claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the technology is sufficiently different that TKT
with Hoechst should prevail,'' said Jonas V. Alsenas, biotechnology
analyst with ING Baring Furman Selz LLC in New York. ``TKT is
starting with human cells and using production technologies a
decade advanced over Amgen's.''
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts disagree. Meirav Chovav at Salomon Smith
Barney maintains that TKT is clarly infringing on patents Amgen
holds for its version of EPO, which is sold as Epogen.
</P>
<P>
   If TKT prevails in court, its product is expected to do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is apparent that the market would be receptive to the
lower-cost Epogen equivalent,'' noted Eric T. Schmidt, SG Cowen
biotechnology analyst.
</P>
<P>
   SG Cowen &AMP; Co., a New York investment bank, predicts that the
TKT/Hoechst version of EPO, now in final phase III clinical trials,
could capture as much as 8 percent of Amgen's market in 2001 and 15
percent in 2002 if the FDA clears it for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen has projected Amgen's Epogen sales at more than $1.9
billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For TKT's Selden, 41, a former pediatrician who did genetic
research while at Harvard Medical School, winning against Amgen
could lead to the company's first product revenues under its
financial arrangement with Hoechst.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Binder, Amgen's chief executive, maintains the
forthcoming legal tussle was not unexpected as Amgen seeks to
protect its control of Epogen, which was approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The drug supplements a naturally occurring hormone made in the
kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production and correct anemia
because of kidney failure. In addition, Amgen earlier this month
gained expanded FDA approval to market Epogen to children with
kidney problems who are undergoing dialysis _ a use that should
further sales.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen's Epogen sales already are soaring, up 28 percent to $449
million during the third quarter of this year alone. The drug's
success makes it a target for others.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Amgen is in a simultaneous battle with Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, of New Brunswick, N.J. Under an Amgen license, J&AMP;J makes
and sells EPO under the name Procrit, and expects this year to have
$1 billion in revenue from the drug.
</P>
<P>
   But Amgen charges that Johnson &AMP; Johnson has gone beyond the
terms of its license by selling it for treatment of patients on
kidney dialysis. Amgen claims it holds exclusive rights to EPO for
that purpose. The dispute is in arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on top it's not surprising that others will want
to go after you. To me this is Hoechst with TKT trying to get
around our patents to get into the EPO market,'' said Binder.
``This is just business _ we've come to expect it and we don't
think TKT's arguments have much merit. We'll see what the judge
says.''
</P>
<P>
   Binder made his comments during an interview in Boston last week
at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new Amgen East Coast research
facility in Cambridge, a mile from TKT's offices. Amgen's home
office is in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Amgen asked US District Court Judge William Young for
summary judgment to dismiss the TKT case. His ruling on the motion
is expected around Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll go to trial _ we're ready,'' said Selden, who
nearly 11 years ago created TKT, but only focused on EPO since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   That was when TKT developed a technology called gene activation
that enables it to make EPO from human cells. The company saw that
EPO genes are in all human cells, but are generally dormant. TKT's
discovery was able to selectively turn on cells to express
naturally occurring EPO, using a fragment of DNA as a switch.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Amgen makes Epogen starting with a more traditional
biotechnology manufacturing process patented in 1983. It begins
with Chinese hamster ovaries and inserts the complete coding
sequence of the EPO gene to create a close copy of the human EPO
protein.
</P>
<P>
   TKT's all-human-cell approach, vs. Amgen's reliance on splicing
or transporting from one cell to another to create human EPO
production, is at the heart of the dispute _ even though in 1996,
Amgen modified some of its patents to account for different
production methods. Amgen also is now testing a second-generation
EPO product.
</P>
<P>
   TKT's future does not rest entirely on EPO. Under Douglas Treco,
senior vice president of research and development (and TKT's first
employee), the company is working on six other gene-activation
proteins along with a second set of drugs to treat rare diseases.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is Fabry's disease, a rare genetic disorder where a
metabolizing enzyme is missing. TKT is in a race to finish work on
this drug before its closest rival, Genzyme Corp. of Cambridge,
which is developing a similar drug using a different technology.
</P>
<P>
   To finance its future, TKT _ which has 200 employees and is
publicly traded _ recently raised $132 million in a private
financing. The new funds will be used to develop and test
forthcoming drugs. This is in addition to Hoechst's $125 million
investment in TKT, which includes a 10 percent stake in the company
as well as rights to EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this extensive funding and a strong technology, Wall
Street support for TKT has been mixed. But the company's stock
price has held up, closing Wednesday at 46, down 1/4. It set a
52-week high of 53 3/8 Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started as a gene-therapy company and knew it would take as
much as 15 years to get a product to market, so we knew we needed
other products to provide us with revenue, and our EPO will be our
first,'' said Selden confidently.

Y2K-OK, Y2K-NOT OK: START-UP GETS ATTENTION WITH LAST-MINUTE 
OFFER
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yawns might have seemed the likely response last week when a
small Silicon Valley start-up, Y2K-OK LLC, introduced a new tool
for diagnosing and fixing Year 2000 computer problems on popular
IBM mainframe and midrange computers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, experts have been warning corporate and government
clients for years that there are no silver-bullet solutions to Year
2000 problems. And recently, they have been advising businesses to
concentrate on contingency plans for working around breakdowns
rather than searching for last-minute fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most established players are struggling for attention.
One vendor, CCD Online Systems, recently pledged to donate $50,000
to charity if its software failed to uncover at least 50
significant errors in each million lines of code that the Internal
Revenue Service or other major computer users had already repaired.
There have been no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, surprisingly, the fledgling Y2K-OK is causing a stir. The
company, based in Campbell, Calif., said that more than 20,000
visitors showed up at its Web site last week in the first three
days after the product was announced. More than 100 visitors, from
Singapore to the nearby San Jose police department, downloaded a
free version that performs a limited audit of a system's readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our salesmen have a ton of leads,'' said Albert P. McBride,
the company's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Free samples of products often attract a crowd, of course, but
Y2K-OK might still have gone unnoticed were it not for its
pedigree. The tool is the brainchild of Willard H. Wattenburg, a
63-year-old inventor, computer scientist and radio talk show host
with a reputation for iconoclastic brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-OK's story is a severe test of the proverb ``Better late
than never,'' akin to opening a toy store on Christmas Eve.
Successful or not, it will go down as one of the more colorful
tales in Year 2000 product lore.
</P>
<P>
   Wattenburg, often called Dr. Bill or Wild Bill by those who know
him, has spent the bulk of his professional life in computer and
nuclear weapons work. But he particularly enjoys developing simple
solutions to complex problems, as when he persuaded California
highway engineers to use surplus railroad flatcars as temporary
replacements for bridges destroyed in California earthquakes to
quickly restore traffic.
</P>
<P>
   His patents include one of the first home smoke alarms, and he
has played bit roles in two Clint Eastwood movies. One devoted fan
of his radio show tracks his life and exploits at www.drbill.org.
</P>
<P>
   Wattenburg is currently an adjunct professor at Chico State
University in Chico, Calif., but he is more widely known for his
Saturday and Sunday night call-in shows on KGO radio in San
Francisco. He said he had little interest in Year 2000 issues until
late 1998, when he was recruited to help rescue a Defense
Department computer program riddled with date problems that would
hit as soon as 1999 began.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other entrepreneurs in recent years, Wattenburg became
convinced that the world needed a fully automated fix for the
problem. He decided to focus on how computers interpret programs'
instructions rather than on the programs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He started by developing a method to get an IBM 390, one of the
most widely used mainframes, to treat calculations involving
numbers (including dates) as invalid operations. He envisioned that
the invalid result could be made to trip a program that would
convert the numbers to a different math system for execution _ a
system in which Year 2000 date confusion would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The math was a numbering system that IBM and Allstate had first
applied to Year 2000 repairs in 1997 but were never able to
popularize.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge with the Year 2000 problem is that for decades,
programmers used only two digits to express years. The century was
always assumed to be 19. Thus, 62 stood for 1962, 96 for 1996. When
2000 arrives, however, the two zeros will be interpreted as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The Allstate system, known as the A0 system, borrows extra
numerals from the Base 16, or hexadecimal, numbering system, which
uses the letters A through F to represent the numbers 10 through
15, so that 10 in hexadecimal is 16.
</P>
<P>
   A standard hexadecimal system would not work in this case
because, for one thing, years previously entered in a database
would have the wrong values. In Base 16, for example, 99 represents
159, and the next number is A0, which represents 160.
</P>
<P>
   But by borrowing the use of A through F for just the 10's column
and keeping the standard zero through nine in the ones column, the
A0 system can delay a turnover to 00 for 59 years.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate's approach had limitations that led Wattenburg to
develop his own variation on A0 math and new rules for how to
calculate with it. His system can only handle dates until 2049, 10
years fewer than Allstate's approach, but it has extra room for
control sequences that, he says, make it possible to automate more
Year 2000 work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his early version was not persuasive enough for the
journal Science to agree to publish it. Nor was it ready for
market. For example, it lacked the coding to convert the Wattenburg
math back to decimal numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Wattenburg was ready to give up by February when McBride's wife
heard him mention his Year 2000 work on radio and suggested that
McBride might be able to develop the tool further.
</P>
<P>
   The two men knew each other from McBride's days as a graduate
student at the University of California, when Wattenburg had been
his thesis adviser. McBride was intrigued by the challenge of
fleshing out Wattenburg's vision.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was willing to lend the team computer time at a Bay Area
facility but told Wattenburg it was too late to get computer users
to try anything new. IBM, Microsoft, Intel and others all declined
to finance the project.
</P>
<P>
   But William N. Joy, co-founder and chief scientist of Sun
Microsystems, was impressed and quickly arranged for Sun to provide
an undisclosed development grant on condition that Y2K-OK make a
free version of the product available to small businesses that
might be starting late on their Year 2000 work.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Sun nor IBM has endorsed the tool released this week.
But Steven Carre, an IBM executive who works on Year 2000 solutions
told The San Jose Mercury News, ``I wish all my customers who are
not ready would call Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Carre said he did not expect many to make that call. The history
of other tools suggests that those who do make their way to the
company's site (www.y2k0k-solution.com) may end up discouraged by
the pricing for the full package or by the tool's limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The most important limitation is that computer users may be
exposing themselves to new problems if databases converted to
Wattenburg numbers are sharing information with programs that have
not been converted.
</P>
<P>
   And the Y2K-OK tool currently works only for Cobol programs on
the IBM 390 and its clones, and for Cobol and RPG programs on IBM
AS400 midrange computers and their clones.
</P>
<P>
   Even Wattenburg wonders how many people will be willing to
experiment with his tool with fewer than than 50 days until the
Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al and his team did a great job,'' he said. ``It's just too
bad we couldn't have been ready sooner.''

BECOMING A `MILLIONAIRE' NEVER SO EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody has an explanation for the runaway popularity of ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Vicarious greed. The irresistible lure
of gambling. The thrill of rooting for the contestants. The novelty
of the format to viewers too young to remember the quiz show
scandals of the 1950s. The ageless charm of host Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   Its attractions may be debatable, but there's no argument that
the ABC show is huge hit, averaging more than 23 million viewers
every time it's on, outdistancing all competition, even, last
Thursday, the ever-popular ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   My own theory is that people are drawn in droves to the show
because it allows them to feel intellectually superior to the
morons who try and fail to answer the idiotic questions. Many of
the multiple-choice questions on ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire''
are almost unbelievably simple-minded, on a par with Groucho's
favorite, ``Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?'' All in all, the show
makes the average ``Jeopardy'' seem like a Mensa test by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a typical question from a recent show: ``What did the
character Little Bo Peep lose? a) mittens b) pigs c) sheep d)
flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, that one occurred in a lower prize-money range, but the
questions don't get a lot tougher as the stakes soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' has been criticized for not having a better
demographic mix of contestants. Of the first 60, 50 were white
males. The producers blame the lack of diversity on a ``blind''
screening process in which people call a toll-free number and
answer a series of trivia questions. It seems only fair that women
and minorities should have the same opportunity as white guys to
answer stupid questions for big money. They sure couldn't do any
worse than some of the contestants have done to date.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night's show, one contestant flamed out at the
$32,000 level because he couldn't pick the name of the composer of
the ``Blue Danube'' waltz. Another had to call a friend for help _
that's allowed _ answering a $32,000 question about where ``author
Henry David Thoreau lived for two years in a hut.'' Lake George? I
don't think so. Luckily for him his friend was able to give him the
correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   One contestant couldn't identify the famous American primitive
artist who didn't start painting until she was in her 70s. Maybe
Georgia O'Keefe? He asked Regis to poll the audience, another of
the show's innovations. One-third of them also thought it was
O'Keefe. Goodbye $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the questions become more challenging as the prize money
approaches the highest levels. The million-dollar question may be
posed in Sanskrit for all I know. Thus far, no contestant has won
more than $500,000. The highest-level question I can recall,
$125,000, involved the number of arms on a squid. It's not in the
Bo-Peep category, but it's not that difficult. Of course that's
easy for me to say because a) for some strange reason (Miss
Mahoney's biology class?) I happen to know the answer, and b) I'm
not sitting in the hot seat with Philbin boring in, asking, ``Is
that your final answer?'' According to a story in the current
People magazine, the show's producers encourage Philbin to heighten
the tension to make contestants sweat. He does a masterful job of
tormenting his victims, but he's been practicing for years on

   The success of ``Millionaire'' has already inspired one Fox
knock-off titled, with brilliant simplicity, ``Greed.'' According
to a Los Angeles Times story, other networks and syndicators are
considering developing quiz programs, including one called ``Who
Wants to Marry a Millionaire?'' in which women would compete for
the attentions of wealthy men. Just what this competition might
involve is as yet unclear, but I'd guess it won't involve answering
questions about Little Bo-Peep. Although who knows?

TICKETMASTER TRIES TO STIR THE PASSIONS OF EVENT-GOERS 
 HAND-HELD WIRELESS DATA GETS A FLAT-RATE TEST 
 A DEBIT CARD FOR STUDENTS, WITH OVERSIGHT FOR PARENTS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   For years, people have gone to music stores to buy concert
tickets. Now Ticketmaster Online is putting a music store inside
its ticket shop.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch features the
``Ticketmaster Store,'' where users can buy more than 150,000
items, including CDs, apparel, videos and memorabilia about their
favorite artists.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the first significant e-commerce expansion for
Ticketmaster (www.ticketmaster.com), which until now has sold only
tickets and goods from local vendors through CitySearch's City
Auction service.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Sullivan, Ticketmaster Online's vice president of
e-commerce, called the store ``an absolutely natural fit for us.
When someone plops down $120 for tickets, they're indicating a
passion that's just about impossible to find in other product
categories.''
</P>
<P>
   The site will try to exploit that passion. First, it will divide
its merchandise into four product categories _ sports, arts,
theater and family. Shoppers can find autographed baseballs or team
jerseys in the sports category, for example, or buy a Monet poster
in the arts section.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, users will be shown various artist-related items as
they buy tickets, and if they register with the site, they can get
information e-mailed to them about performers, like concert
playlists and tour news. They can also pre-order CDs and videos.
</P>
<P>
   Digital music is also in the company's cross hairs. Sullivan
said that the site will soon test different digital music systems,
with an introduction planned for next year. In addition,
Ticketmaster will integrate the store with the CitySearch
offerings, he said, ``so someone can buy tickets, get a CD, book
dinner and make a hotel reservation from one place.''

   Hand-held Wireless Data Gets a Flat-Rate Test
</P>
<P>
   A spinoff of 3Com Corp.'s Palm Computing division plans to say
Monday that it will test a flat-rate wireless service offering
nationwide access to the Internet and electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   OmniSky Corp., which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., will in
partnership with AT&AMP;T offer a small radio modem that attaches to
Palm V hand-held computers. The company said it would begin a test
program in December for 5,000 users of the popular hand-held
digital organizer. At the end of March, it plans to follow with
commercial service for a flat monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   The new service is based on AT&AMP;T Wireless Services' Cellular
Digital Packet Data network, or CDPD, and is intended to offer a
similar range of services now provided by the Palm's wireless Palm
VII hand-held computer and a growing range of pagers and cell
phones connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those plans, though, have been criticized because they
are priced on a usage basis that charges by the amount of data, in
bytes, the user sends or receives. That plan has proved unpopular
with the Palm VII: consumers have had difficulties estimating how
many bytes they consume in any given month, and corporate users
complain that it makes budgeting for wireless use of the Palm VII
almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The new service will be free during the company's four-month
test period after the 5,000 Palm users purchase a $299 modem. The
company said it had not yet determined the monthly price but said
it would be less than $50 and could possibly be as low as $30 for
regional service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about real Internet access,'' said Patrick McVeigh,
chief executive of OmniSky. ``A lot of people have tried this in
the past, but we believe we've hit on the right value
proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobile wireless data devices have long been an object of desire
in the industry, but have been slow to take off. Companies like
Radiomail and Wynd Communications stumbled in the early 1990s, when
broad consumer demand for ``e-mail on the go'' never developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good first step,'' said Andrew Seybold, publisher of
Andrew Seybold's Outlook, an industry newsletter on mobile
computing. ``Flat-rate pricing is the right model.''
</P>
<P>
   OmniSky was formed in June of this year by executives from 3Com
and Infoseek; it has financing from 3Com and Aether Systems, a
maker of wireless Internet technology.

   A Debit Card for Students, With Oversight for Parents
</P>
<P>
   A new type of Visa card allows students to shop until their
parents say drop. Called the PocketCard, it carries the Visa label
and is used like any other credit card. But it is technically a
debit card, financed and guaranteed by a ``sponsor,'' like a
parent, through an account set up on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The account must be tied to a checking or savings account, which
allows the card to be almost instantly replenished over the
telephone or with the click of a mouse. Transactions can also be
monitored as soon as they are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I see as the most unique is the real-time access to
the transaction data,'' said Jeff Green, editor of Bank Network
News.
</P>
<P>
   The cards, which are available through www.pocketcard.com, are
geared toward people like parents or business owners who want to
give others money to work with but still want some control over the
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a 13-year-old kid having this relationship where
she can have her own card with her name on it and the parents can
give her supervision and support,'' said Bill Scheurer, founder and
chief executive of PocketCard.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors must be at least 18 and card holders at least 13. There
is an annual fee of $15 for a family and $20 for a business. A
charge of 25 cents is levied on each transaction, including
deposits. The company also charges an ATM cash fee of $2 in
addition to whatever the host bank charges.
</P>
<P>
   Yvette Burgen, who lives near Detroit, got one for her
18-year-old son, Jason, after she drove 80 miles round trip to buy
him something he needed quickly at the University of Michigan. She
said the card was attractive because it provided some financial
flexibility without relying on credit, while at the same time
giving her some oversight.

VERTICAL TRANSISTOR HOLDS PROMISE FOR COMPUTING ADVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Promising an era of mobile computers that consume less power,
researchers at Lucent Technologies' Bell Laboratories have
developed a radically new alternative to the so-called planar
transistor, the workhorse of the semiconductor industry for the
last 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   The device, known as a vertical transistor, will be reported at
the International Electron Device Meeting in Washington on Dec. 7.
It could provide chip makers with a crucial new weapon in
continuing to significantly lower power consumption while
increasing the speed of computer processors.
</P>
<P>
   The product of a two-year research project by Bell Labs' Silicon
Electronics Research Laboratory in Murray Hill, N.J., the new
device is not the first vertical transistor created by
semiconductor designers. The novel transistors, which rise above
the silicon foundation on which integrated circuits are fabricated,
have largely been research curiosities for a number of years.
However the Bell Labs team said their new design promised to be
more easily manufacturable and thus economically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been trying to make a vertical transistor for 25
years,'' said Jack Hergenrother, a team member. ``We studied the
previous approach and combined some of their ideas, but this is
essentially a new idea.''
</P>
<P>
   If it proves workable, the new device might be widely used in
semiconductors in about five years, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of vertical transistors is that they make it
easier to shorten the ``gate lengths'' of transistors _ the
critical dimension of the tiny switches that control the flow of
electricity in an integrated circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell Labs researchers said they had still not made a
complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, version of the
transistor. However, they said they were confident they would be
able to achieve that goal. CMOS (pronounced SEE-moss) technology is
the most commonly used manufacturing approach in the semiconductor
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, planar transistors have been made by implanting
charged atoms, called dopants, often arsenic, antimony, bismuth or
phosphorus, in silicon to change its electrical properties. Then an
insulating oxide is deposited, after which a metal gate is etched
into the surface using a process called optical lithography.
</P>
<P>
   A voltage applied to the gate can switch the current on and off
within the silicon _ the basis of digital electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Although this manufacturing process is among the most refined in
the world, semiconductor designers are even now bumping up against
fundamental limits, like the minimum wavelength of light, as they
attempt to craft ever-thinner gate lengths.
</P>
<P>
   By standing the transistor on its side, it is possible to
precisely control the gate length without optical lithography,
meaning that it will be feasible to achieve gate lengths that are
not bound by the limitations of light and are thus beyond the
current manufacturing limits of optical lithography.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, vertical transistors also hold out the potential for
elaborate three-dimensional structures, such as stacking
transistors on top of one another to pack even more circuitry into
a given chip area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a smaller transistor, you can run a device with
less power,'' said Mark Pinto, the chief technology officer of
Lucent's Microelectronics Group.
</P>
<P>
   The International Electron Device Meeting is one of two premier
technical meetings held each year that usually offer a peek into
the future of computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a number of important advances will be reported
including a new CMOS transistor from an Intel Corp. research group
that can switch in less than 10 picoseconds, or 10-trillionths of a
second, at room temperature while consuming less than 1.5 volts of
power.
</P>
<P>
   And an IBM research group at the T.J. Watson Research Center in
Yorktown Heights, N.Y., will report the fastest CMOS transistor
ever. IBM's transistor switches in 6.4 picoseconds, also consuming
1.5 volts, but has to be cooled to minus-100 degrees centigrade to
achieve those efficiencies.

MORE VENTILATION MAY END MOISTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 21, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have condensation in my attic, where there is some
pressed-board flooring. Moisture seems to be coming up through the
pressed board. The insulation in my attic floor, under the pressed
board, is not wet, but there is no vapor barrier under it. I have a
ridge vent, and six soffit vents on each side of the house. What
can I do to get rid of what moisture is there? The bathroom fan
exhausts through one of those soffit vents.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FULGONI, Billerica, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That moisture on the pressed board is not coming up through
the pressed board, but is condensation of moisture already in the
attic. To get rid of it, I suggest adding more soffit vents (vents
on the underside of the roof overhang). To put in a vapor barrier
under the existing insulation is difficult, but this is not
necessary because the ceiling paint in the rooms below may form a
vapor barrier; or you can paint the ceilings with a vapor barrier
paint. BIN, a white-pigmented shellac, is a vapor barrier.
</P>
<P>
   While it's OK to exhaust the bathroom through a soffit vent,
make sure the duct carrying the air fits snugly in the vent; in
other words, you do not want the duct to just lie there in front of
the soffit vent; that would allow excess moisture into the attic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We own a house in Maine with asbestos siding. A company said
it would power-wash the siding to clean it. Is this acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   ELEANOR LAMBERTSON, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Power-washing asbestos-cement siding can release asbestos
fibers into the air. I don't think this is a federal or
state-by-state law, but power-washing that kind of siding should
not be done anywhere, any way. Asbestos-cement siding should not be
sanded, scraped, or anything else but washed with detergent and
water. When paint on the siding is peeling, it is particularly
unfortunate because the peeling cannot be safely removed, except by
washing, which is not very effective.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am filling the open stud walls on my house with insulation.
The walls are uneven so I am furring out the studs so the final
wall finish will, indeed, be even. With the new wall furred out a
little, the electric switches and outlet boxes will be indented.
How can I bring them flush with the wall? Incidentally, can I cover
the wires in the walls with insulation?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD BODURTHA, Plymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can cover wires in the walls with insulation. You are not
supposed to cover exposed wires in the attic floor, but it is done
in thousands of houses throughout the country without serious ill
effects. The danger if you do that is that the wires, covered with
insulation, will overheat and cause a fire.
</P>
<P>
   To correct the mystery of the indented outlet boxes, relocate
them to the proper position, since the wall finish is off anyway.
Or, put spacers behind the bolts that hold the outlet or switch
fixtures to the boxes; this will bring them out even with the wall,
so they can be covered properly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I spend my winters in Florida, summers in Nova Scotia. When
visiting my daughter's house in Framingham recently, I noticed
yellow jackets had gotten into the walls. My daughter and
son-in-law are not doing anything about it. They are coming in
under a 4-foot-wide soffit. Shouldn't they do something? Might they
be boring holes in the studs or something?
</P>
<P>
   M.A., Florida/Nova Scotia
</P>
<P>
   A. Your family doesn't have to do anything because there is
nothing to do, if the critters stay in the walls. The yellow
jackets are wasps, and they will die out in winter after eating all
kinds of bugs all summer long. Your family could seal the soffit to
prevent further invasion and to make you feel better. The wasps are
not drilling holes in the studs because they don't do that sort of
thing. The insect that drills holes in wood is a carpenter bee, and
even she (females drill holes to store their eggs in) would drill
holes in siding or outside trim.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house was built in 1955, with a few towel racks that seem
to have been put up with library paste. One small member of my
family actually pulled it off. How can we reinstall it?
</P>
<P>
   BEVERLY BRULE, Northborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah, yes, the collapsing towel racks. In those halcyon days of
building, anything went, and usually collapsed. Towel racks, toilet
paper holders, and other fixtures were put up with grout, which did
not hold as well as the thin-set mortar of today. It's a wonder
your rack lasted as long as it did.
</P>
<P>
   To reinstall it, scrape the old grout off the brackets as well
as the wall on which the bracket was applied. Apply an adhesive
caulk to the fixture brackets. It comes in a caulking cartridge for
use in a caulking gun, so it is easily applied to the fixture.
</P>
<P>
   Press firmly, and hold onto it for several minutes for it to
set. Left alone, it will sag. You have to be there for five minutes
or so, keeping it in position. Once it sets, though, it will hold
very well. An alternative way: Do the same as above with thin-set
mortar, which you have to mix yourself.
</P>

OFF THE PAGE AND ONTO A PC SCREEN: AN ENCYLOPEDIC MIRROR OF WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early years of this fading millennium, two words often
appeared in encyclopedia titles: ``speculum'' (mirror) and
``imago'' (image). Encyclopedias were meant to reflect the world
while also giving it shape. And what enormous mirrors they were!
One Chinese encyclopedia from the 13th century filled 240 volumes.
The German-language General Encyclopedia (1818-89) reached volume
167 and was never even completed.
</P>
<P>
   These textual universes were also meant to reflect the divisions
and categories of the surrounding world. The 10th-century Arabic
encyclopedia, Mafatih al-'Ulum (Key to the Sciences), was split
into two sections: indigenous knowledge (including jurisprudence,
secretarial duties and history) and foreign knowledge (philosophy,
logic, alchemy). One 12th-century European encyclopedia devoted an
entire section to a chronicle of events since Satan's fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Enlightenment changed the categories, but not the ambition.
Francis Bacon, in the plans for his encyclopedia, intended ``to
commence a total reconstruction of sciences, arts, and all human
knowledge, raised upon the proper foundations.'' Until a few
hundred years ago, merely alphabetical organization was considered
to be, in Coleridge's words, a sign of ``impudent ignorance'' that
presented the world as a ``huge, unconnected miscellany.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgive the encyclopedic introduction. I have been reading the
25,000-word entry on encyclopedia in the Britannica. After seeing
sales of its $1,500 set drop 80 percent in the early 1990s, after
stumbling into the Internet era a few years ago with a failed paid
subscription site, after being sold to a Swiss financier, the
Britannica _ the oldest and largest English encyclopedia _ became
freely available on the Internet (at www.britannica.com) in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Britannica is changing from an encyclopedia into a ``portal,''
an entry point into the Web, including news (from The Washington
Post), weather, stock quotes and e-mail. Advertisements,
tailor-made for encyclopedia entries, will provide income. There
will also be be ``e-commerce'' deals and an online store.
Britannica wants to become an Internet brand.
</P>
<P>
   This may have some advantages. Jorge Cauz, Britannica's senior
vice president for marketing, said a 100-member editorial staff is
setting up three-year cycles of continuous revision. About 50
percent of the text will remain intact over time; the total text
will end up being larger by about a third, and ``broader topical
references'' will be included.
</P>
<P>
   But the very nature of the encyclopedia may also change. From
its first edition (1768) in Scotland, the Britannica's world mirror
was formed out of meticulously molded smaller ones. In its 14
editions, the Britannica published classic entries: Swinburne on
Keats, John Muir on Yosemite, Freud on psychoanalysis, Houdini on
conjuring, Einstein on space-time.
</P>
<P>
   The Britannica's alphabetical organization, far from creating
``a huge unconnected miscellany,'' became a sign of both humility
and grandeur: humility because it acknowledged that no system could
encompass the world in all its complexity, and grandeur because it
asserted that there was still a way to present that immensity for
human delectation.
</P>
<P>
   But about a decade ago, this model changed; it has been most
clearly reflected in Microsoft's CD-ROM encyclopedia, Encarta. The
new structure of knowledge is not conceptual or alphabetical. It is
technological. ``Features'' organize the encyclopedic world: time
lines, panoramic views, videos, audio snippets, virtual tours,
games.
</P>
<P>
   Encarta's actual content, in fact, often seems an accompaniment
to the razzle-dazzle technology. Monthly updates are available on
the Internet for a subscription fee and each year has seen welcome
improvements. But most of the text comes from Funk &AMP; Wagnall's and
Collier's _ decidedly second-rate encyclopedias.
</P>
<P>
   So don't expect Encarta to be too revealing about
``encyclopedias,'' for example (an entry gives incorrect dates for
the Britannica). Even a subject close to Encarta's technological
heart _ the ``Internet'' _ is oddly treated; the Encarta 2000
edition has little information after 1997 and a sidebar is offered
from an antediluvian 1994 entry. Patchwork and miscellany seem more
common than systematic interpretations, a symptom perhaps of
hypertext and multimedia obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   But the new technology isn't a problem in itself. It can provide
unusual opportunities to search, listen and watch, as in the
fascinating new release of Encarta Africana (Microsoft), with its
surveys of black American and African culture. And there are times
when the technology, even if imperfectly applied to a dated text,
is still of great use, as in the invaluable CD-ROM of the
Encyclopedia Judaica (Judaica Multimedia). Even Britannica's own
CD-ROM uses technology to illumine the text. The danger comes when
technology, instead of being a tool, determines the content.
</P>
<P>
   For Britannica, though, the greatest risk may be not in
technological excess, but in Internet access. If income depends on
e-commerce, will emphases change to court clicks? Will as many
resources be devoted to a rarely consulted scholarly entry on, say,
Baroque opera as to a popular and commercially supported entry on,
say, rock music? Right now, the Web site offers a ``Britannica.com
happening'' featuring ``psychedelic rock'': it urges you to ``turn
off your mind, relax and float downstream.''
</P>
<P>
   If systematic changes take place _ and the company insists they
will not _ the new categories of knowledge won't be in history or
divinity or the alphabet; they will be in revenue and click count.
Britannica.com would be constantly creating itself in response to
the demands of its readers. That sort of speculum might accurately
reflect the current universe, but not quite in the way the creators
of great encyclopedias had in mind.

NO LANDSLIDE _ YET _ FOR E-VOTING

<P>
   For a few hours on Tuesday (Nov. 2), Helen Steverson had the
toughest job at the Lexington Street Fire Station in Cambridge,
Mass. She was assisting voters with the newfangled ballot box, a
super-high-tech innovation that left locals scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They upgraded the system,'' Steverson explained. ``They
replaced the old machine with the crank.''
</P>
<P>
   The machine with the crank? It looks like Cambridge has made it
into the 20th century, with minutes to spare. Actually, the city
got rid of the old crank machines two years ago. But the rest of
the system is a relic of the Paper and Pencil Age. Here's the
drill: You give your address to a volunteer who crosses your name
off a computer printout. No one asks for identification, and the
list almost always includes names of neighbors who have moved or
passed away. You step behind the star-spangled curtain and fill in
little circles, like a standardized test. Easy enough. But what do
you do with the cardboard sleeve that says, ``Insert finger here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what that means,'' says Steverson. ``We confused
them good this year.'' At 79, the Cambridge native has been
volunteering at the polls for 24 years. She works alongside her
friend Ethel Odell, 78, and the two have become Election Day
fixtures at the fire station. ``It's a civic duty,'' says
Steverson. ``It's a community,'' adds Odell. ``I see people I
haven't seen all year.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do the experts think about voting on the Internet? ``It
will be a long time before it gets here,'' says Steverson.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe or maybe not. Voters in eight precincts in Iowa tested
voting on the Internet this week, and more than 85 percent of the
1,253 participants in the volunteer pilot project said they would
vote on line again, according to Iowa Secretary of State Chet
Culver. The program was run by a company called VoteHere.net;
naturally, the software developers will tell you that the future of
democracy (and their companies) depends on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? You can bank on line. You can buy (or learn to fix)
a kitchen sink. You buy a little red sportscar or fulfill other
little red fantasies. ``We need to do everything possible to
encourage participation in the democratic process,'' says Culver,
ticking off the depressing statistics. Voter turnout nationwide was
only 44.9 percent last year. Two million eligible voters between 18
and 24 are not voting. The US ranks 137th out of 167 democracies
when it comes to voter turnout. But if folks were allowed to click
and pick in their pajamas, the numbers might improve.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, security and privacy issues need to be ironed out.
There's also the question of the digital divide. Polling places
will always have to remain an option for people who do not own or
even use computers. But Iowa is testing the system again in
January, when high school students statewide will cast ballots in a
mock presidential caucus, and Culver predicts on-line voting will
be common in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that encourages folks to vote is a good thing. But at
the same time, the pundits and software peddlers should consider
what's lost in the name of progress. ``Voting should be a
quasi-religious experience,'' says Tracy Westen, president of the
California-based Democracy Network (www.dnet.org). ``It should be a
philosophical and ethical commitment, and the ceremonial aspects
are important. You go to the place, you see the flag, you walk into
the booth, you take your kids with you, and you hand in your
ballot. Those things are important.''
</P>
<P>
   And some day, they might disappear. Frankly, I'd choose on-line
voting over going to the polls any day (especially a stormy one).
But I'll miss the familiar walk to the fire station, the dodging
past the sign-holders and the hand-shakers, the fumbling with the
ballot. What are you supposed to do with that stupid ``Insert
finger here'' sleeve anyway? It's for privacy, Steverson says, but
it's OK if you ignore it. ``I'll be 80 soon,'' she adds, ``and this
might be my last year.''
</P>

----- &QC;  Here's a new low, as seen on eBay: A greedy little
entrepreneur is auctioning the domain name, egyptair990.com, with
bids starting at $2,500. The seller, who goes by the tag keith786
and claims to be from Atlanta, didn't return e-mail messages. No
wonder. The speculator in other people's misery doesn't even own
the Web address. That privilege goes to Doug Desjardins, a
Washington attorney with the firm R. Jack Clapp and Associates.
Desjardins insists he has no intention of using the address for a
profit, and that he isn't selling it on eBay or anywhere else; he
says he gave the domain name to the families of victims of ValuJet
Flight 592 to set up an informational site.

TOYS THAT DO _ AND DON'T _ MAKE THE GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the fifth consecutive year, Child Caring is publishing the
holiday toy list prepared by Teachers Resisting Unhealthy
Children's Entertainment (TRUCE).
</P>
<P>
   Many toy lists are published at this time of year. Some focus on
toys that are physically unsafe; others recommend toys based on
popularity. What distinguishes the TRUCE list is that it focuses on
the value of the quality of the play that a toy does or doesn't
promote. Founded in Cambridge, Mass., TRUCE is a national group of
early childhood educators. While the list highlights specific toys,
TRUCE also reminds parents that these toys represent trends to
watch for.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOYS TO AVOID
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These toys use electronics in gimmicky ways that limit and
inhibit creativity and/or dictate a script:
</P>
<P>
   Elmo Talking Doll Stroller by Sesame Street/CTW. When you put
the doll in the stroller, it says, ``Whee, let's do it again.''
$20, ages 2+(1).
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Amy Playmates by Playmates. A computerized doll who
talks. $60, ages 3+.
</P>
<P>
   Looney Tunes Talking Cup &AMP; Bowl Sets by Funomenon. The cup and
bowl are computerized so that as a child uses them, they talk back,
saying things like, ``That was delicious!'' $14, ages 3+.
</P>
<P>
   These toys hook kids on the media, giving them the message that
the media is all-important in the world at a time when they benefit
more from first-hand interactions with people and with objects:
</P>
<P>
   Clue Keeping Blue by Fisher-Price/Tyco. A computerized stuffed
animal based on the TV show. $17, ages 1 1/2+.
</P>
<P>
   Tummy Glow Teletubbies by Playskool. All five Teletubbies, with
glowing, noisemaking pictures in their tummies. $13, 12 months+.
</P>
<P>
   Star Wars Episode I Electronic Board Book by Publications,
Int'l. A board book where pressing a button elicits a noise to
accompany the picture of fighting and guns shooting. $7, 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   These toys focus young girls on their bodies and encourage
inappropriate and stereotypical behavior:
</P>
<P>
   Body Art Activity Case by Colorbok Paper Products. A case with
tattoos, bellybutton and nose rings, and other trinkets. $8, 6+.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme Green Teen Skipper by Mattel. Skipper (Barbie's little
sister) colors her hair green to ``cruise the mall.'' $8, 4+.
</P>
<P>
   These toys emphasize violent, grotesque, and sexual images and
undermine lessons that caring adults teach:
</P>
<P>
   Super Soaker Naboo Pistol by Larami. An air-pressure rifle that
looks like an Uzi. $13, 6+.
</P>
<P>
   WWF (World Wrestling Federation) Action Figures by Jakks and WCW
(World Championship Wrestling) Action Figures by Toy Biz. Based on
real-life wrestlers seen on TV, these action figures include the
severed head of a woman and a toilet to smash the opponent. $7 and
up, ages 4+.
</P>
<P>
   WWF Bangers by Jakks Pacific. Wrestlers made of cloth. When
smashed against a hard object, they say angry, fighting phrases.
The female figure says, ``Do you want a piece of me?'' $7, 4.
</P>
<P>
   Impaled Mummy with piercing action by Toy Island/Universal.
Stick a spear in the hole in the bloodied half skeleton, and watch
as his intestines fall out of the chest. Each figure has a
different horror. $9, 4+.
</P>
<P>
   These toys have scripted play and turn play into ads for
products that young children cognitively can't recognize:
</P>
<P>
   Barbie `Toys R Us' Toy Store by Arco Toys/Mattel. A miniature
collection of Mattel brand-name toys to set up as a Toys R Us store
where Barbie then shops. $15, 3+.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's Birthday Doll Party Kit by Hasbro. Doll and party
items to act out a birthday party at McDonald's. $10, 3.
</P>
<P>
   These take the creativity out of classic toys:
</P>
<P>
   WCW Mold &AMP; Mash Wrestlers Crash Set by Colorbok. Art set with
four wrestler molds and wrestling ring with the motto: ``Rules &AMP;
bones are meant to be broken.'' $8, 6+.
</P>
<P>
   Night at the Movies, Loving Family Series by Fisher Price.
Miniature props create a living room with TV and VCR with mini
videos to insert into the TV (family figures not included).
</P>
<P>
   Rotten Egg Game by Toy Biz. Electronic game records and plays
back each player's name, then yells insults as children throw the
egg to each other. $20, 5+.
</P>
<P>
   These link play to candy:
</P>
<P>
   Jar Jar Binks Monster Mouth by OddzOn/Lucasfilms. Based on a
``Star Wars'' character, the monster mouth opens and its candy
tongue sticks out. Child's mouth goes in Jar Jar's mouth to lick
the tongue. $4, 4.
</P>

foods. $10, 3+.

ABOVE ALL, THE DOT MARKS THE SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent months, the phrase ``dot-com'' has become synonymous
with the very idea of doing business on the Internet. Screaming
headlines tell us that ``dot-com'' _ or if you are very clever,
``.com'' _ is the future of the e-business and the I-economy. To be
dot-com is to be young, hip, involved with high-tech, and making a
killing on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-com is a frenzy being fed by a lot of really strange
advertisements and marketing moves. Last year Sun Microsystems
began advertising itself as ``the dot in dot-com.'' Now Sun is
bringing out a new version of its Solaris Operating System, calling
it ``the .com OS.'' According to the company, the new Solaris ``is
designed for the .com age.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week the computer industry will flock to Las Vegas again
for the Comdex trade show. An advertising campaign currently
running in the computer trade press jokes that perhaps the show
should be renamed ``.COMdex,'' since there is so much emphasis on
the new Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company originally charged with managing the
``com'' domain, Network Solutions Inc., is trying to make the most
of its electronic franchise. Calling itself ``the dot com people,''
the company's new Web site practically begs visitors to register
their own dot-com Web address _ for a price of $70 for the first
two years.
</P>
<P>
   All of this dot-com stuff got its start in the early 1980s. Only
a few hundred computers (we called them ``hosts'') were on the
Internet then. Most had names with dashes in them, such as
``MIT-Multics'' and ``MIT-Eddie.'' The address of each computer on
the network was stored in a file called ``HOSTS.TXT.'' Whenever a
new computer was added to the network, the listing would be added
manually to the file. Naturally, as the network grew, it became
harder to keep this file up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that this centralized repository was doomed, the
network engineers proposed replacing the HOSTS file with a kind of
distributed database. They called this database the domain name
system, since it arranged all the computers on the Net into
categories called domains. Whether these were typed in capital or
lower-case letters didn't matter. The computer MIT-Eddie became the
computer ``eddie'' inside the ``mit'' domain. The ``mit'' domain,
in turn, was put in the ``edu'' domain, with ``edu'' standing for
``educational.'' So Eddie's new, full name became
``eddie.mit.edu.''
</P>
<P>
   The domain name system _ which predates the World Wide Web by
nearly a decade _ works like a big telephone book. When you type
www.boston.com, for example, your computer uses this system to
translate the name into an Internet address made up of four numbers
separated by periods _ in this case, 199.95.74.90. (Eddie's
Internet address happens to be 18.62.0.6.) It's these addresses,
and not the names, that the Internet's underlying systems use to
send messages.
</P>
<P>
   This multilevel system for naming computers on the Internet made
sense in the 1980s, and it makes sense today.
</P>
<P>
   So much for history. The problem with all of this is that the
dot-com explosion has turned the domain name system on its head.
Domain names no longer point to just computers on the Internet;
these days, most domain names point to Web pages. More and more
companies have multiple dot-com names _ one for each product,
perhaps, with a few extra thrown in for frequent misspellings of
product names.
</P>
<P>
   But dot-com is about more than simply doing business on the
Internet. It's really about globalism without global thinking. The
whole idea of dot-com was fundamentally flawed, because there is
one, and only one, ``dot-com'' domain for the entire planet. Back
in the 1980s, this didn't seem like much of a problem for the
Internet's fathers. But it caused a heap of problems in the 1990s,
when multiple companies started fighting over the same dot-com
addresses. And it's left us with a lot of strangeness.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the ``tower.com'' domain. You would think it might
belong to Tower Records, but it actually belongs to Tower Concepts
of Oneida, N.Y., which obtained the domain in December 1992. Tower
Records didn't wake up to the Internet until May 1995, when it
obtained the domain towerrecords.com. More recently, Tower Records
has gone on a domain-buying spree, picking up towerkids.com,
towersale.com, towereurope.com, towerfranchises.com, and
djcrisis.com. (Most of those dot-com addresses don't actually work.
At $70 apiece, I can't imagine that Tower's managers care very
much.)
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot of dot-com action in recent months. Although
Network Solutions once had a monopoly on the .com, .net and .org
domains, you can now sign up with four other companies _ the
Internet Council of Registrars, Melbourne IT, France Telecom, and
Register.com. Theoretically, this should create competition,
ultimately producing lower prices and better service. For example,
if you go through Net Wizards, which is a member of the Council of
Registrars, you can register a domain for bargain-basement $60.
</P>
<P>
   Next year we're likely to see a whole bunch of new top-level
domains, including ``.arts'' for culture and entertainment,
``.firm'' for professional firms, ``.info'' for information
services, ``.nom'' and ``.per'' for personal home pages, ``.rec''
for recreation, and ``.shop'' for online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that more domain names will reduce contention in
the ``.com'' domain. But I'm not sure that these new domains will
work the way that the Internet architects have planned. Certainly
Xerox and Sony won't sit by idly while some upstart grabs names
such as Xerox.firm or Sony.shop. Meanwhile, I can't believe new
companies will be happy being a dot-firm or a dot-shop, when they
could be a dot-com.

TOXIC E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. has had a pretty rough week, and I was planning
to ease up on them. And then along came Bubbleboy.
</P>
<P>
   By now you've heard of this computer virus. If you use
Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5 browser and the company's Outlook
or Outlook Express e-mail programs, Bubbleboy will send a copy of
itself to everybody in your address book. Other than that it's
pretty much harmless. The scary part is the way it works. You get
Bubbleboy by reading an e-mail message. Just display the message on
your screen, and your computer can be infected.
</P>
<P>
   It's not supposed to work this way. And it didn't, until
Microsoft got a little creative, and a little careless.
</P>
<P>
   We all know the drill. Computer programs like viruses are clumps
of binary ``machine language'' which must be run in order to do
anything. Standard e-mail messages are sent as plain text, and so
cannot contain a virus or any other executable programs. So
standard e-mail is safe. E-mail attachments can be dangerous
because they can contain computer programs, including viruses. So
never open an attachment that comes from a stranger _ or at least
run it through a virus scanner first.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I've been writing for years. And it's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Standard e-mail is safe, but many of us don't just use standard
e-mail. For years there have been e-mail programs that allow you to
send and receive messages in HTML, the simple language used to
create Web pages. These mail programs work by having little Web
browsers in them, or by using features from the browser already
installed on your computer. Open the e-mail, and the message window
becomes, in effect, a minibrowser, running the HTML code that's
part of the message.
</P>
<P>
   Browsers don't just run HTML code. They'll also let you run
software written in ``scripting languages'' like Microsoft's Visual
Basic for Applications and Netscape Communications Corp.'s
Javascript. Unlike other computer languages, scripting languages
don't have to be converted into machine language _ they'll run
as-is.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what this means. An e-mail written in HTML can have a
program lurking inside. Open the message and your browser can start
running that program. Actually, this happens all the time. Many of
the fancy features on your favorite Web sites are little Javascript
programs included on the Web page. Your computer downloads the
Javascript, and your browser runs it.
</P>
<P>
   This makes HTML e-mail riskier than traditional plain-text mail,
but nothing to panic about. The computer is supposed to set limits
on what a Javascript or VBA program can do. But it turns out that
IE 5 has a bug that lets malicious VBA scripts run wild.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith, retired founder of Phar Lap Software Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass., told me that the bug has been common knowledge
for months. It was published on Bugtraq, an Internet mailing list
where security experts swap tales of software gone wrong
(www.securityfocus.com). Microsoft promptly issued a repair patch
that plugs it up. But how many people actually download patches?
``They have a patch,'' said Smith. ``Great. Now all we have to do
is get 50 million people to install it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith directed me to the web site of a Bulgarian programmer
who's posted a demonstration of the bug. This version installs a
creepy but harmless bit of code on unprotected machines. Sure
enough, it worked on my computer. That sent me scurrying to
download the patch. Microsoft has made IE 5 browser upgrades dead
easy. Connect to the Internet, click the Tools menu at the top of
the browser and then click Windows Update. You're taken to a Web
site that offers a selection of available upgrades, with the
life-or-death ones at the top. Download and reboot. You can also
download Bubbleboy shields from the leading antivirus software
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith thinks that the creator of Bubbleboy read about the bug
somewhere on the Net and whipped up his virus as an experiment.
Then the parent of Bubbleboy turned in this delinquent child to an
antivirus company, before it did any real damage.
</P>
<P>
   We come away from the Bubbleboy affair with our software intact,
but with a good deal less confidence in the safety of e-mail. In
the old days the stuff was drab but harmless. But add HTML, and
e-mail becomes colorful, memorable _ and occasionally toxic.

<P>
   There is no mystery about what happens to the Patriots when they
lose this year.
</P>
<P>
   They lose the battle along the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   They can't run against a good defense. They can't stop the run
against a decent running game.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL season stats get right to the point.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 AFC teams, including the expansion Cleveland Browns,
the Patriots rank 14th in rushing . . . and, surprise, they're 14th
in trying to stop the run.
</P>
<P>
   The fans and reporters can talk all they want about the
Patriots' coaching whenever the team fails, but that is not the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   So they went for a touchdown with a yard to go in the first
quarter Monday night against the Jets, trailing just 7-0, and
didn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   So they threw the ball with one minute left in the first half,
trailing, 14-3, and the Jets intercepted it and cashed in for a
quick touchdown. That's not the reason the Patriots lost to the
Jets, or the Chiefs or Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   In every one of those games, they've been outhit on both sides
of the line of scrimmage. The other teams just played tougher. The
Patriots are just not a physical team. And football is still a game
of blocking and tackling.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy football types want to make more out of it than that,
but when you want to be one of the best in the NFL, sooner or later
you have to match the opposition physically or go home a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Miami and Buffalo are tougher teams. The Patriots have to try to
win in both of those places the next two weeks, and if they decide
to play ``soft'' like they did Monday night, they'll lose both
games.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the players to take a little inventory and find
out if they have the heart to win the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe is the best quarterback in the game right now. This
is not just the opinion of your humble reporter; every coach who
has faced him this year says the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   When he has time, he just eats up the opposition. Monday night,
he didn't have a chance. The Jets had someone in his face all
night. They knocked him down 12 times. When they backed off after
going ahead, 24-3, Bledsoe got two quick scores. Then the Jets came
charging back, and in the final three possessions, just one
touchdown away from tying the game, the Patriots had a net of minus
1 yard in 11 plays.
</P>
<P>
   The stats show Miami always plays tougher at home. Coach Jimmy
Johnson blistered the team in Buffalo after the Bills embarrassed
his players, 23-3, Sunday. He's been on their backs all week.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be even more difficult for the Patriots to beat
the Bills in Buffalo in two weeks. Their defense is outstanding,
the AFC's most physical.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots lose to both Miami and Buffalo, then chances are
they'll be on the road in the playoffs trying to get to the Super
Bowl as a wild card. That doesn't happen very often. The Patriots
did it in 1985, and that team did it with heart and courage more
than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins assistant head coach Dave Wannstedt said the key to
winning Sunday is to contain the Patriots' passing game. Wannstedt:
``We will play a lot better than we did in Buffalo. That was just
one of those games. Actually, our defense didn't play that bad.
It's just that our offense didn't do much to help us out. Damon
(Huard) was a little nervous in that situation, and we didn't have
a good day on offense. As a team, we are healthy. We know the key
will be to keep Bledsoe and those wide receivers from making big
plays. I watched the Jets game, and I was surprised. The Jets did a
great job on defense. They did a lot of good things. When you can
stop that passing game, you have a good chance at beating the
Patriots.''

VIRTUAL VOICE SPEAKS IN TONGUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Recently I purchased ViaVoice so that I could
dictate my sermons. No matter what I do or say, how slowly or
softly or loudly I try, I keep getting a message that says ViaVoice
cannot understand all of my words.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mumbles
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MUMBLES: I hate to contradict all those nifty TV
commercials that make it seem like everybody can carry on
meaningful conversations with their computers, but it just isn't so
yet. You might as well be talking to your toaster.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-recognition systems _ at least those that normal consumers
can afford _ are novelties that produce accurate results only when
you follow instructions to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the last time you saw a movie where everybody was
speaking with British accents? You didn't have any idea what
anybody was saying until halfway through the film, but you
eventually got used to the goofy voices. The software has to get
used to your voice, too.
</P>
<P>
   All voice programs have some sort of training module, where you
recite pre-defined phrases. The better ones continue to learn
heuristically as you use them or repeat the training sessions. But
even if you've spent days training your program, it's not going to
know what you're saying if you start mumbling or putting emphasis
on the wrong syllables. You must learn to speak in a strong, clear,
bland monotone with no hint of emotion in your voice. Of course,
then you might be mistaken for Al Gore or Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   If that still doesn't work, make sure your hardware is up to
snuff. You generally need more memory and a faster chip than most
packages say you do, but you also need a decent microphone, and you
have to have it positioned the same distance from your mouth every
time you use it.
</P>
<P>
   Your software probably has some sort of utility to fine-tune
microphone settings, but double-check your sound card's recording
capability. You should be able to record a short phrase or two
using Windows' built-in Sound Recorder (it's in Accessories). If
the playback sounds like you're gargling with razor blades, you've
located the problem.
</P>
<P>
   I'd tend to rely on voice software to make notes rather than to
create a finished document. It certainly couldn't be any worse than
my handwriting. If you want to use it to jot down your sermons,
don't be surprised if some Sunday your congregation may think
you're speaking in tongues, but that seems to have worked out
rather well for some of those TV preachers.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I used to be able to type NUMOFF in the
Autoexec.bat file to keep the Num Lock from activating when
booting. This doesn't work with Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   _ Numb Lock
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NUMB: All I want to know is which bonehead thought
everybody in the world wants that stupid numeric keypad on by
default. You can change that in the computer's setup program (oh,
go read the manual) or get a freeware utility to do it each time
you boot. Try a package called JW-Utils at www.zdnet.com/swlib if
you can't find Numoff.com somewhere.

LATEST IN MUSIC COMES OF AGE IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The suits were a sign.
</P>
<P>
   There weren't many of them, to be sure, and they were in the
requisite black. But the fact that anyone at all was wearing one
drew more attention than did the conference goer with magenta hair.
It was unintended _ and sometimes unwelcome _ evidence that both
they and the on-line music industry are maturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, isn't it?'' said Sunjay Guleria, clad in a black
blazer over blue jeans and impossibly hip eyewear. ``I remember
when I used to be one of the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Guleria is 29, hardly ancient by any standard. The exhibit hall
at the three-day extravaganza known as webnoize, put on by the
Stoneham-based company of the same name, was packed with people his
age. More than a few industry veterans have already cracked 30, a
pronouncement often accompanied by a wince. Anyone over 40 was an
obvious minority.
</P>
<P>
   But in an industry as young and as demographically specific as
digital music, youth is relative. It also rules. Among the
conference attendees were teenagers available to explain some of
the latest technologies and recent college graduates congratulating
each other on taking their companies public.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard in the Century Plaza Hotel lobby, one early
twentysomething to another, both wearing yellow-tinted sunglasses
indoors, one with a cell phone headset plugged into his ear: ``Hi.
Nice to meet you. Congratulations on those stock options.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the nearly 1,000 people who had registered for the
conference, which sold out at $895 a ticket, they had come to
Southern California as much to see and to be seen, or to find out
who's up to what in the fast-moving world of digital music, as to
attend panel discussions with titles like ``Virtual Skulls &AMP;
Crossbones: Music Piracy and the Internet'' and ``Staffing for the
Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But upstairs in the lobby bar, and on the patio where spreads of
sushi and fajitas and linguini were set out, the talk was also
about what after-hours concerts and receptions to attend. Microsoft
Corp.'s bowling party was invitation only. Everyone was invited to
hear the group Supreme Beings of Leisure play at Listen.com's West
Hollywood gala. Webnoize may not come close in size or power to
Comdex, the mega-computer conference taking place in Las Vegas this
week, but it was where computer geekiness and cool converged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a level of excitement here; everyone seems pumped,''
said Monty Schmidt, 35, president of Sonic Foundry Media Services.
``You can sense that people know they're on to something.''
</P>
<P>
   That something is the ability to sell music on the Internet,
circumventing the traditional record labels by allowing listeners
to download music directly to their computers and then carry it
with them on portable players. These days, anyone can sell their
music on line, and sometimes it seems everyone is. In the
competitive world of Web sites now aimed at teenage and young adult
listeners, the garage band is god.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh definitely there's going to be a fallout,'' said Matt
Garman, 23, who described himself as Riffage.com's ``e-commerce
wizard,'' then handed over a blue business card with the more
formal title of online commerce manager. ``There aren't enough
bands for all the sites. It's going to be about who can get the
bands, who has enough money to do the marketing, who's the more
artist friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also, according to display after display, about
interaction with the audience. Almost to a web site, each one
claimed a unique feature. Each one claimed that users in effect
control the sites themselves. Still, one claim was indisputable:
the way young people interact with music has less to do with
flipping on the stereo than with becoming a part of the equipment
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bane, a 33-year-old strategic account executive at STV
Streaming Video Solutions, said: ``Absolutely, convergence is where
it's at. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, but we don't
know how long that tunnel is or if there's another tunnel after it.
But we're all racing to be the one to get there first.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Roli Jr., 29, president and publisher of webnoize, which in
part covers the on-line music industry, added: ``The music idustry
is not just the music industry anymore. It's how do you do videos,
how do you do games, how do you get people involved.''
</P>
<P>
   At the mycaster.com booth, for instance, Jason Kay, vice
president of business development, demonstrated a personal
broadcast system that allows users to become virtual disc jockeys,
creating their own radio stations and even airing their own
thoughts over the Internet. Among the stations operating: ``A
Stoned Guy in Texas'' and a group of Australian college students
who have open-mike discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in a private suite, the icast.com senior vice
president, Geoffrey Miller, promised to ``give members the tools to
express themselves creatively way past home pages.'' In
non-Webspeak, that means users will be able to edit their own music
and videos, then share them with the rest of the world once the
entertainment portal launches in January.
</P>
<P>
   The only downside to all the digital downloading appeared to be
that with only so many eyeballs and advertising dollars to go
around, no one is making money at it yet.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't dampen the party.
</P>

CONGRESS'S DOORS OPEN TO WELL-HEELED TECH LOBBY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MARILYN GEEWAX  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With registered lobbyists now outnumbering members
of Congress roughly 40 to one, most of the men and women who get
paid to influence legislation are having a tough time arranging
meetings with powerful lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But for those lucky lobbyists who represent high-flying
high-tech companies generating enormous fortunes, the doors on
Capitol Hill are swinging open and the phone lines are free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is absolutely overwhelmingly interested in working
with us,'' said Steve Papermaster, an Austin, Texas, entrepreneur
and member of the executive council of Technology Network
(TechNet), a political action group founded two years ago in the
Silicon Valley. ``They are opening their doors. In fact, they are
calling us.''
</P>
<P>
   With politicians now so enamored, bills favorable to technology
companies have been speeding through an otherwise listless
Congress. In just little more than the past year, the
Republican-led Congress and Democratic White House have agreed to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Impose a three-year moratorium on taxes on electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit lawsuits against companies involved with Y2K-related
software flaws.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extend copyright protections to material published on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, most members of Congress still thought the Web
was something you took care of by swiping a broom in the corner.
This year, committee hearings lavished attention on the issues of
Internet privacy, encryption, e-mail marketing and more.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists and lawmakers alike say the dramatic change was caused
by one thing: money. Big piles of money on Wall Street. Money back
in the home districts where young people are getting
computer-related jobs. Money in the campaign war chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``More attention is paid to a flourishing industry,'' said Rep.
Steve Horn, R-Calif., a member of the House Internet Caucus. When
an industry has the power to create thousands of jobs in your
state, ``you've got to stay awake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some say legislators are now so responsive that next year,
companies may have the power to mold the laws that will govern the
wired world of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a wonderful window of opportunity where high-tech is
still being seen in a very positive light,'' said Rick White, a
former congressman from Redmond, Wash. Now a lawyer who advises
high-tech companies, including Dell Computer Corp. and Amazon.com,
White said tech titans are so popular today on the Hill that ``they
probably could get Congress to do anything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Papermaster, who also heads TechNet Texas, the Austin-based
branch of TechNet, said this passion for technology spread through
Washington ``like wildfire over the last 12 to 24 months.''
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Americans who began using the Internet years
ago, Congress may seem a little late to the love affair. But no one
working on Capitol Hill seems surprised that lawmakers were among
the last to appreciate the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has always been slow to come to any new technology,''
said Edward Segal, president of Internetlobby.com, a group
representing users of the Internet. ``Electricity was around for
years before Congress put electric lights in the Capitol.'' Even
now, many lawmakers remain reluctant to send e-mail or update their
Web pages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   White, who was elected to the House in 1994 and served two
terms, said Congress's well-deserved reputation as ``an
old-fashioned institution'' initially turned off the Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs, who tended to be young, politically naive and West
Coast-oriented. ``They were clueless about this process'' of making
laws, White said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Clare Fitzgerald, executive director of the Electronic
Commerce Forum, which lobbies for Internet-based companies, agreed
that the physical and psychological distance between the Hill and
the Valley retarded development of relationships between techies
and legislators. ``It's the nature of the California culture to
ignore Washington if possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1998, the wall of indifference began to erode, especially
on the Washington side. The fantastic growth of America Online Inc.
and Internet-focused companies in Fairfax County, Va., made a
profound impression on the lawmakers and staffers who lived nearby,
and wished they could see such job growth to their own districts.
``The Northern Virginia phenomenon has had a big impact'' on
Congress, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators suddenly wanted to meet the wizards who created such
wealth. ``I can get a high-tech CEO in anywhere'' to meet with a
member of Congress, Fitzgerald said. ``I certainly never saw
anything like this when I was working for the banking industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Congress was waking up to the New Economy, entrepreneurs
in the high-tech breeding grounds of Texas, California, Washington,
Massachusetts, Georgia, Colorado and elsewhere were starting to
develop a new appreciation for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   They realized they had problems that Congress could help them
solve.
</P>
<P>
   Shortages of engineers and programmers spurred companies to seek
higher immigration ceilings for highly skilled workers. Companies
focused on electronic commerce began worrying that state and local
governments would impose a patchwork of taxes on Internet
transactions. Federal restrictions on exports of certain
technologies were hurting business.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the example of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft started going through a highly publicized
antitrust case brought by the Justice Department, tech executives
realized Washington could reshape an industry with century-old
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies would look at Microsoft and think, 'That could
happen to me,'' White said. Suddenly, executives knew ``they had to
do a better job of making their case to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, tech companies have been hiring lobbyists
at a furious pace and organizing political networks to make
themselves heard. In fact, the lobbyist buildup is happening so
fast, numbers are hard to nail down.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics, a non-profit research group,
says public documents show spending on lobbying by computer
equipment and services companies shot from $25 million in 1997 to
$39 million in 1998. The 1999 figures are expected to show another
sharp increase in spending.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this ramping up, the high-tech world doesn't yet have a
clear, coordinated lobbying agenda. Indeed, many big, tech-driven
companies, such as Microsoft, AOL and AT&AMP;T, often want very
different things out of Washington. Still, some legislative goals
seem nearly universally supported.
</P>
<P>
   Companies want Congress to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep Internet transactions from being suffocated by a crazy
quilt of state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bolster spending on scientific research and development.
</P>
<P>
   _ Approve electronic signatures to facilitate commerce on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase funding for education.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow more hiring of highly skilled immigrants and boost
exports of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said high-tech companies have an opportunity to push
this agenda in 2000 because most members of Congress are willing to
take advice from entrepreneurs. ``You can count on two hands all of
the people (in Congress) who really understand the high-tech
world,'' she said. ``But you're at a stage that won't last that
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, lawmakers will ``hire the right staffers to close the
information gap,'' she said. Once they feel more confident about
the substance of a debate, legislators may become more argumentive
and less willing to do whatever the high-tech titans tell them to
do. Once that happens, lobbyists may find ``the door will be
closing,'' she said.

A BIGGER THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've finally plowed through the findings of fact in the
Microsoft antitrust case, and it has almost made me want to go out
and buy stock in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates and his crew are exactly the sort of people you'd
want running your own business _ single-minded, relentless, always
ready to pounce on any threat to Microsoft's prospects. If every
software business had executives this sharp, they'd all be living
in $50 million houses.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but what about Microsoft's efforts to crush its rivals?
Well, sure enough, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson makes the case
that Microsoft, in its zeal to stay on top, sometimes crossed the
line and engaged in questionable bullying tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive example is when Microsoft threatened
to stop producing its office software suite for Apple Computer
Inc.'s Macintosh computers, unless Apple agreed to use Internet
Explorer as its primary browser rather than Netscape Communications
Corp.'s Navigator. Keep in mind that Microsoft makes the only
top-of-the-line office suite for the Mac, and earns a lot of money
from it. Still, the company seemed willing to kill it to get a
better grip on Netscape's throat.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty stuff. But perfectly kosher, unless you're a monopoly.
That's why Microsoft was so desperate to prove otherwise. Jackson
wasn't having any. He ruled, sensibly enough, that Microsoft holds
a monopoly on operating systems for machines that use
Intel-compatible processors.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Apple holds a monopoly on operating systems for
computers using Motorola PowerPC processors. And Apple has at times
been just as aggressive in protecting that monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Apple, bleeding cash and desperate for retail sales,
stopped other computer firms from making Macintosh clones. Apple
also put the kibosh on the Common Hardware Reference Platform, a
system that would have allowed PowerPC computers to run Windows NT
and the Mac OS. Apple thus prevented a flood of cheap Mac
knockoffs, which would have forced the firm to slash its
notoriously high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Apple interim chief executive Steve Jobs wasn't hauled into
court, perhaps because, if he hadn't made these moves, Apple would
probably be dead today. But what about now, with Apple's stock at
record highs and the profits rolling in? You could dramatically
enhance industry competition by forcing Apple to license its
operating system to all comers. Within a year, Macs would be as
cheap as PCs and almost as common. Come to think of it, Apple's
failure to license its operating system hurts consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, you can make a case that Apple's policies are more
harmful than Microsoft's. At the end of Jackson's 200-page
document, he offers just three measly paragraphs explaining how
Microsoft's actions hurt you and me. For instance, Jackson says
that Microsoft's adding its browser to the Windows 98 operating
system hurts consumers because, well, doggone it, some consumers
don't want browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Such shabby reasoning is a blemish on an otherwise well-written
document. But this feeble addendum has to be there to justify the
Draconian remedies I think the judge would like to impose. He
plainly can't stand Microsoft, which has behaved throughout this
case with unseemly and foolish arrogance. Now it's payback time.
Longtime Microsoft haters are calling for a breakup of the company,
and maybe Jackson will give it to them.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe he'll notice the upsurge over the past two
years in rivals to Windows, particularly the operating system
Linux. Jackson is right to note that Linux is still a minor threat
to Microsoft. But ever since the trial began, Microsoft hasn't
dared twisting the arms of computer makers, with the result that
most major PC firms will now sell you a box with Linux instead of
Windows. That's real progress, made possible by self-imposed limits
on Microsoft's bully-boy tactics. Such limits should be enshrined
in a nice simple consent decree, and the lawyers then sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's competitors will say that this won't break the
company's power. They're right. So what? It's the abuse of such
power that should concern the government. With its baser impulses
in check, Microsoft will remain just about as fearsome and tough to
beat as ever. And rival software execs will have to settle for
living in $10 million mansions.

ADVERTISING: HITCHING WEB SITES TO A STAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember Carl Sagan's singsong declarations about space being
filled with ``billions and billions'' of stars? Cyberspace is now
becoming filled with stars too, as a lengthening list of dot-com
marketers center their advertising on celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Famous faces and voices are peddling Web sites,
electronic-commerce companies, PCs, search engines and e-tailers _
almost anything interactive- or Internet-related. They range from
immediately recognizable (Donald Trump) to nostalgic favorites
(Barry White) to hip semi-celebrities (the singer Seal).
</P>
<P>
   The trend is not unexpected if dot-com advertising is considered
to be mimicking the model established by pitches for traditional
products like packaged goods.
</P>
<P>
   The initial phase is to inculcate the name, usually by
repetition and spelling: ``Remember, that's
w-w-w-dot-beauteesoap-dot-com. And don't forget, `beautee' has
three E's.'' Then comes the phase of differentiating one brand from
another, particularly in categories where the participants are
proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   And what better way to try doing that than renting some star
power, a device known as borrowed interest? If Amos and Andy could
make Americans brush with Pepsodent toothpaste, and Ozzie and
Harriet make them snap pictures with Kodak film, why can't Sophia
Loren make shopping at www.giftcertificates.com chic and Dr. Joyce
Brothers make buying computers at www.cozone.com seem like a
no-brainer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are inundated with dot-com this and dot-com that,''
said Joseph Park, chief executive at Kozmo.com in New York, a
company specializing in so-called urban delivery services. ``One of
the key challenges is to build credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A celebrity subconsciously brings credibility and legitimacy
to whatever claims are being made,'' he added. A humorous
television commercial for Kozmo.com by DiMassimo Brand Advertising
in New York presents Lee Majors as a contemporary version of Steve
Austin, the character he played on ``The Six Million Dollar Man''
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dot-coms are using celebrities to bring the familiar to the
world of the unknown,'' said Kathy Delaney, partner and executive
creative director at Deutsch Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these dot-com companies are brand-spanking-new,'' she
added. ``The celebrities lend immediate recognizability.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch is introducing a television and print campaign for the
Encyclopedia Britannica Web site (www.britannica.com) that features
Seal, Ms. Taylor, Norman Mailer, Anjelica Huston and Francis Ford
Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities are brands, and their brands can drive brands,''
said Richard Kirshenbaum, co-chairman at Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP;
Partners in New York, an agency with many dot-com clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest thing is the merging of commerce and entertainment
to create content that consumers remember,'' he added. ``So if
content equals entertainment and celebrities equal entertainment,
therefore content equals celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, the stars have an obvious link to the
dot-coms they promote. For example, a campaign for
Barnesandnoble.com presents authors and entertainers whose books
and compact discs are sold at its Web site (www.bn.com). In
addition to White, the husky-voiced singer, they include the
mystery writer Sue Grafton, the law novelist Scott Turow and the
chef-turned-scribe Emeril Lagasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not using a spokesperson who may or may not like the
product,'' said Carl Rosendorf, senior vice president at
Barnesandnoble.com in New York. ``Our spokespeople are the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relevance of the person is most important here,'' he
added. ``At the same time, we're giving the buying-online process
some personality and style.'' The campaign is created by the New
York office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of
the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the celebrities are relevant to where we're spending
most of our money,'' said Len Short, executive vice president for
advertising and brand management at Charles Schwab in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Because Schwab ``bought time in some key sports properties,'' he
added, the brokerage firm's commercials include the football
players Jason Sehorn and Shannon Sharpe and the tennis players Mary
Joe Fernandez and Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   ``The celebrities put us in the event,'' Short said, ``but the
point isn't celebrities. It's that we show them to be surprisingly
intelligent about investing'' _ because they are Schwab customers,
natch. The Schwab spots are created by BBDO New York, part of the
BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to get a celebrity for celebrity's sake may bring a bit
of attention to a brand, but it does little or nothing for the
brand in the long term,'' said Ted Sann, co-chief executive and
chief creative officer at BBDO New York, which is known for
star-infused campaigns for Pepsico Inc. brands like Frito-Lay
snacks and Pepsi-Cola soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly the same as for general brand advertising,'' he
added. ``There has to be a brand positioning before you hire a
celebrity, which the celebrity has to fit. That was the case with
Cindy Crawford and Ray Charles and Michael J. Fox for Pepsi and
Diet Pepsi.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   How then does Ms. Loren fit with Giftcertificates.com?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a media environment that's so cluttered, especially this
season, you've got to hit as hard as you can,'' said Mark Paviluk,
vice president and group management supervisor on the company's
account at Grey Advertising in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what could be more impactful than the most beautiful woman
in the world, who appeals to everyone from the housewife in Des
Moines to the Chanel shopper in Manhattan?'' he asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   For Cozone.com, a unit of CompUSA, a campaign features Trump,
Dr. Brothers and the basketball star David Robinson, all depicted
as fish out of water: Trump, for example, taking a pottery class,
and Ms. Brothers on a turkey shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities often get used too much in advertising,'' said
Edward Boches, chief creative officer at the Cozone.com agency,
Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass., part of the Lowe Group unit of
Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea here is that just because the celebrity is good at
one thing, it doesn't necessarily mean he or she is good at other
things, like buying computers,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, sometimes stars are part of campaigns because they are
stakeholders in the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopi Goldberg, for instance, is a part owner in a
gift-certificate Web site, Flooz.com, so she appears in the
advertising by Hanft Byrne Raboy &AMP; Partners in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And members of the NFL Quarterback Club _ present and past
players like Bernie Kosar of the Cleveland Browns, Warren Moon of
the Kansas City Chiefs and Ricky Williams of the New Orleans Saints
_ will be featured in a campaign by Organic in New York for Pseudo
Programs, an Internet broadcaster that uses streaming media on a
Web site (www.pseudo.com). Pseudo has scheduled a live show on the
site at 11 a.m. (Eastern time) Tuesday to promote its coming QB
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an endorsement deal,'' said Jeanne Meyer, senior
vice president for marketing at Pseudo in New York. ``The
Quarterback Club is making a cash investment and Bernie Kosar is
joining our board of directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. That's another trend, executives who appear in
ads for the companies they own.

WHO'LL RULE CYBERSPACE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
CODE AND OTHER LAWS OF CYBERSPACE 
By Lawrence Lessig 
Basic Books, 240 pages, $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two kinds of code regulate the Internet, Harvard Law School
professor Lawrence Lessig writes in his first book, ``Code and
Other Laws of Cyberspace.'' The first is embodied in computer
programs. This is the actual code that creates Web browsers, Web
servers, e-mail systems, and the rest of the Internet
infrastructure. Lessig calls this ``West Coast Code,'' because it
is written primarily on the West Coast of the United States in such
places as Silicon Valley and Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The second code, says Lessig, is one made up by lawmakers and
regulators in countries where the Internet's computers reside. Not
surprisingly, Lessig calls this ``East Coast Code,'' since much of
the drafting takes place in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's distinction between East and West is sure to ruffle
feathers at MIT and Bell Labs, two great East Coast institutions
that have been at the forefront of Lessig's so-called West Coast
Code revolution. Nevertheless, the idea of dividing regulation into
that which is accomplished by computer programs and that which is
accomplished by law is a useful tool for those thinking about the
nature of today's Internet and possible futures.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet is weakly regulated today, Lessig argues,
it is sure to be well-regulated in the future. The primary reason
for this push is electronic commerce. Many businesses rightly see
the Internet as the ultimate tool for selling products, reaching
new customers, and cutting the cost of distribution and support.
</P>
<P>
   But they also see the Internet as a threat _ a place where
customers can distribute stolen trade secrets, download pirated
software, and even post attacks on corporations. Their reaction to
these perceptions, says Lessig, will be to gradually remake
cyberspace into a place more friendly to selling things and less
friendly to individuals trying to act on their own.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of examples that support Lessig's thesis. One
is the creeping use of unique personal identifiers, or serial
numbers, on the Internet. Intel put a unique Processor Serial
Number into each Pentium III microprocessor; Microsoft puts a
unique Globally Unique Identifier into every document created by
Microsoft Word; and Real Networks puts a GUID into its Real Audio
Jukebox program. All these were designed to make it easier to track
computers and people on the Internet. They produce accountability
and destroy anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There are other, more subtle ways corporations are regulating
the future of our information space. Consider America Online, which
tens of millions of Americans use to access the Internet. America
Online is a world with particular rules. These rules aren't handed
down by God or Congress. Instead, they are created by AOL's
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   One rule in the world of AOL has to do with public assembly.
AOL's president, Steve Case, can send an e-mail message to every
AOL subscriber. But all others on the AOL system are denied this
right. On other Internet chat services dozens or hundreds of people
can interact at the same time. But AOL's chat rooms are limited to
fewer than 30 people. AOL likes to think of itself as an electronic
town, but it's different than most towns, because none of the
citizens can vote. And it's a town where members will find it very
hard to organize to effect social change.
</P>
<P>
   All this wouldn't matter so much if the Internet were not
already an important part of our economy, and likely to become more
so. The future of the Internet is the future of our world. If we
make the Internet a highly regulated space where anonymity is an
illusion and voting is nonexistent, this can't help but have an
impact on the future of our real-space world.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, Lessig says it's time for East Coast Code to
start exerting more control over West Coast Code. Decisions are
being made that affect the future of the Internet and, by
extension, the future of the world. Do we want these decisions
being made by programmers and product managers, or by an open,
political process?
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's argument is sure to stir controversy. These days the
computer industry's predominant request to government is
laissez-faire. And indeed, says Lessig, the initial attempts of the
US government to regulate cyberspace haven't been too successful.
The Communications Decency Act of 1996 was attacked by
technologists and civil libertarians and ultimately struck down by
the US Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the Clinton administration asked the Internet's
Engineering Task Force to build provisions for wiretapping into the
very TCP/IP protocols _ the West Coast Code _ that drive the
Internet. So far the IETF has refused, arguing such perversions of
its code will make the Internet less secure, and ultimately won't
do much to help law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But Lessig reminds us that the alternative to no regulation by
government is, instead, regulation by corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand on the edge of an era that demands we make
fundamental choices about what life in this space, and therefore
life in real-space, will be like,'' he writes. ``These choices will
be made; there is no nature here to discover. And when they are
made, the values we hold sacred will either influence our choices
or be ignored.'' Lessig doesn't think government today is up to the
task. But he hopes it may one day take its rightful place.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's bias is obviously liberal, not libertarian. But even if
you disagree with his politics, there are still a lot of stories
and history that make this book an easy recommendation. ``Code and
Other Laws of Cyberspace'' does a fabulous job pulling together the
most important issues facing the Internet, from wiretapping and
intellectual property protection to the battle between Microsoft
and Linux. And with a wonderfully conversational style, the book is
understandable by both non-lawyers and non-programmers _ an
impressive feat by itself.

SEPARATELY, STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICALS WEIGH OPTIONS ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sometime in the next two or three months, a diverse
alliance of state and federal officials _ some elected, some
appointed, some Democrats, some Republicans _ must reach agreement
on one of the thorniest public policy issues of the day: What to do
with Microsoft Corp. if, as expected, a federal judge finds the
company guilty of violating the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most optimistic among them, Iowa Attorney General Tom
Miller, places the odds that all of them will agree at only
``something better than 50-50.'' After taking a back seat to the
Justice Department for most of the trial, some attorneys general
for the 19 states that are co-plaintiffs in the case may no longer
be content to let the federal lawyers drive the case solo through
the remedies stage.
</P>
<P>
   With the publication of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's
exhaustive findings of fact on Nov. 5, a guilty verdict on at least
some of the counts seems inevitable. And the judge published a
schedule making it clear that he would hold a separate proceeding
of some sort to establish a remedy, which could range from forcing
Microsoft to rewrite some of its contracts to breaking up the
company.
</P>
<P>
   To get ready for that, the Justice Department and the attorneys
general are deliberating and investigating their options. While the
partner-plaintiffs have said they agree that the remedy must deal
in some way with the Windows operating system monopoly, there are
many paths that might achieve that goal. And while they are talking
to one another, they are operating on two wholly separate but
parallel tracks.
</P>
<P>
   If in the end, the Justice Department and the attorneys general
do not agree, most likely they will give the judge different,
possibly conflicting recommendations for a remedy _ hardly the most
effective way to present their case.
</P>
<P>
   For the states, the effort to reach consensus is complex.
Nineteen attorneys general are equal partners in the states' suit,
which was filed at the same time as the federal suit and combined
with it for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general are elected officials with the same pressures
and ambitions as any other pubic-office holder. And among the 19
are representatives of both major political parties and most every
possible political viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's a diverse group,'' said Miller, who is
directing the effort at devising a recommendation. ``But consensus
is important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller holds a conference call every Monday with some of the
other attorneys general or their assistants to discuss developments
in the Microsoft case. Most of the discussion in the last few weeks
has involved remedy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the states have hired their own academic
consultants, ``and we talk to a fairly wide range of people
representing the best thinking we can find,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, he added, is for the states that participate in the
calls to try to reach a consensus on a remedy sometime early next
year. The judge's verdict is expected in February, with a remedy
proceeding shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can reach a consensus,'' Miller said, ``we will take it
to the other attorney generals'' for a group discussion and vote.
That is the first hurdle, the one Miller said holds just better
than 50-50 odds for success.
</P>
<P>
   The next goal will be to take the states' recommendation to the
Justice Department to see if it can be made to work with the
federal government's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said, ``it's important that we not get in an adversarial
position with the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be easy. Some of the attorneys general and their
aides, while grateful for the effective prosecution of the case,
say they no longer want to take a subordinate role to the Justice
Department and David Boies, the department's lead trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more tension between the states and Justice on
remedies than there was during the trial,'' said a senior aide to
one of the attorneys general. ``During the trial, we were mostly
just passengers, but now there are two different trains running on
parallel tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa College
of Law who is advising the states, said be believed that the
attorneys generals generally face political pressures ``to propose
something different from what the federal government does.
Otherwise they will seem superfluos.'' He said those pressures may
surface in this case, too.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the states have the power to request
monetary damages on behalf of their citizens, something the Justice
Department cannot do. Some attorneys general have said they intend
to use that power.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he often speaks informally with Joel Klein, head of
the antitrust division, and other department officials. But he
insisted that in those calls he cannot speak for the other
attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   For the Justice Department, reaching a conclusion on a remedy
recommendation is made difficult principally because the issue is
complex. Every proposed remedy has its own significant attributes
and liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The department has been soliciting opinions from academics and
other anti-trust experts for more than a year. Timothy F.
Bresnahan, an economics professor at Stanford University, took a
leave from his job this summer to join the Justice Department staff
and help devise a remedy proposal.
</P>
<P>
   While still at Stanford, he solicited opinions and analyses on
remedy proposals from other economists and antitrust experts. The
inquiry had to remain informal because any organized effort would
run afoul of federal rules governing the establishment of advisory
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Now a small group of senior Justice Department officials is
studying these opinions and others, weighing their options. Before
making a decision, officials said, the White House will probably
want to be involved, since the recommendation is a major policy
decision, not a law enforcement matter. Until now, administration
officials said, White House officials have had no involvement in
the Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the end, the states and the federal government cannot
agree, the two plaintiffs will probably submit separate
recommendations to the judge. Trying to put the best face on that
possibility, Miller said: ``That wouldn't necessarily be bad. Maybe
our side will get two shots at it while Microsoft gets only one.''

SCOOP LEAVES VERMONT JOURNALIST JOBLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Oct. 4, Terry Allen, a freelancer and part-timer for a
Vermont newspaper, scored a journalistic coup. A front-page piece
she wrote for that day's Boston Globe revealed that Indonesian
students at Norwich University _ a private military college in
Northfield, Vt. _ had links to the Indonesian Army's feared special
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The story _ which Allen says her newspaper declined to publish
before she took it to the Globe _ made serious waves, coming in the
wake of the bloodshed in East Timor and the White House's decision
to end military cooperation with Indonesia. It brought political
heat down on Norwich, was picked up by everyone from the Associated
Press to CNN, and motivated several senators to express their
concern directly to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Allen says she was suddenly fired
from her part-time job as wire editor and layout person for the
company that publishes the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus, the
Rutland Herald, and a Sunday paper. She says Times Argus managing
editor Scott Fletcher told her that she couldn't be trusted. ``I
don't know why I was let go,'' she says. ``They have no reason, I
know of, to distrust me.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's departure raises disturbing questions. Was she, with her
well-known liberal politics, seen as too advocacy-oriented by her
editors? Did she pay a price for ruffling the feathers of a local
institution to which her publisher has financial and advisory ties?
Was her real sin breaking a controversial story? Her bosses simply
aren't saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to give you a big fat no comment,'' says Sunday
editor Dirk Van Susteren. ``We just don't comment on this
publicly,'' adds publisher R. John Mitchell. Fletcher, who even
declines to confirm that Allen was fired, characterizes her as a
former part-timer ``we don't use anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that no one from our organization can give
you our version of events,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   One party that didn't remain silent was Norwich, which moved
quickly to counter Allen's story. Even before it was published,
school president Richard Schneider sent a letter to Allen _ with
copies to Fletcher and Van Susteren _ accusing her of
unprofessionalism and expressing concern over ``the potential
appearance of bias on your part.'' (In another strange twist to
this tale, Schneider later wrote to Allen acknowledging that he had
been incorrect in some of his criticisms of her work.)
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the Oct. 4 story, both the Rutland Herald
and Burlington Free Press editorialized on behalf of the school,
arguing that the university could actually exert a positive
influence on the Indonesian students. Schneider said much the same
thing in an Oct. 14 op-ed piece in the Times Argus, and Norwich
also placed ads in the Free Press and Argus, characterizing the
idea of rejecting the Indonesian students as ``discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider was unavailable for comment. But Norwich spokesman Tom
Greene says Allen ``seemed particularly concerned with making a
case against Norwich, which led her to report selectively . . . I
think her passion for the subject should have been a reason for her
to pull off the story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an agenda in that story,'' responds Allen, who accuses
Norwich of spreading ``misinformation about me . . . My agenda is
that it was a great story. There were times I have been very
politically active in my life . . . in this case, I was at least 98
percent a journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's Oct. 4 story did include two incorrect first names and a
wrong dateline. But when asked about any major accuracy problems in
the piece, Greene said, ``selectively reported, yes. Factually
inaccurate, no . . . The story's fair game, but it's a question of
slant on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gareth Cook, the Globe's New England editor who handled the
story, said Greene complained that it ``was written with an agenda
(but) no one challenged the accuracy.'' After the Oct. 4 piece,
Allen also produced an Oct. 7 Globe follow-up reflecting Capitol
Hill opposition to the Norwich progam. And on Oct. 10, the Sunday
paper that Allen had worked for ran a follow-up piece she wrote on
the controversy _ catching up to a story that Allen says Fletcher
had rejected in the first place because it wasn't news.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking in the background here is Mitchell's connection to
Norwich. He is a member of the school's board of fellows, which
Greene characterizes as ``an advisory group (with) no formal
authority.'' He is also a Norwich donor, although he won't mention
a dollar figure. ``I know we're supposed to be pure,'' says
Mitchell, adding that ``I don't get involved in day-to-day decisons
about how the paper is run.'' Several sources concur, saying
Mitchell is the kind of hands-off publisher who separates his own
interests from the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   So, why was Terry Allen dismissed right after producing the kind
of story most editors dream about? ``I wasn't let go because I was
unethical,'' she says. ``I was not inaccurate. I was not
insubordinate. I was not unprofessional in my behavior.'' There may
be an answer. But for now, it's very tempting to believe that Terry
Allen didn't deserve her fate.

UNWITTING HERO VS. NET CLODS

 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody wants a piece of Mahir Cagri.
</P>
<P>
   There's the designer in Dallas who is showing movies featuring
Cagri on his Web site and who plans to sell T-shirts and ads soon.
There's the guy in Toronto who designed the Mahir Cagri Ping-Pong
game who readily admits he's driven by ``shameless
self-promotion.'' There's the guy in England hawking Mahir coffee
mugs and mouse pads who claims that the proceeds will go to the Red
Cross in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the columnists sending frantic e-mail to the
overnight cultural icon, assembling pathetically urgent missives
from a dogeared Berlitz phrasebook: ``Merhaba. I am gazeteci. I
want bilmek. Lutfen.'' (``Hello. I am journalist. I want speak.
Please.'')
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Cagri ignored that poignant plea.
</P>
<P>
   For folks who haven't been on line recently, Cagri is reportedly
an ordinary Turkish fellow who awoke one day to find himself an
Internet superstar, the central character in a Kafkaesque tale. The
story goes something like this: About a year ago, Cagri set up a
home page describing his hobbies and interests in fractured
English. Apparently, someone in Turkey doctored the page (which
began ``I kiss you!!!!!''), adding such sentiments as ``I like
sex'' and ``I like to take foto-camera . . . nice nude models and
peoples.'' That page found its way to Netizens at the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, who circulated the Web address
to colleagues worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Cagri was bombarded with e-mail and phone calls and
requests for interviews (``Lutfen!!''). Parodies sprouted all over,
with one page substituting President Clinton for the Turkish
lothario and another combining images of Cagri with the infamous
(and annoying) Hamster Dance. Cagri found himself on the front page
of the Turkish dailies, proving he exists.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually posted his own explanation of the purloined page
with an impassioned appeal for racial and religious tolerance.
``Everthing is for peace, friendship, huminity and love,'' he
wrote. ``As a world's citizen, I love all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the earnest world citizen's page was inspiring
parodies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And in the twisted and complex spirit of the Internet, some
folks were having good-natured fun with the existential hero of the
moment while others were trying to make a quick buck or garner good
PR. The original site was posted on Xoom.com, an on-line community
that offers free home pages. ``We tried to send him a digital
camera so he can use his Xoom membership,'' says Stacey Irvine,
senior director at Xoom. She skirted questions about the identity
of the person who posted the first phony page, answering every
query with a pitch for Xoom.
</P>
<P>
   By now, it doesn't matter how much of the story is true, since
Cagri doesn't own his identity any more. He's part Peter Sellers in
``Being There,'' part Jamaican bobsled team, and part Eddie Edwards
(the British ski jumper whose ineptitude brought instant fame).
He's the guy who makes us all feel a little bit superior because
he's so touchingly naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something deeply endearing about the combination of
earnestness and cheesiness,'' says Jacob Park, a specialist at the
Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights in New York, who runs a site
called Mahir Central. ``Most people think he's charming and cute,
but certainly there were snide comments from people who say, `He
can't speak English good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There is an element of imperialism to all the parodies: None of
this would be funny if it weren't assumed that English is the
language of cyberspace. Just who is making fun of whom?
</P>
<P>
   Park has many human-rights colleagues in Turkey, and he says
that the phrase ``I kiss you'' is the Turkish equivalent of ``Hi''
or ``Ciao.'' By the way, Park now signs his e-mails with kisses,
too.
</P>
<P>
   So do the rest of the Mahir maniacs _ profiteers and fans alike.
Michael Simpson created an interactive game that uses Mahir's head
as a torpedo. So much for Cagri's message of peace. ``There isn't
anything productive or virtuous about it,'' says Simpson, a Web
content developer who lives in Toronto. ``It's a way of shamelessly
promoting myself, like spray-painting your name on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Stachowski, a Web designer in Dallas, is obsessed with the
cult hero, but he also wouldn't mind making a little money off his
Web page, which features animated movies starring Cagri. He is
selling ads on the page and says T-shirts will be available soon.
``I've gotten a couple of leads, but nothing serious,'' he says. So
why has he been spending so much time on the craze? He pauses, as
if in disbelief. ``Because,'' he says, exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that explains it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cagri promises to post another update to the page in
the next few days. According to on-line reports, he has asked CNN
to pay him $50,000 for an interview, but a CNN spokesperson said
those reports were false. ``He never asked to be paid,'' the
spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cagri comes out looking classier than the folks who are
having so much fun with his image and Mediterranean stereotypes. He
seems to lack the cynicism of most opportunists: If he were in
Hollywood, he would already have ``peoples,'' from agents to
publicists to personal assistants. And he'd be sure to have a movie
deal and a book contract.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, he's not answering e-mails from unsophisticated
scribes who contact him in fractured Turk-glish. ``I want bilmek.
Lutfen.'' Maybe we should have tried, ``I kiss you. Ciao.''
</P>

NEVER BUILD A CLOSET IN THE BASEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband built a cedar closet in the basement. He painted
the concrete walls to help keep moisture out, put plastic behind
the wood walls, and lined them with pressed board under a cedar
overlay. The odor of cedar and glue is awful. I can't use our
clothes; they are too smelly. What can we do now?
</P>
<P>
   J.F., Millis, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. For starters, a clothes closet should not be built in the
basement; it is virtually impossible to seal the closet against
moisture, especially the passage of water vapor up through the
concrete floor.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is unlikely that you can seal out all moisture, I
suggest the following, unless you move the closet upstairs: If
there is a window in one of the walls, keep it open for
ventilation, particularly important in summer. Use a dehumidifier
in the dog-day months of July and August, when humidity peaks.
Ventilation is less important in winter. If there are no windows,
make some in the band joist above the foundation wall.
</P>
<P>
   And get rid of that pressed board, since the cedar is
ineffective and the glue is probably formaldehyde, which smells to
high heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Build a regular wall with insulation and plasterboard finish;
then line the walls _ or one or two of them, anyway _ with cedar
liner boards; they should not be overwhelming. Besides, cedar is
only a deterrent to moths; it does not kill them or their larvae.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You wrote recently that when a washing machine is on the
second floor, you need to install a tray underneath to catch any
water in case of a broken hose or an overflowing machine. Where can
I get one of those trays?
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP MANN, Ayer, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think they are made, although you could have one
fabricated by a metal worker. I mentioned a tray because the reader
was concerned about runaway water. And, to be safe, that tray
should have a drain leading to another drain on the first floor or
basement.
</P>
<P>
   All this means is that a tray will allay any concerns about
water damage, but is not necessary. You do take a chance of the
machine overflowing, and that could be critical if it overflows
when it is filling, because it is never likely to stop. But chances
are very low that this will happen. To keep hoses from bursting,
install a one-handle shutoff to them, so you can turn them on when
using the machine and off when not. This saves wear and tear on the
hose and reduces the chance of a burst. Finally, use steel-clad
hoses that are very resistant to bursting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having some of my rotted exterior windowsills replaced
with new ones. They look pretty good, but some of the sills look a
little far out, sticking out a bit over the wall. The installer
said that is how a sill should be. How far should they stick out?
</P>
<P>
   JULIA BALAS, Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Standard stickout or overhang is 1 1/2 inches; a little more
is OK, but you don't want it much less, because the sill acts as a
drip edge, allowing water to drip beyond the wall. Not enough of an
overhang will result in water running under the sill and down the
wall, and perhaps into it. You'll notice a small groove on the
underside of the sill; that is to prevent water from percolating
under the sill to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel the sill is sticking out too far, you can always cut
1/4 inch from the face of it, but I really don't think this will be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wall-hung Vent Away toilet leaked from a crack. I have to
replace it, but this type is no longer made, and, so far, I have
been unable to find a substitute. I cannot put in a regular
floor-mounted toilet. Where can I find a wall-mounted toilet?
</P>
<P>
   DOROTHY COLBERT, Tuftonboro, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. You may have to go to a big city for such a toilet, but they
do exist. Call Watertown Plumbing &AMP; Heating Supply, 617-924-2840.
They have one of the biggest plumbing inventories this handyman has
ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The mounting box for my ceiling fan is too low for the fan to
fit properly against the ceiling. It would be a big hassle moving
the box farther into the ceiling. How can I make the bell mounting
of the ceiling fan, the part that is supposed to fit snugly against
the ceiling, do so?
</P>
<P>
   SCOT LEHIGH, Charlestown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Don't bring the box up (it would, indeed, be a hassle), so
bring the ceiling down. Not the entire ceiling, of course, but you
can devise a wood medallion that would sit against the ceiling;
then the bell will fit snugly against it. You might be able to find
a plastic medallion; if not, make a round or square one of wood,
bevel the edges, and create something decorative as well as useful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sorry about that, but an incorrect phone number was given for
the Mirage Rolling Screen Door mentioned in a recent Handyman
column. The manufacturer no longer has a phone listing, and its 800
number has been assigned elsewhere. The handyman tried to track
down the company from the dusty brochure in his files, but without
success.
</P>

GROWING FROM GAME BOYS TO MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jason Bilsky was in his early teens and living in Orlando,
he came home from school in the afternoon, plopped a cartridge into
his clunky Atari 2600 video-game console, and hunkered down with
Space Invaders. Now 29, he comes home from work in the evening,
slips a CD into his sleek Sony Playstation and kicks back with
Metal Gear Solid.
</P>
<P>
   The difference? Sixteen years. That's about it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we've gone from paddle games to games that play like
Hollywood movies. But video-game consoles _ those boxes that
connect to your TV, as opposed to games you play on your computer _
are still seen as a bratty nephew within the showbiz family despite
their phenomenal success. Pop quiz: which did more business during
its first 24 hours in the marketplace, Sega's new Dreamcast console
or the movie ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace''?
Surprise answer: Dreamcast, by a score of $97.9 million to $28.5
million. Yet we still tend to consign console games to the
toys-for-teens dustbins of our minds, hauling them out only to flay
them for being too violent, addictive, sexual, and/or mind-numbing.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever you think of these games, don't think of them as
solely child's play. A lot of former game boys, like Bilsky, have
grown up to become game guys. Today, they're surfing a wave of
current and near-future technology as they battle virtual villains,
score digital touchdowns, and spin the tires of code-generated
racing cars. According to the Interactive Digital Software
Association, 54 percent of the primary users of console games are
ages 18 and over. The Yankee Group, a Boston research firm, puts
the figure at a more conservative 40 percent. Either way, teens and
preteens are clearly not the only ones who got game.
</P>
<P>
   For Bilsky, there's only one drawback to being something of a
video game elder. ``It does feel kind of weird to go into a video
store and see that I'm older than anyone except the parents who've
brought their kids,'' muses the computer graphics designer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, these relative old fogeys tend to have, you know, like
jobs. Families. Responsibilities. Frederick Baker, a 36-year-old
Coast Guard avionicsman who repairs and flies fixed-wing aircraft
at Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod, has a wife and a
3-year-old son. He also has a stash of four consoles, plus a
hand-held model, the better to settle down with the likes of
Wipeout, Roll Cage, and Future Cop: LAPD. Of the last game, Baker
says, sounding a bit sheepish, ``Basically, you're a cop who
controls a vehicle that transforms from a Mack, and you're putting
down bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baker, a onetime board gamer, can also wax enthusiastic
about the creative graphics of today's games, about the challenge
of mastering them, and about the the sheer thrill of putting, say,
a futuristic if virtual race car through its paces. ``Sometimes he
just plays for hours and hours,'' reports his wife, Jennifer, her
voice sounding as if she is at the midpoint between amazement and
resignation. (Women are outnumbered by men in the console game
universe by a 2-to-1 margin, according to IDSA.)
</P>
<P>
   What those of us who view these games as simply teen
time-fillers don't realize is that their history in the home goes
back more than a generation. It started in 1972 with the Magnavox
Odyssey: paddle hockey, black and white image, no sound. The years
that followed produced a roller coaster of downs (goodbye
Colecovision) and ups (hello Sonic the Hedgehog). They also created
a generation of vidkids who grew up with their hands firmly locked
around a joystick down at the local arcade or in the family den.
These white-knuckle digital pilots ascended from the 8-bit era to
the 16-bit, eventually witnessing the dawn of Sega and Nintendo
during the 1980s. In the '90s, as they've become adults, they've
latched onto Sony's 32-bit Playstation, Nintendo 64, and now Sega's
128-bit Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Laskowski, a 33-year-old administrative director of a
company that owns four McDonald's restaurants, started vidoeogaming
back in the Pong Era. Pong was a simple but semi-addictive arcade
paddle game that burst forth in 1972 and eventually made its way
into homes. ``I played games every day during my teenage years,''
recalls Laskowski, who lives with his wife and two young sons in
Woonsocket, R.I. ``When the excitement waned, a hot new game would
come out and refire my interest. I always wanted something bigger
and I always wanted something better.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawkowski was typical. He moved onward through a series of
gaming gear, from Atari to Mattel to Nintendo. As happened to many
of ancient and honorable gamers, however, the fire cooled while he
tended to the business of becoming an adult. But today he runs two
contemporary machines in his home, a Nintendo 64 and a Dreamcast,
pumping out football, wrestling, and shooter games at will. ``As a
kid,'' he says, ``games were a kind of fantasy. You could find a
piece of your dreams by playing them. But nowadays, I mostly just
sit here and marvel at the ability of the designers to create such
an incredibly eye-catching product that's so enjoyable to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this is a great time to be shopping in the video game
candy store, particularly if you're old enough not to have to ask
Mom and Dad for money to buy the goodies. Dreamcast, launched to
waiting customer lines in September, put Sega Enterprises Ltd. back
at the table with the other members of gaming's Big 3, Nintendo Co.
Ltd., and Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. It has also upped the
ante, creating a new generation of games by introducing a more
powerful, Internet-ready, graphically rich system and backing it
with a $100 million marketing push.
</P>
<P>
   Sony plans to retaliate in March with the Japanese release of
its next-generation Playstation 2 (US release: fall 2000), complete
with its own 128-bit Emotion Engine. Nintendo, meanwhile, is
working on a 256-bit console tentatively known as Dolphin, hoping
to deliver, by the end of 2000, with bells and whistles that will
further knock a gamer's socks off. Nintendo also says it will
introduce a new 32-bit version of its portable Game Boy next fall,
thereby replacing the hottest piece of video game hardware of all
time: 80 million units sold.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional industry wisdom holds that older players tend to
favor sports and racing games rather than fighting and shooting
games. (Sega is marketing a Dreamcast fishing game with a
controller that simulates the lazy cast of a fly rod. Try selling
that to a twitchy kid.) Many game developers believe that these
adults want games they can learn fairly quickly. But for someone
like George Cavros, a 28-year-old emergency medical technician,
figures he spends at least 500 hours a year with a game controller
in his hands, learning time isn't an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I do games where you run around and kill guys,'' Cavros
says. ``But I prefer strategy games and war games that involve
careful thinking and planning. And I like putting myself in
situations that don't happen to people in ordinary life. A good
video game is like being inside a good book and living a
character's life. You're experiencing a world in which you don't
live. But you're in that world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big 3 console makers are obviously aware of the 20- to
40-something crowd. When Sony launched its Playstation in 1995, it
made a concentrated effort to go after what spokesperson Molly
Smith calls ``an older, more sophisticated market.'' The strategy
worked: more than a third of the demographic base of the Sony
console, which has sold more than 60 million units, is 24 years or
older. Smith says the company is aiming lower these days, having
increased its number of titles aimed at young teens. But targeting
kids can be a good way of hitting grown-ups, especially if we're
talking about adults who are trying to recapture their youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about downward aspiration,'' explains Peter Moore,
senior vice-president for marketing for Sega of America Inc. ``I'm
44. But when I pick up a controller and play a game, I'm suddenly
younger because of that. I'm playing again. We like to say here,
`Everybody's 17 when they get that contoller in their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are it's been in their hands for as long as a quarter of
a century, since the days of ``Pong'' and other artifacts.
``Playing video games is a natural thing for these people because
they've been doing it all their lives,'' says Perrin Kaplan,
director of corporate affairs for Nintendo of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toy industry loses people when they grow older. We
don't.''

TROUBLE IN TOYLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time you're standing in a store aisle surrounded by
more toy choices than Santa's elves ever dreamed of, stop a second
before you cart one to the register and ask yourself this question:
What kind of activities can this toy lead to?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the answer this holiday season is too often,
``Nothing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Early childhood educators say they are finding some disturbing
new themes among the toys being marketed for young children this
year, from a growing reliance on electronic technology to an
increase in violent themes and toys that involve candy in play.
</P>
<P>
   For Boston College developmental psychologist Martha Bronson,
the first hint of the troubling trends came after she had spent a
few afternoons visiting toy stores for a research project. Then she
pored through 30 or so holiday toy catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all,'' she says, ``it was very depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her complaint is that manufacturers are taking the play out of
toys. ``It's through play that young children learn about the
world. A good toy opens doors for a child to how the world works.
It leaves gaps for the child to fill in so that there's room for
imagination and creativity,'' says Bronson. A good toy has
possibilities. It expands play, it doesn't limit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic gadgets, where a baby pushes a button and gets
entertained, are about as limiting as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a toddler's perspective, it's nothing more than a magic
trick,'' says Bronson. ``No matter how many times she pushes the
button, there's nothing a baby or toddler can learn from that
toy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a toy that gets boring very quickly and is put aside, a
big deal when you consider the time and money you spent choosing it
and the unrewarded energy a child put into it. But there are other
developmental problems with these toys, too, says early childhood
educator Diane Levin of Wheelock College, a specialist in
children's toys and media and the author of ``Remote Control
Childhood?'' (NAEYC Press).
</P>
<P>
   One of a child's earliest developmental tasks is to learn about
cause and effect, where baby does something and sees an immediate
result: She smiles and Daddy smiles back; he shakes a rattle and
there's a noise; she kicks a mobile and it moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic toys short-circuit this process,'' says Levin.
``What babies get out of it is that something happens inside the
box. It takes them away from the process of understanding how you
influence the world, how you make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Distracting sound chips
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Electronics are even creeping into some classic toys, say toy
gurus Joanne and Stephanie Oppenheim, authors of the popular
parents' guide ``Oppenheim Toy Portfolio'' (2000 edition).
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, everything has a sound chip, which is a distraction
for little kids, not a plus,'' says Stephanie Oppenheim. ``Taking
your first step with a push toy is a big deal by itself. You don't
need sounds and lights on the toy.''
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheim says they were hard-pressed this year to find a toy
garage that didn't have sound added. ``Kids are better off bringing
their own horn and motor sounds to it,'' she says. Even stuffed
animals, one of the most reliable toys you can give, are
increasingly adulterated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Magic Kermit Talking Doll we liked because there are
four things you can make him do, and it's huggable,'' she says. But
there is also a Rock and Roll Elmo and Ernie they don't like:
``It's a one-note toy. There's nothing to do but watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there are too many toys that dictate play or offer
only one way to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a toy kitchen that told kids which color pot to put
on the stove,'' asks Oppenheim. ``That flies in the face of
everything we know about the importance of toys helping children
bring imagination to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, generic props are almost always better than specific
ones. ``Some kitchen toys come equipped down to a plastic fried
egg,'' says Bronson. ``But a plastic fried egg can only be a
plastic fried egg. Better to let them pretend a block or leaf is an
egg.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Violence and grotesquerie
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is it more obvious that a toy can only be what it is
than in the proliferation of toys with violent, grotesque, and
sexual imagery, a trend identified by TRUCE (Teachers Resisting
Unhealthy Children's Entertainment) in its annual toy list. Levin,
a TRUCE spokeswoman, says there is more violence and grotesquerie
this year than ever in toys for young children. The example she
cites is the Impaled Mummy, where you put a spear in the toy's back
and its intestines fall out. Not only does it endorse a violent
action, but this toy also presents a problem developmentally,
because it focuses children on subject matter that would not
normally cross their horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage, they're trying to undertand how the body
functions, and they don't have the cognitive skills to separate out
what's real and what's not,'' she says. ``A toy like this confuses
them on both fronts.'' A 3-year-old who scrapes his knee, for
instance, might overreact, worried that his insides will fall out.
In addition, she says, when children are confused by the message a
toy sends, they work that much harder to figure it out even though
they don't have the cognitive equipment to do so. ``That takes
their energy away from the issues they do need to work on,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Bronson worries about the implied message we send when we give
toys like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you give a child any toy, you are saying, `This is
appropriate, this is for you.' You are sanctioning the activity the
toy generates, including the violence,'' she says. ``I don't think
parents think about that enough.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sending wrong messages
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Bronson asks the all-important question, ``What kind of
activities can this toy lead to?'' the ``nothing good'' answer is
particularly apropos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad enough when a toy is designed to follow a script from
TV or video; that leads to imitative rather than creative play,''
she says. ``When the play the toy promotes is violent _ when the
only play value of an action figure is to beat up another action
figure _ what image of the world does a child construct?''
</P>
<P>
   The grotesqueness of most action figures raises another issue.
Bronson says more and more research shows that young boys think
their bodies have to look like muscle-bound action figure bodies,
much the way little girls think they have to look like Barbie. And
with so many action figures presenting distorted and violent female
body images, boys and girls potentially get equally distorted ideas
about female sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The movies and TV shows these figures come from _ ``Star Wars''
or WWF, for instance _ are rated by their industry as not
appropriate for very young children, yet toys spun off from them
are marketed for toddlers and preschoolers. ``What does `Star Wars'
have to do with an 18-month-old's world?'' Levin asks. She urges
parents to stay away from things like the ``Star Wars'' board book
with sound effects. Not only do the sounds distract from the
reading process and set a child up to need constant stimulation,
but the content also ``hooks them on violence and begins to
desensitize them to it, even at 18 months,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Candy-toy links
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toys with violent themes don't even get considered by the
Oppenheims but Stephanie Oppenheim says they had to sidestep many
more of them this year than ever before. They also stay away from
the candy-toy link, a trend that made it to the TRUCE ``Toys to
Avoid'' list for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was barely visible last year at Christmas,'' says Levin.
This year it's all over the place, from plush 3-inch Pokemon toys
with Wonka TartnTinys candy inside to minitrucks carting mini M&AMP;Ms.
Disney has a Tarzan rainstick candystick: ``The downpour that
sounds delicious.'' And perhaps most offensive of all is Jar Jar
Binks Monster Mouth, where a child sticks her mouth into Jar Jar's
to lick the candy off its tongue. ``The sexual overtones to that
could set up kids to be accepting of an abusive sexual come-on,''
says Levin.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious and more typical trouble with a candy-toy link is
that it promotes poor nutrition. ``Kids learn from their play, so
the message that junk food is OK becomes ingrained,'' says Levin.
</P>
<P>
   So what should we be buying?
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important is for young children to have a rich
variety of playthings,'' says Oppenheim. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   --Birth to 12 months. ``Babies need responsive people more than
responsive objects,'' says Bronson. Keep toys simple, basic, and
predictable: rattles and mobiles.
</P>
<P>
   --12 to 24 months. They're grappling with cause and effect and
for control. Give them toys that offer opportunities to push, pull,
fill, empty, pile, and climb. Blocks are great; so are simple
stacking toys, board books, and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   --2 to 3 years. Oppenheim says the best new toy for this age is
the Tomy Ball Party Connecting Bridge by International Playthings.
``It's basically a ball run,'' says Stephanie Oppenheim, ``so they
make it happen. As they get older, you can make a color game out of
it: red balls first, blue second; and you can make it
interactive.'' Also good at this age are toys that involve texture,
shape, size, and color: simple matching games, basic musical
instruments, balls for large motor skills, and familiar objects for
fantasy play.
</P>
<P>
   --3 to 5 years. Play becomes more purposeful as they act out
themes of their lives. Provide items for fantasy play (boys like
this as much as girls); materials for lacing, beading, matching,
and sorting; simple board games of chance or games like dominoes or
lotto; art materials for creating and planning ahead; beginners'
building sets. Oppenheim's advice about construction sets like Lego
is that less is more _ ``Too many pieces overwhelm'' _ except for
train sets: ``If you only have enough track to make a circle, it's
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one more trend the Oppenheims noticed this year: dirty
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Dirty toys?
</P>
<P>
   ``Open the box and many toys have grease, dirt, and human
hair,'' says Stephanie Oppenheim. ``We're telling parents not to
give any toy to a young child without washing it first.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Since in addition to being personally fascinated with autos, I
also write about them, shows like the New England International
Auto Show are fun in a couple of ways.
</P>
<P>
   In one manner, I approach them just as most of you do: spot
interesting-looking cars, walk around them, and check their lines
from all angles; climb into the drivers' seats and imagine myself
the owner; sit in the back and get the feel for being a passenger.
Grab literature. Check sticker prices. Walk and gawk until my feet
get sore.
</P>
<P>
   But since writing about cars also means having some
understanding of the people who buy them, it's also fun to attend
an auto show and, while moving among the cars, watch you folks
check them out.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it easy to spot trends: which cars are clicking with
which groups of people.
</P>
<P>
   It makes it easy to spot enduring traits: which groups of people
are borne back ceaselessly to the same brands, year after year,
even as those brands may be changing radically.
</P>
<P>
   And it is also inevitable that you run across irony and humor as
you listen to certain folks comment on cars.
</P>
<P>
   Like the guy, wearing a ``Buy American'' button standing before
a Toyota Tundra pickup truck and exhorting that he would never buy
something made in Japan. He was surprised when I told him it was
built by American hands in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Or the yahoo who approached a glistening Saleen Mustang
convertible, set his Pepsi on the polished rear deck and announced
so all could hear: ``I have one of these puppies. It's not a
Saleen, but it's a Mustang.'' Right, and Charlie Parker may have
been OK, but Neil Diamond in ``The Jazz Singer'' was just awesome.
</P>
<P>
   But if you watched carefully, there were serious, interesting
observations to be made about both cars and the people who studied
them:
</P>
<P>
   --Any time you saw a group of young kids (as in too young to
drive) rolling rapidly across the floor, you knew they were headed
to the Volkswagen Beetles.
</P>
<P>
   --It was almost endearing to watch young couples sit in the
front seats of Mercedes and dream of the day any one of these might
be their car.
</P>
<P>
   --Families of four or more, of course, went to the vans and
SUVs, but you spotted them again later circling the four-door,
six-passenger pickup trucks that are in abundance this year.
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of vans, don't many of them seem to be getting
progressively smaller?
</P>
<P>
   --Older folks formed the steadiest lines to the Lincoln and
Cadillac displays and many had to be surprised at the youthful
sportiness of the Lincoln LS or the Cadillac Catera.
</P>
<P>
   --Watching large groups of people emerge from the gargantuan
Ford Excursion reminded me of a day at the circus. How many clowns
could you fit into one of those beasts?
</P>
<P>
   --In this day and age, why do sellers of automobiles think they
must use tall, thin women in tight clothes to sell us their cars?
</P>
<P>
   --At a show where flash and glitz are at a premium, it is
amazing how those fabulous Porsche automobiles can sit there
looking so benign.
</P>
<P>
   --The bug look is obviously in for the latest generation of SUVs
_ that's bug as in having an exoskeleton in the form of racks,
step-up rails, and various tubes wrapped over and around the autos.
It was most noticeable in the Kia Sportage 4 x 4, the Sportage EX,
the Nissan Xterra, and the Isuzu VehiCross.
</P>
<P>
   --Not buglike at all but out there on the edge where SUV meets
car meets sport vehicle are the BMW X5 and the Mercedes ML55 AMG _
both as comfortable at up to 135-150 m.p.h. as they are off road.
</P>
<P>
   --Seeing this evolution in SUVs made me wonder how long Jeep can
wait before designing something beyond the basic box (rounding off
corners on Cherokees is not a major design statement) that will
appeal to younger drivers.
</P>
<P>
   --You want cars that look fast and sleek just sitting there?
Here are a few that caught my eye: the Saab Aero 9-5, the BMW M5,
the Cadillac Catera, the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, the Subaru Imprezza
RS all-wheel-drive, the Audi TT Quattro, and the CL 500 Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   --Looking futuristic yet retro was the new Ford Thunderbird,
this one a yellow bird, its doors open like wings and exposing a
plush interior as the car spun on its platform.
</P>
<P>
   --Remember the old Dodge Power Wagon: looming, almost toothy up
at the grill. A prototype at the show was definitely modern, but
decidedly evocative of the old beast. If those buglike SUVs ever
marched to war, this Power Wagon could lead them.
</P>
<P>
   --The rush to build the four-door truck that is an SUV that is a
car proceeds headlong with Ford's F-150 Supercab, the Chevrolet
Silverado, the Dakota Sport, the Nissan Frontier, and the Toyota
Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   --Clashing examples of SUVs turned into one of the above: the
Ford Explorer Sport Trac is the SUV with a bed added and it works
superbly. The Lincoln attempt _ turning a Navigator into a
Blackwood _ is just plain ugly. A Lincoln SUV-pickup? Spare us.
</P>
<P>
   --And finally, one thing any good auto show needs is a display
of exotics, those cars most folks don't even get to see up close
and personal, let alone own. I know the intent of the show is to
sell, but a Ferrari or Lamborghini display sprinkled here and there
would add greatly to the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Update:
</P>
<P>
   In a review of the Mercury Sable a few weeks back, I wrote that
the car had an intermittent but troubling wind noise. Credit the
Ford Motor Co. with jumping on the problem. The company sent an
engineer out to test the car and determined that some of the rails
that guide the windows up and down to tight closings had been
incorrectly installed. Since the car was a factory prototype, it's
not a problem you should expect on production models.

2000 JETTA TDI _ A DIESEL THAT'S FUN TO DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The time: A glorious Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The place: Interstate 95 in New Hampshire and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The car: A 2000 VW Jetta TDI. The TDI signifies that a
turbocharged, direct-injection diesel engine is powering us along.
</P>
<P>
   We're zipping along about 70 miles per hour in the middle lanes
as a steady line of SUVs zooms past in the high-speed lane. Most
have one or two people aboard and don't look to be loaded with
anything more than a suitcase or two.
</P>
<P>
   I turn to Mrs. G and say: ``It's a self-righteous feeling to be
driving a vehicle that's getting 49 miles per gallon while all
those cars are getting about a third of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, self-righteousness only counts for so much. The truth
is that this Jetta is flat-out fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My prior experience with diesels was limited.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a former colleague racked up 100,000 miles on a
diesel VW Rabbit and used to rave about how much he loved the car _
and the great gas mileage it got.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Roy, a mechanic for a fleet of oil trucks, had a diesel
Chevy pickup truck in the late '70s. He had nothing but trouble and
couldn't get rid of it soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   My new son-in-law, Stefano, drives a turbocharged Fiat Punto
around Milan. My few rides in the car have shown it to be a totally
reliable vehicle. It has big rubber bumpers for forcing its way
into parking spaces; it's easy on gas; and it more than holds its
own on the high-speed autostradas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus I was somewhat less than fully prepared when this Jetta TDI
arrived for a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   Did I have to deal with letting glow plugs heat up before it
would start? (No.) Would it give itself away with rocks-in-a-pail
diesel vibration? (No . . . just enough rattling at idle to let you
know it was a diesel.) Would it smoke like an 18-wheeler? (No
again.)
</P>
<P>
   This is a nifty package. On the road, it's hard to believe that
there's only 90 horsepower under the hood emanating from 116 cubic
inches (1.9 liters). The TDI cruises effortlessly at highway speeds
_ moving with the flow of traffic anywhere from 5 to 15 m.p.h. over
the posted limits. From a dead stop, it effortlessly climbs the
mountain road leading to home.
</P>
<P>
   At 60 m.p.h., the tach read 2,000 r.p.m. _ a tried-and-true
benchmark for long engine life.
</P>
<P>
   We'd driven it well over 300 miles and the gas gauge had barely
dropped to midway, leading to a common first reaction: ``That gauge
is broken!''
</P>
<P>
   The Jetta's previous driver had complained because the best
mileage he could get was 49.5. We were hoping to hit 50, but a
frantic call from VW recalled the test car before we reached the
pumps. It seems that someone put out the word (erroneously) that
the car hadn't been cleared to be sold in Massachusetts (it has).
</P>
<P>
   Our abbreviated test was a disappointment, but it didn't prevent
the family from reaching a conclusion: This package is a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certain cars and certain engine-gearing combinations just seem
to click with me. The first time I really appreciated it in a
four-cylinder was in a '94 Honda EX. Later, I came across it in a
Mazda Protege ES. This Jetta hit my personal bull's-eye by putting
its torque just where you want to use it _ on highway on-ramps, in
passing situations, when accelerating from the endless traffic
lights and stop signs we deal with daily. Did you ever notice that
TV commercials rarely place the product in a traffic jam _ unless
the car is going to magically fly over it all?
</P>
<P>
   The reason to write about this Jetta was strictly the diesel
engine. Royal Ford, who regularly reviews autos for the Globe, gave
the top-of-the-line V6 Jetta a solid thumbs-up earlier this fall,
and we found no reason to argue with his review.
</P>
<P>
   The TDI was the basic GL trim level and has an MSRP of $17,995.
</P>
<P>
   As the price of gas marches toward $1.50 a gallon _ up about 40
percent since spring when I actually filled up for 89 cents a
gallon _ you'd think folks might look more closely at diesels, but
VW's Steve Keyes doesn't think that's the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that gas would have to hit $2 a gallon _
and maybe a lot higher _ before folks would buy for economy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are diesel fans out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 5 percent of the market will look at a diesel,'' said
Keyes. ``And those are the folks you can't get out of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Count me among them. Self-righteous? Not really. Just a guy
savoring a car that's fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The back door shape. You have to make like a matador dodging a
bull to let the chest-high curve of the door past you.
</P>
<P>
   --The center armrest. In the down position, it interferes with
shifting, using the handbrake, and fastening seat belts. In the up
position, you can't get at the stuff stored in the top container _
cell phone, directions, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The red and blue dashboard lights.
</P>
<P>
   --Trunk space. You have to see it to believe it.

IS IT RACISM, OR IS IT FEAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's beat-up-on-cabbies time in New York City. Some 150
undercover police officers have hit the streets, ready to nail any
taxi driver they catch failing to stop for a black passenger, or
refusing to take passengers to certain neighborhoods. Operation
Refusal, the crackdown is called. Operation No Income might be a
better name, since a cabbie cited by the city immediately loses, at
least for a while, his means of earning a living: His hack license
is suspended on the spot, and his vehicle taken to the nearest
police station. Following a hearing, first-time offenders can
expect a fine of up to $350; three offenses, and the cabbie's
license is revoked for good.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudy Giuliani ordered the crackdown after the actor Danny
Glover complained that he was repeatedly snubbed by taxi drivers in
Manhattan because he is black. Glover didn't doubt that the cabbies
who ignored him were motivated by bigotry. Neither did Giuliani and
his subalterns. ``If they'' _ cabbies _ ``can't see decency on a
human level, they will understand it on an economic level,'' the
taxi commissioner warns.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to sympathize with Glover, or with any other
honest man who has gone through the same infuriating experience.
``I don't know of an African-American who has not endured the shame
and anger of having a cab driver lock his doors upon approaching
them,'' writes Floyd Flake, a black former congressman from Queens,
in the New York Post. ``An additional indignity usually follows:
the cracked window and the question about where the rider is headed
_ and then the driver pulling off, saying he's not headed in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Flake dubs the practice ``transportation apartheid.'' Others
label it ``drive-by racism.'' A New York Times editorial supporting
Operation Refusal was titled ``Taxi Discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Are there hate-addled drivers who are so steeped in prejudice
that they would rather forgo a fare than let a nonwhite passenger
sit in their cab? Possibly. But it's a strange sort of racism that
kicks in when a black man hails a cab, only to disappear when the
passenger at the curb is a woman. Stranger still when it affects
not only cabbies who are white, but even those who are dark-skinned
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And what about you, dear reader? Could it be that even you are a
``drive-by racist?'' Let us see. You're in your car, headed for the
highway. As you approach the on-ramp, you see a black man with his
thumb out. He's not dressed like a CEO, but he doesn't look like a
hoodlum, either. Most likely he is what he appears to be _ an
ordinary hitchhiker _ but you can't be sure. After all, you've
never seen him before.
</P>
<P>
   Do you stop and let this black stranger get in your car? Or do
you drive right past him?
</P>
<P>
   With his customary swagger, Giuliani brushed off any complaints
that the taxi crackdown might provoke. ``I know we're going to get
the same howls and screams and yells that we got when we did this
with drunk drivers,'' he said, referring to a policy of seizing the
cars of people arrested for driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison is an insult. Cabbies are not drunk drivers. They
are, as a rule, hard and hungry workers who ply one of the most
dangerous jobs in America. ``Taxicab drivers and chauffeurs face
unusually high risks of becoming homicide victims,'' noted the
Bureau of Labor Statistics in a 1994 report. ``This occupation
accounted for almost one-10th of all victims of job-related
homicide, but less than one-half of 1 percent of the nation's
workforce. Nocturnal trips, especially those to secluded areas,
make these drivers particularly vulnerable. Almost half the cab
drivers died from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a rare cabbie who can afford to pass up ready cash to
indulge something as irrational as dumb bigotry. For most, racism
isn't a reason to avoid picking up black men or driving to black
neighborhoods. Prudence is.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is rotten when a black man can't get a taxi to take him
home from work. It is unfair. It is cruel. But not as cruel as when
a taxi driver gets robbed at gunpoint _ or stabbed _ or killed _ by
a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bitter fact of life that black males in America commit
crimes of violence far out of proportion to their numbers. They
account for more than 40 percent of those arrested for violent
crimes and 56 percent of those arrested for murder. Thirteen
percent of black men are convicted felons. In many cities, the
percentage is higher. In Washington, D.C. _ a city with a black
mayor, a majority-black police force, and a great sensitivity to
racism _ the likelihood that a young black male will be arrested
before his 35th birthday is 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my
life,'' lamented Jesse Jackson in 1993, ``than to walk down the
street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery _ then
look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not racism, it's reality. And many black Americans share
that reality. In a 1996 survey, 52 percent of blacks said they were
afraid to walk alone at night in their own neighborhoods. A cab
driver need not be a bigot to want to steer clear of those
neighborhoods as well.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Refusal and similar crackdowns in other cities will
not end this problem. Taxi drivers are not about to start ignoring
their instincts, or to forget their priorities. As one black cabbie
told The Washington Post a few years ago, ``I'd rather be fined
than have my wife a widow.''

   The dinosaurs may have perished in a gas-fueled firestorm of
unimaginable intensity, claims a team of American oceanographers.
They believe the impact of a giant asteroid or comet in the Gulf of
Mexico unleashed vast quantities of methane that set the air
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Cretaceous period, about 65 million years ago,
huge amounts of methane generated by rotting vegetation lay trapped
in sediments more than 500 meters below sea level. At these depths,
low temperature and high pressure allow methane to combine with
water to form solid methane hydrates.
</P>
<P>
   Enormous quantities of methane hydrate are trapped below the
Earth's surface today, and several countries, including the United
States, Germany and Japan, are interested in exploiting their
potential as fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   But Burton Hurdle of the Naval Research Laboratory in
Washington, D.C., and his colleagues believe methane hydrate
reserves have already played a pivotal role in the Earth's history
_ by speeding the extinction of the dinosaurs. They say huge shock
waves generated as the asteroid or comet collided with the ocean
floor would have traveled round the planet and freed vast
quantities of trapped methane.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning bursts in the disturbed atmosphere would have ignited
the methane-rich air.
</P>
<P>
   ''The atmosphere itself would have been on fire,'' Burton and
his colleagues conclude in a new paper. ''This could have
contributed to the demise of the dinosaurs,'' Burton told New
Scientist.
</P>
<P>
   As further evidence, the researchers point to an earlier
discovery of disruption in late Cretaceous sediments, possibly due
to methane release, at Black Ridge off the coast of Florida. More
recent activity on the sea floor suggests that trapped methane
periodically escapes even in the absence of asteroid strikes.
Oceanographers believe a smaller ''blow-out'' occurred in an area
in the Gulf of Mexico measuring 36 by 22 kilometers during the late
Pleistocene epoch.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Norris, a paleobiologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts, who helped to discover the Black
Ridge feature, agrees that lots of methane could have been released
from that site, had it been trapped in the form of methane hydrate.
He adds that the increased preponderance of the isotope carbon-12
over carbon-13 immediately after the impact also suggests that lots
of methane was burnt. But he says this isotopic pattern is not
repeated all over the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts are similarly cautious. ''I think this idea is
very intriguing,'' says Peter Schultz of Brown University in
Providence, R.I., who has studied the late Cretaceous impact. ''But
I'm not sure even an impact this big would have liberated that
amount of methane.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, even local firestorms could have contributed to
the dinosaurs' demise. Angela Milner, head of vertebrate
palaeontology at the Natural History Museum in London, says that
many dinosaurs appear to have been in serious decline before the
impact. But she agrees that huge methane fires ''could have been
the final straw'' for some species.  &QL;

   Influenced by the robotic ''exoskeleton'' worn by Sigourney
Weaver in the 1986 movie ''Aliens,'' engineers in Australia are
building a two-legged industrial robot that will be able go places
and do things no forklift truck ever could.
</P>
<P>
   Many robotics groups around the globe are trying to make
androids, but a robot biped for industry is a new twist.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody loves the idea of a droid,'' says project leader Joe
Cronin of the University of New South Wales in Sydney. ''But we
think our robot has a better chance of being commercially viable.
The great difference is that humanoids will one day do what humans
can do. But our industrial bipeds will be able to do what humans
can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Robolift stands 3 meters tall and will be able to lift a
load of 500 kilograms when it is fitted with arms. Its power comes
from a propane-fuelled 20 horsepower engine _ the team decided
against weak, quickly depleted batteries.
</P>
<P>
   At a symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics in
Monterey, Calif., last week, Cronin described how Robolift balanced
successfully in their tests, a critical milestone before taking its
first steps. Robolift balances much like a person, using a
combination of standard movements of its leg and foot joints as
well as more drastic hip movements, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   When standing still, the robot should have equal pressure on
each foot. If the robot is pushed, sensors in the legs and feet
detect it and move the joints to compensate, if possible. If not,
then a larger movement is triggered at the hips, just like a person
trying to balance on one foot. A gyroscope tells the robot when it
has moved enough to stop falling. Once it has arms it will use a
similar technique to balance while lifting: a payload will trigger
the same response as a push on the robot's back.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the robot will be controlled by an on-board
operator, but for now a tethered joystick is used. Either way, a
built-in computer translates the operator's commands into the
movements needed at each joint. If a joint cannot move, perhaps
because of a change in terrain, it tells the computer, and the
robot makes a drastic hip movement to regain control before it
tries to take a step.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cronin, balancing was the greatest hurdle in
Robolift's development. ''We'll have it walking by the end of the
year,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After that the final step will be to add arms, either like those
on a forklift or some type of grasper reminiscent of the machine in
''Aliens,'' he says. Robert Howe, an engineer who works with
two-legged robots at Harvard University in Massachusetts, is
enthusiastic about the Australians' work. ''I'd wager they're going
to get it walking,'' he says. ''It's an original idea.''  &QL;

   It seems barely a week goes by without another piece of bad news
for the agribiotech giant Monsanto. Now researchers in the United
States have found that hot climates don't agree with Monsanto's
herbicide-resistant soybeans, causing stems to split open and crop
losses of up to 40 per cent.
</P>
<P>
   This could be a serious blow to the St. Louis-based company,
which sees Brazil and other Latin American countries as major
markets for its soybeans. ''It has the potential to be quite a
problem,'' says Bill Vencill of the University of Georgia in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Vencill examined the effects of heat on the engineered soybeans
after farmers in the southern state alerted him to unexpected crop
losses. He realized that most severe losses occurred during
Georgia's two hottest springs since the beans were launched in
1996. ''In the years we saw the problems, the soils were reaching
40 to 50 degrees C,'' says Vencill.
</P>
<P>
   His team replicated these conditions in laboratory growth
chambers, comparing the hardiness of the Monsanto plants with that
of conventional strains of soybean. In soils that reached only 25 C
during the day, the genetically modified Monsanto beans grew just
as well as conventional beans. But in warmer soils, the Monsanto
plants appeared stunted. And in soils reaching 45 C, the
differences were marked. Vencill described the findings at a
meeting of the British Crop Protection Council in Brighton this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw lower heights, yields and weights in the Monsanto
beans,'' says Vencill. Worse still, stems of virtually all the
Monsanto beans split open as the first leaves began to emerge
compared with between 50 and 70 percent of the other test plants.
This same phenomenon had occurred on farms, but had been blamed on
fungal disease. ''Instead, we think the stem splits, and it exposes
the plant to secondary infection,'' says Vencill.
</P>
<P>
   Vencill suspects that the phenomenon is the result of changes in
plant physiology caused by the addition of genes making the beans
resistant to glyphosate, the herbicide marketed as Roundup by
Monsanto. Plants carrying these genetic alterations have been shown
to produce up to 20 per cent more lignin, the tough, woody form of
cellulose. ''We think it might make the plants more brittle,'' says
Vencill.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, he found that plants resistant to a different
herbicide, gluphosinate, were not affected by the heat, so he
concludes the problem must be peculiar to glyphosate resistance.
''It's not genetic modification per se that's causing the
effects,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Vencill says that the bacterial enzyme that imparts resistance
to glyphosate affects a major metabolic pathway in the plant, and
has the side effect of sending lignin production ''into
overdrive.'' Gluphosinate resistance, by contrast, is achieved
using a gene that simply enables plants to break down the
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto says it can't comment in detail on Vencill's results
''until we've seen a published and peer-reviewed article.'' But a
spokesman suggests that farmers might avoid the problem by choosing
a variety of engineered soybean that is better suited to hot
conditions.  &QL;

   The hunt for Red October seems to have become the hunt for
glowing plankton. Last month, the Ukrainian security service
accused four marine biologists of exporting state secrets, leaving
their Western colleagues bewildered. Now New Scientist's inquiries
have revealed the probable reason for the Ukrainian authorities'
draconian action: the scientists all study bioluminescent plankton,
which can reveal the whereabouts of submarines.
</P>
<P>
   On October 15, the Security Bureau of Ukraine raided the
Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas in Sevastopol. They
interrogated four researchers _ Sergei Piontkovski, Gallina
Piontkovskaya, Yuri Tokarev and Boris Sokolov _ and searched their
homes. The scientists were told they could be charged with
transferring secret information to foreign governments. However,
their Western colleagues remain convinced that the biologists are
innocent of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations center on projects funded by Western agencies,
including the European Union and Britain's Darwin Initiative, which
supports studies of biodiversity. Many species of plankton can
generate light, so measurements of bioluminescence can be used to
study their global distribution. But in releasing the results of
bioluminescence studies done over the past three decades, the
biologists found themselves in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Bioluminescent plankton often glow when they are physically
disturbed _ by a submerged submarine's wake, for example. A sub's
wake can leave a telltale scar at the surface, triggering a flash
of light from bioluminescent plankton that can be spotted from
surface vessels, aircraft or even orbiting satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Herring of the Southampton Oceanography Center, president
of the International Society for Bioluminescence and
Chemiluminescence, says that the plankton are very sensitive to
disturbance. ''Even swimming mackerel produce a nice effect,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Glowing plankton have a long history in naval warfare. On
November 9, 1918, the German submarine U-34 was destroyed in the
Mediterranean after bioluminescent plankton betrayed its position.
And last year, Captain Michael McHugh, former manager of the U.S.
Navy's program for assessing strategic threats to ballistic missile
submarines, admitted in the magazine Undersea Warfare that the U.S.
military had developed a way of using bioluminescence to detect
submarines. Britain appears to be doing similar research.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that one or two colleagues work on bioluminescence for
the detection of subs,'' says Simon Boxall, a remote sensing expert
at the University of Southampton. The Ministry of Defense declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not a submarine triggers surface plankton to glow
depends on its depth and speed, but many countries have satellites
that would be able to detect submarines when conditions are right.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a system that can reliably detect submarine wakes
means knowing a lot about the normal distribution and activity of
the plankton, however. And it is this information that Ukraine
seems so determined to protect.
</P>
<P>
   In June, for instance, border guards confiscated a poster
presentation describing the mapping of plankton by bioluminescence
from Tokarev as he traveled to a symposium in Lithuania.  &QL;

   MOSCOW _ The holidays are a confusing time in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The former communist country still reckons major holidays by the
Georgian calendar that was abandoned by the rest of Europe in the
16th Century. Russia's New Year's Day, for example, is on January
13.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Russians will have to join the rest of the
world and pay attention to what they call the ``new'' New Year's as
potential computer problems caused by the so-called ``millennium''
or ``Y2K'' bug.
</P>
<P>
   Russia appears ill-prepared for any Y2K bug problems.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while experts say that the chances of spontaneous
missiles launches or exploding nuclear power stations are
``virtually nil,'' they agree that power outages and dead phone
lines are more than likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have left it to late. Now Russians are not thinking about
solutions, but are making plans to deal with Y2K problems and how
to contain the damage,'' says Ron Lewin, whose company, Teralink
Technologies, works to make Russian companies Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   The ``millennium bug'' is due to a programming shortcut that
used only the last two digits of a year in software to save space.
When the current year ends, computers can confuse 2000 with 1900
and crash as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of such computer glitch-induced hardships lead the
U.S. State Department earlier this month to offer up to 800 embassy
the opportunity to go home for the holidays. The move is expected
to cost U.S. taxpayers up to $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has embassies in more than 100 countries, but
the only four affected by the decision are former Soviet Bloc
countries deemed to be at highest risk: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus
and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mainly a concern for the families,'' said one U.S.
Embassy staffer here who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Most
employees came here and accepted the risk. But their children
didn't. They want to go home because of the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials, at least publicly, say there is little to
worry about. But embassy staff members who choose to leave will not
be allowed back into Russia until the ``all clear'' is given by the
State Department. They could spend as much as a month working from
hotel rooms in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can petition to come back early, but there is no choice,''
said one staff member who asked not to be identified. ``At this
point there is no program. It is all uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, played
down the nervous reactions and predicted that only a few dozen
embassy staffers will take up the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most American expatriates here are deciding to brave it
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard of anyone packing up and leaving because of
Y2K,'' said Christina Olsson, of the Russia-U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   She said the pro-business organization is not advising American
executives working here to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is ample room for concern. First, is the
worry that a computer will spontaneously launch one of Russia's
3,000 nuclear missiles that are still in a high state of launch
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Defense Department has been working with its Russian
counterparts for more than a year to troubleshoot any potential
problems. In addition, Russian military personnel will be stationed
at launch information-sharing center at NORAD in Colorado. It goes
into operation at the start of December and will operate through
the first part of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything Y2K has reduced the chances for an accidental
launch,'' says Tom Martins, the head of Environment, Science and
Technology Department at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The other major cause of concern are Russia's nine nuclear power
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Just under three-quarters of electricity in Russia is generated
by thermal power stations that use analogue systems that won't be
affected by Y2K problems. Another 15 percent is generated by
nuclear reactors _most, of the same design as the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant that exploded in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   That doomsday scenario has been uppermost in the minds of U.S.
officials, as the Department of Energy has worked closely with
Russia's International Science and Technology Center and similar
organizations throughout Europe to bolster Russia's stations.
However, U.S. Embassy officials said the chances of a mishap
``approach zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Likely, they said it will be the day-to-day things that will go
wrong. In a report to the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Year
2000 Technological Problems, special advisor John Beyrle said:
``Russia is likely to experience disruptions in its electrical grid
and telecommunications infrastructure, with subsequent effects on
its financial, industrial and government sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Power outages in Russia are no joke. As the winter starts,
already more than 20 people have died in Moscow alone from the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   A holdover from the old communist system, all houses are heated
by power stations under the control of municipal authorities.
Following last summer's financial crisis, many of these _
especially in the poorest (and coldest) parts of the country _ have
already run out of money for fuel. A house without heating can
spell death to a rural resident.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the phonelines go dead and the heating is turned off,
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow is well supplied and is unlikely to be
affected directly. It has its own back-up supply of food, power
generators, clean water and satellite telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's major cities are also reasonably well-prepared. Experts
expect only minor problems in Moscow and St. Petersburg, where the
bulk of the country's wealth is concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   With the snow already lying thick on the ground, it is the
people in the countryside that are going to suffer the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new?'' says Teralink Technologies' Lewin. ``It is Y2K
every day in Siberia.''

FIVE WONDERFUL AND INEXPENSIVE HOLIDAY CRAFT IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Saturday, Nov. 20)

<P>
   Five inexpensive and easy holiday craft ideas
</P>
<P>
   Build your own snow globe
</P>
<P>
   Shake up a snow globe and you reactivate the magic of childhood,
when it seemed you could make it snow at will, blanketing a tiny
scene with particles of ice and snow. And it's not that hard to
make your own, either to re-experience a chunk of your own
childhood or to introduce your children to a bit of the magic.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you'll need:
</P>
<P>
   1 empty, clear glass jar with tight-fitting lid
</P>
<P>
   1 small can spray paint
</P>
<P>
   Small glass, painted clay or ceramic figure
</P>
<P>
   2 cups water (more if jar is larger)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons glycerin (available at pharmacy)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons clear and/or white confetti
</P>
<P>
   Hot glue gun, glue sticks
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to make it:
</P>
<P>
   Paint lid of jar; let dry thoroughly. Turn lid over and paint
inside; let dry.
</P>
<P>
   Stir together water and glycerin in pitcher; pour into jar,
filling to within 1 inch of rim. Add confetti.
</P>
<P>
   With hot glue gun, glue the small figure (we used a cookie press
with a Santa as a handle) to the inside of the painted jar lid.
Squirt hot glue on the inside rim of the lid, then screw on lid.
Turn over and watch the snow fall.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: About $7, using a thrift-store jar for a globe. There'll
be enough glycerin, paint, confetti and glue left over to make
another globe or two with the addition of another lidded jar and
another figure to go inside.
</P>
<P>
   Time: Several hours, or overnight, to let painted lid dry.
Assembly takes less than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty: Easy. Small children may need help measuring and
pouring glycerin and water.
</P>
<P>
   Easy holiday candle
</P>
<P>
   Say ``candlemaking,'' and you conjure up images of pioneer women
slaving over vats of hot tallow, dipping wicks to give their family
light on moonless nights.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's much easier to shed a little light on the holidays
these days. While it's possible to buy paraffin _ or even bees' wax
_ at crafts stores, there's an easier and safer way.
</P>
<P>
   Our candles use a product called Candle Magic, which is finely
ground pieces of paraffin, about the texture of coarse sand. No
melting is necessary, so no little fingers get burned in the
process. And it makes much less of a mess, although it's best to
lay down a few sheets of newspaper before starting.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you'll need:
</P>
<P>
   A clean, attractive, clear-glass jar or mug, heavy enough to
withstand a bit of heat.
</P>
<P>
   A wick that reaches from the bottom of the jar or mug to a
couple of inches above the rim.
</P>
<P>
   One or more bags of Candle Magic.
</P>
<P>
   A pencil, chopstick or wooden spoon
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to make it:
</P>
<P>
   Place the wick in the center of the jar or mug, making sure it
touches bottom. Tape the top end of the wick around a pencil,
chopstick or wooden spoon to hold it in place, and tape the anchor
in place. Pour in the Candle Magic.
</P>
<P>
   You can make a candle of all one color, layer colors to make
stripes, run a knife through it to ``marbleize'' the colors, or
tilt the jar or mug gently and layer in colors to make slanted
stripes.
</P>
<P>
   When the jar is filled, your candle is done. Use the scissors to
cut the wick so a half-inch or more protrudes above the wax. Throw
away the unused portion of the wick and untape anchor rod from jar.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: For two candles, using heavy thrift-store mugs, about
$9.50. You'll have several wicks left over (from a package of five)
and possibly some Candle Magic, depending on the size of your mugs,
so you might be able to make a third, smaller candle for only the
additional cost of a small jar or mug.
</P>
<P>
   Time: Less than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty: Very easy. No special skills needed.
</P>
<P>
   Recipe card gifts
</P>
<P>
   Come the holidays, everybody's thoughts turn to family and fun _
and food! And what better way to preserve Aunt Edna's recipe for
Sticky Buns or Gram's secret for the best butter cookies than to
write them down on recipe cards designed just for the holidays?
</P>
<P>
   Around this time of year, you can often find holiday-decorated
recipe cards in local party, book and card shops. Or you could
create your own with a stack of 3-by-5-inch or 4-by-6-inch index
cards and some holiday stickers. And for giving, you can dress them
up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you'll need:
</P>
<P>
   An 18- to 24-inch length of jute twine, heavy yarn or ribbon,
any color.
</P>
<P>
   Two clay, ceramic or wooden figures, each 1{ inches to 2 inches
high.
</P>
<P>
   Hot glue gun.
</P>
<P>
   Glue.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to make it:
</P>
<P>
   Use jute, yarn or ribbon to tie the cards together; make a big
bow and cut the ends to fall about halfway down the card. Use the
glue gun to glue a small figure to the end of each tie.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could make your recipe cards into a book. Use a paper
punch to make a hole in the upper left-hand corner of each card.
Use jute, yarn or ribbon to tie the cards together, tie a bow, and
glue the figures to the ends of the ties.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: About $4.50 to assemble and decorate a stack (or a book)
of 50 recipe cards.
</P>
<P>
   Time: Less than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty: Very easy. Small children will need help handling
the hot glue gun.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen `clay' ornaments
</P>
<P>
   Everybody loves squishing stuff between their fingers _
meatloaf, fingerpaint, mud pies ... you name it. That's why it's
such fun to make your own craft dough, to fashion into anything
from a candy dish to a tree ornament.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you'll need:
</P>
<P>
   A large-size resealable plastic bag
</P>
<P>
   1 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup salt
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup water
</P>
<P>
   A rolling pin
</P>
<P>
   Cookie cutters or a knife
</P>
<P>
   A straw or colored paper clips
</P>
<P>
   Colored acrylic paint
</P>
<P>
   Clear acrylic gloss paint
</P>
<P>
   Colored ribbon or twine
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to make it:
</P>
<P>
   In a large-size resealable plastic bag, combine flour, salt and
water; zip closed and knead until dough is well-mixed and without
lumps. (If dough is dry and crumbly, add more water, a few drops at
a time. If it feels too mushy and wet, add more flour, a sprinkle
at a time.)
</P>
<P>
   When it's smooth and of the consistency of cookie dough, you can
store it in a plastic bag in the refrigerator, but bring it to room
temperature when you're ready to use it.
</P>
<P>
   To make ornaments, use a rolling pin to flatten the bag of
dough, to \-inch thick. Zip open the bag, then cut each side open.
Fold back the top layer of plastic and use cookie cutters _ or a
knife and your own pattern _ to make the shapes you want. While the
dough is soft, either push a paper clip into the back of the
ornament, making sure the top of the clip sticks out over the
ornament, or use a straw to make a hole in the top of the ornament.
Lift away any unused dough; fold the plastic back over and knead
the leftovers together, reroll, peel back the plastic again, and
cut more shapes out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Let your cut-out ornaments sit on a flat surface in a cool, dry
place for two to three days, until they're thoroughly dry. Then
paint them with acrylic paint in colors and designs of your choice.
When dry, give them a coat of clear acrylic gloss. Thread short
lengths of ribbons through the paper clip or the hole you made, tie
the ribbon into a bow and hang your decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: Less than $5 for a dozen ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Time: Mixing, rolling and cutting the dough takes only about 30
minutes. Then it must dry for two to three days. Painting the
ornaments takes another 30 minutes; they take anywhere from several
hours to overnight to dry. A final coat of clear gloss needs
several more hours to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty: No special skills needed, but young children will
need adult help.
</P>
<P>
   Shrink art pins
</P>
<P>
   You may not want to wear your heart on your sleeve, but you can
wear your holiday cheer on your lapel with handmade pins using the
same principal as shrink-wrapping packages: Apply heat and watch it
get smaller.
</P>
<P>
   This craft can produce everything from tiny charms to large
sun-catchers you can hang in the window year-round. All you really
need to do is trace, bake and glue.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you'll need:
</P>
<P>
   1 package (6 sheets) Aleene's Opake Shrink-It plastic
</P>
<P>
   A design to copy
</P>
<P>
   Fine-grained sandpaper
</P>
<P>
   Fine-tipped pen
</P>
<P>
   Colored pencils or paints
</P>
<P>
   Scissors
</P>
<P>
   Pin backing or (for hanging) hole punch
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to make this craft:
</P>
<P>
   Use sandpaper to rough up the surface of the plastic sheets.
Choose an uncomplicated design from a coloring book, magazine or
other source and photocopy it so the copy is 160 percent of the
size you want your final project to be. Place the design under a
plastic sheet and use a fine-tipped pen to trace it onto the
plastic. Color design with pencils. (If you plan to use paints,
wait until after design is shrunk before painting.)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 275 F. Use scissors to cut designs from plastic
sheet. (Now is the time to punch a hole for hanging if you plan to
use your design as an ornament or charm instead of a pin). Place
plastic pieces, not touching, on a sheet of aluminum foil on a
baking sheet. Bake for 3 to 5 minutes. (Plastic will curl as it
shrinks but will uncurl and flatten as shrinking is finished.)
Remove from oven and cool. If using paint, paint them; let dry.
Coat finished designs with clear acrylic gloss paint or clear nail
polish and let dry. Adhere a pin to the back for a lapel pin (use
an adhesive pin, or use a hot glue gun to attach another kind of
pin), add to a bracelet for a charm, or tie a ribbon on it for
hanging.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: About $4 for a package of Aleene's Opake Shrink-It
plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 30 minutes, depending on the complexity of your
design and how much you embellish it with color. To save time, a
whole sheet of pins or ornaments can be made, then baked at once.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty: Moderately difficult; needs a steady hand. Children
will need help using the oven.

FIVE WONDERFUL AND INEXPENSIVE HOLIDAY CRAFT IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Saturday, Nov. 20) 
By Carol Bidwell 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's a bit of the crafter in any of us, it seems to wiggle
its way to the surface just about this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are we thinking about decorating for Hanukkah and
Christmas, but we're beginning to think about gifts, too. And as
any nonsmoking mom who's received a lopsided clay ashtray from her
offspring can attest, no matter what the gift, it's special when it
comes from someone you love and who loves you.
</P>
<P>
   But let's face it: Some crafts _ tole painting, needlework,
woodworking _ take more time, training and skill than most people
have.
</P>
<P>
   All crafts aren't difficult, though, otherwise Americans
wouldn't be spending $10 billion annually on crafts materials.
According to the Hobby Industry Association, more than four out of
every five American households have at least one family member
engaged in crafts and hobbies _ and 77 percent of crafters give
their crafts as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   We've come up with five crafts that just about anybody who can
wield a wooden spoon, a paint brush or a hot glue gun can do with a
minimal outlay of cash. Virtually all are easy enough for the kids
to do, but adults with an artistic bent can make some of them into
works of art, eminently respectable for gifting ... or for keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Build your own snow globe
</P>
<P>
   Shake up a snow globe and you reactivate the magic of childhood,
when it seemed you could make it snow at will, blanketing a tiny
scene with particles of ice and snow. And it's not that hard to
make your own, either to re-experience a chunk of your own
childhood or to introduce your children to a bit of the magic.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you'll need:
</P>
<P>
   1 empty, clear glass jar with tight-fitting lid
</P>
<P>
   1 small can spray paint
</P>
<P>
   Small glass, painted clay or ceramic figure
</P>
<P>
   2 cups water (more if jar is larger)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons glycerin (available at pharmacy)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons clear and/or white confetti
</P>
<P>
   Hot glue gun, glue sticks
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to make it:
</P>
<P>
   Paint lid of jar; let dry thoroughly. Turn lid over and paint
inside; let dry.
</P>
<P>
   Stir together water and glycerin in pitcher; pour into jar,
filling to within 1 inch of rim. Add confetti.
</P>
<P>
   With hot glue gun, glue the small figure (we used a cookie press
with a Santa as a handle) to the inside of the painted jar lid.
Squirt hot glue on the inside rim of the lid, then screw on lid.
Turn over and watch the snow fall.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: About $7, using a thrift-store jar for a globe. There'll
be enough glycerin, paint, confetti and glue left over to make
another globe or two with the addition of another lidded jar and
another figure to go inside.
</P>
<P>
   Time: Several hours, or overnight, to let painted lid dry.
Assembly takes less than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty: Easy. Small children may need help measuring and
pouring glycerin and water.
</P>
<P>
   Easy holiday candle
</P>
<P>
   Say ``candlemaking,'' and you conjure up images of pioneer women
slaving over vats of hot tallow, dipping wicks to give their family
light on moonless nights.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's much easier to shed a little light on the holidays
these days. While it's possible to buy paraffin _ or even bees' wax
_ at crafts stores, there's an easier and safer way.
</P>
<P>
   Our candles use a product called Candle Magic, which is finely
ground pieces of paraffin, about the texture of coarse sand. No
melting is necessary, so no little fingers get burned in the
process. And it makes much less of a mess, although it's best to
lay down a few sheets of newspaper before starting.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you'll need:
</P>
<P>
   A clean, attractive, clear-glass jar or mug, heavy enough to
withstand a bit of heat.
</P>
<P>
   A wick that reaches from the bottom of the jar or mug to a
couple of inches above the rim.
</P>
<P>
   One or more bags of Candle Magic.
</P>
<P>
   A pencil, chopstick or wooden spoon
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to make it:
</P>
<P>
   Place the wick in the center of the jar or mug, making sure it
touches bottom. Tape the top end of the wick around a pencil,
chopstick or wooden spoon to hold it in place, and tape the anchor
in place. Pour in the Candle Magic.
</P>
<P>
   You can make a candle of all one color, layer colors to make
stripes, run a knife through it to ``marbleize'' the colors, or
tilt the jar or mug gently and layer in colors to make slanted
stripes.
</P>
<P>
   When the jar is filled, your candle is done. Use the scissors to
cut the wick so a half-inch or more protrudes above the wax. Throw
away the unused portion of the wick and untape anchor rod from jar.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: For two candles, using heavy thrift-store mugs, about
$9.50. You'll have several wicks left over (from a package of five)
and possibly some Candle Magic, depending on the size of your mugs,
so you might be able to make a third, smaller candle for only the
additional cost of a small jar or mug.
</P>
<P>
   Time: Less than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty: Very easy. No special skills needed.

   SPORTS-PARENTS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Jupiter-Tequesta
Athletic Association has a novel idea for the 6,000 kids in its
youth leagues. Make good sportsmanship mandatory _ for the parents.
Beginning Jan. 1, the JTAA will be the first youth group in the
nation to require parents to attend an ethics class. (O'Meilia,

   HITLER-SILVERWARE _ ATLANTA _ Auction of Hitler tableware, at
Atlanta's Great Gatsby's, winds down. We take stock of the

their war trophies. (Hendrick, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

   GOLDCLUB _ ATLANTA _ The government's charges of organized crime
involvement against an Atlanta strip club and its owner and
operator sound tough on the surface, but most of those charges are
built on a filament of an association that occurred 15 years ago.
The indictment says the association with the Gambino mob continues,
but it is short on specifics. (Rankin, Atlanta

   SOFT-MONEY _ WASHINGTON _ A month after Senate Republicans
killed efforts to ban soft money, Time Warner executives announced
that the company will stop making the unregulated donations from
its corporate treasury to the political parties. The move makes
Time Warner _ the parent of Cable News Network, Time magazine and
Warner Brothers _ the fifth company to stop making donations of
soft money, so named because they are not subject to federal
contribution limits. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BOOKS-HILLARY _ Maybe it's her we should be building a library
for, not her husband. It probably goes without saying that Hillary
Rodham Clinton has broken the mold when it comes to U.S. first
ladies. It's still about 18 months until her husband leaves office,
and yet some 40 books already have been written largely or
completely about her. (Even the relatively controversial Nancy
Reagan barely hit double figures _ well after leaving the White
House.) And apparently, the deluge is just beginning. Last month it
was ``Bill and Hillary _ The Marriage.'' Come November it will be
publication of dueling tomes (including one from ``Passages''
author Gail Sheehy) purporting to take us inside Hillary's head.
And don't even get us started on the writers who've already signed
contracts to produce books about the all-but-declared Hillary
Clinton-Rudy Giuliani Senate race. A look at the phenomenon of
Hillary Literature and speculation on when _ and if _ it will ever
end. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   TEX-BROWN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ He's one of a select club in Texas,
a state senator whose imprint is on most of the environmental
legislation passed in the last two decades. He's talked about as a
candidate for lieutenant governor. But Sen. Buster Brown's had a
tough year, defending against charges of sexual harassment in the
workplace. Last week, the Republican Party in his Southeast Texas
district, which has been sending him to Austin since 1981, turned
against him. The Lake Jackson Republican Party said he should
resign because his sexual escapades make the party look bad.

<P>
   The change seemed to be a small one. British people buying the
new version of Apple Computer's operating system, OS9, noticed the
icon for deleting files wasn't called the Wastebasket anymore. It
was called the Trash.
</P>
<P>
   The result was uproar last week: for British users, accustomed
to having an English name for something, this was seen as part of a
creeping _ or possibly rampant _ change worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some, describing it as a ``slap in the face,'' have said they
will not buy the new version until Apple relents.
</P>
<P>
   That looks unlikely _ and not just on the computer front. Around
the world, British spellings such as ``colour'' and ``favour'' are
being overwhelmed by the American versions _ color, favor and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   American culture, exported in TV series, the Internet and the
language of computers, is overwhelming ``British English'' so fast
that it may not be a question of if, but when, our spellings and
colloquial uses are forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   John Simpson is familiar with the frustrations of the American
invasion of British English. ``Every time I spell-check a document,
the computer's dictionary seems to assume that I'm in America, and
I have to override it and put in the British spelling.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a common enough complaint; but for Simpson it has a
particular resonance. He is the chief editor of the Oxford English
Dictionaries, where he has worked for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odd thing is that there's actually only a small number of
words which are different, such as travelling, where Americans drop
the second `l,' or catalogue, where they drop the `ue,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the differences were introduced consciously in 1828 by
Noah Webster, who produced the first American dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not long after the War of Independence, and he wanted
to show that American English was different from British English _
that it had thrown off the overlordship of Britain. He was very
keen for American English to be completely respelt. It was a
political act.''
</P>
<P>
   The spread of American culture has gone far beyond what even
Webster might have imagined. The Independent's foreign
correspondents, in big cities around the world, confirmed that in
almost every case the form of English used is the American one.
</P>
<P>
   There have even been signs of that spread reaching the UK: a
couple of years ago the MP Diane Abbott was surprised to find local
children who thought the emergency number was 911 _ because ``call
911'' is what characters in American dramas yell.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Millum, director of development for the National
Association for the Teaching of English, thinks it is important to
distinguish between spelling _ which he thinks is comparatively
unimportant _ and colloquialism, which does matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we spell the word `colour' or `color' is really only
interesting to linguists and pedants like myself. But quirks, like
the choice between `Trash' or `Wastebasket,' add to the richness of
a language.
</P>
<P>
   ```Wastebasket' has meanings for us which differ from `Trash' or
`Trashcan.' And we say pavement where Americans say sidewalk _ but
they call the road the pavement. It can make a difference just in
terms of instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple remains steadfast. Peter Lowe, head of product marketing,
insisted that calling it ``Trash'' will make production of new
versions cheaper and faster.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Jary, editor-in-chief of Macworld UK magazine, is
unconvinced: ``Apple changes the paper to A4 from the American
sizes _ but they couldn't change this? It doesn't ring true.'' &QL;

<P>
   Talking Doorknobs, ingestible computers and telephones that do
not ring if there is nobody to answer them are the shape of new
technology in the next 10 years, according to an Internet guru.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Media Laboratory, made his predictions when
addressing an audience in London Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``You may wonder about how computing could possibly
affect something like a doorknob. But if you think about it, an
intelligent doorknob would be a really useful thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not need keys: it could identify you by your
fingerprints, and perhaps confirm your identity by asking a
question, `What's your mother's maiden name?' for example.''
</P>
<P>
   The smart doorknob could also accept parcel deliveries _ and
perhaps sign digitally for them; ``and maybe it could let the dog
out, and then let it back in while keeping out the other nine dogs
following it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology required to do that is already sufficiently
miniaturized, he said, and could pervade our world. ``We will have
thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of embedded chips around us,
all intercommunicating,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Negroponte, author of the book ``Being Digital,''
espouses the view that anything that can be expressed as computer
``bits'' _ including words, images and sound _ will eventually be
transmitted in that form across the world, speeding deals and
cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   As computers shrink and become pervasive over the next decade,
the sort of information they can access will grow, he forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a really futuristic product for 10 years hence,
you'll have computers that you eat, one per day. (They) will
contain devices and sensors which will record all your anatomical
measurements, what's going on inside you, and relay them to a black
box that you wear on your belt. If it passes through you, no
problem _ swallow another.'' Such systems would be invaluable to
doctors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Negroponte also foresees telephone handsets becoming
smarter. ``Phones should be built smart enough to know if there's
nobody there. And if there is someone there, they should be able to
answer them, like a good butler, and find out who is calling and
why, and only then decide whether to get our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are still some giant steps to be made for the average
user of computers, he admitted. ``Who would have believed, ten
years ago, that big segments of the population would spend between
$1,600 and $3,200 on their own computers _ and that those machines
would reduce people to tears once or twice a week?'' &QL;

<P>
   If the prospect of two weeks in Marbella bores you and even a
walking vacation in Patagonia fails to excite you, perhaps it is
time to start planning a long weekend in space.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years this may mean a day trip to low earth orbit
or, by 2017, at a vacation resort resembling a cross between a
theme park and a cruise ship where space tourists can stay for as
long as they like.
</P>
<P>
   These and other such plans for vacation 200 miles above the
Earth's surface were unveiled this week at the World Travel Market,
the tourism trade show in west London.
</P>
<P>
   Guests must travel lightly and be prepared for space sickness,
but highlights include the opportunity for weightless sex in one of
the honeymoon suites and some awe-inspiring vacation snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolff, vice-president of Wimberly Allison Tong &AMP; Goo
(WAT&AMP;G), a U.S. architectural firm specializing in leisure resorts
which has designed a 100-room orbiting hotel, said: ``An increasing
number of people are seeking some kind of transformative
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking for more than a vacation on the beach and
want something more to show for it than just a tan. And what could
be a more life-transforming experience than seeing our planet from
200 miles up?''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff is confident that there is a market for space tourism and,
in the U.S. at least, it is an idea that appears to have taken off.
</P>
<P>
   More than 93,000 people have put their name down on PanAm's
waiting list for flights to the moon while 15 million visitors went
to land-based space attractions last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 1,500 North Americans, 34 percent said they would
be interested in a two-week trip aboard a space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   WAT&AMP;G's orbiting resort would use recycled external fuel tanks
salvaged from future space shuttle launches. There will be a
viewing deck on board with computer images to help guests identify
which parts of the Earth they are looking at.
</P>
<P>
   Guests will be served food grown hydroponically on board and can
keep fit by playing ball games in zero gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like developing a new, vast and wonderful frontier,''
Wolff said. ``But the point will be to strike a balance between
creating an out-of-this-world experience and providing some
creature comforts that travellers have come to expect from other
destination resorts.'' &QL;

 &HT;    IN SPUR OF THE MOMENT, CLINTON DELIVERS DRAMATIC MESSAGE TO
YELTSIN
 &HT;    With CLINTON-OSCE-1119.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Sometimes history unfolds on the fly, even in
the most scripted of moments.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Russian leader Boris Yeltsin tell the rest of the
world to keep its nose out of Moscow's brutal military campaign in
Chechnya, President Clinton was struck by the irony of the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't this the guy, Clinton recalled, who captured the support
of the world and turned the tide of an anti-democratic coup in
August of 1991 by jumping on top of a tank in Moscow and shaking
his fist in the face of tyranny?
</P>
<P>
   What if the world had turned a deaf ear to Yeltsin's cause,
Clinton wondered, as he awaited his turn to speak Thursday before
his 53 counterparts from member states of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And so Clinton pulled out a pen and, in the few minutes
remaining, scribbled into his prepared speech what would become the
most dramatic passage of the day's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Yeltsin, one of the most thrilling experiences of my
life as a citizen of the world before I became president, was when
you stood up on that tank in Moscow, when they tried to take the
freedom of the Russian people away,'' Clinton began. ``Your
standing there on that tank said to those people, you can do this,
but you'll have to kill me first.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he continued, as nearly one-third of the world's leaders
sat listening in rapt silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had put you in jail instead of electing you president,
I would hope that every leader of every country around this table
would have stood up for you and for freedom in Russia and not said,
well, that is an internal Russian affair that we cannot be a part
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later told reporters it was a question of spur of the
moment rhetoric meant to convey a timeless notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose he hadn't prevailed. Suppose the Russian military had
taken him down off the tank, thrown him in jail and announced they
were going to execute him,'' Clinton said. ``I would hope that the
entire world represented around that OSCE table today would have
gone into an absolute uproar of outrage about it and would have
saved his life and helped restore democracy. That's the point I was
trying to make.''

LATEST IN MUSIC COMES OF AGE IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The suits were a sign.
</P>
<P>
   There weren't many of them, to be sure, and they were in the
requisite black. But the fact that anyone at all was wearing one
drew more attention than did the conference goer with magenta hair.
It was unintended _ and sometimes unwelcome _ evidence that both
they and the on-line music industry are maturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, isn't it?'' said Sunjay Guleria, clad in a black
blazer over blue jeans and impossibly hip eyewear. ``I remember
when I used to be one of the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Guleria is 29, hardly ancient by any standard. The exhibit hall
at the three-day extravaganza known as webnoize, put on by the
Stoneham-based company of the same name, was packed with people his
age. More than a few industry veterans have already cracked 30, a
pronouncement often accompanied by a wince. Anyone over 40 was an
obvious minority.
</P>
<P>
   But in an industry as young and as demographically specific as
digital music, youth is relative. It also rules. Among the
conference attendees were teenagers available to explain some of
the latest technologies and recent college graduates congratulating
each other on taking their companies public.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard in the Century Plaza Hotel lobby, one early
twentysomething to another, both wearing yellow-tinted sunglasses
indoors, one with a cell phone headset plugged into his ear: ``Hi.
Nice to meet you. Congratulations on those stock options.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the nearly 1,000 people who had registered for the
conference, which sold out at $895 a ticket, they had come to
Southern California as much to see and to be seen, or to find out
who's up to what in the fast-moving world of digital music, as to
attend panel discussions with titles like ``Virtual Skulls &AMP;
Crossbones: Music Piracy and the Internet'' and ``Staffing for the
Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But upstairs in the lobby bar, and on the patio where spreads of
sushi and fajitas and linguini were set out, the talk was also
about what after-hours concerts and receptions to attend. Microsoft
Corp.'s bowling party was invitation only. Everyone was invited to
hear the group Supreme Beings of Leisure play at Listen.com's West
Hollywood gala. Webnoize may not come close in size or power to
Comdex, the mega-computer conference taking place in Las Vegas this
week, but it was where computer geekiness and cool converged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a level of excitement here; everyone seems pumped,''
said Monty Schmidt, 35, president of Sonic Foundry Media Services.
``You can sense that people know they're on to something.''
</P>
<P>
   That something is the ability to sell music on the Internet,
circumventing the traditional record labels by allowing listeners
to download music directly to their computers and then carry it
with them on portable players. These days, anyone can sell their
music on line, and sometimes it seems everyone is. In the
competitive world of Web sites now aimed at teenage and young adult
listeners, the garage band is god.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh definitely there's going to be a fallout,'' said Matt
Garman, 23, who described himself as Riffage.com's ``e-commerce
wizard,'' then handed over a blue business card with the more
formal title of online commerce manager. ``There aren't enough
bands for all the sites. It's going to be about who can get the
bands, who has enough money to do the marketing, who's the more
artist friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also, according to display after display, about
interaction with the audience. Almost to a web site, each one
claimed a unique feature. Each one claimed that users in effect
control the sites themselves. Still, one claim was indisputable:
the way young people interact with music has less to do with
flipping on the stereo than with becoming a part of the equipment
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bane, a 33-year-old strategic account executive at STV
Streaming Video Solutions, said: ``Absolutely, convergence is where
it's at. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, but we don't
know how long that tunnel is or if there's another tunnel after it.
But we're all racing to be the one to get there first.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Roli Jr., 29, president and publisher of webnoize, which in
part covers the on-line music industry, added: ``The music idustry
is not just the music industry anymore. It's how do you do videos,
how do you do games, how do you get people involved.''
</P>
<P>
   At the mycaster.com booth, for instance, Jason Kay, vice
president of business development, demonstrated a personal
broadcast system that allows users to become virtual disc jockeys,
creating their own radio stations and even airing their own
thoughts over the Internet. Among the stations operating: ``A
Stoned Guy in Texas'' and a group of Australian college students
who have open-mike discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in a private suite, the icast.com senior vice
president, Geoffrey Miller, promised to ``give members the tools to
express themselves creatively way past home pages.'' In
non-Webspeak, that means users will be able to edit their own music
and videos, then share them with the rest of the world once the
entertainment portal launches in January.
</P>
<P>
   The only downside to all the digital downloading appeared to be
that with only so many eyeballs and advertising dollars to go
around, no one is making money at it yet.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't dampen the party.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In parts of this city's Dorchester neighborhood, home
to as many as 20,000 Vietnamese-Americans, trappings of the
homeland are visible in each shop window and on every street
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Stores crowding Dorchester Avenue offer videotapes of cai luong,
traditional Vietnamese folk opera, as well as foods like canned
rambutan, jackfruit chips, and prawn crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductions of the red-striped yellow flag of the former
Saigon government, which fell to communist forces in 1975, are
prominently displayed in homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And looming over all of this, some believe, is a perceived image
of Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese communist leader, painted in the
blue stripe of an abstract rainbow adorning the Boston Gas tank on
Dorchester Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But many Vietnamese immigrants call Ho Chi Minh a pariah in
their neighborhood. It is one of Boston's most curious ironies for
members of this staunchly anticommunist community that in their
midst sits the 73,000-square-foot rainbow in which many discern the
face of Ho.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the Vietnamese in Dorchester left their homeland to
escape the communist regime that imprisoned them, appropriated
their businesses, and shuttered their churches when it occupied
South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Chi Minh, who founded and led the country's communist
movement until his death in 1969, personifies tyranny in the eyes
of most Vietnamese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ho Chi Minh and me are enemies,'' Phanreil Thach, 46, on his
way to shop at the Vien-Dong Far East Supermarket, said in a
typical comment.
</P>
<P>
   Corita Kent, the late artist, pacifist, and former nun who
designed the prize-winning peace rainbow in 1971, denied that the
image of the man known in Vietnam today as ``Uncle Ho'' is embedded
in the mural.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Vietnamese believe that, in Big Brother fashion,
Uncle Ho is watching.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about the gas tank's hidden face have passed along
Dorchester Avenue as the Vietnamese community has burgeoned in
recent years. The story is repeated over banh mi thit sandwiches
and cups of ca phe sua, Vietnamese coffee served with sweetened
condensed milk.
</P>
<P>
   Some consider the rainbow an insult. Others are indifferent,
uninterested in any reminder of the turbulent past. Many simply do
not believe that Ho's image overlooks the Vietnamese beauty salons
and travel agencies from a mere three blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   The range of reactions represents the conflicting emotions that
pull at the Vietnamese community about whether to continue waging
the ideological battles of the past or to leave politics behind in
pursuit of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   Dorchester pharmacist Tuan Q. Tran and his 20-year-old daughter,
Mai Khanh, are typical in their feelings. Tran lectures tirelessly
about the evils of communism in a tone reminiscent of his former
life as a high school teacher in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, born in the United States and now in college, has
no interest in the subject of communism or, by extension, the gas
tank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Tran joined a group of Vietnam veterans protesting the
silhouette of Ho Chi Minh, whose facial features and long beard
they see outlined on the left side of the blue stripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot bring Hitler into the Jewish community and see how
they respond,'' Tran said. ``It's the same thing to bring Ho Chi
Minh into the Vietnamese community.''
</P>
<P>
   Tran, 55, is a small man with a coarse mustache and tiny stubble
on the chin of his round face. At the pharmacy, he wears a dress
shirt and tie with New Balance sneakers, dispensing prescriptions
amid rows of Asian nonperishable foods.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-class teacher in his youth, Tran was drafted into the
Saigon government's army in 1968. After 1975, because of his
military service, he spent four years in what the communists called
``reeducation camp.'' Tran calls it prison.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was fed a starvation diet, made to clear minefields
with his bare hands, and force-fed Marxist-Leninist ideology. It
was an experience shared by thousands of other South Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Vietnamese immigrants in America, Tran undertook a
perilous escape by boat. He left with his wife, who was eight
months pregnant, and friends. One man's baby died during the 13-day
journey without food or fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Communism, Tran said, ruined the prosperity of South Vietnam and
brought years of suffering to him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   In South Vietnam, ``we had freedom. We were practicing a
democracy,'' Tran said. ``Suddenly, the communists came in and we
cannot talk; we cannot move; we cannot stand up and raise our
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk, however, means little to Mai Khanh Tran, 20, who
studies finance at Bentley College, or to her three sisters, none
of them born in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know too much about it, and I'm not too interested,''
she said. ``We would rather (our father) didn't impose his beliefs
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mai Khanh doesn't understand why Boston Gas has to upset
her father and the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put a little blue paint on the beard or something,'' she said.
``I don't see how that would bother anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a move is out of the question, according to Boston Gas,
because Kent's creation is a copyrighted work of art _ the largest
in the world. Kent died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will read whatever they want into many things,'' said
Kathleen Hearn, director of public and government relations at
Boston Gas. ``We absolutely do not agree that it has anything to do
with Ho Chi Minh at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of Dorchester's Vietnamese take Boston Gas at its word.
Henry Hiep Tran, 46, calls the image a fantasy of agitated Vietnam
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the vets, after the war, they have memories; they
imagine things,'' said Tran, tapping his temple to indicate that Ho
is all in the head. So Tran, a former South Vietnamese helicopter
gunner who escaped in 1975, is not bothered, though he calls Ho Chi
Minh ``a cheat and a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Vietnamese-Americans would rather not talk about the past,
saying that constant recriminations drain energy away from building
a prosperous life in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't remind me of Ho Chi Minh,'' said Martin Khoi Pham, who
spent 14 years in a reeducation camp because he had been a colonel
in Saigon's army. ``I don't want to remember. When the communists
took over, I lost everything. I've already lost too much of my
life.''

LOOKING AT THE PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT THE CARS

<P>
   Since in addition to being personally fascinated with autos, I
also write about them, shows like the New England International
Auto Show are fun in a couple of ways.
</P>
<P>
   In one manner, I approach them just as most of you do: spot
interesting-looking cars, walk around them, and check their lines
from all angles; climb into the drivers' seats and imagine myself
the owner; sit in the back and get the feel for being a passenger.
Grab literature. Check sticker prices. Walk and gawk until my feet
get sore.
</P>
<P>
   But since writing about cars also means having some
understanding of the people who buy them, it's also fun to attend
an auto show and, while moving among the cars, watch you folks
check them out.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it easy to spot trends: which cars are clicking with
which groups of people.
</P>
<P>
   It makes it easy to spot enduring traits: which groups of people
are borne back ceaselessly to the same brands, year after year,
even as those brands may be changing radically.
</P>
<P>
   And it is also inevitable that you run across irony and humor as
you listen to certain folks comment on cars.
</P>
<P>
   Like the guy, wearing a ``Buy American'' button standing before
a Toyota Tundra pickup truck and exhorting that he would never buy
something made in Japan. He was surprised when I told him it was
built by American hands in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Or the yahoo who approached a glistening Saleen Mustang
convertible, set his Pepsi on the polished rear deck and announced
so all could hear: ``I have one of these puppies. It's not a
Saleen, but it's a Mustang.'' Right, and Charlie Parker may have
been OK, but Neil Diamond in ``The Jazz Singer'' was just awesome.
</P>
<P>
   But if you watched carefully, there were serious, interesting
observations to be made about both cars and the people who studied
them:
</P>
<P>
   --Any time you saw a group of young kids (as in too young to
drive) rolling rapidly across the floor, you knew they were headed
to the Volkswagen Beetles.
</P>
<P>
   --It was almost endearing to watch young couples sit in the
front seats of Mercedes and dream of the day any one of these might
be their car.
</P>
<P>
   --Families of four or more, of course, went to the vans and
SUVs, but you spotted them again later circling the four-door,
six-passenger pickup trucks that are in abundance this year.
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of vans, don't many of them seem to be getting
progressively smaller?
</P>
<P>
   --Older folks formed the steadiest lines to the Lincoln and
Cadillac displays and many had to be surprised at the youthful
sportiness of the Lincoln LS or the Cadillac Catera.
</P>
<P>
   --Watching large groups of people emerge from the gargantuan
Ford Excursion reminded me of a day at the circus. How many clowns
could you fit into one of those beasts?
</P>
<P>
   --In this day and age, why do sellers of automobiles think they
must use tall, thin women in tight clothes to sell us their cars?
</P>
<P>
   --At a show where flash and glitz are at a premium, it is
amazing how those fabulous Porsche automobiles can sit there
looking so benign.
</P>
<P>
   --The bug look is obviously in for the latest generation of SUVs
_ that's bug as in having an exoskeleton in the form of racks,
step-up rails, and various tubes wrapped over and around the autos.
It was most noticeable in the Kia Sportage 4 x 4, the Sportage EX,
the Nissan Xterra, and the Isuzu VehiCross.
</P>
<P>
   --Not buglike at all but out there on the edge where SUV meets
car meets sport vehicle are the BMW X5 and the Mercedes ML55 AMG _
both as comfortable at up to 135-150 m.p.h. as they are off road.
</P>
<P>
   --Seeing this evolution in SUVs made me wonder how long Jeep can
wait before designing something beyond the basic box (rounding off
corners on Cherokees is not a major design statement) that will
appeal to younger drivers.
</P>
<P>
   --You want cars that look fast and sleek just sitting there?
Here are a few that caught my eye: the Saab Aero 9-5, the BMW M5,
the Cadillac Catera, the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, the Subaru Imprezza
RS all-wheel-drive, the Audi TT Quattro, and the CL 500 Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   --Looking futuristic yet retro was the new Ford Thunderbird,
this one a yellow bird, its doors open like wings and exposing a
plush interior as the car spun on its platform.
</P>
<P>
   --Remember the old Dodge Power Wagon: looming, almost toothy up
at the grill. A prototype at the show was definitely modern, but
decidedly evocative of the old beast. If those buglike SUVs ever
marched to war, this Power Wagon could lead them.
</P>
<P>
   --The rush to build the four-door truck that is an SUV that is a
car proceeds headlong with Ford's F-150 Supercab, the Chevrolet
Silverado, the Dakota Sport, the Nissan Frontier, and the Toyota
Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   --Clashing examples of SUVs turned into one of the above: the
Ford Explorer Sport Trac is the SUV with a bed added and it works
superbly. The Lincoln attempt _ turning a Navigator into a
Blackwood _ is just plain ugly. A Lincoln SUV-pickup? Spare us.
</P>
<P>
   --And finally, one thing any good auto show needs is a display
of exotics, those cars most folks don't even get to see up close
and personal, let alone own. I know the intent of the show is to
sell, but a Ferrari or Lamborghini display sprinkled here and there
would add greatly to the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Update:
</P>
<P>
   In a review of the Mercury Sable a few weeks back, I wrote that
the car had an intermittent but troubling wind noise. Credit the
Ford Motor Co. with jumping on the problem. The company sent an
engineer out to test the car and determined that some of the rails
that guide the windows up and down to tight closings had been
incorrectly installed. Since the car was a factory prototype, it's
not a problem you should expect on production models.

 &HT;    Y2K EXPECTED TO CAUSE FEW FOOD SUPPLY PROBLEMS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans shopping for their New Year's Eve parties
will find an impressive bounty in the grocery stores, despite any
small problems caused by the Y2K bug, Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of mounds of groceries stuffed into carts at a
Giant Food store in suburban Washington, Glickman proclaimed that
``the food system is not at risk'' of failure from the Y2K bug, a
programming flaw that could cause some computerized equipment to
fail on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that grocery stores may be hit with ``some spot
shortages'' of perishable foods in late December as people
stockpile before the date change. In addition, a few older
computers in stores might malfunction. ``But the problems will be
negligible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers and retailers carry a 30- to 60-day supply of
nonperishable food, he said, so even if power outages or other
difficulties disrupt normal food production, the nation could
absorb the impact with little effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade association, says
food makers have spent $1.8 billion fixing and testing computers to
avoid any production problems Jan. 1. Stores also are in good
shape, with 96 percent of all checkout scanners now set to properly
process date information.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Y2K
Conversion, also participated in the press conference. For months,
he has been urging consumers to have on hand a three-day supply of
food and water as the New Year approaches. But he warned against
waiting until the final days of December to shop.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the period between Christmas and New Year's Eve
will be a ``high-activity time,'' with many people preparing for
millennium parties. If everyone rushes for the cheese balls and
salami at the same time on New Year's Eve, stores could see spot
shortages. ``Don't wait till the last day,'' he said.

   A wild-child earth mother pulls up stakes and moves her
precocious daughter across the country. The two fuss and feud,
switch familial roles and, after enduring some hard times and
rotten men, they eventually strike a truce and form a mutual
appreciation society.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? It should to anyone who saw ``Anywhere but
Here,'' Wayne Wang's well-intentioned road picture, earlier this
month. That movie, starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman,
smoothed out the rough edges of Mona Simpson's searing novel to
such a degree that the finished product barely registered. It would
be hard for a film to be any less involving.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case with the similarly themed ``Tumbleweeds,''
which takes the same premise and has the courage to run with it.
While the film doesn't stake out any territory that hasn't already
been visited by, say, ``Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,'' it does
have a bawdy sense of humor, candid honesty and terrific
performances in the lead roles. And that's enough to make you want
to take a trip with this mother-daughter team.
</P>
<P>
   Well-regarded British stage actress Janet McTeer plays Mary Jo
Walker, a Southern firecracker who tends to fall for, and quite
often marry, whatever man crosses her line of vision. The film's
opening moments find Mary Jo and her 12-year-old daughter, Ava
(Kimberly Brown), fleeing from the latest catastrophe and hitting
the road, destination unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo is on the constant lookout for Prince Charming; her self
worth is tied to her dating status. Ava has learned from her manic
mom's mistakes and isn't afraid to question her when poor judgment
is exercised _ which is often the case.
</P>
<P>
   The two relocate to Starlight Beach, a fictional coastal town
north of San Diego. Ava makes friends, finds a calling in her
school's production of ``Romeo and Juliet'' and attracts the
interest of a loopy classmate, Adam (Cody McMains), whose hairstyle
becomes more unlikely each time we seem him.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo, meanwhile, takes up with a trucker, Dan (the film's
director and co-writer, Gavin O'Connor), who she met on the road.
Mary Jo believes that this time she might have found the stability
she has long craved, but it's apparent (to the audience, at least)
that history has a way of repeating itself and that Mary Jo needs
to learn a lesson or two before she can move on.
</P>
<P>
   McTeer, displaying an expert ability to affect a North Carolina
accent, oozes brassy charm and hits every right
</P>
<P>
   note in her demanding role. It's an electrifying turn. Brown,
best-known for her work on the soap opera ``Guiding Light,'' is
equally good, imbuing her bright 12-year-old with an assured
authenticity that never lapses into cutie-pie antics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the credit for that should go to the charming and
touching screenplay, written by O'Connor and his ex-wife, Angela
Shelton. O'Connor, who cast himself apparently as a cost-cutting
measure, shows a sure hand in the director's chair, making
``Tumbleweeds'' a kind of intimate family snapshot that we're lucky
enough to glimpse.

2000 JETTA TDI _ A DIESEL THAT'S FUN TO DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The time: A glorious Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The place: Interstate 95 in New Hampshire and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The car: A 2000 VW Jetta TDI. The TDI signifies that a
turbocharged, direct-injection diesel engine is powering us along.
</P>
<P>
   We're zipping along about 70 miles per hour in the middle lanes
as a steady line of SUVs zooms past in the high-speed lane. Most
have one or two people aboard and don't look to be loaded with
anything more than a suitcase or two.
</P>
<P>
   I turn to Mrs. G and say: ``It's a self-righteous feeling to be
driving a vehicle that's getting 49 miles per gallon while all
those cars are getting about a third of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, self-righteousness only counts for so much. The truth
is that this Jetta is flat-out fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My prior experience with diesels was limited.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a former colleague racked up 100,000 miles on a
diesel VW Rabbit and used to rave about how much he loved the car _
and the great gas mileage it got.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Roy, a mechanic for a fleet of oil trucks, had a diesel
Chevy pickup truck in the late '70s. He had nothing but trouble and
couldn't get rid of it soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   My new son-in-law, Stefano, drives a turbocharged Fiat Punto
around Milan. My few rides in the car have shown it to be a totally
reliable vehicle. It has big rubber bumpers for forcing its way
into parking spaces; it's easy on gas; and it more than holds its
own on the high-speed autostradas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus I was somewhat less than fully prepared when this Jetta TDI
arrived for a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   Did I have to deal with letting glow plugs heat up before it
would start? (No.) Would it give itself away with rocks-in-a-pail
diesel vibration? (No . . . just enough rattling at idle to let you
know it was a diesel.) Would it smoke like an 18-wheeler? (No
again.)
</P>
<P>
   This is a nifty package. On the road, it's hard to believe that
there's only 90 horsepower under the hood emanating from 116 cubic
inches (1.9 liters). The TDI cruises effortlessly at highway speeds
_ moving with the flow of traffic anywhere from 5 to 15 m.p.h. over
the posted limits. From a dead stop, it effortlessly climbs the
mountain road leading to home.
</P>
<P>
   At 60 m.p.h., the tach read 2,000 r.p.m. _ a tried-and-true
benchmark for long engine life.
</P>
<P>
   We'd driven it well over 300 miles and the gas gauge had barely
dropped to midway, leading to a common first reaction: ``That gauge
is broken!''
</P>
<P>
   The Jetta's previous driver had complained because the best
mileage he could get was 49.5. We were hoping to hit 50, but a
frantic call from VW recalled the test car before we reached the
pumps. It seems that someone put out the word (erroneously) that
the car hadn't been cleared to be sold in Massachusetts (it has).
</P>
<P>
   Our abbreviated test was a disappointment, but it didn't prevent
the family from reaching a conclusion: This package is a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certain cars and certain engine-gearing combinations just seem
to click with me. The first time I really appreciated it in a
four-cylinder was in a '94 Honda EX. Later, I came across it in a
Mazda Protege ES. This Jetta hit my personal bull's-eye by putting
its torque just where you want to use it _ on highway on-ramps, in
passing situations, when accelerating from the endless traffic
lights and stop signs we deal with daily. Did you ever notice that
TV commercials rarely place the product in a traffic jam _ unless
the car is going to magically fly over it all?
</P>
<P>
   The reason to write about this Jetta was strictly the diesel
engine. Royal Ford, who regularly reviews autos for the Globe, gave
the top-of-the-line V6 Jetta a solid thumbs-up earlier this fall,
and we found no reason to argue with his review.
</P>
<P>
   The TDI was the basic GL trim level and has an MSRP of $17,995.
</P>
<P>
   As the price of gas marches toward $1.50 a gallon _ up about 40
percent since spring when I actually filled up for 89 cents a
gallon _ you'd think folks might look more closely at diesels, but
VW's Steve Keyes doesn't think that's the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that gas would have to hit $2 a gallon _
and maybe a lot higher _ before folks would buy for economy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are diesel fans out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 5 percent of the market will look at a diesel,'' said
Keyes. ``And those are the folks you can't get out of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Count me among them. Self-righteous? Not really. Just a guy
savoring a car that's fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The back door shape. You have to make like a matador dodging a
bull to let the chest-high curve of the door past you.
</P>
<P>
   --The center armrest. In the down position, it interferes with
shifting, using the handbrake, and fastening seat belts. In the up
position, you can't get at the stuff stored in the top container _
cell phone, directions, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The red and blue dashboard lights.
</P>
<P>
   --Trunk space. You have to see it to believe it.

 &HT;    Y2K EXPECTED TO CAUSE FEW FOOD SUPPLY PROBLEMS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans shopping for their New Year's Eve parties
will find an impressive bounty in the grocery stores, despite any
small problems caused by the Y2K bug, Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of mounds of groceries stuffed into carts at a
Giant Food store in suburban Washington, Glickman proclaimed that
``the food system is not at risk'' of failure from the Y2K bug, a
programming flaw that could cause some computerized equipment to
fail on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that grocery stores may be hit with ``some spot
shortages'' of perishable foods in late December as people
stockpile before the date change. In addition, a few older
computers in stores might malfunction. ``But the problems will be
negligible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers and retailers carry a 30- to 60-day supply of
nonperishable food, he said, so even if power outages or other
difficulties disrupt normal food production, the nation could
absorb the impact with little effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade association, says
food makers have spent $1.8 billion fixing and testing computers to
avoid any production problems Jan. 1. Stores also are in good
shape, with 96 percent of all checkout scanners now set to properly
process date information.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Y2K
Conversion, also participated in the press conference. For months,
he has been urging consumers to have on hand a three-day supply of
food and water as the New Year approaches. But he warned against
waiting until the final days of December to shop.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the period between Christmas and New Year's Eve
will be a ``high-activity time,'' with many people preparing for
millennium parties. If everyone rushes for the cheese balls and
salami at the same time on New Year's Eve, stores could see spot
shortages. ``Don't wait till the last day,'' he said.

   BODY-ART-EXHIBIT (New York) _ ``Body Art: Marks of Identity,''
at the American Museum of Natural History, is a transparent effort
on the part of a family-style institution to heat up its image and
pull in a fresh audience, one that probably couldn't care less
about large, extinct reptiles with tiny brains. The theme is
personal adornment of the most intimate kind, usually applied
directly onto or into the skin. The exhibition _ smart, extremely
entertaining and assembled in record time _ is geared to the
current fashion-as-art vogue. The packed installation offers just
enough bare, multicultural flesh to inspire viewer rubbernecking,
without actually being an adults-only affair. By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   GULBENKIAN-COLLECTION (New York) _ What is there to be said
about the Metropolitan Museum of Art's wonderful exhibition of
treasures from the legendary collection that Calouste Gulbenkian
assiduously brought into being in the first half of this century,
and then left to the world in the form a private museum in Lisbon
where he spent the last dozen years of his life? See it, enjoy it,
pore over its every object from beginning to end, that is, from a
17th-century Armenian illuminated Bible to a vitrine of three
Japanese lacquers. In between lie extraordinary examples of Islamic
and Turkish textiles and ceramics, 18th-century silver, European
painting and the Art Nouveau jewelry of Rene Lalique. Glean all you

they cast on generation after generation down through time. By

   1. BILL BRADLEY'S NAOMI WOLF, by Jacob Weisberg
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Al Gore isn't the only candidate with a guru.
Bill Bradley has one too, a Harvard professor by the name of Cornel
West. While West is not being paid by the Bradley campaign, as
Naomi Wolf is by Gore's campaign, he plays an analogous role as
affiliated intellectual. Where Wolf advises Gore about how to score
with women voters, West is helping Bradley appeal to blacks. And as
in the Gore-Wolf case, the benefits of the Bradley-West
relationship are clearly reciprocal.

   2. DICK MORRIS TAKES HIS ACT TO THE INTERNET, by William Saletan
</P>
<P>
   Like his past careers as Bill Clinton's savior, confessor,
accuser, and pundit-translator, Dick Morris' latest incarnation as
Internet democracy-builder is an act. He's not building direct
democracy with his vote.com Web site. He's building a rather
different political system, which might more aptly be called
dickmorrisy.

   3. ARE BRADLEY'S JOCK ENDORSERS REALLY HELPING? by William
Saletan
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of history's greatest basketball players headlined a
Madison Square Garden fund-raiser for Bill Bradley last Sunday. The
event, complete with cheerleaders, movie stars, and lights and
music reminiscent of an NBA game, enthralled the press. But Bradley
has pitched himself as a man of substance in a world corrupted by
glitz. So it's worth asking whether the jocks' media blitz for
Bradley, punctuated by their full-court press on Sunday's political
talk shows, conveyed anything of substance.

   4. THE DEMISE OF `ULTIMATE FIGHTING' by David Plotz
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club,'' a movie about a fictional organization of men
who strip down and beat each other to pulp, has provoked more than
its share of media hand-wringing. It has not, however, sparked an
iota of interest in a real organization of men who strip down and
beat each other to pulp: the Ultimate Fighting Championship. UFC's
flameout from national sensation to total irrelevance is a tragedy
of American sports, a cautionary tale of prudishness, heavy-handed
politics, and cultural myopia.

   2. DICK MORRIS TAKES HIS ACT TO THE INTERNET, by William Saletan
</P>
<P>
   Like his past careers as Bill Clinton's savior, confessor,
accuser, and pundit-translator, Dick Morris' latest incarnation as
Internet democracy-builder is an act. He's not building direct
democracy with his vote.com Web site. He's building a rather
different political system, which might more aptly be called
dickmorrisy.

   4. THE DEMISE OF `ULTIMATE FIGHTING' by David Plotz
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club,'' a movie about a fictional organization of men
who strip down and beat each other to pulp, has provoked more than
its share of media hand-wringing. It has not, however, sparked an
iota of interest in a real organization of men who strip down and
beat each other to pulp: the Ultimate Fighting Championship. UFC's
flameout from national sensation to total irrelevance is a tragedy
of American sports, a cautionary tale of prudishness, heavy-handed
politics, and cultural myopia.

BILL BRADLEY'S NAOMI WOLF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JACOB WEISBERG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Washington Post published an editorial about the
Naomi Wolf business that drew a contrast between Al Gore's and Bill
Bradley's uses of advisers. The editors noted that while Gore is a
sucker for trendy gurus peddling magical elixirs, Bradley relies
only on trusted long-term advisers (``who think nothing of sharing
hotel rooms in order to save money'').
</P>
<P>
   But as Wolf quite reasonably pointed out in TV appearances last
week, Bradley has a guru too, a Harvard professor by the name of
Cornel West.
</P>
<P>
   While West is not being paid by the Bradley campaign, as Wolf is
by Gore's campaign, he plays an analogous role as affiliated
intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   Where Wolf advises Gore about how to score with women voters,
West is helping Bradley appeal to blacks. And as in the Gore-Wolf
case, the benefits of the Bradley-West relationship are clearly
reciprocal. As a result of his association with a leading
presidential candidate, West can expect to see his fame and his
already formidable lecture fees rise. I don't think he shares hotel
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit to being poorly disposed toward West, mainly on the
basis of a devastating critique in the New Republic by Leon
Wieseltier that appeared in year 1995. In a long review-essay,
Wieseltier demolished West's stature as a ``public intellectual,''
portraying him as a pretentious egomaniac, a mass of
contradictions, and a superficial thinker who dresses up diluted
Marxism in incomprehensible phraseology. An obvious column idea
suggested itself: Bradley's guru is much wackier than Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Then I read some of West's writings. While he certainly can be
eccentric, solipsistic, and turgid, at his best moments West is
shrewd, courageous, and inspirational. I remain ambivalent about
his work, but it is certainly not, as Wieseltier asserts ``almost
completely worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't trouble me at all that West is advising Bradley. In
fact, it makes me respect Bradley, for openly engaging a
self-described socialist who may prove a big political liability to
his campaign, mainly because he finds him insightful and
stimulating.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get some of West's obvious faults out of the way. His
vanity is indeed considerable. West's picture invariably appears on
the cover of his books, and their interiors contain nearly as many
self-references as those of that other Bradley mentor, Pat
Moynihan. West goes on tremendous name-dropping riffs. The
just-published Cornel West Reader is dedicated to John Coltrane,
Frederico Garcia Lorca, Franz Kafka, Paul Celan, Tennessee
Williams, Giacomo Leopardi, Samuel Beckett, Sarah Vaughn, Muriel
Rukeyser, Thomas Hardy, Nikos Kazantzakis, Toni Morrison, ``and
above all,'' Anton Chekhov.
</P>
<P>
   It's that ``above all'' that really cinches it. West has an
unfortunate tendency to refer to his utterances as ``prophetic''--a
judgment best left to others. But like West's taste for three-piece
suits (after another of his idols, W.E.B. DuBois), this is a more a
matter of style than of substance. West cultivates a distinctively
black mode of academic discourse, improvisational in tone and
containing a stronger element of showmanship and braggadocio than
most of his white colleagues are comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   Another annoyance is West's love affair with labels. In the
early pages of The Cornel West Reader, he describes himself ``a
Chekhovian Christian with deep democratic commitments,'' ``a
Gramscian democratic socialist,'' a ``non-Marxist socialist,'' and
a ``prophetic, Christian pragmatist freedom fighter.'' These
stickers accumulate, as on a steamer trunk, without pointing to any
definitive destination.
</P>
<P>
   This habit, too, makes West easy to mock, but I think it serves
a purpose. West wants to communicate the intensity of his effort to
reconcile his various influences: religious, political,
philosophic, and artistic. Wieseltier may be right that West's
efforts at synthesis lack rigor. But I don't think West's intention
is so much to work out a system as it is to put his own personal
journey forward as an example.
</P>
<P>
   West is self-made intellectual who found Kierkegaard in a
bookmobile, was influenced by the Black Panthers as a teen-ager,
and found his way to Karl Barth and John Dewey. His promiscuous use
of slogans is a way of personalizing the philosophical, of telling
you where he's been.
</P>
<P>
   So what is it that I find appealing about West? I think his main
strengths are his thoughtfulness about America's racial divide and
his charismatic enthusiasm about bridging it. West has a reputation
as something of an angry revolutionary. I would describe him as a
blunt-spoken moderate with a radical self-image slightly at odds
with the substance of his views.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Race Matters,'' he blasts Jesse Jackson for trying to
monopolize black political leadership and for lacking programmatic
follow-through. He defends affirmative action, but notes that it
``is not the most important issue for black progress in America.''
</P>
<P>
   His basic stance is a rejection of both the conservative view
that racism is no longer a big problem and the liberal view that
it's the whole problem. Instead, West opts for a multi-causal
explanation of black America's problems. He thinks racism remains
pervasive and destructive, a truth that Bradley alone among this
season's presidential candidates seems comfortable uttering, and
one that West has helped him articulate more pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet West doesn't exonerate victims of racism for
irresponsibility or criminality (something for which his critics on
the conventional academic left, like Adolph Reed, can't forgive
him). West is blunt about what he calls black ``nihilism''--what he
defines as ``a numbing detachment from others and a
self-destructive disposition toward the world.'' West in fact takes
a position that is close to that of many conservatives on the
importance of family structure and religious values.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a relentless and insightful enemy of black
anti-Semitism, black homophobia, and anti-white racism. ``The very
ethical character of the black freedom struggle largely depends on
the open condemnation by its spokespersons of any racist attitude
or action,'' he writes in ``Race Matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his emphasis on how bad things are, West is hopeful--as
opposed to naively optimistic--about America's racial future. As a
believer in what he calls ``politics of conversion,'' he considers
no one beyond the possibility of redemption and no problem utterly
intractable. West is among the toughest and most trenchant critics
of black nationalism and Afrocentrism. But he seldom concludes a
diatribe with a condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   His religious sensibility tells him to try to find what is
useful in views that he deplores, and to try to pull moral
reprobates in a more positive direction. West is scathing on the
subject of Louis Farrakhan. Yet he has embarked on a quixotic
effort to engage Farrakhan and change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   West's writing lacks the lucidity and panache of his Harvard
colleague and sometime collaborator Henry Louis Gates. He has said
many things that I wouldn't try to defend, and that I doubt Bill
Bradley would want to defend either, such as his formulaic, p.c.
denunciations of American ``imperialism.'' Where he tries to lay
out a policy agenda, as in his recent book ``The Future of American
Progressivism'' (co-written with Roberto Mangabeira Unger), I think
he oscillates between dreary, conventional ideas (public financing
of campaigns, class-based rather race-based affirmative action, a
consumption tax) and utterly impractical ones (a modified
parliamentary system, explicit economic redistribution, mandatory
voting).
</P>
<P>
   I'd be alarmed if West were drafting Bradley's policy positions.
But for the role of spiritual guru to a candidate with a charisma
deficit, he seems like just the guy.

</P>
<P>
   Twenty of history's greatest basketball players headlined a
Madison Square Garden fund-raiser for Bill Bradley last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His former New York Knicks teammates Dick Barnett, Dave
DeBusschere, Walt Frazier, Jerry Lucas, Earl Monroe and Willis Reed
sang Bradley's praises, as did Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bob Cousy,
Julius Erving, John Havlicek, Moses Malone, Oscar Robertson, Bill
Russell and Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   The event, complete with cheerleaders, movie stars, and lights
and music reminiscent of an NBA game, enthralled the press.
``Bradley Throws Garden Party, Scores,'' whooped the Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has pitched himself as a man of substance in a world
corrupted by glitz. As Russell put it at the gala, ``In these days
of spin control, Bill Bradley is one of the most honest people I've
ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's worth asking whether the jocks' media blitz for Bradley,
punctuated by their full-court press on Sunday's political talk
shows, conveyed anything of substance. The question posed by NBC's
Tim Russert--``Why do former opponents and teammates support Bill
Bradley for president?''--raises a prior question: Why should we
care?
</P>
<P>
   On the talk shows, the players testified that Bradley is
``intelligent,'' ``knowledgeable,'' ``well-rounded,''
``compassionate,'' ``concerned,'' ``wonderful,'' ``a great
leader,'' ``a great listener,'' and ``a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   They applauded his ``honesty,'' ``integrity,'' ``respect,'' and
``quiet strength.''
</P>
<P>
   They recalled that he ``played very hard,'' ``played by the
rules,'' and ``was always interested in the needs of people.''
</P>
<P>
   They asserted that he ``loves his country'' and seeks ``the good
of as many people as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   These platitudes are probably true. But why did they dominate
the three major networks Sunday morning? What light do they shed on
Bradley's presidential competence or agenda?
</P>
<P>
   On ``Meet the Press,'' DeBusschere argued that the ex-athletes
``know (Bradley) as a man'' and that voters should ``listen to what
celebrities have to say about a man that they all respect and have
known very well.'' That explanation, however, turns out not to be
true of many of Bradley's jocks. On ``Face the Nation,'' Erving
conceded that he had never played against Bradley and knew little
about him until this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cousy told the same story: ``My wife and I jumped on board the
minute the senator called. I didn't have a personal relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The jocks who knew Bradley as an athlete failed to name anything
he had accomplished in politics. Nevertheless, they praised his
political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had good leadership qualities as a senator,'' said Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   DeBusschere agreed: ``He's a leader. He was when he first came
into the political scene. He was going to study and learn and I
think he's done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell added, ``He's had some experience in national politics.
And then he got away for a while, which is sometimes very
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, how do the assertions of former basketball players
clarify this question? Unable to produce evidence, they
extrapolated from sports to politics. Bradley believed in ``passing
and getting other people involved in the game,'' Reed argued on
``This Week.'' ``That's what Bill's about, and what he'd do in his
politics: getting everybody involved in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The jocks were plainly ignorant of the issues. ``Old jocks don't
know a lot about the Balkans and the Middle East solutions or
campaign-finance reform and all,'' confessed Cousy.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Face the Nation,'' Bob Schieffer told Erving, ``Well, Dr.
J, since you're the doctor here, I guess I ought to ask you about
health care.'' The question sounded like a joke, but it wasn't, and
Erving answered it. ``I'm a proponent of Bill's position,'' he
replied, citing ``Bill's health care plan, which I got a chance to
read last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign has been long on sentiment and short on
solutions. The athletes' testimonials did nothing to remedy that
deficit. DeBusschere praised him for ``caring and going out and
saying things and doing things about'' race relations. Reed called
for racial ``enlightenment'' and predicted, ``Bill will try to make
that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson observed, ``Skin color is
an immediate reaction to people, and this is something that we have
to overcome. This is something Bill sees.'' Cousy boasted that
Bradley ``makes human rights a cornerstone, really, in terms of his
priorities All those problems stem, obviously, from man's
inhumanity to man. So I'm happy to see Bill focusing on, you know,
just getting people to get along together on a domestic and a
worldwide level.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousy argued that Bradley's jock advocates should be taken
seriously because they're ``concerned about issues'' and
unencumbered by the ``baggage'' of immorality that disqualifies
many celebrity athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ``has been very selective in terms of the celebrities
that he has asked to jump on board,'' said Cousy. ``If we're all
pretty good guys and we've lived our lives properly, then, hey, why
don't you listen to us in this case and vote for Bill Bradley?''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Cousy has lived his life properly. So have my
neighbors. And they don't get on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of their rationalizations, Bradley's jocks fall back on
the argument that their opinions are important simply because
they're celebrities. ``Look at America and what America is all
about,'' Robertson argued. ``Basketball is America's game. People
come to games to see these stars play. Stars have such influence on
Americans today. And it's just apropos for me to be here to say
that Bill Bradley's a person who can generalize all these people
together.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Late Edition,'' Bradley said of his basketball pals, ``Why
wouldn't you reach out to your friends? I'd be stupid if I didn't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   If the jocks don't know why Bradley should be president, why are
they endorsing him? Because they think their association with him
helps their image as well as his. ``Not too many jocks are Rhodes
Scholars,'' observed Cousy, arguing that Bradley ``personifies''
the virtues of team sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, everybody was a dumb jock who played
sports,'' sniffed DeBusschere. ``Bill, I think, has proven that a
basketball player, baseball player, football player are very
intelligent people and that type of stigma attached to you is not
worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   But are the jocks serving Bradley well? At best, they're helping
him exploit the superficial, elitist politics he claims to be
campaigning against. That's what happened on ``Meet the Press,''
where Russert, after hosting Bradley's jocks for much of the show,
explained the absence of a Gore representative by reporting, ``We
asked the Al Gore campaign to provide celebrities who would support
him. They declined.''
</P>
<P>
   At worst, the jocks are hurting Bradley by failing to comprehend
and refute misrepresentations of his agenda. That's what happened
on ``Face the Nation,'' where Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile
accused Bradley of endangering ``African-Americans and all other
minorities and Hispanics'' by trying to ``eliminate Medicaid.''
What Bradley needed was a policy expert who could block Brazile's
cheap shot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the task of defending Bradley fell to Erving, who
shrugged that ``it's probably a debatable issue, but knowing Sen.
Bradley, he is, you know, the type of individual who has always
been fair.'' With that response, Erving negated his layup for
Bradley by yielding a three-pointer to Brazile.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with basketball stars. They can score, but
they can't play D.

   ``Fight Club,'' a movie about a fictional organization of men
who strip down and beat each other to pulp, has provoked more than
its share of media hand-wringing, particularly diatribes about
Hollywood's infatuation with violence and Faludi-esque ruminations
about the emasculated American male.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club,'' however, has not sparked an iota of interest in
a real organization of men who strip down and beat each other to
pulp: the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
</P>
<P>
   UFC's flameout from national sensation to total irrelevance is a
tragedy of American sports, a cautionary tale of prudishness,
heavy-handed politics, and cultural myopia.
</P>
<P>
   UFC began in 1993 as a locker-room fantasy. What would happen if
a kickboxer fought a wrestler? A karate champion fought a sumo
champion? Promoters built an octagonal chain-link cage, invited
eight top martial artists, and set them loose in no-holds-barred,
bare-knuckles fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no rules!'' bragged an early press release.
Contestants would fight till ``knockout, submission, doctor's
intervention, or death.''
</P>
<P>
   UFC allowed, even promoted, all notions of bad sportsmanship:
kicking a man when he's down, hitting him in the groin, choking.
Four-hundred-pound men were sent into the Octagon to maul guys half
their size. Only biting and eye-gouging were forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   The gimmick entranced thousands of people (well, men).
</P>
<P>
   What happens when a 620-pound sumo champion fights a 200-pound
kickboxer? Answer: The kickboxer knocks him silly in 35 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   They tuned in for bloodshed--``the damage,'' as fans like to
call it. UFC fights could be horrifying. Tank Abbott, an
ill-tempered, 270-pound street fighter, knocks out hapless opponent
John Matua in 15 seconds. Then, before the ref can intervene,
Abbott belts the unconscious Matua in the head, sending him into a
fit, limbs quivering uncontrollably, blood spurting from his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, naturally, became a cult hero and won a guest spot on
``Friends.'' (Matua walked out of the ring.) Soon, UFC was selling
out huge arenas and drawing 300,000 pay-per-view subscribers for
its quarterly competitions.
</P>
<P>
   But a subtle sport was emerging from the gimmicks and carnage.
My passion for ultimate fighting (which is also called ``extreme''
or ``no-holds-barred'' fighting) began when I saw the finals of UFC
IV.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Gracie, a 180-pound Brazilian jujitsu specialist, was
matched against a 275-pound beast named Dan Severn, one of the top
heavyweight wrestlers in the world and a national champion many
times over. In 30 seconds, Severn had grabbed Gracie, flung him to
the canvas, and mounted him. For the next 15 minutes, Severn
pummeled and elbowed and head-butted the smaller man. Gracie's face
grew drawn, and he squirmed wildly to avoid Severn's bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Then, all of sudden, Gracie, still lying on his back, saw an
opening, wrapped his arms and legs around Severn like a python and
choked the giant into submission.
</P>
<P>
   UFC's caged matches revolutionized the idea of fighting. Nursed
on boxing and Hollywood, Americans imagine fights as choreography,
a dance of elegant combinations, roundhouse kicks, clean knockouts.
The UFC punctured this. Boxers floundered. Experts in striking
martial arts such as karate and tae kwon do, who fancied themselves
the world's greatest fighters, found themselves pretzeled by
jujitsu masters, who pulled them to the ground and slowly choked or
leg-locked them.
</P>
<P>
   ``UFC immediately debunked a lot of myths of fighting, of
boxing, karate, kung fu. It showed the reality of what works in an
actual fight,'' says Dave Meltzer, editor of Wrestling Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being carnivals of gore, UFC fights looked strangely
like ... sex. Almost all fights ended on the ground, one man
mounting the other in missionary position, the pair of them
wiggling mysteriously along the canvas for five, 10, even 30
minutes. There were few spectacular knockouts. The referee--yes,
there was always a referee--stopped many bouts, and in most others,
fighters ``tapped out,'' surrendering to mild-looking but agonizing
chokes and joint locks.
</P>
<P>
   It was not barbarism. It was science.
</P>
<P>
   The UFC spawned a new breed of ``mixed martial artists.''
World-class wrestlers learned to kickbox. Champion kickboxers
learned to grapple. (The karate experts learned to stay home.) They
became, without doubt, the best fighters in the world. Mike Tyson
wouldn't last 30 seconds in an ultimate fighting match.
</P>
<P>
   When Olympic gold medal wrestler Kevin Jackson came to the UFC,
a fighter named Frank Shamrock KO'd him with a submission hold in
16 seconds. Ultimate fighting schools began sprouting up all over
the country, replacing the stylized gestures of the Eastern martial
arts with techniques that actually work.
</P>
<P>
   UFC's promoters predicted that it would supplant boxing as
America's martial art. Instead, it fell apart. The collapse began
in 1996, when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., saw a UFC tape. McCain, a
lifelong boxing fan, was horrified at the ground fighting, kicks,
and head butts. It was ``barbaric,'' he said. It was ``not a
sport.'' He sent letters to all 50 governors asking them to ban
ultimate fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry against ``human cockfighting'' became a crusade, and
like many crusades, it was founded on misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   UFC fell victim to cultural determinism about what a fight is.
In countries such as Brazil and Japan, where no-holds-barred
fighting has a long history, it is popular and uncontroversial. But
Americans adhere to the Marquis of Queensbury rules. A fight
consists of an exchange of upper-body blows that halts when one
fighter falls.
</P>
<P>
   Any blood sport can be barbaric, whether it's boxing or
wrestling or ultimate fighting. It is impossible to draw a bright
line between ultimate fighting and boxing. If anything, ultimate
fighting is safer and less cruel than America's blood sport.
</P>
<P>
   For example, critics pilloried ultimate fighting because
competitors fought with bare knuckles: To a nation accustomed to
boxing gloves, this seemed revolting, an invitation to brain
damage. But it's just the reverse: The purpose of boxing gloves is
not to cushion the head but to shield the knuckles. Without gloves,
a boxer would break his hands after a couple of punches to the
skull. That's why ultimate fighters won't throw multiple skull
punches. As a result, they avoid the concussive head wounds that
kill boxers--and the long-term neurological damage that cripples
them.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the chain-link fence surrounding the octagon looks
grotesque. Critics have demanded that UFC install ropes instead.
But ropes are a major cause of death and injury in boxing: Fighters
hyperextend their necks when they are punched against the ropes,
because nothing stops their heads from snapping back. The
chain-link fence prevents hyperextension.
</P>
<P>
   When I tell people I'm an ultimate fighting fan, they invariably
respond: ``Don't people get killed all the time doing that?'' But
no one has ever been killed at the UFC--though boxers are killed
every year. No one has even been seriously injured at the UFC. On
the rare occasions when a bout has ended with a bloody knockout,
the loser has always walked out of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   But this does not impress boxing fans, who are the most vigorous
opponents of extreme fighting. McCain sat ringside at a boxing
match where a fighter was killed. When I asked him to explain the
moral distinction between boxing and ultimate fighting, he exploded
at me, ``If you can't see the moral distinction, then we have
nothing to talk about!'' Then he cut our interview short and
stormed out of his office.
</P>
<P>
   But logic has not served the UFC well. Where McCain led, a
prudish nation followed. George Will opined against UFC. The
American Medical Association recommended a ban. New York state
outlawed ultimate fighting, as did other states. The Nevada
Athletic Commission refused to sanction UFC bouts, barring the UFC
from the lucrative casino market. (One public TV station refused a
UFC sponsorship ad. The only other organization the station ever
rejected was the Ku Klux Klan.)
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits blocked or delayed UFC events all over the country,
forcing the promoters to spend millions in legal fees. The UFC was
exiled from mega-arenas to ever-smaller venues in ever more
out-of-the-way states: Louisiana, Iowa, and Alabama. The match I
attended in October 1997 was held in the parking lot of a small
Mississippi casino.
</P>
<P>
   The cable TV industry struck the fatal blow. In early 1997,
McCain became chairman of the commerce committee, which oversees
the cable industry. In April 1997, the president of the National
Cable Television Association warned that UFC broadcasts could
jeopardize the cable industry's influence in Washington. Time
Warner, TCI, Request, Cablevision Systems, Viewer's Choice, and
other major operators stopped airing UFC events, saying they were
too violent for children.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that 1) UFC only aired on pay-per-view, so children
could not see it unless their parents paid for it; and 2) the same
cable outfits carried boxing matches, R and NC-17 movies, and
professional wrestling shows far more violent than UFC. The UFC's
``addressable audience''--the potential number of PPV
subscribers--shrank from 35 million at its peak to 7.5 million
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very cheap way for the cable companies to portray
themselves as anti-violence. It did not cost them much and it made
them look good in Washington,'' says Carol Klenfner, spokeswoman
for UFC's parent company, SEG.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate fighting industry did little to help its own cause.
The UFC promoted itself less as a serious sport than as a circus of
carnage. Its early ads emphasized extreme fighting's potential for
death. UFC folks accused McCain, without any evidence, of opposing
the sport as a favor to campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme fighting was tarnished when fighters from the other
ultimate fighting operation, the now-defunct Battlecade, were
arrested for violating Canadian prizefighting laws when they fought
on an Indian reservation outside Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, an increasingly desperate UFC has been
trying to assuage its critics. The competition, which had been
gradually adding safety rules since the first fight, imposed even
more. It institued rounds and a ``10-point must'' scoring system.
It banned head butts and groin strikes. You can no longer kick a
downed man or elbow someone in the back of the head. Fighters are
required to wear thin martial arts gloves (a purely cosmetic
change). The UFC imposed weight classes, ending the
David-and-Goliath mismatches that made early fights so compelling.
</P>
<P>
   None of this soothed the cable operators, who have kept UFC off
the air. The pay-per-view audience has plunged from 300,000 per
show to 15,000. UFC can no longer afford its best fighters: Some
are fighting overseas. Others, notably Ken Shamrock (Frank's
brother), have become pro wrestlers. Fights have deteriorated. UFC
is limping along, but it has been reduced to scheduling events in
Japan and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports fans want to grow with the sport,'' says former UFC
fighter David Beneteau. ``They want to recognize the athletes. They
want to see the same fighters come back. When you compare UFC now
to what it was, the fighters are not the same, the rules are not
the same. The fans have no story to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as it disappears from public view, ultimate fighting is
returning to its roots. Away from the scrutiny of the major media,
state legislators, and McCain, kids are still learning mixed
martial-arts techniques, and small-time promoters are quietly
staging events. You can see Kage Kombat competitions at Dancing
Waters nightclub in San Pedro, Calif. You can watch the Warrior's
Challenge at a small Indian casino outside Sacramento. Texans
compete in Houston's Dungal All Styles Fighting Championship.
Tribal casinos in Northern Idaho are hosting small Pankration
tournaments. The Extreme Fighting Challenge is popular in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The money is low; the crowds are small; and there's not a TV
camera in sight. Ultimate fighting should have become boxing.
Instead it has gone underground.
</P>
<P>
   It has become Fight Club.

DICK MORRIS TAKES HIS ACT TO THE INTERNET

<P>
   &UR; By WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Halloween, former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris
dressed up as a populist visionary and went out on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His new Web site, vote.com, asked visitors to ``vote'' yes or no
on questions such as ``Protect Gays from Hate Crimes?'' and
``Increase the Minimum Wage?''
</P>
<P>
   Each time a user clicks a box taking one side or the other, an
e-mail is sent to Congress or the White House conveying his e-mail
address and his position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll send your vote to your congressional representative,
your senators and the president,'' Morris promises on the site's
home page. This, he asserts, is ``direct democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his past careers as Bill Clinton's savior, confessor,
accuser, and pundit-translator, Morris' latest incarnation is an
act. He's not building direct democracy. He's building a rather
different political system, which might more aptly be called
dickmorrisy. How does dickmorrisy differ from democracy? Let us
count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   --Morris picks the issues. The power to choose and craft
questions is more profound than the power to choose and craft
answers. That's why other Web sites, such as faqvoter.com, let
users pose questions to politicians on any topic. Morris knows that
the first rule of politics is to dictate the agenda--and at
vote.com, he's the dictator.
</P>
<P>
   So while vote.com asks visitors, ``Should Hillary Have Spoken
Out when Mrs. Arafat Made Controversial Comments About Israel?''--a
no-win question about the woman Morris excoriates elsewhere on the
site--it asks no similarly rigged question about Mrs. Clinton's
opponent, Rudy Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   --Morris frames the arguments. ``On vote.com, you can get the
pros and cons on various issues and cast your votes,'' CNN's Bob
Franken told viewers two weeks ago. Well, not quite. What you get
are the pros and cons Morris chooses to include.
</P>
<P>
   Take the question Morris posted Wednesday: ``Admit China into
the World Trade Organization?'' At vote.com, you can click to read
a few paragraphs of the arguments on each side about economics and
human rights, but there's nothing about how ``engagement'' (as one
side sees it) or ``appeasement'' (as the other side sees it) might
affect nuclear proliferation--a consideration that might have
changed your mind.
</P>
<P>
   Morris never links you to sites that offer more detailed
arguments than his. He wants you to stay on his site, read his
summaries, and pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   --Morris simplifies your views. Morris says vote.com is ``fully
interactive'' and ``gives us a chance to speak out and to be heard.
When you vote ... we'll send an immediate e-mail to significant
decision makers ... telling them how you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   But while you can explain the nuances of your position on a
bulletin board at vote.com, the only thing Morris lets you
communicate to your government is yes or no.
</P>
<P>
   On vouchers, for example, I checked the box marked ``Yes--Use
competition to improve schools,'' because I favor pilot voucher
programs and public school choice to shake up the education system.
My vote was translated into an e-mail to Clinton and Congress
stating, ``On the question Vouchers for Schools? I voted YES.''
Since more than 80 percent of vote.com users have voted yes on this
question, Republicans will no doubt cite these ``votes,'' including
mine, as a mandate for nationwide private school vouchers. Morris
hasn't conveyed my opinion. He has misrepresented it.
</P>
<P>
   --Morris distorts your degree of interest. Morris concedes that
vote.com doesn't represent the whole population (since the average
Internet user is wealthier and more educated than the average
person, for example), but he argues that it faithfully simulates an
election because it expresses the votes of those ``who care enough
to speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he built vote.com ``to set up a way for voters to speak
out'' because ``I trust the voters.'' Of course, voters already had
a way to speak out: They could--and did--write letters and e-mails
to the government, but only when they cared enough to do so. The
labor and thought that went into those letters helped politicians
understand how many voters really cared about an issue and exactly
what those voters thought.
</P>
<P>
   If Morris truly ``trusted the voters,'' he would have left this
system alone. Instead, by simplifying the ``voting'' process and
flooding politicians with thousands of identical one-line e-mails,
he obliterates the distinction not just between my opinion on
vouchers and Bill Bennett's, but also between Bennett's intense
interest in the issue and my faint interest in it.
</P>
<P>
   --Morris defines where politicians stand. Vote.com ``will
elevate the dialogue between members of Congress and their
constituents to a new level,'' writes Morris. ``When your
congressional representative votes on the issue, we will e-mail you
to tell you how he or she voted. Right before election day, we'll
send you a report card listing how they voted on all the topics you
voted on.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris says the report card will show each voter ``what
percentage of the time his congressman agreed with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Report cards aren't new--they're used by the Christian Coalition
and other interest groups to reduce complicated issues so that each
politician can be labeled ``pro-abortion'' or ``pro-environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Report cards don't transfer power from politicians to voters.
They transfer power to the intermediary that gets to characterize
how politicians have voted. If vote.com succeeds, Morris will
become that intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   --Morris controls the special interests. Morris says vote.com
``will give us all a chance to be heard so our voice gets loud
enough to drown out the special interests that run Congress.''
Meanwhile, he predicts that ``money won't work in politics anymore,
because you won't be able to reach people by buying television
ads,'' since ``the Internet is taking the place of television in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you're a special interest, where can you take your money
to reach the voters? To Morris, of course. He boasts that vote.com
is ``free'' because ``we get our money from advertisers.'' But the
price of this ``free'' voting is accepting ads. And who's going to
advertise on a site where people vote on political issues? Why,
special interests, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Morris already quotes leaders of groups such as the AFL-CIO in
the arguments he summarizes for voters. The more influential these
summaries become, the more each interest group will be willing to
pay to get its views and quotes into them.
</P>
<P>
   --Morris represents the Internet. ``Edmund Burke, a British
statesman, called journalism the Fourth Estate during the French
Revolution,'' recalls Morris. ``We think the Internet is replacing
the media, so we call it the Fifth Estate.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than relinquish this catchy title to the whole
Internet, Morris claims it for the ``magazine'' (translation:
column) he writes on vote.com. He sees the power center of the
future, and he wants to dominate it. When critics ignore or dismiss
Morris, he accuses them of ignoring or dismissing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, citing technical reasons, has capped the number
of e-mails it will accept from vote.com each day. Morris, in turn,
has charged that ``the Internet administration is burning the
bridge to the 21st century'' and is ``discriminating simply because
this is over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, it seems, has taken his philosophy less from Robespierre
than from Louis XIV: l'Internet, c'est moi.
</P>
<P>
   --Morris controls the voting process. Morris constantly
describes his visitors as ``voters'' who are engaged in
``referenda'' through vote.com. The site advises them when the
``polls'' will ``close'' on each referendum and assures them
afterward that ``your vote really counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Morris warns the White House against ``censoring''
the ``views of those who vote'' through his site, and he advises
members of Congress who don't accept e-mails that ``we'll have to
tell their constituents who participate in vote.com referenda that
they won't take e-mail, even from those who elect them.''
</P>
<P>
   He also promises to crack the whip on wayward legislators by
publishing the ``referenda results, broken down by state and
congressional district,'' in the Hill, a congressional newspaper.
By adopting the language of elections (''vote,'' ``elect,''
``referenda'') and by encouraging voters and politicians to treat
vote.com as the vehicle through which the public delivers mandates
to its leaders, Morris is trying to make vote.com, in effect, the
place where people vote.
</P>
<P>
   Vote.com would become, as Morris envisions it, the nation's
``town meeting.'' And Morris would run the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, of course, insists that vote.com poses no such threat.
``It's a ballot box,'' he says. ``It has no point of view.'' What a
brilliantly innocuous metaphor, devised by a master manipulator to
obscure his manipulations.
</P>
<P>
   This, it turns out, is the most important difference between
democracy and dickmorrisy. The only thing worse than a cacophony of
special interests plastering their views all over the nation's
airwaves and legislation is a single special interest that owns the
ballot box--and knows how to make itself invisible.

   In all, a diverse group of eight troubled California teens with
a history of violence was assembled for this UPN documentary, which
debuts Friday at 8 p.m. There is much that is wrong with the
two-hour program, especially its disconcertingly peppy music-video
style, but there is a lot more that is right.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of a month, producer Arnold Shapiro filmed the
kids in a number of provocative settings designed to elicit
understanding of their violent impulses and explore their potential
for positive change. For example, they visit an LA hospital where a
trauma surgeon shows them gruesome and sometimes pitiful outcomes
of street mayhem. The film's most emotionally wrenching moments are
kindled by a visit to Columbine, where the teenagers are asked to
confront the agonies of tearful parents and teachers remembering
individuals killed in the bloodbath there.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, ``The Truth About Violence,'' which also covers the
group's activities at an Outward Bound-like wilderness camp, seems
contrived. At times, it plays like a hybrid of MTV's
quasidocumentary ``Real World'' series and ``Scared Straight,''
Shapiro's late-'70s film about a program to shock juveniles out of
antisocial behavior by taking them into a state prison. It can be,
alternatively, too tidy, too politically correct (despite the
clouds of profanity), and soap-operatic in its melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   But under the artifice _ including tasteless gunfire sound
effects and familiarly choppy MTV-inspired editing _ is an often
powerfully affecting and valuable account of troubled youngsters
with a chance at a better future. By encouraging them to plumb
their own pasts and interact frankly with one another, it digs
beneath swaggering, threatening teen stereotypes to reveal bright
kids struggling with painful histories. As young children, many of
them witnessed horrific violence or were themselves beaten or
sexually abused. No wonder one girl won't permit herself to say,
``I love you'' to anyone, or why, for another, it's such a
challenge to even imagine making friends or being kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truth About Violence'' makes a convincing case that with
committed support and attention, young people such as these can
change and perhaps even flourish. What it fails to emphasize,
however, is the lack of social programs and of the political will
required to make such transformations possible on a national level.
</P>
<P>
   UPN is to be commended for broadcasting ``The Truth About
Violence.'' It's worth noting, though, that the struggling network
has recently improved its fortunes with ``Smackdown,'' a weekly
wrestling spectacle that has earned high ratings and the
condemnation of many critics appalled by its vulgarity and bloodily
violent content.

   WASHINGTON _ The mystery of what happened to the Egyptair Boeing
767 which crashed off the U.S. coast two weeks ago may finally be
solved this week, as the tape from the cockpit voice recorder is
painstakingly transcribed and analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in British and American media has so far blamed
mechanical failure, a struggle between the crew, a bomb, a hijack
and a suicidal crew member, without any evidence whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators from America's National Transportation and
Safety Board have been extremely careful not to speculate, and the
lack of any ``steer'' has to some extent encouraged the media to
make up theories.
</P>
<P>
   But the nationality of the crew and the plane have also
apparently encouraged reporters to make irresponsible guesses at
what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In previous crashes, infighting between the U.S. agencies
investigating the incident has contributed to a welter of
conflicting stories about the cause. This time, the authorities
have sought to stop speculation by focusing on the facts.
</P>
<P>
   But anonymous sources from one U.S. agency have repeatedly
leaked their views to the press.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest indications from the cockpit voice recorder are
that there was a problem with the aircraft, the crew tried to deal
with it, but that things went rapidly from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happens. Alarms go off. Both work to try to fix
it,'' an unnamed source told the Associated Press after the
investigators listened to the tape for the first time. ``There is
some kind of problem that they're dealing with. It gets
progressively worse. And the tape stops.''
</P>
<P>
   The source, however, apparently did not speak Arabic and had not
understood anything on the tape, which tends to undermine his
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   From the aircraft's flight data recorder, it is known that for
some reason the crew disengaged the autopilot. The aircraft began
dropping from 33,000 feet at a 40-degree angle, reaching a speed
just short of the sound barrier, and reaching zero gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The engines were apparently manually shut down during the dive.
It reached 16,000 feet and then climbed back up to 24,000 feet
before falling rapidly again and breaking up. This pattern of
events does not fit readily with any known course of action in
response to a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The first reports from the voice recorder did seem to lessen the
probability of one of the many competing, and contradictory,
accounts made up in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication of a fight between the crew, who were
speaking ``like pals,'' said AP. Nor was there any sign that
someone had entered the cockpit. Indeed, there was never any
evidence whatsoever for this theory.
</P>
<P>
   A government official told Newsweek magazine that Boeing was
``pushing'' the theory that a cockpit struggle was responsible for
the crash. Boeing denied this. If mechanical failure is the cause,
then there might be serious implications for Boeing, including
legal action.
</P>
<P>
   The supposition of a cockpit fight was based on the fact that
the flight elevators had been moved in opposite directions moments
before the aircraft crashed, and from this the inference was drawn
that the pilot and co-pilot were acting against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, it assumed that the decision to shut off the autopilot
and the engines were irrational, something that cannot be known
until the causes of the aircraft's initial problem are known.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation that one of the crew might have tried to kill
himself, or have fought with his colleagues, was based on no
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It seems highly unlikely that U.S. newspapers would have made
these accusations against an America pilot who had died in similar
circumstances, and the families and friends of the crew have
understandably responded angrily to these libels.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ahmed al Habashy, the lead pilot, was stable and happy,
his wife and brother have said. He was close to retirement. ``He
never smoked or drank alcohol,'' his brother told Agence France
Presse. ``He had no bad habits. He was very religious and prayed
and was always reading the Koran,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald felt it necessary to add that he was ``not an
extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-pilot Adel Anwar was due to be married five days after the
flight and had exchanged slots with another flight officer to
return home sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Other theories with equally little evidence have also surfaced.
The first was that the reverse thrusters might have malfunctioned,
based on a similiar crash of a Boeing 767 in Thailand _ an aircraft
that was made at the same time as the Egyptair plane. The data
recorders seemed to rule this out.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald reported that a flight attendant called Hassan
Sherif telephoned his wife, Rania, from New York to say ``there was
something wrong with the plane'' and that he was ``very worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Egyptair said that there was a flight attendant on the aircraft
called Hassan Farouk, not Hassan Sherif. Rania Reda is his fiancee,
not his wife. ``He just told me that the plane was delayed at Los
Angeles and he is waiting for the plane,'' Reda told Associated
Press Television News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   More than one newspaper has blamed terrorism, citing the
aircraft's flight profile, the suddenness of the problem and the
lack of a distress call. It has also been noted that the aircraft
had a large number of Egyptian military personnel on it.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI have given no signs that they are actively looking at
terrorism as a likely cause, though some kind of sudden incident
might have led the aircraft to depressurize rapidly, and the crew
might then have taken it lower.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaks from the inquiry may come from the FBI, which
would take over the investigation if there was a strong presumption
of criminal activity. The FBI has been heavily criticized for a
number of investigations recently, and is seeking extra funds for
an expansion and reorganization of its activities _ including a new
counter-terrorism unit. &QL;

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject nted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

 &HT;    WITH FLU BUG ON THE MARCH, ELDERLY WARNED TO GET SHOTS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A health group urged older people Thursday to be
vaccinated against influenza, warning that 90 percent of people who
die from the disease are over age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Flu cases were reported in 30 states during the past week, said
Dr. Rashid Ahmed Chotani of John Hopkins University said at a news
conference held by the National Council on Patient Information and
Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flu is here, and we need to worry about it in a big way,''
Chotani said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Golodner, chairwoman of the council, said that ``flu, most
of which is preventable through vaccination, unfortunately takes a
heavy toll each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Influenza infects nearly 40 million Americans a year, and kills
about 20,000 of them, the council said. Americans spend nearly $4.6
million a year treating the flu.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll released Thursday found that one in five Americans
reported having the flu within the last three months. One-fourth of
those with symptoms said they were treated by a doctor, and more
than half reported missing work.
</P>
<P>
   People with flu symptoms should contact a doctor within two days
and should consult their pharmacist for over-the-counter
medications, Golodner said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccinations reduce the risk of death from influenza by nearly
80 percent. Besides the elderly, patients with chronic illness, and
pregnant women are more susceptible to the flu and should be
vaccinated, Chotani said.
</P>
<P>
   Flu shots are offered at local heath clinics, hospitals, and
shopping malls for about $7 to $10.
</P>
<P>
   The council also announced a national campaign to educate
doctors and patients on how prevent and treat the flu. The
campaign, which includes public service announcements and a flu
awareness Internet site (www.talkaboutrx.org), will end in March
2000. The council also has a toll-free number: 1-877-358-2638.

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

AUTHORS QUESTION VALUE OF BUSINESS SCHOOL EDUCATION

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, how much did you learn at the last business seminar you
attended?
</P>
<P>
   Was it worth the several hundred, or several thousand, dollars
that you or your company shelled out to fine-tune your skills,
advance your knowledge or propel your career?
</P>
<P>
   Or was it just a break from the office routine, with lunch and a
nice hotel conference room thrown in?
</P>
<P>
   In the growing world of business education, whether it's Harvard
or some two-person computer training team, most companies are
receiving far less value than the billions that they are spending
would suggest, according to two established English business
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Business schools are big business but are not living up to the
standards they preach, Stuart Crainer and Des Dearlove write.
</P>
<P>
   Business writers for publications such as ``The London Times''
and ``The Financial Times'', the authors set their investigative
sights on business schools in their provocative ``Gravy Training:
Inside the Business of Business Schools'' (Jossey-Bass, 315 pages,
$).
</P>
<P>
   Companies spend more than $100 billion annually worldwide on
training, according to a Penn State study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dauntingly, (the study) estimates that over half of this is
wasted as much is carried out with no objective,'' the authors
write.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the $3 billion so-called executive education
industry branch of the business school curriculum. With courses
ranging from $1,395 for a three-day seminar at Vanderbilt
University on effective management techniques to $40,500 for a
nine-week advanced management program at Harvard, it's easy to see
how the authors arrived at their title.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they all have in common is a price tag that reflects the
buying power of business,'' Crainer and Dearlove write.
</P>
<P>
   Price aside, how have business schools measured up in their
effectiveness on American business? Not too well, the authors
argue.
</P>
<P>
   Laden with so-called strategic planning and attention to the
bottom line, business schools have notoriously ignored the human
element, an effect that was felt painfully during the early '80s as
corporate America lost its market share on household names to
foreign competitors, the authors suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only were the business school graduates of the time
ill-equipped for managing real people, their analytical skills also
proved ineffective as companies were outflanked by more nimble
competitors,'' they write. ``The new arrivals _ many of them
upstarts from Silicon Valley and Japan _ broke the mold. They
seemed to be making up strategy as they went along. They had not
been to business school.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect of business schools on wealth creation is also
questionable, Crainer and Dearlove write.
</P>
<P>
   ``If business schools were supposed to turn out entrepreneurs
who would go forth and multiply _ creating jobs and adding to GDP _
then they have not succeeded,'' they write. ``When it comes to
successful business start-ups, with a few notable exceptions such
as Dell Computers, business school graduates are conspicuous by
their absence.''
</P>
<P>
   Crainer and Dearlove suggest that this inability to meet true
market needs is causing business schools to lose to a new
competitor: company universities.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than a thousand corporate universities, with
names such as Walton Institute in Arkansas, Home Depot University
in Atlanta, Target Stores University in Minneapolis and Dell
University in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola University supplies 550,000 student days a year and
costs $170 million to run. But all 139,000 Motorola employees are
expected to train at least 40 hours a year there, and Motorola
calculates that every dollar invested in training reaps $33. The
training facility even has its own international MBA program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference between Motorola U. and a conventional
university is the absence of a football team,'' Crainer and
Dearlove write.
</P>
<P>
   With so much being invested in advanced or continuing education
by business, it might be worth picking up this book before you or
someone under you sign up for that next course.

GO TO THE MAIL WITH STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN (For use by NYTimes

CHILDREN'S BOOKS: OF TINY ACORNS, GIANT OAKS, AND SNAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KARLA EATON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marsha Danzig has created an inspirational tale in her work
``The
</P>
<P>
   Tiniest Acorn, A Story to Grow By.'' It is reminiscent of the
visual power found in ``The Biggest House in the World,'' a classic
by the late Leo Lionni. Both works deserve a pleasant pause by both
young and old because they teach lessons from which we can all
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig's work follows the best in books for kids, inspiring them
to realize their greatness and see themselves full of all the
goodness that others see.
</P>
<P>
   Lulu is this tiniest of acorns who struggles to recognize her
glory when she grows into a mighty oak.
</P>
<P>
   Only after hearing another's words of praise for her does she
realize that she is not just the acorn she used to be but, instead,
is a magnificent tree. Beyond the strong message of this story,
Danzig's book is extremely appealing to the eye, with text printed
in casual handwritten print, dialogue in different color text, and
colorful illustrations that instantly draw the reader closer.
</P>
<P>
   The tenderness of the text coupled with the tenderness of the
illustrations combine for a compelling lesson for young and old.
This message is even stronger when the reader absorbs the epilogue
where the writer explains her own background as a cancer survivor
and accomplished academic who, like Lulu, struggled to recognize
her own virtues. Danzig is using Lulu to spread words of
encouragement: We are all capable of great things.
</P>
<P>
   Another tiny creature, a snail, searches for greatness in
Lionni's work, ``The Biggest House in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Danzig's book, this one couples a powerful message with
stunning visuals. The tale from the wise father snail encourages
his child to appreciate what he is for its many benefits, a small
snail in a small house. This allows him to move freely in the
splendor of the world, bringing him immense happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Lionni, known by many as a painter and graphic artist, was also
an accomplished children's book author and winner of four Caldecott
Honors. His fables often focused on animals and the natural world.
``It's Mine,'' ``Swimmy and Alexander'' and the ``Wind-Up Mouse''
are just a few of this prolific author's masterpieces. His
inspiring words and pictures have captured children's imaginations
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Revisiting his works is a glorious way to pay tribute to him.
</P>
<P>
   A great children's book is created in the harmony of words and
pictures. Lionni was a master of his trade, teaching, delighting,
intriguing and transporting his readers to places in his
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In those footsteps, Marsha Danzig's first publication is an
endearing tale with an inspirational message. Whether it's a big
house or a little acorn, children will be pleased to have these
stories read and adults will be pleased to read. Big and small,
young and old, we all win.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Millionaire fever has swept America. And we are not talking
about the booming economy or the tide of winnings from stock
trading on Wall Street. This is all about a TV game show that
started in Britain and is now commanding the airwaves on this side
of the water _ ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ABC network began airing its own version of the ITV
quiz program in the summer, it has seen its ratings explode. Last
week, it started a run of 15 hour-long ``Millionaire'' shows _ one
a day, every day for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It has trampled everything in its way, with minimum effort. The
American ``Millionaire'' is identical to the original ITV model _
the same melodramatic techno music, the same swivelling lights,
even the same spaceship set.
</P>
<P>
   True, there is no Chris Tarrant. The quiz-master is Regis
Philbin, a stalwart of U.S. daytime talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone in the U.S. seems aware of the show's ancestry.
Philbin is credited with inventing the catchphrase: ``Is that your
final answer?'' Anyone who has watched Tarrant's teasing of
competitors will know that this is his catchphrase, not Philbin's.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday this week, ``Millionaire'' drew in 26.8 million
viewers. It is estimated that after the end of this current run,
more than half of the American population will have watched it. No
other show on this autumn's American television schedule has come
near it in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   And a surprising number of people are making money from the
show, from Jasper Carrott to Rupert Murdoch, because it is financed
by a premium rate phone line for contestants keen to get on the
show. This meant that Celador Productions, the company that makes
it, was allowed to keep the rights to sell the format
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Celador, one of whose shareholders is Carrott, an English, has
sold the format to more than 52 countries, including Australia,
South Africa, Spain, Holland, Germany, Russia and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   In each territory it is dominating its peak-time slot. The
rights are shared between Celador, whose managing director, Paul
Smith, is probably already a millionaire, and the show's creators.
</P>
<P>
   Also making money is Rupert Murdoch's News International, whose
Broadsystems call center handles the phone line and takes a cut.
And Tarrant will make a cool $4 million (pounds sterling 2.5

<P>
   Millionaire fever has swept America. And we are not talking
about the booming economy or the tide of winnings from stock
trading on Wall Street. This is all about a TV game show that
started in Britain and is now commanding the airwaves on this side
of the water _ ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ABC network began airing its own version of the ITV
quiz program in the summer, it has seen its ratings explode. Last
week, it started a run of 15 hour-long ``Millionaire'' shows _ one
a day, every day for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It has trampled everything in its way, with minimum effort. The
American ``Millionaire'' is identical to the original ITV model _
the same melodramatic techno music, the same swivelling lights,
even the same spaceship set.
</P>
<P>
   True, there is no Chris Tarrant. The quiz-master is Regis
Philbin, a stalwart of U.S. daytime talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone in the U.S. seems aware of the show's ancestry.
Philbin is credited with inventing the catchphrase: ``Is that your
final answer?'' Anyone who has watched Tarrant's teasing of
competitors will know that this is his catchphrase, not Philbin's.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday this week, ``Millionaire'' drew in 26.8 million
viewers. It is estimated that after the end of this current run,
more than half of the American population will have watched it. No
other show on this autumn's American television schedule has come
near it in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   And a surprising number of people are making money from the
show, from Jasper Carrott to Rupert Murdoch, because it is financed
by a premium rate phone line for contestants keen to get on the
show. This meant that Celador Productions, the company that makes
it, was allowed to keep the rights to sell the format
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Celador, one of whose shareholders is Carrott, an English, has
sold the format to more than 52 countries, including Australia,
South Africa, Spain, Holland, Germany, Russia and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   In each territory it is dominating its peak-time slot. The
rights are shared between Celador, whose managing director, Paul
Smith, is probably already a millionaire, and the show's creators.
</P>
<P>
   Also making money is Rupert Murdoch's News International, whose
Broadsystems call center handles the phone line and takes a cut.
And Tarrant will make a cool $4 million (pounds sterling 2.5
million) for presenting the first 90 episodes in Britain. &QL;

MORE EXECUTIVE CHANGES LIKELY AT LEVI STRAUSS 
</HEADLINE>

 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Philip Marineau, the outsider who was hired to
revive Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., has fired top executives of the
struggling San Francisco jeans manufacturer and a company spokesman
said more personnel changes were anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   After just seven weeks on the job, the former Pepsi-Cola
executive has ousted John Ermatinger, 45, president of Levi's
Americas division, and Robert Holloway, 40, vice president of
marketing for people aged 15 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   The news, effective immediately, comes just one week after
Marineau removed Levi's chief marketing officer, Gordon Shank, from
his position. Shank had spent 25 years with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news for Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. because we are
renewing our company and positioning ourselves to be successful in
the year 2000,'' said Levi spokesman Jeff Beckman, explaining that
the firings were all part of Marineau's plan to turn the company
around. ``Part of that plan is Phil's recognition we must have the
right leadership in place to deliver those plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Marineau, who started in his new position Sept. 27, sent an
internal message to employees late Monday explaining the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``While John and Rob are both highly skilled professionals, it
is my assessment they do not have the level of experience and track
record in their current roles to accomplish what we need to be
successful,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ermatinger nor Holloway returned messages asking for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   To replace Holloway, Marineau promoted James Capon, vice
president of marketing for the U.S. young adult division (target
ages 25 to 34), to the newly created position of president of the
Levi's brand.
</P>
<P>
   Capon is identified in a lawsuit filed against the company by a
former Levi employee claiming retaliation. The employee, Patricia
Ogden, said she was fired after participating in an investigation
of Capon, who was then president of the Dockers brand, and Dockers
executive Vincent Tavani, who has since left the company, for
promoting women with whom they were having affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Beckman called the charges against Capon baseless. ``We
conducted a thorough investigation, and James was completely
exonerated,'' he said of Capon.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbi Silten, marketing director for the Slates brand, was
promoted to the newly created position of president of U.S. Dockers
and Slates brands. Silten has been with the company since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Levi will conduct a search to replace Ermatinger, but Marineau
will lead the Americas region in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   Beckman hinted at staff changes to come. He said, ``We'll be
making a number of other adjustments as we look forward, because we
are looking at other ways of consolidating and removing
redundancies.''
</P>
<P>
   In his lengthy memo, Marineau acknowledged that a number of
``experienced and accomplished'' employees have been leaving the
company, but he assured employees he had been hiring top talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to staff the organization at the appropriate size to
match our level of sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although still recording $6 billion in sales, Levi has been
losing its foothold in the market to other manufacturers in recent
years and reported a 13 percent drop in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   One retail expert said Levi missed the boat on a number of key
fashion trends in the jeans market and allowed its competitors _
everyone from designers to department store brands _ to horn in on
their territory.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Liebmann, of WSL Strategic Retail, a marketing and retail
consulting firm in New York, was encouraged by the fast-moving

 &HT;    WITH FLU BUG ON THE MARCH, ELDERLY WARNED TO GET SHOTS
 &HT;    Corrects time frame of poll in 6th gray to ``last year.''
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A health group urged older people Thursday to be
vaccinated against influenza, warning that 90 percent of people who
die from the disease are over age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Flu cases were reported in 30 states during the past week, said
Dr. Rashid Ahmed Chotani of John Hopkins University said at a news
conference held by the National Council on Patient Information and
Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flu is here, and we need to worry about it in a big way,''
Chotani said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Golodner, chairwoman of the council, said that ``flu, most
of which is preventable through vaccination, unfortunately takes a
heavy toll each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Influenza infects nearly 40 million Americans a year, and kills
about 20,000 of them, the council said. Americans spend nearly $4.6
million a year treating the flu.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll released Thursday found that one in five Americans
reported having the flu last year. One-fourth of those with
symptoms said they were treated by a doctor, and more than half
reported missing work.
</P>
<P>
   People with flu symptoms should contact a doctor within two days
and should consult their pharmacist for over-the-counter
medications, Golodner said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccinations reduce the risk of death from influenza by nearly
80 percent. Besides the elderly, patients with chronic illness, and
pregnant women are more susceptible to the flu and should be
vaccinated, Chotani said.
</P>
<P>
   Flu shots are offered at local heath clinics, hospitals, and
shopping malls for about $7 to $10.
</P>
<P>
   The council also announced a national campaign to educate
doctors and patients on how prevent and treat the flu. The
campaign, which includes public service announcements and a flu
awareness Internet site (www.talkaboutrx.org), will end in March
2000. The council also has a toll-free number: 1-877-358-2638.

FOR MICHAEL YORK, `OMEGA' SPELLS SUCCESS

entertainment column)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Michael York in
a scene from ``The Omega Code.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For more than 20 years actor Michael York has been a mainstay of
Hollywood's British-expatriate community, natural heir to David
Niven and Ronald Colman as a gentleman to the manner born.
 &HT;    He never quite attained the stardom of fellow Brits Michael
Caine or Sean Connery, however. Instead, he earned a reputation as
a reliable professional who could be counted on for a solid
performance, even if he wasn't likely to send a movie through the
box-office roof.
 &HT;    But late in October, to his own and everyone else's surprise,
York awoke to discover that his latest movie, the hardly heralded
``The Omega Code,'' was a hit in theaters across America,
outgrossing rivals starring the likes of Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis
and Michelle Pfeiffer.
 &HT;    Implausibly, the $7 million ``Omega Code,'' produced by the
low-profile, Christian-fundamentalist Trinity Broadcasting Network,
managed to earn more per theater than major-studio entries such as
Pitt's ``Fight Club'' and Willis and Pfeiffer's ``The Story of
Us.'' The Hollywood Reporter called its box-office take
``eye-popping.''
 &HT;    Though he admits to surprise at the actual numbers, York says
that in retrospect there were signs that something was happening.
 &HT;    ``Even before the film opened,'' he recalls, ``I was in Oklahoma
City, and a woman selling me a newspaper said, `I'm going to see
your movie the first day it opens.'''
 &HT;    In a limited release, ``Omega Code'' already has earned more
than $8 million, with a wider release planned in the next few
weeks. In Portland, Ore., the film _ which co-stars Casper Van
Dien, best known for ``Starship Troopers'' (l998), and English
actress Catherine Oxenberg, last seen on television's ``Dynasty'' _
sold more advance tickets than any film ever, save only ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace.''
 &HT;    At first, York admits, he was hesitant about doing the film,
fearing that it would come across as fundamentalist propaganda.
 &HT;    ``I first had said I wasn't interested in being in a tract,'' he
says. ``But, while it has moral underpinning, it's a millennial
thriller shot in Rome and Jerusalem.''
 &HT;    York plays Stone Alexander, a Rupert Murdoch-like media kingpin
based in Rome who hungers for the ancient knowledge hidden in a
code within the Bible _ knowledge that conveys awesome power.
 &HT;    ``And, like most power, it corrupts,'' the actor says. ``He
turns into a megalomaniac. Casper plays a guy who once worked for
Stone and then takes it upon himself to stop him.''
 &HT;    In other words, it's a classic good-vs.-evil story, a fact which
York thinks may account for much of the film's success.
 &HT;    ``TBN has grassroots-Christian folks who were complaining that
there was nothing for them to see,'' he says. ``The film took $2
million the first weekend. Now we'll see if it will cross over to
people outside of the Bible Belt.''
 &HT;    His travels across the country in his one-man show have left
York more attuned to America as a whole than is the case with many
Hollywood actors, for whom the area between New York and Los
Angeles might as well be a black hole.
 &HT;    ``What I've been hearing when I take my one-man show on the road
is that a lot of people feel that Hollywood has disenfranchised
them with all the gratuitous sex and violence masquerading as
entertainment,'' he says.
 &HT;    Not that York is much of a square. His previous film this year
had a fair bit of gratuitousness of its own _ a reprise of his role
as Basil Exposition, head of British intelligence in Mike Myers'
raunchy sequel, ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
 &HT;    ``It's hard to believe, I know,'' he says with a laugh. ``I've
been in two humongous hits in one year.''
 &HT;    It's been a while since York had that experience, though there
was a time when his films routinely earned rave reviews and bulging
box-office coffers alike.
 &HT;    His film debut was in Franco Zeffirelli's high-profile
production of ``The Taming of the Shrew'' (l966), opposite Richard
Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. The Italian director _ who had
directed York in ``Much Ado About Nothing'' at England's National
Theatre _ also cast him in ``Romeo and Juliet'' (1967).
 &HT;    The young actor worked with several other critically esteemed
directors, appearing in Joseph Losey's brilliant ``Accident''
(l966), Bob Fosse's ``Cabaret'' (l971) and Richard Lester's ``The
Three Musketeers'' (l973), as well as co-starring with fellow
up-and-comer Farrah Fawcett in the science-fiction smash ``Logan's
Run'' (l975).
 &HT;    As he aged out of his matinee-idol period, York displayed a rare
sense of perspective. Instead of burning out or dying too young
from overindulgence in the Hollywood high life, he forged a new
career for himself as a respected character actor, displaying a
poise and professionalism that are unusual in the movie industry.
 &HT;    Today he lives with his wife, the talented photographer Pat
York, in a magnificent house high in the hills above Sunset
Boulevard. At 57 he looks at least a decade younger _ young enough
to suggest that there's a Dorian Gray-style portrait aging
somewhere in his attic.
 &HT;    As that rarest of rarities, an actor who thinks about his art
and has something to say, York has lectured on the history of
acting, and is following his insightful autobiography
``Accidentally on Purpose'' (1991) with ``A Shakespearean Actor
Prepares,'' an acting treatise co-written with stage director
Adrian Brine.
 &HT;    Fans of books on tape have heard York's extremely well-modulated
tones reading a wide variety of material, from ``The Book of
Psalms'' to Anne Rice's ``The Vampire Lestat.''
 &HT;    Not that he's forsaken the screen: Besides ``The Omega Code,''
he has two other current films _ ``The Haunting of Hell House,'' a
straight-to-video gothic mystery produced by Roger Corman, based on
a Henry James short story and shot in Ireland, and ``Merchants of
Venus,'' an offbeat comedy which co-stars Beverly D'Angelo.
 &HT;    The risque ``Merchant'' was screened at the Moscow Film festival
earlier this year, as part of a Michael York retrospective _ as it
happened, one that coincided with a Kremlin exhibition of his
wife's photos.
 &HT;    It casts York as a Russian who emigrates to southern California
and, anxious not to end up driving a cab like his uncle (English
actor Brian Cox), lands a job in a marital-aids factory.
 &HT;    The classically trained British actress Prunella Gee, who
co-stars in the picture, kept telling York what an enormous switch
the role was for her.
 &HT;    ``But I told her, you don't put a label around your neck saying
`Dramatic Actor,''' York says. ``You do it all. In Britain, that's
the tradition.''
 &HT;    That's his philosophy _ stay around and stay busy.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, working in rubbish is not good for you or anyone,''
York says. ``But you have to recognize that everything is changing.
Some actors can hold off without working for years. But when I'm
not working I'm writing or lecturing, busier than when I'm filming.
 &HT;    ``And you never know what's going to happen,'' he adds.
``Studios can spend $100 million on a picture and it totally goes
bottom-up. Then you can get a `Blair Witch Project,' and it
works.''
 &HT;    Or you can get ``The Omega Code,'' which is making York a star _
all over again.

   WASHINGTON _ The mystery of what happened to the Egyptair Boeing
767 which crashed off the U.S. coast two weeks ago may finally be
solved this week, as the tape from the cockpit voice recorder is
painstakingly transcribed and analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in British and American media has so far blamed
mechanical failure, a struggle between the crew, a bomb, a hijack
and a suicidal crew member, without any evidence whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators from America's National Transportation and
Safety Board have been extremely careful not to speculate, and the
lack of any ``steer'' has to some extent encouraged the media to
make up theories.
</P>
<P>
   But the nationality of the crew and the plane have also
apparently encouraged reporters to make irresponsible guesses at
what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In previous crashes, infighting between the U.S. agencies
investigating the incident has contributed to a welter of
conflicting stories about the cause. This time, the authorities
have sought to stop speculation by focusing on the facts.
</P>
<P>
   But anonymous sources from one U.S. agency have repeatedly
leaked their views to the press.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest indications from the cockpit voice recorder are
that there was a problem with the aircraft, the crew tried to deal
with it, but that things went rapidly from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happens. Alarms go off. Both work to try to fix
it,'' an unnamed source told the Associated Press after the
investigators listened to the tape for the first time. ``There is
some kind of problem that they're dealing with. It gets
progressively worse. And the tape stops.''
</P>
<P>
   The source, however, apparently did not speak Arabic and had not
understood anything on the tape, which tends to undermine his
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   From the aircraft's flight data recorder, it is known that for
some reason the crew disengaged the autopilot. The aircraft began
dropping from 33,000 feet at a 40-degree angle, reaching a speed
just short of the sound barrier, and reaching zero gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The engines were apparently manually shut down during the dive.
It reached 16,000 feet and then climbed back up to 24,000 feet
before falling rapidly again and breaking up. This pattern of
events does not fit readily with any known course of action in
response to a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The first reports from the voice recorder did seem to lessen the
probability of one of the many competing, and contradictory,
accounts made up in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication of a fight between the crew, who were
speaking ``like pals,'' said AP. Nor was there any sign that
someone had entered the cockpit. Indeed, there was never any
evidence whatsoever for this theory.
</P>
<P>
   A government official told Newsweek magazine that Boeing was
``pushing'' the theory that a cockpit struggle was responsible for
the crash. Boeing denied this. If mechanical failure is the cause,
then there might be serious implications for Boeing, including
legal action.
</P>
<P>
   The supposition of a cockpit fight was based on the fact that
the flight elevators had been moved in opposite directions moments
before the aircraft crashed, and from this the inference was drawn
that the pilot and co-pilot were acting against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, it assumed that the decision to shut off the autopilot
and the engines were irrational, something that cannot be known
until the causes of the aircraft's initial problem are known.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation that one of the crew might have tried to kill
himself, or have fought with his colleagues, was based on no
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It seems highly unlikely that U.S. newspapers would have made
these accusations against an America pilot who had died in similar
circumstances, and the families and friends of the crew have
understandably responded angrily to these libels.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ahmed al Habashy, the lead pilot, was stable and happy,
his wife and brother have said. He was close to retirement. ``He
never smoked or drank alcohol,'' his brother told Agence France
Presse. ``He had no bad habits. He was very religious and prayed
and was always reading the Koran,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald felt it necessary to add that he was ``not an
extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-pilot Adel Anwar was due to be married five days after the
flight and had exchanged slots with another flight officer to
return home sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Other theories with equally little evidence have also surfaced.
The first was that the reverse thrusters might have malfunctioned,
based on a similiar crash of a Boeing 767 in Thailand _ an aircraft
that was made at the same time as the Egyptair plane. The data
recorders seemed to rule this out.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald reported that a flight attendant called Hassan
Sherif telephoned his wife, Rania, from New York to say ``there was
something wrong with the plane'' and that he was ``very worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Egyptair said that there was a flight attendant on the aircraft
called Hassan Farouk, not Hassan Sherif. Rania Reda is his fiancee,
not his wife. ``He just told me that the plane was delayed at Los
Angeles and he is waiting for the plane,'' Reda told Associated
Press Television News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   More than one newspaper has blamed terrorism, citing the
aircraft's flight profile, the suddenness of the problem and the
lack of a distress call. It has also been noted that the aircraft
had a large number of Egyptian military personnel on it.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI have given no signs that they are actively looking at
terrorism as a likely cause, though some kind of sudden incident
might have led the aircraft to depressurize rapidly, and the crew
might then have taken it lower.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaks from the inquiry may come from the FBI, which
would take over the investigation if there was a strong presumption
of criminal activity. The FBI has been heavily criticized for a
number of investigations recently, and is seeking extra funds for
an expansion and reorganization of its activities _ including a new
counter-terrorism unit. &QL;

NETWORKS MAY BE CATCHING ON _ ORIGINALITY SELLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes a while to get the networks' attention. Twenty years,
in this case, and that's probably about average.
</P>
<P>
   The message, once they are more or less alert and have wiped the
drool from their chins:
</P>
<P>
   HELLO, NETWORKS. GUESS WHAT? PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF YOU AND YOU
HAVE TO GIVE THEM A REASON TO TURN ON THEIR TV SETS!
</P>
<P>
   Or they won't. Or they'll turn on the sets and leave the room.
Or they'll go on a surfing safari _ everybody's learning how _ for
hours at a time, from one channel to the next. Or they'll ignore
the TV and talk to their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   This is a revelation to network TV. One minute, everybody was
perfectly happy watching ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley.'' A minute later, the
networks couldn't get viewers to watch the latest sitcom if you
paid them.
</P>
<P>
   People still seem willing to watch the occasional drama, so long
as it's not exactly like every other drama. Which is a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The same old-same old isn't cutting it anymore. Our voodoo
trance has lifted. Too much of the tiresome has spoiled the medium.
One more ``Friends'' knockoff, one more wacky neighbor, one more
goofy girlfriend, and we're outta there. Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   The audience craves something different. Almost anything
different. Slowly, the networks are learning to give it to them,
though they might still be garbling the message.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone think the phenomenal success of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' is due solely to a pent-up demand for quiz shows?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes. The networks probably do, because Fox whipped up
``Greed'' in a jiffy and NBC is supposed to be dickering with a
``Twenty-One'' revival. It better hurry.
</P>
<P>
   (Quick diversion. Speaking of ``Greed,'' it was unpardonable how
the producers milked their million-dollar winners through three
commercial breaks last Thursday. In effect, they cheated viewers
and suspended time to bring the winning contestants back this week,
probably to announce that they'll take their money and not pursue
the $2.2 million jackpot.)
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the big-money quiz show genre has been dormant so long
that ``Millionaire'' and ``Greed'' seem new, involving and exciting
_ sensations no one would ascribe to ``Shasta McNasty'' or ``Oh
Grow Up.''
</P>
<P>
   After a frenzy of imitation, quiz shows will run their course
and we'll all be yawning again, as with prime-time animated shows
and newsmagazine shows. But the first full flush is fun. TV needs
fun.
</P>
<P>
   There are glimmering signs that the broader message is being
received. The message is that programmers must escape ruts.
</P>
<P>
   The TV universe will collapse if it is dominated by
cookie-cutter series and generic movies. Titillation and
promotional sizzle can't sustain the old forms in the absence of
fresh types of programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie'' was a big hit earlier this month for several reasons.
Those included a production standard that was crisp and wholesome.
It was an old musical done new, and right, and respectfully, all of
which made it a novelty. And its ratings dwarfed those of two
hackneyed miniseries on CBS and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is already drawing criticism for ``Survivor,'' a show being
readied for next summer. Something about stranding 16 contestants
on a Pacific island called Pulau Tiga and letting them vote
periodically to winnow the group to one ``survivor,'' who will win
a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Survivor'' concept has already had a life abroad. A death,
too _ a losing Swedish contestant committed suicide after he
returned home in 1997. But it'll be something different for the
U.S. audience.
</P>
<P>
   Come July, which would you rather see on CBS, '`Survivor'' or a
``Cosby'' rerun? I'd rather Pulau Tiga by the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has every reason to embrace the new, inasmuch as its
existing programming has taken a high-board dive into an empty
pool. Sure enough, it's reportedly considering a neat twist on the
``Millionaire'' phenom.
</P>
<P>
   An inside source said ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire''
is in television's ``primordial ooze right now,'' but may surface
soon with a contestant search.
</P>
<P>
   It's self-explanatory. A multimillionaire, unmarried but not
unwilling. And a national search, or contest, for a ready-made
spouse. It's real. The presumed sequel, a ``Who Wants to Divorce a
Multimillionaire,'' is an altogether different genre.
</P>
<P>
   So we've got greed and lust covered, or at least greed. UPN can
work on gluttony: ``Who Wants to Eat a Cow.''
</P>
<P>
   It's low stuff, more apt to lead to riches than honor. But
whatever else these show are, they aren't just another batch of
sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that makes them beautiful.

<P>
   STAN BERG, Yugoslavia _ With a cold November rain pelting her,
Shensie Mernica rushes to gather in the laundry hanging on a line
by the chaos of bricks, lumber and stone that used to be her
family's house.
</P>
<P>
   The rubble is strewn among the remains of a dozen houses built
on the steep hillside among the mountains of northern Kosovo. The
gold and orange of the trees could be autumn in Appalachia. The air
is damp and cold, and the mornings have begun to feature frost on
the grass and fallen leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Across a muddy footpath a few yards away, her father, Beram
Mernica studies the scene of his 14-year-old daughter working in
the rain. He said the houses were destroyed last February in a
grenade attack by Serbs battling separatist rebels in the village.
Four people in one neighboring family were killed. Mernica
indicated their house with a nod and then looked at what is left of
his.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will take three years to rebuild,'' he says, the cold
rain soaking through his nylon jacket. ``But we will rebuild no
matter how long it takes. What else can we do?''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say when Mernica will see his family sleep in the
warmth of a real house _ an experience they haven't had in 10
months. A week ago, aid workers moved the family of 13 from a tent
near the ruin to an abandoned building at the base of the hill to
settle in before the snow.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is just one of 50,000 houses demolished in a particularly
ugly brand of warfare that seemed designed to burn the roof from
over every head in the province. Nearly half the houses in Kosovo
were damaged in the war between Yugoslav forces and ethnic Albanian
separatists. The war ended in June after NATO's 78-day bombing
campaign forced Serb leader Slobodan
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, Yugoslavia's president, to withdraw his troops. Since
then, about 800,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have returned to their
homes to pick up the pieces and start over.
</P>
<P>
   For the legion of international relief groups swarming across
Kosovo, the immediate task is to get everyone into shelter before
the freeze. In the spring, the reconstruction can begin in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a very rough winter ahead,'' said Tom Hurley, the
director of C.A.R.E. International's mission in Kosovo. ``There
will be a lot of people who will be very uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hurley believes the threat of a humanitarian disaster with
widespread loss of life is subsiding. ``I don't think there will be
a lot of deaths,'' he said. ``Our primary mission has been to save
lives, and I think we have accomplished that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the atmosphere is anything but placid. With signs of a
fierce Balkan winter already evident, aid workers seem overwhelmed
by the challenge of providing shelter for the nearly 300,000
Kosovars whose homes were damaged beyond repair. By most accounts,
the shelter effort is running weeks behind schedule, leaving
thousands of people searching for cover as November passes into
December.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations refugee agency had hoped to provide each
family at least one warm, dry room by the onset of winter. But the
challenge of obtaining the materials _ mostly plastic sheeting and
lumber _ and delivering them to Kosovo have forced the relief
community to accept the reality that winter will catch them before
they will get everyone under cover.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Kosovars must help each other _ a capacity they
demonstrated impressively last spring and summer when they were
crammed into refugee camps and the houses of fellow Albanians in
neighboring Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Each family that receives a new roof must house other families,
sometimes two. Many have already left their villages and moved in
with friends or relatives in the cities. The provincial capital
Pristina, for example, has swollen to twice its pre-war population
of 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-November, aid agencies had distributed only half the
nearly 70,000 repair kits designed to allow the former refugees to
spend the winter in their own homes, according to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agency for International Development, one of the lead
groups providing shelter, has put temporary roofs of heavy plastic
and lumber on only 28 percent of the houses it has targeted. It is
scrambling to get the rest up before the end of December.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Maynard, the head of USAID's disaster assistance relief
team in Pristina, acknowledged the agency has endured delays in
obtaining materials but it now has what it needs to provide the
shelter it promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the work now to increase exponentially over the next
few weeks,'' Maynard said. ``We think that by doing all the things
we plan to do, the Kosovars will survive the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the shelter campaign is reaching its pre-winter
climax just as the supply line into Kosovo from neighboring
Macedonia has become impassable because of a combination of
overwhelmed border guards and a huge surplus of cars, trucks and
military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the winding 10 miles of two-lane road between
Skopje, the Macedonian capital, and the border crossing at Blace
was bumper-to-bumper. Some truckers had been waiting in line for a
week or more.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian aid trucks received little preferential treatment
and even NATO vehicles were detained several hours at the border.
Ordinary people who want to cross the border are dropped off as
close to the crossing as traffic permits and then walk across to
find a taxi on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Blace crossing is the same narrow bridge that
would have been employed for a NATO land invasion if the air war
hadn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat in the region said the bottleneck was
perhaps the single greatest challenge to the relief efforts.
Officials are working virtually every day to improve the flow.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems facing Kosovo _ many of them so complex
that many people seem relieved to focus on winter rather than the
future of this troubled place _ there are many encouraging signs.
</P>
<P>
   The rich, black soil in the countryside is plowed and planted
with winter wheat, the first crop for many in two years. Retail
shops in Pristina and other cities are full of merchandise and
fresh produce. People in the streets seem triumphant. In a few
nightclubs, young Albanians dressed in black smoke American
cigarettes and listen to jazz. Children, many of them clad in what
appears to be clothing donated by Americans _ particularly Chicago
Bulls fans _ go to school toting books and papers in new UNICEF
backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have turned to combating a rampant respiratory infection
called by some the ``Kosovo cough'' instead of mending gunshot and
shrapnel wounds.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also still very soon after a war that did not produce
a clear solution to the conflict. Kosovo is still a part of Serbia
and officials in Belgrade show little desire to set it free.
</P>
<P>
   The devastation of a year of warfare will take years to rebuild.
Making things more complicated, the aid community must create a
civil government structure to deliver services and rebuild a
shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some signs of prosperity, more than 900,000 people _
about half of Kosovo's population _ will receive food assistance
from the World Food Program this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups expect to be in Kosovo for five to 10 years, and
there is no sign that the precarious security situation will allow
the multinational military force known as KFOR to head home any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   And the sheer size of the reconstruction effort is daunting.
Take the issue of restoring the province's housing stock. The year
before the war, the province produced only 2,000 new houses. At its
peak production a decade ago _ with the full support of a
relatively healthy Yugoslav economy _ Kosovo added only 7,000 new
houses.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100,000 damaged houses, the arithmetic suggests
the end of international involvement is very far off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about rebuilding a city the size of Buffalo,''
said C.A.R.E.'s Hurley. ``That takes time.''

OKLAHOMA HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYER GETS PAST DISABILITY (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most young defensive backs, Levi Nowlin fantasizes about
big plays. It's an ordinary daydream: Intercept a pass, sprint for
the end zone and start highstepping in for the touchdown, Deion
Sanders-style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practice it all the time,'' said Nowlin, a 5-foot-3,
120-pound strong safety for the Quapaw (Okla.) High School football
team.
</P>
<P>
   But while it might be a common dream for ballplayers, Nowlin
faces anuncommon physical obstacle to make that play happen. A
birth defect left Nowlin with one leg and no hands. Nowlin must use
a prosthesis not only to compete in three sports but get around in
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the disability, nothing seemed to get in the way of
Nowlin's inspiring performance this season for Quapaw.
</P>
<P>
   Nowlin capped off his first season of varsity football by being
a unanimous selection for newcomer of the year in his team's
district. And in a recent column in the Fort Worth (Texas)
Star-Telegram, Deion Sanders recognized Nowlin, writing: ``I'm here
to tell you that I'm not too old to have heroes. His story is
certainly an inspiration to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Having Sanders acknowledge his efforts ``just blew my mind,''
Nowlin said. ``Here he is, Deion Sanders; and here I am from little
old Quapaw, Oklahoma. It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowlin also has an apparent fan in Colcord football coach James
Bryant, who nominated Nowlin and confirmed that the selection was
legitimate. ``We didn't know about him until we played 'em,''
Bryant said. ``Watching all the game tapes on Quapaw, we never
noticed his condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it wasn't like he shied away from contact; he played as
hard as anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said his players, at first stunned by Nowlin's effort,
pulled no punches. ``They didn't tear into him, but they tried to
block him when they had to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the honor, Nowlin, who plans to lift weights to improve
his size, said he made a lot of mistakes the past season. ``I
didn't play as good as I could play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Simpson, Nowlin's coach, said football fans in this
northeastern Oklahoma community don't necessarily see a young
athlete overcoming a handicap this season. Instead, they see ``the
situation of a young man aspiring to be a college football
player,'' Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowlin's goals are simple: One, he'd like to play football as
long as he's physically able; two, he'd like to see a Cowboys game
and Sanders play.
</P>
<P>
   Why Sanders, whose flamboyant style differs from Nowlin's humble
persona? ``I've liked him for a long time,'' Nowlin said. ``He gets
the crowd going.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said he has known for a long time that Sanders is
Nowlin's favorite. ``He's tried (a touchdown dance) a couple of
times in practice,'' he said. ``But in our (winless) situation, we
kind of shy away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one deserves to do one more than Nowlin.

`SLEEPY HOLLOW': HEADLESS HORSEMAN, EMPHASIS ON `HEADLESS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year is 1799 and ``the millennium is almost upon us,''
according to the newly dashing Ichabod Crane played by Johnny Depp
in Tim Burton's enthusiastically bleak new movie. And speaking of
dashing, when Ichabod gallops north from New York City, he rides up
the west bank of the Hudson River although the village of Sleepy
Hollow is on the east. But an ornate visual fantasy of Burton's can
be expected to make its own rules, and ``Sleepy Hollow'' does that
with macabre gusto. His idea of a beautiful day may be somebody
else's nuclear winter, but Burton eagerly brings his visions of
sugarplums to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   So when it comes to appearances, this dark, shivery ``Sleepy
Hollow'' manages to be as distinctively Burtonesque as ``Edward
Scissorhands'' or ``Batman.'' Offering a serenely unrecognizable
take on Washington Irving's story and its famously unlucky
schoolteacher, the film brings its huge reserves of creativity to
bear upon matters like the severing of heads. Quaint Dutch burghers
of the Hudson Valley could have bowled ninepins throughout Rip Van
Winkle's sleep-in with the supply of decapitated heads sent flying
here, even if Burton handles such sequences with his own brand of
wit. Shot 1: Sword approaches victim. Shot 2: Blood splashes
Ichabod's glasses. Shot 3: Head rolls away. Shot 4: Body pitches
forward. Pause for laugh.
</P>
<P>
   History will recognize the rich imagination and secret
tenderness of Burton's best films. (From a purely technical
standpoint, as in the award-ready cinematography of Emmanuel
Lubezki, this grimly voluptuous ``Sleepy Hollow'' must be one of
them.) But it will also raise the question of what we were smoking
during this period of infatuation with grisliness on screen. It is
not unreasonable to admire Burton immensely without wanting to peer
at the exposed brain stems of his characters, but ``Sleepy Hollow''
leaves no choice. As written by Andrew Kevin Walker, who took off
Gwyneth Paltrow's head in ``Seven'' and apparently considered that
small potatoes, ``Sleepy Hollow'' turns the tale of the Headless
Horseman into the pre-tabloid story of a rampaging serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons to be troubled by this, and they aren't about
squeamishness. Walker's credits also include ``Fight Club,'' a
genuinely daring effort to make sense of the violent impulses of
buttoned-down young men, and to plumb those dangers found at the
nexus of popular culture and political fanaticism. That, at least,
had the hallmarks of something different, and it involved a much
lower body count than the one racked up by the Headless Horseman.
But ``Sleepy Hollow,'' in the guise of an exotic fable and
horror-film homage, offers little such ballast. For all its visual
cleverness, it's much more conventionally conceived than Burton's
admirers would expect.
</P>
<P>
   Even birds nesting in one of the film's vast, wintry indoor sets
found themselves trying to get away, moving into the only
blossom-filled backdrop that ``Sleepy Hollow'' uses (only for brief
fantasy scenes). But the bulk of the film unfolds in a forbidding,
fairy-tale village and forest that are as ambitious as the Gotham
City of ``Batman.'' It is here that Ichabod, who now has a faintly
English accent and Depp's playful charisma, is sent to solve a
series of murders and to find that everyone in Sleepy Hollow looks
mildly suspect. It is also here that he learns of the vengeful,
headless Hessian (Christopher Walken in redundant fright makeup)
who is the town's main tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Using a color palette more often associated with stories of the
gulag, ``Sleepy Hollow'' creates a landscape so daunting that even
a large tree bleeds. At moments like the one revealing the tree's
bloody secret, and in a couple of incidents involving witchcraft,
Burton's film delivers a scare or two, but most of it is too tongue
in cheek for that. As this film's Ichabod conducts a Holmesian
murder investigation and even unearths a village conspiracy, he has
much better luck with Katrina Van Tassel than any traditional
Ichabod ever did. Katrina is played photogenically by Christina
Ricci, who gets through the film gamely while remaining very much a
sardonic creature of her own time.
</P>
<P>
   An impressive cast shows off Colleen Atwood's sumptuous costumes
and delivers dialogue, some apparently worked on by Tom Stoppard,
sometimes graced with a clever edge. Miranda Richardson swishes
dangerously through the proceedings as Katrina's obviously wicked
stepmother, while the town elders include Michael Gough, Michael
Gambon and Jeffrey Jones. The horror patriarch Christopher Lee is
here, as well he ought to be. And Marc Pickering plays the teenage
sidekick whom Ichabod cautions, as he might the audience, with ``I
hope you have a strong stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many scenes of cheeky mayhem, one finds a little boy
cowering beneath floorboards while the Horseman harvests the heads
of his parents. In case you were thinking of taking the children. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A second team of Egyptian aviation specialists
arrived here Thursday to join U.S. investigators in an effort to
agree on what was said in the cockpit of the doomed EgyptAir Flight
990 and whether it helps confirm or dispel the theory that a
co-pilot caused the fatal dive.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, a deputy attorney general, Eric
Holder, cautioned that investigators had reached no conclusions.
``It's simply too early to decide exactly what has happened here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian authorities have angrily protested against what they
say is a rush to blame the co-pilot, Gamil Batouti, and to portray
the crash as a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded in delaying a handover of the investigation to
the FBI, which is regarded by some Egyptians as an intrusive
intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators have moved steadily toward the conviction
that Batouti uttered a prayer, plunged the plane into a sharp
descent, then struggled to keep its nose down as the captain
returned to the cockpit and fought desperately for control. All 217
aboard died in the crash on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   A snatch of conversation from the audio tapes recovered from the
wreckage, not officially made public but widely disseminated,
apparently has Batouti saying, ``I put my trust in God'' shortly
before the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Nabil Fahmy said Thursday that Egyptians were ``angry
about the way this is being reported.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned against leaping to conclusions as, he noted,
happened with the Oklahoma City bombing of a federal building in
1995, when Arabs were at first suspected, or with the bombing at
the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, which was wrongly attributed to
a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Fahmy said he had listened to the tape. He would not comment on
its contents, but said it did not appear to confirm a suicide
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said that Egyptian cooperation had been excellent but
indicated that the investigation would not be guided from Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working in partnership with Egypt,'' he said at a
news briefing. ``But I would not say anything is contingent upon
the approval of the Egyptian government.''
</P>
<P>
   Batouti's family has rejected suggestions that he was suffering
from financial woes or psychological depression. He was not an
Islamic extremist, they say, nor, as a Muslim, would he have
considered suicide, let alone what would amount to mass homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the confusion and sharp dissent over what the tapes reveal,
the next few days of listening, translating and analyzing the data
_ and correlating what was said with the data-recorder information
on when different cockpit controls were activated _ could prove
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board said it would work
through the weekend to provide a ``literal, factual transcript of
all conversations and sounds'' aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
   A meticulously coordinated time line could provide crucial
information. A prayer by the co-pilot would have a dramatically
different meaning if uttered just before he sent the plane into a
dive, as U.S. investigators now believe, than it would if it came
just after he had discovered some grave mechanical malfunction. Or
if, as some Arabic speakers say, his prayer was simply a
commonplace one.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials, and many Arabic and Muslim experts, insist
that such an invocation of God is routine for many Muslims. They
have demanded a more careful study of the tapes and warned against
any rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still working to synchronize the timing of the
voice recorder with the 150 data channels on the flight data
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board has repeatedly said that the EgyptAir data
recorder, one of the most sophisticated available, showed no sign
of any mechanical disability.
</P>
<P>
   But the data analysis will not be an easy task either and it is
not clear whether the American and Egyptian authorities will
ultimately be able to agree on all points.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said it could take at least five days for a
precise transcription of the final minutes of the flight to be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis now involves safety board experts, Federal Bureau
of Investigation agents, translators, specialists from the Egyptian
aviation authority and EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Thursday, representatives of Boeing, which
made the plane, and of Pratt &AMP; Whitney, which made its jet engines,
were included in meetings to listen to the tape, along with the
Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of understanding and carefully translating the
Arabic voices heard on the tape has been a thorny one. Different
interpreters have rendered various phrases differently.
</P>
<P>
   The prayer Batouti reportedly uttered is one that Muslim
passengers and crew frequently recite before a flight. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A report that Batouti had sent money back with a colleague a day
before returning himself was denied by a son, Mohammed, a police
officer, who said he personally had asked his father to send $300
as soon as possible, the Los Angeles Times reported.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A second team of Egyptian aviation specialists
arrived here Thursday to join U.S. investigators in an effort to
agree on what was said in the cockpit of the doomed EgyptAir Flight
990 and whether it helps confirm or dispel the theory that a
co-pilot caused the fatal dive.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, a deputy attorney general, Eric
Holder, cautioned that investigators had reached no conclusions.
``It's simply too early to decide exactly what has happened here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian authorities have angrily protested against what they
say is a rush to blame the co-pilot, Gamil Batouti, and to portray
the crash as a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded in delaying a handover of the investigation to
the FBI, which is regarded by some Egyptians as an intrusive
intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators have moved steadily toward the conviction
that Batouti uttered a prayer, plunged the plane into a sharp
descent, then struggled to keep its nose down as the captain
returned to the cockpit and fought desperately for control. All 217
aboard died in the crash on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   A snatch of conversation from the audio tapes recovered from the
wreckage, not officially made public but widely disseminated,
apparently has Batouti saying, ``I put my trust in God'' shortly
before the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Nabil Fahmy said Thursday that Egyptians were ``angry
about the way this is being reported.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned against leaping to conclusions as, he noted,
happened with the Oklahoma City bombing of a federal building in
1995, when Arabs were at first suspected, or with the bombing at
the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, which was wrongly attributed to
a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Fahmy said he had listened to the tape. He would not comment on
its contents, but said it did not appear to confirm a suicide
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said that Egyptian cooperation had been excellent but
indicated that the investigation would not be guided from Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working in partnership with Egypt,'' he said at a
news briefing. ``But I would not say anything is contingent upon
the approval of the Egyptian government.''
</P>
<P>
   Batouti's family has rejected suggestions that he was suffering
from financial woes or psychological depression. He was not an
Islamic extremist, they say, nor, as a Muslim, would he have
considered suicide, let alone what would amount to mass homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the confusion and sharp dissent over what the tapes reveal,
the next few days of listening, translating and analyzing the data
_ and correlating what was said with the data-recorder information
on when different cockpit controls were activated _ could prove
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board said it would work
through the weekend to provide a ``literal, factual transcript of
all conversations and sounds'' aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
   A meticulously coordinated time line could provide crucial
information. A prayer by the co-pilot would have a dramatically
different meaning if uttered just before he sent the plane into a
dive, as U.S. investigators now believe, than it would if it came
just after he had discovered some grave mechanical malfunction. Or
if, as some Arabic speakers say, his prayer was simply a
commonplace one.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials, and many Arabic and Muslim experts, insist
that such an invocation of God is routine for many Muslims. They
have demanded a more careful study of the tapes and warned against
any rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still working to synchronize the timing of the
voice recorder with the 150 data channels on the flight data
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board has repeatedly said that the EgyptAir data
recorder, one of the most sophisticated available, showed no sign
of any mechanical disability.
</P>
<P>
   But the data analysis will not be an easy task either and it is
not clear whether the American and Egyptian authorities will
ultimately be able to agree on all points.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said it could take at least five days for a
precise transcription of the final minutes of the flight to be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis now involves safety board experts, Federal Bureau
of Investigation agents, translators, specialists from the Egyptian
aviation authority and EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Thursday, representatives of Boeing, which
made the plane, and of Pratt &AMP; Whitney, which made its jet engines,
were included in meetings to listen to the tape, along with the
Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of understanding and carefully translating the
Arabic voices heard on the tape has been a thorny one. Different
interpreters have rendered various phrases differently.
</P>
<P>
   The prayer Batouti reportedly uttered is one that Muslim
passengers and crew frequently recite before a flight. &QL;

<P>
   A report that Batouti had sent money back with a colleague a day
before returning himself was denied by a son, Mohammed, a police
officer, who said he personally had asked his father to send $300
as soon as possible, the Los Angeles Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   A nephew, Sharif Batouti, denied that medical bills for
treatment of one of Batouti's daughter in Los Angeles for lupus had
left the family in financial difficulty. His uncle, he said, was
``filthy rich'' from an inheritance, land holdings, and his

really want to learn more about its subject matter.

Smith, $60) _ The photos and artifacts represented here are drawn

   Sports

animals and plants and oceans.

first.

   ``Building the Book: Cathedral'' by David Macaulay (HM Company,
$29.95) _ The difficulty in describing this book _ it's sort of a
primer on how a Gothic cathedral was designed and constructed _
shouldn't be taken as any indication that it's less than
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If This House Could Talk: Historic Homes, Extraordinary
Americans'' by Elizabeth Smith Brownstein (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35) _
Yes, we get more about Lincoln's home in Springfield and Robert
Frost's New Hampshire Farm, but we also visit Booker T.
Washington's residence in Tuskegee, Ala.; Edward Gorey's digs in
Yarmouth Port, Mass.; and other unexpectedly interesting dwelling
places.

<P>
   Texas
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Friends: Great Texas Courthouses'' by Bill Morgan
(Landmark Publishing, $55) _ The price is a bit steep, but the
quality is unquestionable. From Mason to Mount Vernon, Morgan takes
readers on an engaging tour of those ubiquitous small-town squares
and their courthouse centerpieces that we all recognize and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Cattle Barons: Their Families, Land and Legacy'' by
Elmer Kelton, photography by Kathleen Jo Ryan (Ten Speed Press,
$49.95) _ Kelton's essays are, as always, great fun and
informative, too. Ryan's accompanying photos help maintain a
friendly tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Houses Built by the Book: The Use of Published Designs,
1850-1925'' by Margaret Culbertson (Texas A&AMP;M, $39.95) _ It is
undoubtedly true only dedicated state historians would be initially
drawn by this book. But it's not as limited as it sounds;
Culbertson gives readers a sense of why houses were built in
certain ways, and it's enjoyable.

THE BEST OF THE COFFEE-TABLE BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
and LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems that each year, a dominant theme emerges among the
hundreds of oversize or ``coffee-table'' books. Animals in the Wild
was the subject in 1995; Art was the rage in '96 and '97; and Home
Decorating dominated in 1998. In 1999 _ you guessed it _ there is a
plethora of coffee-table books that claim to encapsulate the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   We have 1900-99 represented in more ways than Hillary Rodham
Clinton has had hairstyles. Want to understand these 100 years via
art or photographs or athletic achievements or architecture? You
can take your pick. Other, less dominant trends include more
coffee-table books devoted to sports and literature. There are
still plenty of art books, and tomes about all things Texan are
more numerous than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are so many oversized books to choose among this
year, we have selected 42 books from almost 700 for a ``best-of''
listing. The 10 we believe are the best are ranked in order. The
other 32 are grouped by category and listed alphabetically.
</P>
<P>
   THE 10 bEST:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Century'' (Phaidon, $49.95) _ It is almost inconceivable
that this fabulous collection of photos and brief essays is priced
so low. ``Century'' is the clear-cut best oversize book of 1999
because it is concise, yet completely captures each year. The art
is superb, the printed words crackling and appropriate. Even if you
don't otherwise collect coffee-table books, you ought to have this
one. Placed in a time capsule or blasted into outer space, it would
serve well as evidence of who and what we were circa 1900-99.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Earth From Above'' by Yann Arthus-Bertrand (Abrams, $65) _
Arthus-Bertrand spent five years circumnavigating the globe to work
his magic as an aerial photographer. The results are masterful;
you'll have the sensation of viewing our beautiful planet from a
hovering spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Brassai: The Eye of Paris'' by Anne Wilkes Tucker with
Richard Howard and Avis Berman (Abrams, $60) _ Published in
conjunction with a recent exhibition at The Museum of Fine Arts in
Houston, this collection of the French photographer's genius is
outstanding. It isn't just for francophiles.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``The American Art Book'' (Phaidon, $39.95) _ From Berenice
Abbott to William Zorich, with Donald Judd and Sister Gertrude
Morgan and Nancy Spero in between, this richly illustrated tome
presents samples of the work of 500 great American artists. A
glossary and listing of museums where featured works are displayed
sums up an outstanding collection.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``American Chronicle: Year by Year Through the Twentieth
Century'' by Lois Gordon and Alan Gordon (Yale University Press,
$49.95) _ The title is self-explanatory. What's special (and
endearing) about this book is that it doesn't pretend to have only
lofty information. Yes, we learn which symphonic works were
composed in certain years, which historic events occurred when and
which great books were written. But there's an annual listing of
hit TV shows, too.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``The Holy Bible'' illustrated by Barry Moser (Viking Studio,
$65) _ This is not a new work but is the century's only published
Bible illustrated by a single artist. He is Barry Moser, the gifted
designer/illustrator whose other works adorn such sanctified spots
as New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery
of Art in Washington, D.C. This book is huge, weighing in at easily
5 pounds, but it is so, so beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Diego Rivera'' by Pete Hamill (Abrams, $49.50) _ Most books
representing works by an artist are heavy on the art and light on
the printed commentary. This is almost the reverse. Hamill, in a
chatty rather than professorial style, tells us all about events in
Rivera's life that influenced his art. If you just want pretty
pictures, choose another book. But if you want to learn about a
great artist, ``Diego Rivera'' is a perfect choice.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``Glory: Photographs of Athletes'' by Richard Corman (Morrow,
$45) _ Muhammad Ali's visage peers forth on the cover, but this
isn't another of those find-'em-everywhere coffee-table books with
huge black-and-white portraits of familiar faces such as Michael
Jordan, Nancy Kerrigan and Ken Griffey Jr. Instead, Corman
intersperses the expected snaps of George Foreman and Michael
Johnson with breathtaking photos of cyclists and college wrestling
coaches and just plain folks out for a little exercise.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Great African-American Women'' by Darryl Lyman (Jonathan
David Publishers, $29.95) _ Oprah is included here, and Rosa Parks
and Barbara Jordan and others who made their historic mark and have
received deserved acclaim. But Lyman also singles out great women
whom most of us might never have heard about, such as Juanita Kidd
Stout, the first black woman to serve on a state supreme court, and
Elizabeth Ross Haynes, who fought the YWCA's color barrier until
full integration was achieved in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Peanuts: A Golden Celebration'' by Charles Schulz
(HarperCollins, $45) _ Good grief, Charlie Brown! Are you really
50? It's true, and creator Charles Schulz takes us on an engaging
romp through the cartoon past. It's regrettable, though, that
nowhere is it pointed out that, without ``Peanuts' '' gentle social
proddings, the world might not have accepted ``Doonesbury'' or
``Bloom County'' a couple of decades later.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the rest
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century (any titles with a millennium theme):
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Century: Art &AMP; Culture 1900-1950'' by Barbara
Haskell (Whitney Museum/Norton, $60) _ It's only half a century,
but why quibble? Haskell, the Whitney curator of painting and
sculpture, gives us 50 years' worth of eye- and mind-candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Photography: A Century of Images'' by Vicki Goldberg
and Robert Silberman (Chronicle Books, $40) _ An adjunct to the PBS
TV series, this book will conjure many memories, including some
that are uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Century of Country: An Illustrated History of Country
Music'' by Robert K. Oermann (TV Books, $39.95) _ The 1900s country
scene kicked off with Powder River Jack and Kitty Lee, and ends
with the Dixie Chicks and Tim McGraw. This book tells you how and
why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children's History of the 20th Century'' (DK Publishing,
$29.95) _ As with all DK's titles for younger readers, this one is
colorful, concise and entertaining. It ought to be a study staple
for every child in junior high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine: The Spirit of 20th-Century American Heroes'' edited
by Gina Misiroglu (New World Library, $29.95) _ A hallmark of
20th-century history was the opportunity to record the thoughts and
acts of great men and women in their own words. JFK, Amelia
Earhart, Paul Robeson and many more speak to us between this book's
covers. MORE: .MDUL/ nn

   Patrick Stewart In Miller's `Ride'
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Stewart, whose last appearance on Broadway was in the
acclaimed 1995 revival of ``The Tempest,'' will return in March as
the charismatic bigamist and businessman at the center of Arthur
Miller's ``Ride Down Mount Morgan.'' Stewart said his return was a
testament to his inordinate love for the play and its central
character, Lyman Felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur has created a wonderful and complex leading
character,'' Stewart said. ``It's musical and emotional and
expressive, and very, very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shubert Organization has committed a theater, as yet
undetermined, for the play, to begin performances for a limited run
on March 20.
</P>
<P>
   The story of a man whose two wives _ and two lives _ converge
after a nearly deadly accident, ``Ride'' had its world premiere in
1991 in London. The play had its United States debut in 1996 at the
Williamstown Theater Festival, with F. Murray Abraham playing
Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the play arrived in New York, at the Public Theater,
where Stewart took over the role of Lyman, and fell in love with
it.
</P>
<P>
   While critical reaction to ``Ride'' has been uneven, Miller said
last year's sold-out run at the Public had inspired him. ``The
enthusiasm is so high,'' he said. ``We're all a little nutty about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The brevity of last year's run _ a month _ had also inspired
Stewart to push for a longer opportunity to perform the show on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain pieces of work that simply don't leave you
alone,'' he said. ``Certain characters and plays that continue to
haunt you. I think actors need to pay attention to that.''
</P>
<P>
   More From Miller
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on Broadway, David Richenthal, producer of ``The
Price,'' also by Miller, said he was confident _ nay, sure! _ that
the revival of the 1968 play would be a hit on Broadway, despite
early ticket sales that were ``not abysmal but not where I'd like
them to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Richenthal's strategy? Advertising, and lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll spend any amount of money to advertise this play to help
find it an audience,'' Richenthal said. ``Whatever it takes.
Because audiences love it, and I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, Richenthal said he had doubled his
advertising budget, paying about $125,000 for new spots emphasizing
a bundle of positive reviews the play has received. The play opened
on Monday night at the Royale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in for a big fight,'' Richenthal said. ``But anybody
who's writing an epitaph on this show is premature.''
</P>
<P>
   A Busy Roger Rees
</P>
<P>
   Roger Rees is going to be a busy man next spring if the
Roundabout Theater Company has its way. A week after signing on to
appear in an April production of ``Uncle Vanya,'' at the
refurbished Selwyn Theater, Rees spent this week talking to actors
about a proposed production of ``Arms and the Man,'' by George
Bernard Shaw that Rees would direct.
</P>
<P>
   The show would appear at the company's temporary home at
Gramercy Theater in February.
</P>
<P>
   But if Rees and the Roundabout can't get the cast they want
another as-yet-undetermined show will take its place.
</P>
<P>
   Health Watch
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few health updates:
</P>
<P>
   Carol Burnett, the heart and soul of ``Putting It Together,''
was back onstage Tuesday night after missing all weekend because of
the flu. Ms. Burnett informed the audience at the Saturday matinee
of her illness _ ``Something icky has invaded my body'' _ but
apparently was in good voice by Monday, the show's dark day.
``Putting It Together,'' a revue of the songs of Stephen Sondheim,
will open as scheduled on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile at the New York Theater Workshop Nathan Lane was
suffering a cold on Wednesday, resulting in the cancellation of
that evening's presentation of ``Wise Guys,'' the new Sondheim
musical. He was to be back Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   And in Chicago, the stars of Disney's ``Aida'' were also to be
back onstage Thursday night, after an accident that brought
Saturday night's performance screeching to a halt. Near the end of
the musical, the actors Heather Headley and Adam Pascal were inside
the play's central set element, an elevated stone tomb, when a
cable failure caused the set piece to fall about 10 feet to the
stage. The two actors rolled out and lay silent for several moments
before the action was stopped and a doctor was called to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pascal and Ms. Headley were shaken up and suffered bruises.
Two scheduled performances on Sunday were canceled, and
understudies appeared on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aida,'' with a score by Elton John and Tim Rice, is on a
tryout run at the Cadillac Palace in Chicago before its move to the
Palace Theater on Broadway on Feb. 25. Officials said the accident
would have no effect on the show's run in Chicago or New York,
though there will be one change: from now on the tomb will no
longer elevate, said Chris Boneau, a spokesman for the musical. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Two new plays, one a transfer, one a delay: As expected,
``James Joyce's `The Dead''' will move to Broadway to the Belasco
from Playwrights Horizons. Performances begin on Dec. 14, for a
limited run of 10 weeks. And ``Wrong Mountain,'' by David Hirson,
has delayed its opening from Dec. 14 until Jan. 13 to avoid what
producer Michael David called ``a historically distracting
holiday,'' not to mention the six other Broadway shows to open in
December.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Wooster Group's latest effort, ``North Atlantic,'' closes
on Sunday but will reopen on Jan. 11 for an open-ended run. The
play, about a surreal set of Navy types adrift in the, well, North
Atlantic, stars Willem Dafoe and Kate Valk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk about Take Your Daughters to Work Day. Off Off Broadway
has two prominently pedigreed young women in residence: Keira
Naughton, the daughter of the director and actor James Naughton,
who is appearing in ``Uncle Jack,'' at the TriBeCa Playhouse, and
Emma Zaks, daughter of the director Jerry Zaks, who will appear in
``Out of the Blue,'' a new musical at the Miranda Theater, which
began rehearsals this week. Performances will start on Dec. 9.

A TURKISH TRANSVESTITE JUST WANTS HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Osman, a proudly macho Turkish taxi driver living in Berlin,
wants Murat, his gorgeous, baby-faced younger brother, to lose his
virginity. Osman wants it so much that he drags Murat out of the
taxi and over to a prostitute who has just agreed to a fee of 100
marks (about $50) for the assignment. Murat (Baki Davrak), however,
runs away. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Murat is young, but he knows he's gay, and in ``Lola and Billy
the Kid,'' a well-meaning German-Turkish drama with a message, he
learns just how difficult coming out can be. If Kutlug Ataman, the
film's writer and director, is on target, some Turkish families
living in Germany are so homophobic that they make Newt Gingrich
look like the president of Act Up.
</P>
<P>
   Lola (Gandi Mukli), a transvestite who works at a Berlin club,
turns out to be a relative of Murat's; Lola's family did not react
well to the discovery that he was gay. Now Lola is in love with a
black-leather-jacket guy who calls himself Billy the Kid (Erdal
Yildiz), spelled Bilidikid in German, and things would be fine if
it weren't for Billy's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   He's so horrified about being gay that he wants Lola to have
sex-change surgery so they can marry and live normally like
everybody else (his words). Lola wonders, ``Why can't we just be
happy like we are?'' The film is Murat's search for his own
identity, which involves getting to know Lola.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sometimes amusing subplot about Friedrich (Michael
Gerber), an older gay German man who drives a fabulous Daimler
convertible and falls for Iskender (Murat Yilmaz), a hirsute
Turkish prostitute with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The finest moments in the film involve Iskender; Friedrich's
white-haired little-dog-toting mother, Ute (Inge Keller), and an
extremely valuable brooch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lola and Billy the Kid'' has an important social message, but
it's delivered in a much too heavy-handed and simplistic fashion to
have the impact it should. The film is not rated, but it includes
strong profanity (the film is in German and Turkish with English
subtitles), a number of discreet sex scenes and one extended scene
of disturbing violence.

 &HT;    MOST U.S. KIDS SHOW BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF CIVICS
 &HT;    WITH CIVICSDATA19-COX
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two-thirds of American students have at least a
basic knowledge of civics, according to national test results
released Thursday by the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   That may be better than most grown-ups could do; one national
poll showed that 63 percent of adults couldn't name all three of
the federal government's branches: executive, legislative and
judicial.
</P>
<P>
   Most fourth-graders could name the president and knew that all
people, including the police, are supposed to obey the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Most eighth-graders knew that Martin Luther King Jr. opposed
racial segregation, and most could identify concepts from the
Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Most twelfth-graders knew that Social Security concerned the
elderly and that the rights of the majority are limited by
protections in the Constitution for the rights of individuals and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But about one-third of the 22,000 students in 4th, 8th and 12th
grades who took the tests last winter were scored ``below basic''
in their knowledge of the government and of the skills, rights and
responsibilities of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, only one-fourth soared above the ``basic'' level to
earn grades of ``proficient'' or ``advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley praised the upper one-fourth
for showing ``a grasp of civics above grade level.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he plans to work with educators and civic leaders
``to find new ways to engage the (bottom) one-third of our students
who need to learn much, much more about our ddemocrtic way of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While deeply troubling, the ... findings in civics are not
surprising,'' said Charles N. Quigley, one of the people invited by
Riley to speak at the ceremony releasing the results of the test
conducted as part of the National Assessment of Educational
Progress.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming schools for failing to adopt high-standard curriculums,
Quigley said: ``Failure of students to do well on the NAEP study is
a direct consequence of the widespread lack of adequate curricular
requirements, teacher preparation and instruction in civics and
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, executive director of the California-based Center for
Civic Education, said a study done for his center by the Lyndon B.
Johnson School of Public Affairs in the University of Texas at
Austin showed that there isn't a single state or school district
with a satisfactory program for teaching civics and government.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Ravitch, a New York University professor, noted that all
the seniors will be old enough to vote in next year's presidential
and congressional elections. ``Yet, about 35 percent of the seniors
lacked even a basic understanding of our system of constitutional
government,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ravitch served on the National Assessment Governing Board, a
panel of educators and citizens who decided how high scores had to
be for the various achievement levels. ``It was a judgment call,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the achievement levels announced Thursday :
</P>
<P>
   -- The top rating of ``advanced'' for ``superior'' performance
went to 2 percent of the test-takers in grades four and eight and
to 4 percent in twelfth grade.
</P>
<P>
   -- A rating of ``proficient'' for showing ``full mastery'' of
the knowledge and skills went to 21 percent in grades four and
eight and to 22 percent in twelfth grade.
</P>
<P>
   -- A rating of ``basic'' for ``partial mastery'' was awarded to
46 percent in fourth grade, 48 percent in eighth grade and 39
percent in twelfth grade.
</P>
<P>
   -- Failing ratings of ``below basic'' went to 31 percent in
foruth grade, 30 percent in eighth grade and 35 percent in twelfth
grade.
</P>
<P>
   In some grades, totals didn't total 100 percent because the
numbers were rounded.
</P>
<P>
   A summary and a full report on the civics test scores are posted
on the Internet at http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard.

THE BATTLE AND THE WAR AROUND THE DECATUR SIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most people, being handcuffed and hustled into a police van
would be a frightening and humiliating experience. But for some
people, being arrested and braceleted constitutes a photo
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson knew what he was letting himself in for
when he led a small group of parents and ministers onto the campus
of Eisenhower High School in Decatur, Ill., to protest the
expulsion of six students from the school.
</P>
<P>
   He invited arrest to attract more attention to the campaign he
was leading to persuade the Decatur school board to change its
punishment of the students. And it was a smart, effective move.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's mission in Decatur should not be disparaged just
because of his reputation for enjoying publicity and the sound of
his own voice raised in reverberating, alliterative protest against
some small, large or middling injustice.
</P>
<P>
   The Decatur Six were expelled for two years by the school board
because of their participation in a brawl in the stands at a Sept.
17 football game at Eisenhower. Originally they were seven, but one
of the students withdrew from the school during the expulsion
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Under the glare of national publicity and prodded by Jackson,
Illinois Gov. George Ryan and state school Superintendent Glenn
``Max'' McGee, the school board reduced the expulsions to one year
and permitted the students to continue to earn credits by attending
alternative programs.
</P>
<P>
   Not good enough, said Jackson. He and McGee worked out a plan to
allow the students to return to regular classes provided they keep
their noses clean and maintain ``C'' averages while in the
alternative programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the school board just said ``no.'' And that set the stage
for Jackson's protest and arrest at Eisenhower and the
intensification of national attention on Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has threatened to file a federal lawsuit against the
school district, which he should win, if it comes to that. The
board's blanket punishment does appear too excessive.
</P>
<P>
   The board should relent and judge the expelled students
individually because there almost certainly are differing degrees
of guilt. And there also are the differing attendance, academic
performance and conduct records to take into account.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the students are scheduled to graduate this year. They
would have a strong incentive to work hard and behave themselves in
the alternative program proposed by McGee to graduate with their
class. Another is an honor student and captain of his varsity
basketball team. He also would have a strong motivation to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Because of failures and frequent absences, three of the students
are repeating freshman year for the third time. They might not be
able to qualify for early reinstatement, but if they did, everyone
would be better for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Decatur school board made its point. But it can only come
off looking shortsighted and mean-spirited if it insists on
sticking to what amounts to an academic death sentence for all or
some of the Decatur Six.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson is championing a just cause, a victory for him
would not necessarily be good for public education. It could send
the message to school districts across the nation that they risk
political retaliation and humiliation if they make determined
efforts to bolster discipline at public school campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur's zero-tolerance-for-violence policy is not unique. Many
school districts nationwide have adopted such policies, based on
the reasonable assumption that a safe and secure learning
environment is indispensable to high academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   If they cannot provide a safe setting for learning, increasingly
the public schools will lose students to private schools, and the
movement to undermine the public schools with voucher programs to
pay for private schooling will continue to gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about the voucher movement _ it has as much, if
not more, to do with deteriorating discipline and violence in the
public schools as it does with comparative instruction and student
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest advantage of private schools is that they have the
power to expel any student who misbehaves and detracts from the
learning environment, with no responsibility for that student after
expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools can't do that. But they do need the authority to
deal with violent and disruptive students. And the best way to do
that in many instances may be to expel them for long periods in
order to get their parents' attention and make them live up to
their disciplinary responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Decatur school board has erred on the side of excess in this
matter. But in doing so, it focused national attention on the
school discipline problem. Having made its point, it should show
some flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   There is right on both sides of this issue. A creative
compromise is needed. Otherwise, either the school board or Jackson
will win a battle and contribute to losing a war against the forces
that are attempting to dismantle public education.

</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To watch the video title shuffle, try updating a mail order
catalog. ``What's interesting this year is how many movies that
have been gone for years are now coming back,'' said Irv Slifkin,
an editor of the 2000 catalog from Movies Unlimited, a company in
Philadelphia that, along with Facets International of Chicago, is
one of the most versatile mail order operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles film ``Yellow Submarine,'' long kept out of
circulation by a rights dispute, is now back from MGM. So are
``Dances With Wolves'' and ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' both of
which were owned by Orion, now defunct, but have also been picked
up by MGM. ``People may not have realized it, but you couldn't have
gotten them for a couple of years,'' Slifkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples include ``The Onion Field,'' Joseph Wambaugh's
police drama; ``Where Eagles Dare,'' Brian G. Hutton's World War II
thriller and one of Movies Unlimited's most requested titles;
``Stop Making Sense,'' Jonathan Demme's Talking Heads concert film,
and ``Labyrinth'' and ``Dark Crystal,'' two Jim Henson films that
have large followings and are now available from Columbia Tri-Star.
``People have been paying hundreds of dollars for used copies of
those two,'' Slifkin said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he added, there has also been a large increase in
wide-screen letter-boxed editions of big films like ``Chinatown''
and Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic ``The Passion of Joan of
Arc.'' But with a total of 40,000 titles, the catalog doesn't limit
itself to movies. Occupying 63 pages, old television shows have
always been best sellers, and this year, Slifkin said, the demand
is for boxed sets of series like ``That Girl,'' with Marlo Thomas,
and ``The Avengers,'' the '60s show with Diana Rigg and Patrick
Macnee, which has quickly grown to 23 volumes, and ``Monty Python's
Flying Circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Growth in other areas is somewhat surprising. ``There's more
interest in silent films, with more coming out and more being
restored,'' Slifkin said. Among hundreds of titles is Herbert
Brenon's ``Peter Pan'' (1924), adapted from James M. Barrie's play
and incorporating his and others' ideas about expanding the story
to the screen. The video will be available from Kino on Nov. 30,
but Slifkin said there have been many pre-orders. ``It's a very
different version,'' he added. ``People who saw `Hook' should take
a look.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten Clara Bow films, released by Milestone and others, are also
among the most requested of the silent films. ``Who knows Clara Bow
today except older people?'' he said. ``But it seems younger people
are interested, too. The orders we're getting point to a pretty big
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight actors _ Gwyneth Paltrow, Drew Barrymore, Sandra Bullock,
Leonardo DiCaprio, Ronald Colman, Johnny Depp, Tony Curtis and the
erotic thriller star Shannon Tweed _ have been added to the
featured stars list. All get specially tinted sections of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog is $9.95, and a DVD catalog can be ordered at no
extra charge. Information: (800) 523-0823. Everything is also

works stunts like this while posing as an insurance investigator, a
job that introduces her to an old master thief named Mac (Sean
Connery). Soon they are planning crimes together, culminating in
the rigging of a computer to help steal billions. Naturally, all
the training and planning inspire a May-December attraction between
the two, which, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``works
because it isn't forced, and because both actors are so
mischievously game.''

based on a children's fable by Ted Hughes) lets the villagers of
Rockwell, Maine., make what they will of a huge iron man who wades
ashore one night. In the resulting panic, the Army is summoned
along with a nasty g agent whose paranoia leaves no opening for a
rational reaction. Only a young boy named Hogarth has the tolerance
and fortitude to try to establish contact in a story that has
lessons for children and memories for adults wrapped up in a
``smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking'' (Lawrence Van

that come alive with the spirits of children murdered there in the
last century. Actually, the participants have been brought together
by Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) to serve as guinea pigs in his

movie ``firmly committed to the notion that more is more''

`RKO 281': LACKLUSTER DRAMATIZATION OF INTRIGUE SURROUNDING
`CITIZEN KANE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a film is trying to latch onto someone else's glory, it helps
to jump in at the right end of the career. ``RKO 281'' depicts
Orson Welles' making of ``Citizen Kane'' and William Randolph
Hearst's efforts to thwart the release of the film, whose
megalomaniacal newspaper tycoon was so clearly modeled on him. But
while ``RKO'' portrays Welles in his first and most complete flash
of genius, it has the glamour and artistry of those stiff,
self-important commercials for cheap wine he made near the end of
his life. Like so many other disappointing HBO biographical movies,
including ``Dorothy Dandridge'' and ``The Rat Pack,'' this one
takes a juicy idea, lines up a seductive cast, then hands them a
banal script that lets everyone down.
</P>
<P>
   ``RKO 281,'' whose title refers to the number the studio gave to
the project, begins with an echo of ``Citizen Kane'': a deathbed
scene and a newsreel setting up the hero's life. Instead of Kane's
own death and life, here we see little Orson at his mother's
deathbed and the headline ``Boy Wonder Wows Hollywood'' when the
24-year-old Welles arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Those borrowings work well enough, but the film quickly falls
into a trap; showing the creation of a masterpiece is usually a
terrible idea. The film also tries to improve on real life,
inventing one of the lavish dinners Hearst and his mistress, the
actress Marion Davies, gave at his castle, San Simeon. The
screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz had been a frequent guest, but this
fictional version also includes Welles (who never was). The
invention is not a problem in itself, but the hokey way in which it
is used as the genesis for ``Kane'' is. After the dinner, Welles
comes up with the idea for the story of a media baron and asks
Mankiewicz to collaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Mankiewicz pulls out his unpublished novel about
Hearst. ``Great minds think alike,'' he says. But the film swerves
away from one of the most contentious, bitter and probably
unsolvable issues in film history: How much writing credit did each
man deserve?
</P>
<P>
   As the shooting of ``Kane'' begins, ``RKO'' nudges viewers with
visual reminders. When he meets the cinematographer Gregg Toland,
Welles is holding the famous snow globe that falls out of the dead
Kane's hands. Viewers who know ``Kane'' will feel constantly poked
in the ribs, while those who don't will wonder what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Liev Schreiber moves in and out of Welles' voice in a
distracting way, occasionally capturing its timbre. Without a solid
script, he can't give Welles an inner life, so he offers a broad
outline of the legend: brilliant, charming, self-absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   John Malkovich is terrific as the hard-drinking Mankiewicz, who
would never subsequently equal his work on ``Kane.'' When
Mankiewicz argues that Hearst is too powerful to take on, Welles
pompously tells him, ``I expected more from you, Mank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, me too, but I got used to it,'' Mankiewicz says
casually, sipping his drink. Malkovich creates a deft, understated
sketch of what Hollywood can do to talent.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Griffith is sympathetic as the hapless Davies, doing
jigsaw puzzles on the floor of the castle. And James Cromwell makes
a surprisingly powerful case for Hearst as a human being when, as
Hearst, he insists that his privacy has been violated. When it is
time to depict Hearst's evil side, though, the script clumsily
shows him making blunt anti-Semitic remarks to Louis B. Mayer
(David Suchet).
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's effort to suppress the film is a tale of media power
that resonates today. But it takes half of ``RKO 281'' to get
there, and when it does it is flat-footed in its depiction of
Hollywood intrigue. Brenda Blethyn and Fiona Shaw prance around as
Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper. Instead of creating the texture
of 1940s Hollywood, like most of ``RKO 281'' they seem as flimsy as
paper dolls.

 &HT;    GORE, BRADLEY VOTING RECORDS SHOW POLITICALLY POTENT SPLIT
 &HT;    980&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories
for release Sunday, Nov. 21.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore and Bill Bradley rarely disagreed as
senators, but when they did it was usually about guns and butter _
and sometimes honey.
</P>
<P>
   Those differences could be important in the presidential race,
especially when the two Democratic presidential candidates face off
in the South, where military and farm programs are fighting words
in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man is easy to pigeonhole based on a comparison of the
yeas and nays they cast during the nearly eight years they spent
together in the U.S. Senate, from 1985 through 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The record shows both could be political mavericks and
intellectual loners, sometimes moving to their own rhythms rather
than those of their constituencies or their party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And they could defy political labels.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate over a 1988 federal antidrug laws in the 1980s,
for example, the ``Southern conservative'' Gore voted against the
death penalty for drug kingpins, while Bradley, a ``Northeastern
liberal,'' voted in favor of it.
</P>
<P>
   But on matters of defense and agriculture, two of the defining
political issues of the South in this century, Gore's votes in the
Senate reflect traditional political attitudes much more often than
Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   Gore represented Tennessee in the Senate from 1985 until his
election as vice president in 1992. Bradley was elected three times
to the Senate from New Jersey and retired in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985 through 1992, the Senate recorded 2,722 votes. Of the
2,137 votes cast by both Gore and Bradley during that time, they
agreed 1,604 times _ more than 75 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But on Jan. 12, 1991, they had their most dramatic disagreement,
and one that is as reflective of their differences as any.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was one of only 10 Democrats to vote to authorize U.S.
military force to expel Iraqi troops who had invaded Kuwait the
previous summer. Bradley voted with the losing Democratic majority
in opposition to President Bush's war effort.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time Gore and Bradley had crossed swords on
defense-related issues. Gore supported production of the MX
multiple-warhead missile, the B-2 bomber, the Seawolf nuclear
submarine and the space-based Strategic Defense Initiative, all of
which Bradley opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's anti-military efforts in the Senate culminated in an
unsuccessful proposal in 1992 to cut $18 billion from the
Pentagon's budget over five years to finance education, health care
and environmental programs. Gore voted against Bradley's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did, however, endorse the Reagan administration's
support of the Nicaraguan rebel army in 1986, though he eventually
withdrew his backing after disclosures of the Iran-contra affair
the following year, in which some proceeds of arms sales to Iran
were diverted to benefit the rebels. Gore opposed the CIA-backed
contras.
</P>
<P>
   Equally striking is the way in which Gore and Bradley
consistently lined up on opposite sides on virtually every vote
taken between 1985 and 1992 on the federal government's various
farm price support programs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it involved peanuts, tobacco, wheat, dairy products or
honey, Bradley routinely voted against farm subsidies, while Gore,
just as routinely, supported them. In 1990, Bradley even voted
against natural disaster relief for farmers. Gore supported the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only farm-related vote that has caused Bradley any
political heartburn on the presidential trail has been his vote
against subsidies for ethanol, a fuel additive made from corn. Such
subsidies are popular in Iowa, which hosts the first presidential
preference voting next year, and Bradley now supports ethanol
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gore's farm support votes are also causing the vice
president problems. In 1985, Gore voted to subsidize the tobacco
industry, while Bradley opposed the measure. But Gore and the
Clinton administration have led the attack on tobacco in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Gore voted the opposite of Bradley to support a 1988
bill that was designed to protect the largely Southern-based
textile industry from imports. As vice president, Gore has
championed the administration's free trade policies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's record on most of these issues may be popular in his home
region, but it might work against him elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not always a good thing in Democratic presidential
primaries,'' said Merle Black, a political science professor at
Emory University in Atlanta and co-author of ``The Vital South,'' a
1992 book about the pivotal role the South plays in presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic primaries, especially in the Northeast, attract more
liberal voters. And as Bradley has effectively positioned himself
to the left of the vice president, his Senate voting record is part
of his campaign's appeal to liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard assumption _ that they are nearly identical _
misses the detail,'' Eric Howser, Bradley's press secretary, said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   To counter, Gore emphasizes one big difference between his and
Bradley's Senate voting records _ Bradley's support for school
voucher ``experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never supported vouchers,'' Gore repeatedly notes in an
appeal aimed at teacher organizations, which are active in
Democratic primaries and which regard vouchers as a threat to
public education funding.
</P>
<P>
   But when the presidential campaign moves to the South next
March, Gore's emphasis is likely to shift to other differences in
his and Bradley's voting records, specifically, his own
pro-military votes and Bradley's consistent opposition to farm
price support programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there are issues that resonate in the South,'' said
Gore press secretary Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In their Senate days, Gore and Bradley also split company on
several key votes in the Senate's effort to stop the record growth
of the federal budget deficit during the Reagan and Bush
presidencies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore voted for a proposed constitutional amendment requiring a
balanced federal budget, and Bradley opposed it. Gore also
supported the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law in 1985 that tried to set
spending caps, but Bradley rejected it as a gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also was a bit more partisan than Bradley in voting to
confirm presidential appointees, rejecting more nominees than
Bradley. But Bradley voted against the Supreme Court nomination of
David Souter, while Gore supported it. And Bradley opposed the
nomination of Alan Greenspan to head the Federal Reserve, while
Gore voted in favor of it.

 &HT;    GORE, BRADLEY VOTING RECORDS SHOW POLITICALLY POTENT SPLIT
 &HT;    980&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories
for release Sunday, Nov. 21.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore and Bill Bradley rarely disagreed as
senators, but when they did it was usually about guns and butter _
and sometimes honey.
</P>
<P>
   Those differences could be important in the presidential race,
especially when the two Democratic presidential candidates face off
in the South, where military and farm programs are fighting words
in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man is easy to pigeonhole based on a comparison of the
yeas and nays they cast during the nearly eight years they spent
together in the U.S. Senate, from 1985 through 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The record shows both could be political mavericks and
intellectual loners, sometimes moving to their own rhythms rather
than those of their constituencies or their party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And they could defy political labels.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate over a 1988 federal antidrug laws in the 1980s,
for example, the ``Southern conservative'' Gore voted against the
death penalty for drug kingpins, while Bradley, a ``Northeastern
liberal,'' voted in favor of it.
</P>
<P>
   But on matters of defense and agriculture, two of the defining
political issues of the South in this century, Gore's votes in the
Senate reflect traditional political attitudes much more often than
Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   Gore represented Tennessee in the Senate from 1985 until his
election as vice president in 1992. Bradley was elected three times
to the Senate from New Jersey and retired in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985 through 1992, the Senate recorded 2,722 votes. Of the
2,137 votes cast by both Gore and Bradley during that time, they
agreed 1,604 times _ more than 75 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But on Jan. 12, 1991, they had their most dramatic disagreement,
and one that is as reflective of their differences as any.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was one of only 10 Democrats to vote to authorize U.S.
military force to expel Iraqi troops who had invaded Kuwait the
previous summer. Bradley voted with the losing Democratic majority
in opposition to President Bush's war effort.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time Gore and Bradley had crossed swords on
defense-related issues. Gore supported production of the MX
multiple-warhead missile, the B-2 bomber, the Seawolf nuclear
submarine and the space-based Strategic Defense Initiative, all of
which Bradley opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's anti-military efforts in the Senate culminated in an
unsuccessful proposal in 1992 to cut $18 billion from the
Pentagon's budget over five years to finance education, health care
and environmental programs. Gore voted against Bradley's proposal.
</P>

withdrew his backing after disclosures of the Iran-contra affair
the following year, in which some proceeds of arms sales to Iran
were diverted to benefit the rebels. Gore opposed the CIA-backed

`FORCE MORE POWERFUL': WINNING A CAUSE BY REFUSING TO FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most stunning images from Richard Attenborough's 1982
film, ``Gandhi,'' is the line upon line upon line of protesters
standing up to British oppression by lying down, or allowing
themselves to be knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   What Gandhi did was undeniably momentous. He invented and taught
passive resistance based on the Hindu concept of satyagraha, the
assertion of truth through firmness and patience, and as a result
won India its independence. Luckily, early-20th-century movie
cameras were around to record much of it.
</P>
<P>
   The cinematic possibilities in Gandhi's accomplishment make it
all the sadder that ``A Force More Powerful,'' a documentary about
nonviolent protest written, directed and produced by Steve York,
has taken such a formal approach.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opens Friday, conveys valuable information, but
with the imagination and liveliness of a high school history
lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers will learn dates and the names of some true unsung
heroes, but in unmemorable ways. Even the screen titles are
academic: ``I. India,'' ``II. Nashville, Tenn.'' and ``III. South
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nashville,'' the best-told story, introduces the Rev. James
Lawson Jr., a young Methodist minister who worked with the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. Lawson taught the principles of passive
resistance to young black people in Tennessee in preparation for
the lunch counter sit-ins of 1960. The film of their rehearsals and
of the sit-ins is fascinating, as is a brief early appearance by
King on ``Meet the Press'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively unknown hero of South Africa's victory over
apartheid is Mkhuseli Jack, who led consumer boycotts beginning in
1985. Gandhi's story began in Africa too, where he lived from the
early 1890s to 1914. When he staged peaceful protests there, Jan
Smuts, then the country's interior minister, told him: ``You reduce
me to helplessness. How can we lay hands on you without looking
like villains?''
</P>
<P>
   That was the point, of course, and the method continues to work
miracles.
</P>
<P>

SACKLER GETS ASIAN ART; ARMANI AT GUGGENHEIM; GIFT AT CHICAGO

   Passage From India
</P>
<P>
   Cary Welch, a Harvard alumnus and scholar, has given the Arthur
M. Sackler Museum in Cambridge, Mass., more than 300 works of
Indian and Islamic art.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, a leading collector of Turko-Indo-Iranian art for the
last 40 years, was a teacher and curator at Harvard until his
retirement in the mid-1970s. He gave the Sackler, part of the
university art museums, his works from India, Iran and Turkey
dating from the 15th to 19th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's collection includes more than 250 works from India,
among them 190 drawings and paintings from Rajasthan. Combined with
his 1995 gift to the Sackler of more than 70 Indian paintings, plus
earlier donations from John Kenneth Galbraith and John Goelt, the
Harvard University Art Museums now have the most important
collection of Indian drawings and paintings in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The Fogg Art Museum, the Sackler's sister institution, has a
world-class collection of Western drawings. ``It adds strength to
strength,'' said James Cuno, the director of the Harvard museums.
</P>
<P>
   He said an exhibition of Welch's drawing collection, with a
catalog, would be held at the Sackler in about three years. ``It
makes us a stop for anyone studying Persian, Turkish and Indian
art,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to Fashion
</P>
<P>
   Since its blockbuster 1998 exhibition ``The Art of the
Motorcycle'' which drew record-breaking crowds of more than 500,000
visitors, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York has been
casting about for another offbeat subject from 20th-century
culture. This week it announced that its big fall show in 2000
would be a Giorgio Armani retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the museum choose the Italian fashion designer to fill
its entire rotunda at one of the busiest times on the art world
calendar?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about doing a big fashion show for about
five years now,'' said Lisa Dennison, the Guggenheim's chief
curator. ``We debated and debated about who the great fashion
designers are that haven't been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dennison added that the museum did not have seasons and
that, contrary to what most people thought, the summer was its most
popular time of year because of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armani comes right after `1900: Art at the Crossroads,' a
survey show of the year 1900, which is very classical,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Armani show, to run from Oct. 13 through Jan. 10, will
feature more than 200 garments plus sketches, photographs and a
video presentation. The exhibition's curators are to be Germano
Celant and Harold Koda. Koda was a curator at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, where he helped organize exhibitions for its Costume
Institute. Celant, a senior curator of contemporary art at the
Guggenheim, has organized exhibitions that included a fashion
component, like ``The Italian Metamorphosis, 1943-1968'' in 1994.
He also helped organize the first Biennial in Florence, ``Looking
at Fashion,'' three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcycle exhibition had an unusual installation: the
California architect Frank O. Gehry wrapped the rotunda in shiny
stainless-steel panels. Now the Guggenheim has asked the French
architect Jean Nouvel to design the Armani installation. Robert
Wilson, the stage director, is to work with Nouvel on the lighting.
</P>
<P>
   But the big question is whether the Armani company will help pay
for the exhibition. ``We do not have a sponsor yet,'' Ms. Dennison
said. The museum hasn't asked Armani to be a sponsor, she added,
and is seeking other corporate support.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim has received financial help from fashion
companies in the past. Its five-year arrangement with Hugo Boss,
the German menswear company, ends this year. Boss sponsored two to
three exhibitions a year and provided educational support to the
museum along with funds for the annual $50,000 Hugo Boss Prize,
awarded to a young artist. Although Boss decided to concentrate its
energies on sports events, officials at the Guggenheim said the
museum hoped to continue some ties with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Gift
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Art Institute has also received a gift of drawings
this week. Jean and Steven Goldman, patrons of the museum, gave it
$5 million toward renovating its department of prints and drawings
and announced their intention to donate their collection of about
80 old master drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldman, a scholar in Italian 16th-century drawings, has
been a lecturer and an adjunct professor at the institute's school.
``Precisely because she is a scholar, the collection has
intellectual integrity,'' said Suzanne Folds McCullagh, the curator
of early drawings at the institute. ``As collectors, the Goldmans
were not afraid to take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldman said she began collecting drawings 33 years ago with
a Madonna and Child by Carlo Maratta. Her works date from 1450 to
about 1650, and include drawings by masters like Titian, Guercino,
Parmigianino and Romano.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things we didn't have before,'' Ms.
McCullagh said. ``What is important is that this gift isn't just
bricks and mortar but a collection, too. And we're hoping it will
instill more philanthropy from other collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Appointment
</P>
<P>
   Ned Rifkin, director of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta since
1991, has been named director of the Menil Collection in Houston.
He succeeds Paul Winkler, who resigned in February. Rifkin begins
his post Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Resignation
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Stebbins, who for 22 years has been a curator at the
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and was most recently chairman of the
art of the Americas department, has resigned effective Jan. 17. He
is the third senior curator to resign or be asked to leave the
museum in the last five months.

SUBMARINES, BALLOONS AND A GUY NAMED BOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)

<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' was directed by Michael Apted, whose
insightful glimpses of the maturing process can be seen in his
latest documentary, ``42 Up.'' Doggone if Apted hasn't been able to
make James Bond grow up a little too.
</P>
<P>
   In his third and most comfortable effort to model the Bond
mantle, Pierce Brosnan bears noticeably more resemblance to a real
human being. He shows signs of emotion, cuts back on the lame puns
and makes lifelike conversation with fellow characters. Should he
ever stop posing mannequinlike with left hand in trouser pocket, or
engage in a clinch without appearing to be promoting his
wristwatch, Brosnan's Bond will have entered the land of the
living.
</P>
<P>
   This latest film, which evokes its jolliest laugh when Bond
tries to work the title phrase into a conversation, seems to be
populated by more noticeable people all around. Back at
initial-filled headquarters, M (Dame Judi Dench) takes a more
active role in this story, while the delightful Q (Desmond
Llewelyn) is now made even more so by John Cleese's R.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are suitably aghast whenever Bond runs off with their
newly designed equipment and treats it as if he were a teenager who
shouldn't have borrowed the car.
</P>
<P>
   The film is off to the races with its obligatory high-octane
opening. This year's model features the Frank Gehry-designed museum
in Bilbao, Spain, an amphibious chase through London and a hot-air
balloon. And it pits Bond against a woman in tight red leather who
drives a speedboat while shooting a machine gun. (Question: Isn't
it difficult to do both?) The chase ends tragically, with a cryptic
line of dialogue. (Question: Will anyone know what her problem was
when the movie is over?)
</P>
<P>
   Still trawling for plausible villains, ``The World Is Not
Enough'' pits Bond against Renard (Robert Carlyle), a rabid
anticapitalist terrorist who has a bullet in his head. (Question:
Is the large, mobile, computer-generated hologram of Renard's skull
and brain more interesting than the actual character?) Renard was
once the kidnapper of beautiful Elektra King, whose beloved father
(note her first name) is blown up before this film's opening
credits.
</P>
<P>
   When a character here explains that Elektra fell in love with
her captor, the phrase ``Stockholm syndrome'' is used nervously.
It's as if the movie's real goals of admiring scenery and plugging
products were jeopardized by such a knotty concept.
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Marceau does a smashing turn as Elektra, in a
mischievously sexy performance that manages to make Bond that much
more interesting. While Ms. Marceau gets the slinky costumes,
gorgeous ski sequence and boudoir scenes, the film's other female
star fares less well.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Richards seemed far more clever as the teenage vixen of
``Wild Things'' than she does as a brilliant scientist whose name
(Dr. Christmas Jones) is mercifully avoided in conversation. And
she's the one who gets stuck talking about plutonium and flailing
away on a soggy submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, which often sends the audience into a pleasant fog
while big machines and deadly weapons are thrown around, involves
the struggle over an oil pipeline (with Robbie Coltrane as an
amusing Russian gangster) and sends postcards from places as
diverse as Scotland and central Asia. (Question: Is it easy to rent
a shiny new BMW if you're in Azerbaijan? It is if you're James
Bond.) &QL;

   WILL SMITH: ``Willennium''(Columbia).
</P>
<P>
   Will Smith describes himself as hip-hop's `` Clean'' and
challenges other rappers to write just ``one verse without a
curse.'' He's sold millions of albums doing just that; in his spare
time, he's a sitcom star and a bankable action-movie hero.
</P>
<P>
   He has plenty to boast about, and he does, but what saves him
from sounding sanctimonious or overbearing is an all-conquering
affability.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't claim to be the toughest, the wildest, the most
underground or the most innovative rapper, just a clever
word-slinger who's delighted and amused by his own success.
</P>
<P>
   He and his original partner, D.J. Jazzy Jeff, are the album's
executive producers; songs are unashamedly built on recognizable
tunes. ``Willennium'' is cheerful, benign and mildly trendy; quick
on the uptake, it includes a rap over a Tito Puente mambo.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't expect a long shelf life; ``Will 2K,'' rhyming
about a New Year's Eve party over the Clash's ``Rock the Casbah,''
expires on Jan. 1.

`RIPLEY': THE KINSHIP OF MACABRE AND BANAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Ripley, the hero of these three novels by Patricia
Highsmith, is an American arriviste who reinvents himself as a
Continental gentleman, a small-time con man who evolves into an
urbane serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of these three novels (reissued in a single volume
for Everyman's Library), Ripley has murdered more than half a dozen
people _ acts that barely cause a ripple in his conscience or
genteel lifestyle. He is at once a less bizarre, more bourgeois
version of Hannibal Lecter and an illustration of High-smith's
deeply cynical view that all human beings are corruptible, that as
one of her characters in Hitchcock's adaptation of ``Strangers on a
Train'' remarks, ``Everyone is a potential murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this volume is decidedly uneven, it can serve as an
introduction, for readers unfamiliar with Patricia Highsmith's
crime fiction, to her chilly, misanthropic world. It is a world in
which murderers are rarely caught, much less brought to justice; a
world in which identity is permeable and the macabre and the banal,
the insane and rational, live serenely side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Tom Ripley has been portrayed on screen by such
disparate actors as Alain Delon, Dennis Hopper and now Matt Damon
(who stars in Anthony Minghella's forthcoming adaptation of ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley''), and he emerges from Highsmith's novels as
the consummate quick-change artist: a would-be actor who delights
in disguise and impersonation; a novelist manque who uses his gifts
of fantasy and imagination to lie, manipulate and elude.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stories were good,'' Highsmith writes, ``because he
imagined them intensely, so intensely that he came to believe
them.''
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet Tom in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' (1955), he
is still a small-time con man living in a shabby apartment in New
York and eking out a living with small-time scams.
</P>
<P>
   An encounter with the wealthy father of an acquaintance,
however, abruptly alters the course of his life: Dickie Greenleaf's
father asks Ripley to go to Europe and persuade his prodigal son to
return home, and like Lambert Strether in Henry James'
``Ambassadors'' (a book Highsmith alludes to) Ripley soon finds
himself in Europe, acting as a family emissary.
</P>
<P>
   Dickie resists Ripley's entreaties to return to the States, but
the two men, who look like mirror images of each other, quickly
become best friends _ much to the irritation of Marge, a young
American woman in love with the handsome and worldly Dickie. In
fact, Ripley himself harbors an infatuation with Dickie, an
infatuation made up in equal parts of sexual attraction, narcissism
and envy.
</P>
<P>
   On a holiday trip those emotions erupt into murderous rage, and
after killing Dickie, Ripley assumes his identity _ a scenario
seemingly borrowed from this novel by the 1975 Antonioni movie
``The Passenger'' and a recent novel called ``Stealing Lives'' by
Michael Pye.
</P>
<P>
   Ripley eventually discards Dickie's persona and passport but not
before killing another man, and concocting an ingenious ruse to
thwart the police and acquire Dickie's estate. Henceforth, with
Dickie's money, he settles down to a comfortable life in the French
countryside with a wealthy wife: like Dickie, he takes up painting
and acquires a taste for fine art and clothes and antiques. He
learns several languages and takes frequent trips abroad. In short,
he adopts Dickie's life of a gentleman dilettante.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' not only demonstrates Highsmith's
gift for using the genre conventions of the mystery novel to
explore the existential ambiguities of identity, but it also
attests to her keen gift for psychological insight. By chronicling
the ordinary details of Ripley's life and the logical workings of
his mind, she forces us to re-evaluate the lines between reason and
madness, normal and abnormal, while goading us into sharing her
treacherous hero's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the two Ripley sequels in this volume are
decidedly flimsier, more perfunctory productions. Although ``Ripley
Under Ground'' (1970) gets off to a promising start, immersing
Ripley in the messy fallout of an art scam, it soon devolves into a
series of grisly set pieces and a hasty ending that improbably
frees Ripley to appear in yet another novel.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Ripley's Game'' (1974), it tries to resurrect the theme
of doppelgaengers featured in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' and
``Strangers on a Train'' by pairing Ripley, the veteran killer,
with a first-time murderer named Jonathan Trevanny. Trevanny is
manipulated by Ripley and one of Ripley's friends into believing
that he is dying and then is induced to pull off a mob hit in
return for a large sum of money. There is lots of hokey talk in
this novel about the Mafia and guns and garrotes, and several
bloody shoot-outs _ none of which play to Highsmith's psychological
forte.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Ripley seems to have become an out-and-out madman: a
sadist who will play a cruel joke on an ailing man simply because
he dislikes the man's manner; a thrill-seeking murderer who likes
to celebrate his kills with a fine dinner or an expensive purchase.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to the zombielike Heloise feels like a thorough
sham _ she is not the least bit nonplussed by his dabblings in
murder and is equally unconcerned about the frequent threats to his
safety _ and their self-indulgent existence in the French
countryside begins to feel like a lame parody of upper-class life.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's increasingly difficult for us to care about Ripley,
the sense of complicity Highsmith wants to create between the
reader and her characters dissolves. Instead of being immersed in
their shadowy, venal world, as we were in ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley,'' we are invited to feel smug and morally superior: a fatal
flaw in just about any novel.

`JOURNEY' INTO ARTISTRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vast majority of movies are meant simply to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   So Atom Egoyan, 1997 best-director and best-writer Oscar nominee
for ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' has trouble understanding why some
people seem so put out when, now and then, a film strives to be
more. Like painting, writing or music, some movies, Egoyan
believes, can and should strive for artistry.
</P>
<P>
   This came up because I told Egoyan that a novelist who had seen
his newest film, ``Felicia's Journey,'' had asked why anyone would
want to make a movie that was disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that laughable,'' Egoyan said, looking not at all like
he was about to laugh. ``Some of the artists that I most respect, a
lot of them writers, have this view that movies are somehow an
escape from it all. (They say) `Movies should be entertaining.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand that. A movie can be disturbing and
entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be the short definition of Egoyan's work: disturbing
and entertaining. Take the exquisitely elusive ``Exotica,'' a film
about several troubled characters built around a high-class men's
club. Or the deliciously sad puzzle film ``The Sweet Hereafter,''
in which a small town is turned inside out by a bus accident that
has killed several children.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those films, in which the ``plot'' is almost impossible
to summarize, ``Felicia's Journey'' could be given a short ``genre
film'' description. But not only would that give away a few things
best not known before seeing it, but it also would be highly
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say this: It is a highly unconventional thriller,
set in England, in which a naive, lost Irish girl (Elaine Cassidy)
is given shelter by a likable but disturbed man (Bob Hoskins).
</P>
<P>
   Egoyan is uncomfortable talking about the artistry in his work,
but he won't pretend it's unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit coy when you make a film like this to say you just
want people to see it as a movie,'' he said. ``You've designed it
and expressed it in a way that invites further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Felicia's Journey' was made just as a movie, it would
provide more visceral and immediate jolts. But there is space in
this movie _ and time _ which allows a viewer to contemplate other
issues: What is the nature of consciousness? What is the nature of
personality? When are we really being ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like (being considered artistic) in the sense that it
marginalizes the work, but artistic in the sense I would use the
possibilities of cinema in an exploratory way. Using it as an art
form, as opposed to an industrial means of communicating narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an attempt to operate at a different level and
combine elements of music and cinematography and drama in a really
textured way _ to find a form, which elevates the material into
something a bit more mythic.''
</P>
<P>
   Egoyan, 39, was born in Cairo and raised in Victoria, British
Columbia. Since ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' he has been regarded
almost as a Canadian national treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a book by William Trevor, ``Felicia's Journey'' is much
more about what is beneath the surface of his characters than what
is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Films are about the seduction and pleasure (of the
audience),'' Egoyan said. ``To get the full pleasure you have to be
looking for other levels of meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, though, to be too obscure, too subtle. Egoyan
says he was guilty of that in his early films, but he believes that
what we, as viewers, don't see is revealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `The Sweet Hereafter,' I tried to deal with the notion of
incest, but from the point of view of what a victim would think is
going on as it is unfolding. So that is subtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can see that movie, and they may not even get that
that's what's going on. Because they are in as much denial as (the
girl victim) is.''
</P>
<P>
   That film has a key scene in which a man we thought of as a good
father is seen quietly, tenderly but clearly molesting his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `What was happening in that scene?''' Egoyan said.
He believes those viewers have done the same thing the victim has
done _ denied the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've had the information; you've seen the empirical evidence
on screen. But you have effectively denied that scene,'' Egoyan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, to me, is very interesting as a phenomenon. Those people
might say, `That is very subtle.' Well, it's not, really. You don't
want to believe that's what is happening. You don't want to believe
who this man is.''

 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is there to be said about the Metropolitan
Museum of Art's wonderful exhibition of treasures from the
legeollection that Calouste Gulbenkian assembled in the
first half of this century and then left to the world in a museum
in Lisbon, where he spent his last dozen years? See it, enjoy it,
pore over its every object from beginning to end: that is, from a
17th-century Armenian illuminated Bible to a vitrine of three
Japanese lacquers.
</P>
<P>
   In between lie extraordinary examples of Islamic and Turkish
textiles and ceramics, 18th-century silver, European painting and
the Art Nouveau jewelry of Rene Lalique. Glean all you can about
the many forms that visual power can take and the spells they cast
on generation after generation.
</P>
<P>
   See this show also for proof that great collectors are as driven
as artists and have as little choice in their calling, even though
the evidence here won't exactly prove that natural collectors will
pursue their quest regardless of their financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Gulbenkian was born into a family of prosperous
Armenian merchants and bankers in Istanbul in 1869.
</P>
<P>
   For another, his skill and tenacity as an organizer of oil
companies and a broker of trade agreements eventually made him one
of the world's wealthiest men, and also one of the shrewdest and
most determined of art buyers. Still, the urge to collect seems to
have asserted itself before all else.
</P>
<P>
   Gulbenkian made his first acquisition at age 14 when his father
gave him a small amount of money as a reward for academic
excellence; he went directly to a market and purchased an ancient
coin. It was not for another seven or eight years, after returning
to Turkey from schooling in France and England, that he grasped the
importance that oil would soon have and began to explore the Middle
Eastern oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   The 80 objects in this exhibition are diverse enough that they
nearly form a mini-Met. Every gallery presents a different facet of
Gulbenkian's collection and his demanding sensibility; sometimes
there is a change in culture, century or medium every few yards.
Within 30 feet of the entrance, for example, you will move from a
Roman medal bearing Alexander the Great's likeness, to a finely
detailed Late Dynasty head of an old man to a Yuan porcelain stem
cup to Ghirlandaio's gossamer portrait of a Florentine noblewoman
in the bloom of youth, her neck encircled by coal beads.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it all hangs together in a whole in a virtual self-portrait
of a man of passionate connoisseurship, a man of complex cultural
background and princely lifestyle who had a penchant for objects of
lavish material and superb craftsmanship. Gulbenkian was not
interested in being comprehensive in any way; he bought only what
captured and held his attention.
</P>
<P>
   He continually weeded and refined his holdings, giving away,
trading or selling objects that did not measure up. He was famously
picky, taking things home on approval for days or even weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And he frequently beat dealers at their own game. In the late
1920s, when the financially shaky Soviet Union was selling off some
of the Russian Empress Elizabeth I's silver _ a 21-pound dish cover
in the form of frolicking fish by the great French silversmith
Antoine-Sebastien Durand, for example _ Gulbenkian's business
connections enabled him to close a deal ahead of Joseph Duveen, and
at a lower price.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition, then, is a distillation of a collection that
had been rigorously distilled by the time of its owner's death in
1955. (The foundation that he established in his will created the
museum, which opened in its permanent home in 1969.) The show
traces Gulbenkian's taste in big transcultural arcs, alternating
paintings and sculpture with the decorative in ways that create
telling visual echoes.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination with portraiture that asserts itself early in
the show carries on throughout. Near the Ghirlandaio, for example,
there is a remarkable Florentine medal of Filippo Strozzi at an
advanced age, seen in profile, his wrinkles and sags as visible as
his proud unyielding character. Skip a gallery and you'll be face
to face with Rubens' magnificent full-length portrait of Helena
Fourment, his young second wife, arrayed in black satin, queenly
yet beguiling.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is a Watteau study of a woman's head shown in three
graceful positions that seems to capture a single, cinematic
movement. And beyond there is Gainsborough's portrait of Elizabeth
Lowndes-Stone, also full length, her silks and the surrounding
landscape rendered in loose, windswept strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's penultimate gallery holds two great portraits
from 19th-century France. Degas' tiny full-length portrait of the
painter Henri Michel-Levy _ elegant, lost in thought, with a
life-size female mannequin lying at his feet in an awkward heap _
is as pictorially complex and emotionally charged as this enigmatic
artist gets.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite wall hangs Manet's ``Boy Blowing Bubbles'' of
1867, as arresting for its image of youthful focus as for its
luscious shades of gray and gray-white, especially palpable in the
subject's humble jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Gulbenkian's passion for lavish decorative objects finds
expression in a room devoted to Iranian and Turkish ceramics,
glass, tiles and textiles. On one wall a carpet and three hangings
in silk or velvet, most with silver thread, form an isolated
exegesis on motifs derived from nature and the many possibilities
of figure-ground, positive-negative relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The growth cycle itself seems to be enacted in a 17th-century
velvet panel in which patterns of red, white and blue on a cream
background feature flowers in schematic bud form, at half bloom and
full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A later gallery displays a sampling of the Gulbenkian's
18th-century French decorative arts. Included here are the silver
dish cover and Elizabeth I's three-piece silver centerpiece
featuring impeccably coiffed toddlers, ornately floral silk panels
that once belonged to the French royal family, and a medal cabinet
by Charles Cressant whose inlaid rosewood is all but obliterated by
its engraved gilt bronze mounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the final gallery Gulbenkian's taste for the decoration based
on nature reaches the turn of the century with Lalique's jewelry.
This includes a gold-and-enamel brooch depicting nine serpents that
is the size of a small breastplate and a choker in rock crystal
whose tiny squares depict cats crouched on tree limbs. Best of all
is an amber glass sugar bowl snared in an elaborate silver setting
of writhing, hissing serpents likely to curtail most cravings for
sweets.
</P>
<P>
   At the show's beginning one might take in three illuminated
books of hours, including one from 16th-century France open to a
particularly emotional image of Jesus carrying the Cross. From
14th-century France there's an ivory diptych that recounts the life
of Jesus and in a subsequent gallery a 15th-century Iranian
manuscript illumination in which a young prince surveys seven
princesses installed in a separate pavilions that form a single,
apselike space.
</P>
<P>
   Farther along Fragonard's ``Fete at Rambouillet,'' shows a
boating party moving toward a picturesque garden in a scene that
changes from tame to wild and from frivolous to disquieting before
your eyes.

   Back in the last painting gallery, ``Wreck of a Transport
Ship,'' an early work by J.M.W. Turner, depicts a futile rescue
attempt in towering seas. The lifeboats and struggling figures are
rendered in exquisite detail, the churning waves in broader strokes
that convey not only the indefatigable power of nature but also the
growing imagination that would be fully unleashed in Turner's later
works.

MYERS SHOWS HIS `POWERS' 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME'
</P>
<P>
   1999, PG-13, New Line, CC, VHS $22.98, DVD $24.98. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Most sequels are less entertaining and make less money than
their predecessors. This one did the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spy'' is funnier than 1997's Austin Powers: International Man
of Mystery, and it also made more money on its opening weekend ($55
million) than the first film did in its entire domestic run ($54
million).
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to Mike Myers hitting his stride _ and while you're
at it, give the guy bonus points.
</P>
<P>
   Myers plays three roles here (not counting time-displaced copies
of '60s spy Austin Powers himself), so he's in almost every scene.
</P>
<P>
   He's a stitch _ but not without a hitch. ``Spy'' is stupidly
plotted and riddled with holes.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers brush off this laziness as deliberate, with
characters making fun of the nonsense in asides to the audience.
Not making sense is deemed part of the joke.
</P>
<P>
   The plot has Dr. Evil (Myers) in the '90s using time travel to
steal Austin's ``mojo,'' or life force, from the '60s, thus
rendering Austin ineffective in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   To retrieve his ``mojo,'' Austin teams with American spy
Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). Meanwhile, Dr. Evil adopts a
tiny clone of himself in Mini-Me (Verne Troyer).
</P>
<P>
   Plopping down in the middle is an obese Scottish mercenary
(Myers again), whose gross-out gags may make you gag.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there's something to offend everyone here. Yet Myers'
crazed performance is more gleefully impudent than mean-spirited,
making this return romp an encore well worth making _ and having.
</P>
<P>
   As with the first film _ 1998's top tape on Billboard's charts _
this one is geared to sales, with the added bonus of DVD.
</P>
<P>
   The latter has scads of added material, including 19 minutes of
unused scenes and a half-hour documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Also featured are three music videos (including Madonna's
``Beautiful Stranger''), three theatrical trailers, feature-length
audio commentary by Myers and director Jay Roach, and a wide-screen
presentation of the film _ not to mention DVD-ROM features. Groovy.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 stars.

<P>
   `BARTOK THE MAGNIFICENT'
</P>
<P>
   1999, G, Fox, CC, VHS $19.98, DVD $29.98.
</P>
<P>
   Like Disney's ``The Lion King,'' ``Pocahontas'' and ``Beauty and
the Beast'' and Universal's ``The Land Before Time,'' Fox's
``Anastasia'' is spinning off a sequel just for video.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no Princess Anastasia in sight. There's only Bartok,
the wisecracking little bat from the first film.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he and his bear pal, a hammy actor named Zozi (voiced by
Kelsey Grammer), must find a kidnapped Russian prince.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria returns as the voice of Bartok, with Tim Curry as a
monstrous creature too close to his role in ``The Enchanted
Christmas,'' Disney's video sequel to ``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   French Stewart, Jennifer Tilly, Catherine O'Hara and Diedrich
Bader also lend voices to this tale of magic, music and mirth.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Anastasia,'' the quality of the animation is
remarkably high. Directing were Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, who
also helmed ``Anastasia'' and collaborated on ``The Land Before
Time,'' ``All Dogs Go to Heaven'' and ``An American Tail.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bartok, he's more fun on his own than you'd expect.
</P>
<P>
   Wryly complaining, his voice breaking, he's an amusingly impish
hero, and his mite size makes the fanciful vistas and giant
creatures seem even more imposing.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 stars.

   `TEA WITH MUSSOLINI' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1999, PG, MGM, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $24.98.
</P>
<P>
   Italian writer-director Franco Zeffirelli creates a strong sense
of time and place for this semi-autobiographical look at his
childhood, yet the story seems detached.
</P>
<P>
   His surrogate is a homeless boy who's taken in by expatriate
Englishwomen _ and two ``vulgar'' Americans _ in Italy on the eve
of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As war erupts, the women must cope with the hostilities, even
though one woman did, in fact, have tea with the Italian dictator,
who assured them they'd be safe.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is superb, with Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Judi
Dench as the Englishwomen and Cher and Lily Tomlin as the
Americans. They don't always gel well, but they're full of life and
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the boy's presence seems incidental, and the
historical plot has a plodding inevitability.
</P>
<P>

CAYMAN GOVERNMENT TELLS CRUISERS: NEVER ON A SUNDAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGE TOWN, Grand Cayman _ The Cayman Islands made a bold
statement this year about tourism and community values by closing
its ports to cruise ships on Sundays and religious holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson, Cayman minister of tourism, said the decision
followed two years of discussion by the government's Executive
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we be role models if we openly condone business on
Sundays and religious holidays?'' Jefferson said. ``This sends a
contradictory message to our young people. We cannot tell our
children to respect and live by such values while ignoring them
ourselves. Restoring the sanctity of observing Sundays, Christmas
and Good Friday sends a strong message about the importance of
Christian values in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the first time the Cayman Islands have cited
religious values in closing a port. Two years ago, Grand Cayman
made headlines when it turned away a Norwegian Cruise Line ship
chartered for gay passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from restaurants, there is little commercial activity on
Sundays in the Caymans. Bars close at midnight on Saturdays and
cannot reopen until 1 p.m. on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The country's deeply held religious beliefs also mean that
public nudity is not tolerated. Laws prohibit topless sunbathing.
And local custom calls on tourists to cover up once they are off
the beach.

FOLLOWING THE TRAIL OF FOLK ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now in its 21st year, Sanford Smith's Fall Antiques
Show is still the premier show in the country for folk art.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Wallach, one of 64 exhibitors at the show, which runs
through Sunday at the Armory at Park Avenue in Manhattan, praised
the show for its antique and period folk art, ``in terms of quality
of dealers, merchandise and the amount of participation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallach is expecting clients from Detroit, Chicago, Cincinnati,
Philadelphia and, yes, Alaska. Among his exhibits is a poignant
shadow-box diorama dated April 5, 1900. It was made by a sailor for
his captain after he survived a shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painted on canvas rescued from the wrecked ship,''
Wallach said.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a six-foot-tall grandfather clock covered with
wooden clothespins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely homemade,'' he said. ``The Shakers invented
the clothespin in about 1850. Here someone in the Adirondacks has
reinvented it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallach said he drove across northern New York State in search
of folk art, but often came home emptyhanded.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Judith Milne, another dealer at the show, said, ``It's tough,
really tough, to find great things now.'' She added that really
good items sold very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers find stock in novel ways. Amy Finkel of M. Finkel &AMP;
Daughter, a Philadelphia dealer in American needlepoint, created a
Web site, www.samplings.com, and found that it became a source of
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much to our surprise, we find people approach us to sell
things after they see our site,'' Ms. Finkel said. ``We had no idea
it would be such a successful business tool.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At the show, Ms. Finkel is selling a New England needlework
picture signed ``Elizabeth Newsam, Feb. 16, 1753.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a glorious rendition of a couple standing on a hillock _
very much in the mid-18th-century tradition of sophisticated
needlework one finds in Massachusetts,'' Ms. Finkel said. ``To have
made this, you would have had to come from a family who cared
enough to send you to school to learn needlework.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen and Carol Huber of Old Saybrook, Conn., are showing silk
embroideries of classical scenes from the Moravian School in
Bethlehem, Pa., one of the oldest girls' schools in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is so strong now that people are willing to part
with things,'' Ms. Huber said.
</P>
<P>
   She also has a pair of samplers marked ``1807 Holmes Hole,'' the
name of a town on Martha's Vineyard. She found out that the pair
was the work of two classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``One married the other's brother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Each sampler is priced at $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the millennium, Laura Fisher said, she is showing
``textbook examples of museum-quality quilts from every single
decade of the century _ the 19th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Gecker, a Manhattan dealer, has two 19th-century Fiske
weather vanes. One is a rare gilded copper dragon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only other one I've ever seen sold for $95,000 at the
Winter Antiques Show 15 years ago,'' Gecker said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Milne has a 1930s Adirondacks sideboard that is eight
feet long and has drawer fronts decorated with fish, deer and
horses carved in relief. It costs $12,500.
</P>
<P>
   She also has a striking woodcarving of a man playing pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like an Elie Nadelman sculpture,'' she said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fantasies in Silver &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is extraordinary 18th-century French silver in ``Only the
Best: Masterpieces of the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, Lisbon,''
which opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Tuesday (review,
Page x). Most of the silver was designed for the dinner table, but
utilitarian functions are strictly secondary. These are Rococo
pieces designed to dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is a pair of silver mustard barrels made
about 1751 for Madame de Pompadour by Antoine-Sebastien Durand. Two
tiny men, quivers of arrows thrown over their shoulders, are
trundling the barrels along in tiny wheelbarrows, which roll on
silver wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of thing that just screams Gulbenkian,'' said
James David Draper, the Met's curator of European sculpture and
decorative arts. ``He liked things that were the summation of a
civilization. He wanted the perfect representational object.''
</P>
<P>
   An Armenian born in Istanbul, Gulbenkian (1869-1955) became one
of the world's richest men, founding the Turkish Petroleum Co.
before World War I and then using his fortune to amass a fine art
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Another item in the show is a Rococo silver gilt tureen and
stand made for Empress Elizabeth I of Russia in 1758-61. It is one
of eight commissioned from Francois-Thomas Germain, widely
considered the best Rococo silversmith of France.
</P>
<P>
   The lid of the tureen is adorned with two small children at
play. A small boy is tugging on the leash of his dog, trying to
stop it from approaching a nest of eggs in which baby birds are
hatching. A little girl protects one bird by holding it in her
hand. Fruits and flowers are scattered about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel a certain taste for sensuality in such pieces,''
said Joao Castel-Branco Pereira, director of the Gulbenkian Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable piece by Durand is an enormous dish cover
called a cloche. Designed to serve fish, it is festooned with
exuberant sea creatures. A conger eel cranes its mouth to catch a
sardine in midair. Around it, a sole, a red mullet and a dogfish
fall out of a creel. Oysters, clams and shellfish rest on a bed of
algae. On the base, a boy is supported by two dolphins. Waving sea
grasses are etched on the sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish are so realistic they look like life casts,'' Draper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Few such spectacular silver services survive; most were melted
down by the French kings when they needed money to go to war.
</P>
<P>
   Silver services cost a fortune to make in the 18th century, and
because of their rarity cost a fortune to buy 200 years later. But
Gulbenkian's friends say he used his silver.
</P>
<P>
   One friend, Robert Arnold, recalled: ``Gulbenkian was an
intensely private person, but he entertained lavishly. That silver
was out and around the dining room.''
</P>
<P>
   Sao Schlumberger, a Paris society woman who received an art
scholarship from Gulbenkian when she was 18, said: ``He bought
whatever he liked. He was interested in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Essayan, Gulbenkian's grandson, said: ``My grandfather
always told me, `I've taken advice, but in the end I always bought
what I liked.'''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold added, ``Rather like the Rockefellers after World War I,
he just bought everything that was the best.''

AT THE MOVIES: BURTON AND DEPP TEAM AGAIN; 007'S SCREENWRITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   Mutual Admiration
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ They are two of Hollywood's more idiosyncratic
figures. So it's not especially odd that Tim Burton, the inventive,
offbeat director of ``Beetlejuice,'' ``Batman'' and ``Edward
Scissorhands,'' should team up once more with Johnny Depp in
``Sleepy Hollow.'' The film opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny is like a chameleon,'' said Burton, who has worked with
him in ``Scissorhands'' and ``Ed Wood.'' ``He likes to change. He
becomes different people. He doesn't care how he looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton added with a laugh: ``In fact, he usually wants to look
worse. Like me, he likes to make something believable out of absurd
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Depp said: ``For an actor, Tim Burton is a dream because he's so
open to ideas. He trusts me, and I trust him. He explores all the
possibilities. I did this film for one reason: Tim. If he called me
and said, `I want to make a five-hour documentary in a deli,' I'd
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new film, with some strong advance reviews, is hardly a
five-hour film in a deli. Based on Washington Irving's classic
fantasy ``The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,'' it has humor, and that is
one of its surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to find humor in any and every situation,''
said Depp, who plays a prissy, neurotic and not very courageous
Ichabod Crane. ``Ichabod is a wreck. He's fragile. He's about to
explode. He's very much in touch with his feminine side.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, set in 1799, Ichabod is a constable with a
contemporary approach to police work who comes to the small town of
Sleepy Hollow to investigate a string of murders attributed to a
headless horseman. Adapted by Andrew Kevin Walker and produced by
Scott Rudin, the film also stars Christina Ricci, Miranda
Richardson and Michael Gambon. Tom Stoppard, the playwright, was an
uncredited screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Burton grew up in a working-class home in Burbank, Calif., and
spent his childhood watching the ``Frankenstein'' movies of James
Whale as well as films by Roger Corman, Vincent Price and German
expressionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the lurid beauty of these monster movies,'' he said.
``They spoke to me. I was never afraid of them. I didn't understand
the world, and these films were somehow symbolic of the way I
felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's vision is uniformly dark. ``His world is
constitutionally warped and explosive,'' wrote David Thomson in A
Biographical Dictionary of Film.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the image of the headless horseman in ``Sleepy
Hollow'' has gripped him since childhood when he saw the Disney
animated version.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a powerful folk tale image,'' he said. ``It
ultimately represents the power of the subconscious. It's something
you can't put your finger on or even verbalize. And it's an image
whose power you can't categorize in a world where the imagination
wants to categorize everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton added, ``And I loved the juxtaposition of Ichabod, always
thinking in his head, versus the guy without a head.''
</P>
<P>
   Depp said he patterned his performance after several actors he
admires: his longtime friend Roddy McDowell, Basil Rathbone in the
Sherlock Holmes films and even Angela Lansbury in ``Death on the
Nile.'' ``The way she spoke, she had a beautiful energy in that
film,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Depp, a busy actor with several films coming up, said he was
awaiting another call from Burton. ``Working with him is like
coming home,'' Depp said. ``It's one of the most comfortable places
I've been in. I hope he continues to call me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Same but Different  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Feirstein doesn't know how to make the perfect martini, as
James Bond does. (``I drink them though.'') He doesn't drive an
Aston Martin. (``A Jeep Cherokee.'') He doesn't know much about
guns. (``I am not one of those geeks who can tell you about the
right gun.'')
</P>
<P>
   And quite unlike Agent 007, this New Jersey-born writer hardly
sees himself as a suave lady-killer who periodically saves the
world from an international terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   But James Bond is certainly part of Feirstein's unusual writing
career, which veers from journalism and humor books (``Real Men
Don't Eat Quiche,'' ``Nice Guys Don't Sleep Alone'') to
screenplays. Feirstein is now returning for his third James Bond
script. He was co-writer of ``Goldeneye'' in 1995, writer of
``Tomorrow Never Dies'' in 1997 and co-writer of ``The World Is Not
Enough,'' which opens Friday. It's the 19th installment of the
longest-running and most successful film franchise in history.
</P>
<P>
   Feirstein, 45, joined the Bond bandwagon in an unusual way. He
has earned much of his living over the last 20 years writing
romantic comedies that have been optioned by studios but never
made. His humor has also appeared in numerous magazines and
newspapers, including The New York Times, where he also was a
contributor to the editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Feirstein was working on a comedy for the
producer Fred Zollo. Zollo's wife, Barbara Broccoli, who is one of
the producers of the recent Bond films, read some of Feirstein's
scripts and called to ask him to contribute some jokes for
``Goldeneye.''
</P>
<P>
   Feirstein said: ``I went in to do five jokes for the movie. I
was supposed to give Bond some wit. But I wound up rewriting a lot
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his creations was the character M, played by Judi Dench,
the cunning head of British intelligence whose language is often
full of double entendres.
</P>
<P>
   Feirstein, seated in a Santa Monica cafe the other afternoon
eating an un-Bondian luncheon of fruit salad and decaf coffee, said
he was flattered and a little awe struck to be part of the Bond
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's daunting to look at those early ones, like `Thunderball'
and `Goldfinger' and `Dr. No,' and realize how wonderful the
writing was; that's the challenge,'' said Feirstein, who lives with
his wife, the producer Madeline Warren, in New York's Greenwich
Village, as well as in an apartment in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are really like ritualistic Greek drama,''
Feirstein said. ``People go to the movies expecting to see certain
things in a Bond film. But they want them just a little bit
different each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see M say, `I want you to take care of this
little problem, James.' They want to see him go to the casino and
say, `The name is Bond, James Bond.' They want to see the scene
where the guy says, `I've been expecting you, Mr. Bond.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are one or two lines that usually follow. One of
them is: `I can kill you now, but only you can understand the evil
genius of my plan.' And the other is: `It's not about this cup of
coffee, Mr. Bond. It's about global domination.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And the girl has to say at one point, `Oh, James!'''
</P>
<P>
   Feirstein said he was convinced that one of the reasons the
films were so successful was that Bond was British.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lone man from a vanquished power saving the world,'' he
said. ``If he was an American, it wouldn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the films are total fantasies. ``The Bond films are
set five minutes in the future,'' he said. ``He lives in a world
where anything is possible and can be accomplished with an
unlimited amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bond films are sometimes written in almost
committee style, and Feirstein has no real control over the final
version, he said he allowed his own fantasies to run rampant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to see a motorcycle jump over a flying
helicopter; that was in the last one,'' he said. ``In `Goldeneye'
we needed a way to get information to Bond. So I sat down and typed
out this idea of a full-color fax coming out of a CD player. Three
days later on a sound stage it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Feirstein acknowledged that, despite the fantasy element of
James Bond, he tried to slip a serious issue or two into the
script. In an early scene in the new film, Bond, played by Pierce
Brosnan, goes to the office of a Swiss banker.
</P>
<P>
   The banker says, ``I'm only trying to do the right thing, Bond,
in returning the money to its rightful owner.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bond replies: ``Yes. And we both know how difficult it can
be for the Swiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Feirstein said with a laugh: ``Can you imagine being a Swiss
banker in Zurich watching this film when Bond says that line? The
Bond films can have so much more impact than editorials.''
</P>
<P>
   Feirstein, who is now writing a comedy for Will Smith, said he
was unsure if Ms. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, her producing
partner, would call him back. A Bond film rolls out every two
years. The current film, which was directed by Michael Apted, also
features Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I serve at the pleasure of the producers,'' said Feirstein,
who shared writing credit on the latest film with Neal Purvis and
Robert Wade.
</P>
<P>
   The Bond experience has been memorable, Feirstein said. During
the making of the current film, he said, the armorer who handles
the movie's weapons called Feirstein in one day to show him the
Walter PPK revolver that had been used by Sean Connery and the
other Bonds in all the films until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like touching the Holy Grail,'' Feirstein said.

REAGAN'S SON MIKE TALKS OF CHILDHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TOM SCHULTZ   
 Santa Barbara (Calif.) News-Press   
 1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Mike Reagan, the son of former President
Ronald Reagan, says he shares ``Kodak moments'' with his ill
father, who has Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hug him hello and hug him goodbye,'' Reagan said during a
speech here. ``He hasn't said my name in two years, but he knows
I'm the guy who hugs him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sitting down now. It's not easy for him to stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan's ailment has been well documented in recent
years, and public interest in the former president is still high
and particularly persistent in Santa Barbara, where the younger
Reagan was invited to speak Wednesday to the Channel City Club. The
former president and first lady, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, owned a
ranch here, which was their vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Reagan, 55, is the adopted son of Reagan and his first
wife, the actress Jane Wyman. He is now a syndicated talk show
host.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Reagan largely ignored hot-button issues like
abortion and gun control that he normally tackles on his
conservative radio show. Instead, he offered brief glimpses of his
childhood, and talked about the difficulties of being raised by
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was not all positive, Reagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Boarding school filled many of his early years, which were spent
largely away from his parents: ``I never really did see them that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Reagan frustrated his father with shallow
academic performances. And like so many sons or daughters, he
sparred with Ronald Reagan over musical taste: ``I was listening to
the Beach Boys, and he was listening to some guy named Glenn
Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   But if his relationship with his parents was at times distant,
it was not without value, Reagan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jane Wyman and Ronald Reagan have the same defects _ yeah,
they were born with a work ethic,'' Reagan said.
</P>
<P>
   While his father was governor of California, Reagan loaded
freight at a Los Angeles trucking dock, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had guys on the dock coming up to me asking, `Do your
parents just not like you?'''
</P>
<P>
   For much of his adult life, Reagan raced and sold speed boats.
</P>
<P>
   His current radio program went national in 1992, and it is now
heard on stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan said he has no plans to abandon his latest line of work,
and will not be seeking public office any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   If you get elected,'' he said, ``you've got to say goodbye to
your family. I'm not willing to do that.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (star) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings
and running times are in parentheses.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``AMERICAN BEAUTY,'' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette
Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan
Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old
suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader. And he
never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but
the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry
humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie.
</P>
<P>
   All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms.
Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the story spreads
itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a
devastating finale (Janet Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``AMERICAN MOVIE,'' featuring Mark Borchardt and friends.
Directed by Chris Smith (R, 104 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   An insightful, funny, not-to-be-missed documentary about a
no-budget Wisconsin filmmaker who makes a horror film as if his
life depended on it. And as Smith so affectingly reveals,
Borchardt's hopes really do hang in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   This knowing and often hilarious look at try-anything indie
filmmaking becomes a moving portrait of one man's uphill struggle
and finds Borchardt often describing success and prosperity as his
goals. Meanwhile his own life is eloquently presented as a very
different, no less authentic kind of American Dream (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``ANYWHERE BUT HERE,'' starring Susan Sarandon and
Natalie Portman. Directed by Wayne Wang (PG-13, 113 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In a knowing film adaptation of Mona Simpson's widely praised,
if not often wildly eventful, first novel, Ms. Sarandon is
show-stopping as the 14-year-old heroine's mother and main nemesis.
And Ms. Portman, who proves her mettle in a fully formed dramatic
role, does a terrific job of holding her own in the film's battle
of wills.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the material meanders, Wang supplies insightful,
affectionate direction, just as he did for ``The Joy Luck Club.'' A
women's picture made with feeling and acted with great flair
(Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``BEING JOHN MALKOVICH,'' starring John Cusack, Catherine
Keener, Cameron Diaz and (of course) John Malkovich. Written by
Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze (R, 112 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the fun house: in this exhilaratingly quirky first
feature by a stellar video director, the reigning fears and
obsessions of a technology-crazed, voyeuristic culture are given an
even wilder workout than they got from ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack plays a discouraged puppeteer who accidentally finds a
way into Malkovich's mind. While the ordinary science-fiction plot
might go downhill after revealing its gimmick, this one's inspired
craziness goes on and on. Originality and cleverness abound
(Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BACHELOR,'' starring Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger.
Directed by Gary Sinyor (PG-13, 90 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This crude, frantic yuppie farce stars O'Donnell as a selfish,
marriage-shy bachelor who botches his proposal to his sweetheart
(Ms. Zellweger) days before his grandfather dies and leaves him
$100 million on the condition he marry before his 30th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   That gives him 27 hours either to win back his true love or find
another wife. After running through his ex-girlfriends, he finds
himself besieged by a horde of prospective brides chasing him
through the streets of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a 1925 Buster Keaton classic, the movie lands a few
satiric thrusts at the money-mad workaholic '90s (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BONE COLLECTOR,'' starring Denzel Washington and Angelina
Jolie. Directed by Phillip Noyce (R, 118 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   One of the year's most gruesome movies, the ingenious but
preposterous whodunit stars Washington as a quadriplegic forensic
detective tracking down a serial killer who plays cat and mouse
with him by leaving elaborate clues at the crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jolie is the police officer (and former model) whom he
instructs by cell phone on how to gather evidence. Crammed with the
usual manipulative jolts, this urban creepshow at least succeeds in
sustaining an atmosphere of menace, and Washington's and Ms.
Jolie's star chemistry smolders without the two exchanging so much
as a kiss (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``BOYS DON'T CRY,'' starring Hillary Swank and Chloe
Sevigny. Directed by Kimberley Pierce (R, 114 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story
of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to
create a charismatic identity as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but
on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American
tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly
romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One
of the year's best (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``BRINGING OUT THE DEAD,'' starring Nicolas Cage and Patricia
Arquette. Written by Paul Schrader from a novel by Joe Connelly.
Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 115 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   An intense, volatile film full of sorrow and wild, mordant
humor. This time it took prop garbage on the streets of Hell's
Kitchen to create a sufficiently hellish ambience for another
nighttime tour of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But Scorsese has mellowed significantly since his ``Taxi
Driver'' days, and his uneven but impassioned, visually inventive
new film is more contemplative than it looks. Cage gives a fine,
soulful performance as a New York ambulance driver haunted by
ghosts. Ving Rhames is a major scene-stealer as one of his partners
(Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``DOGMA,'' starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda
Fiorentino, Chris Rock and Salma Hayek. Directed by Kevin Smith (R,
130 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Smith's idea of angels in America is the notion of two cool
dudes who take a hair-splitting, legalese approach to Roman
Catholic doctrine and think it would be amusing to nullify all
existence. And nothing in this wildly brazen, unexpectedly devout
comedy is any less outrageous than that.
</P>
<P>
   Smith again shows off a rare gift for fusing his comic-book
sensibility with serious debates and big, big laughs, even if some
parts of his film (Ms. Fiorentino's performance, Rock's and
semi-repartee from the ubiquitous Jay and Silent Bob) work better
than others (an excrement monster).
</P>
<P>
   Making a gutsy leap into matters of faith, Smith miraculously
emerges with his humor intact and his wings unsinged (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``FELICIA'S JOURNEY,'' starring Elaine Cassidy and Bob
Hoskins. Directed by Atom Egoyan (PG-13, 116 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In the brilliantly realized surreal thriller, adapted from
William Trevor's popular novel, Felicia (Ms. Cassidy), a pregnant
Irish girl searching for her boyfriend in the English midlands, is
befriended by Joseph Hildritch ( Hoskins), a catering manager who
also happens to be a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   Egoyan, Canada's most gifted filmmaker, elevates this
cat-and-mouse game into a film that transcends genre by entering
the characters' consciousness and implying a world of
half-discernible connections in which the weather, the landscape
and the chance encounters of strangers suggest the sense of a grand
design (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL,'' starring Geoffrey Rush, Taye Diggs
and Peter Gallagher. Directed by William Malone (R, 115 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   If the ever vigilant Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan,
is truly determined to snuff out inflation aborning, then he can do
no better than to take sharpened pencil in hand, make his way to
the nearest theater showing this film and strike fearlessly until
its feeble pulse beats no more.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sorry reincarnation of the 1950s William Castle horror
film in which an eccentric millionaire played by Vincent Price
offered five strangers $10,000 each to spend the night in a spooky
old mansion. In the new version the ante for survival has been
raised to $1 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Even allowing for inflation in the 40 years since the original
opened, the reward in 1999 should come to only $57,113.47,
according to the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis. But some
things have not become devalued over the years: words like junk,
for example. ``Hill'' was pronounced junk in these pages in 1959.
And it is still junk (Lawrence Van Gelder). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE INSIDER,'' starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and
Christopher Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Mann directs this taut thriller about the tobacco industry
whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand with pulse-quickening panache. And he
illustrates why, in the corporate climate of the '90s,
truth-telling is a riskier business than it was circa ``All the
President's Men.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage as a producer
for ``60 Minutes,'' and Plummer wickedly mimics Mike Wallace, Crowe
movingly captures the complexity of Wigand's situation. Shaky
docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on ``60 Minutes.'' But this
is an inordinately well-played thriller, with Mann's stylistic brio
at its best (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC,'' starring Milla
Jovovich, John Malkovich, Tcheky Karyo and Faye Dunaway. Directed
by Luc Besson (R, 130 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The Hundred Years' War feels twice that long in this shrill,
frenetic account of Joan of Arc. It's a film whose main revelation
is that the Middle Ages may have been a lot more lurid than
previously reported. Besson directs plenty of grisly, hand-held
battle scenes and absurd scenes of royal scheming, while Ms.
Jovovich talks. Like this. And doesn't seem faintly plausible as
France's teenage martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a case where ``Don't shoot `The Messenger''' would have
been sound advice (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``MUSIC OF THE HEART,'' starring Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn,
Angela Bassett and Gloria Estefan. Directed by Wes Craven (PG, 110
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Not many of us enjoy being lectured by dressed-down Hollywood
stars in gritty classroom situations. But the true story of Roberta
Guaspari, a music teacher in East Harlem and a single mother
surviving a nasty divorce, has been given a blunt, no-nonsense tone
that works.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Streep gives a down-to-earth performance that is sheer award
bait. The story is inspirational enough to take Ms. Guaspari from
no job prospects to watching her proud students play alongside
Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern and other violin stars. Not a bad
reason for Craven to have sidelined the claws and hatchets for a
while (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``PRINCESS MONONOKE,'' with the voices of Billy Crudup,
Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton and Minnie Driver. Directed by
Hayao Miyazaki (PG-13, 133 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A landmark feat of Japanese animation from the acknowledged
master of the genre. This complicated, exotically beautiful epic
features gods and demons locked in battle for the future of the
forest, and its visions are breathtakingly rendered.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the film's stirring use of nature, myth and Japanese
history that makes it so special. Worth seeing just for its Forest
Spirit, which takes animal form by day and roams the night as a
diaphanous, Godzilla-like divinity.
</P>
<P>
   The image of plants and flowers springing to life beneath his
hooves is ravishingly presented. Despite a superb blend of
hand-drawn cels and fluid, computer-generated animation, the film's
look is gratifyingly understated (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE STRAIGHT STORY,'' starring Richard Farnsworth and
Sissy Spacek. Directed by David Lynch (G, 110 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   As the least likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a
G-rated miracle, Lynch rises to the challenge with exhilarating
vigor. It may not sound like much, but this account of an old man
making a long trip on a riding lawn mower turns out to be a
slow-moving, folksy-looking, deeply spiritual film with the power
to hold audiences in thrall.
</P>
<P>
   And as Oscar may well note next spring, it would not have been
possible without Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its
heart. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new
frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result:
a supremely improbable triumph (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Film Series &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``COLUMBIA 75.'' Just think of it: Mondays of screwball comedies
like ``His Girl Friday'' (1940) and ``The Awful Truth'' (1937).
Wednesdays and Thursdays of film noir like ``In a Lonely Place''
(1950), ``Dead Reckoning'' (1947) and ``The Big Heat'' (1953). And
that's not to overlook such attractions as ``It Happened One
Night'' (1934), `` Deeds Goes to Town'' (1936), ``The Wild One''
(1953), ``Taxi Driver'' (1977), ``Pal Joey'' (1957), the Three
Stooges, Krazy Kat and eight days of ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964).
</P>
<P>
   They're all part of ``Columbia 75,'' a 75-film festival at the
Film Forum that celebrates the 75th anniversary of Columbia
Pictures. The series of films from the studio archive begins with
screenings Friday and Saturday of a double feature of Rita Hayworth
vehicles: Orson Welles' ``Lady From Shanghai'' (1948) and Charles
Vidor's ``Gilda'' (1946).
</P>
<P>
   The series continues through Jan. 13 at the Film Forum, 209 West
Houston Street, South Village. Tickets: $9; $5 for members.
Information: (212) 727-8110 (Van Gelder).

   COMDEX _ LAS VEGAS _ Cable and DSL technologies continue their
push for high-speed Internet access, but complex installations and
a critical lack of availability hamper wiper usage. In the

   ``Health care providers who have been struggling under the
burden of money-saving regulations imposed in 1997 will now be
getting some much-needed relief,'' said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr.,
R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, the bill increases payments to
hospitals by $7.2 billion, to managed care groups by $4.8 billion,
and to nursing homes, home health and hospice services by $3.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also increases the amount spent for Medicare Part B _
doctors and related services _ by $2.8 billion over five years.
One-fourth of the cost of Medicare Part B is paid by beneficiary
premiums. Medicare Part B is expected to spend roughly $100 billion
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional staffers said Thursday they did not know how much
premiums would have to increase to cover the additional Part B
expenses. The monthly premium is now $45.50 and will remain at that
amount in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare provisions are intended to fix a problem caused by
the 1997 law. Because of the law, payments to hospitals for
outpatient services were cut in many areas below payment levels in
effect before the law was passed. The bill includes revisions to
add $3.9 billion for outpatient services, plus another $3.3 billion
for hospitals over all over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also extends from 36 months to 44 months the coverage
for people taking immunosuppressive drugs used in organ
transplants. It also suspends until 2003 proposed caps on payments
for physical theraphy and occupational therapy.

FLYING WITH EGYPTAIR ON OUR MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Nov. 25)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat

<TEXT>
<P>
   The day we flew east, front page newspaper photos showed the
shocked and tortured faces of relatives. A week later when we flew
home the photos were of mourners gathered for a large memorial.
</P>
<P>
   You can sit on a plane and read about another plane plunging
into the ocean, on its way to Egypt from New York, 30 minutes after
takeoff, but it doesn't stop you from flying. Your friend says the
odds are with you. It's usually a long time between bad air
crashes. Besides, you see car wrecks all the time and that doesn't
keep you from driving.
</P>
<P>
   So, you pack up early in the morning and get on a plane that you
trust will get you where you're wanting to go, even though you know
there are no guarantees you'll get there.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still unsure of the cause, but you squeeze
into your seat and go through your own personal boarding ritual.
Check to see what the movie will be, locate the nearest bathroom.
Stick the water bottle in the seat pocket in front of you, see if
there's anything in the reading rack but golf magazines and settle
back, trusting someone to get you there.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't entirely settle back. Even though you go ahead and
fly, you do it a little differently this time. You check exit
signs. You listen for appropriate and inappropriate noises. You
realize you have absolutely no control over this plane and send up
a little prayer as it starts down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes flying is like a day off from work with the flu.
You've got a Vanity Fair that will last a few hours, music if you
want, a movie, someone to bring you food and drinks, make sure you
have a blanket. But those are the flying days when your head is not
caught up in front page photos.
</P>
<P>
   This time it doesn't matter if they've run out of pillows. It
doesn't even matter that you're so far in the back that all the
pasta is taken and only beef is left.
</P>
<P>
   So what that the guy in front of you has tall hair which will
probably block the movie screen. The flight attendant commiserates
and gives you a free headset.
</P>
<P>
   You don't even mind that the connecting flight from Chicago is
delayed because of mechanical problems and they're waiting for
another plane. Take all the time you need. They have a plane just
in from London that will do nicely but it needs to be serviced.
We'll wait.
</P>
<P>
   The guy in the camel coat with the sunglasses grousing at the
ticket agent behind the counter is not happy about waiting. He's
playing the role of very important and personally inconvenienced, a
type commonly seen at boarding gates. But on this day he grumbles
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm imagining it but I think we're being mannerly out of
respect. Another time we will be the impatient throng, complaining
about time lost, sighing heavily, critically noting the bulging
sides of another's carry-on.
</P>
<P>
   Why are we so lucky and 217 people on EgyptAir Flight 990 were
not? They had people who loved them, important jobs to do, friends
to meet, adventures to have. They didn't imagine their plane diving
into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   They were thinking miles and hours ahead, of the food they would
eat, the souvenirs they'd buy, the love they would make. But until
then maybe they'd have something to drink and hope the person next
to them didn't snore.
</P>
<P>
   They were like everyone in my plane, breathing each other's air,
rubbing elbows, touching thighs, anticipating one another's
bathrooms habits. Readers, watchers, eaters, sleepers, mostly
strangers who just happened to decide to go to the same place on
the same day on the same plane.
</P>
<P>
   It gets bumpy during the last 45 minutes. The college student
next to me, who's been under headphones the whole way, now has her
face to the window and I ask if she sees any lights yet. I tell her
that I always feel better when I see lights. She says it's raining
and there's nothing but black out there.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot has been pretty chirpy. A flight attendant was
offering free wine earlier and one walked down the aisle whistling.
</P>
<P>
   Now the captain tells the flight attendants to sit down. We
passengers will have to make sure our own tray tables are locked up
and our seat belts are securely fastened. He apologizes for the
turbulence but says we'll soon be landing, and then we are.
</P>
<P>
   The student points outside to where a city suddenly appears and
we smile at each other. We bump. We touch down. We stop.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people are delivered this night safe and sound,
like some sort of miracle. We find the people we belong to and go
our separate ways.

TV DEAL POWERFUL FOR NASCAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR's announcement last week that it has agreed to a new
television deal worth a reported $2.8 billion marks a major step
forward for stock car racing.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the money being paid out by NBC Sports and Turner
Sports, NBC's cable partner, and Fox and its FX cable network
indicates that the networks now view NASCAR as comparable to pro
football, baseball and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   NBC/Turner and Fox/FX will combine to pay NASCAR $400 million a
year for six years, with Fox/FX signed for an additional two years
at a reported $200 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC/Turner contract begins in 2001 and expires in 2006, with
the Fox/FX deal extending through 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The total being paid to NASCAR is more than the networks are now
paying major-league baseball and the National Hockey League, and
close to what they are paying the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Only the National Football League contract, which got a $17.6
billion, eight-year deal in 1998, is significantly more than what
NASCAR will make. Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, called that
a ``ridiculous deal.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC/Turner will televise the final 18 races of the season, while
Fox/FX, which also has the NFL, will televise the first 18.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's all-star race, The Winston and the Bud Shootout, a race
featuring all the pole winners from the previous year, are also
part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   The Daytona 500 and the Pepsi 400, also run at Daytona, will
alternate between the two networks. In odd years, Fox will have the
Daytona 500 and NBC the Pepsi 400, and the coverage will be
reversed in even years.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR is the healthiest of any sport right now,'' Ebersol
said, pointing to Nielsen ratings which show that while other
sports are either losing viewers or have leveled off, NASCAR's
numbers are increasing yearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox walked away from hockey, and we walked away from
football,'' Ebersol said. ``It's going to take some education on
our part to learn the wheres and whys of racing, but we're excited
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Winston Cup, the contract calls for the networks
to televise Busch races.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the networks involved was key for NASCAR, according to
Bray Cary, NASCAR's vice president for broadcasting and technology.
Cary assisted Brian France, NASCAR's senior vice president in
charge of marketing, in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we've only had about 20 percent of our races on
network TV,'' Cary said. ``Now, 70 to 75 percent will be on the
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fox is committed to doing a one-hour pre-race show
prior to each event. NBC will do 30 minute pre-race and 30 minute
post-race shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the pre-race shows are good lead-ins to the event and
will help draw new viewers,'' Cary said.
</P>
<P>
   The networks will also market NASCAR heavily, according to
Ebersol. ``I think you can expect to see references to NASCAR in
our other programming,'' he commented.
</P>
<P>
   According to France, the networks will retain ``full control of
the editorial content. They will also be in charge of production,''
although they are expected to work with NASCAR on new technology to
improve racing telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The exact method for distributing the television money has not
been worked out in detail. Generally, NASCAR will get 10 percent,
the tracks 65 percent and the drivers 25 percent. But the 65
percent going to the tracks will not be shared equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daytona 500, which is our Super Bowl, will get more than
the others, and we're working on a formula which will include TV
ratings, purse size, attendance and about 30 other things that will
determine how much each race gets,'' Cary said.
</P>
<P>
   Cary said that all races will be carried in their entirety
regardless of rain delays or other problems. ``In most cases, the
networks will carry the race from start to finish,'' Cary
commented. ``In some instances, a particular race might be switched
to the network's cable partner for the conclusion, but the complete
race will be shown.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Showers and a few thunderstorms will develop across the
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on Friday as moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico streams northward and intercepts a cold front.
Showers will produce brief downpours in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, lighter rains will dampen parts of the lower Ohio
Valley and central Great Lakes as the availability of moisture
decreases along the northern flank of the front. Meanwhile, showers
of rain or snow will fall across parts of the upper Mississippi
River Valley as cold, moist air wraps west-southwestward around a
low pressure system centered over Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Very mild air will surge into the upper Ohio River Valley ahead
of the cold front as increasing winds from the south build to
speeds averaging 15 to 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle or light rain will speckle parts of the Southeast as
moist winds from the Atlantic press inland across parts of
northeast Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. Farther south, moist
ocean winds will fuel isolated showers and thundershowers near the
east-central and southeast coasts of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will douse parts of the Pacific Northwest as moist ocean
winds persist in the wake of a cool front. Rainfalls will be
enhanced in places, particularly in northern California, where a
jet stream disturbance trailing the front works in tandem with the
lay of the land to lift arriving Pacific air. Rainfalls will be
also augmented along west-facing slopes of the Washington and
Oregon Cascades as Pacific air is forced to ascend the sloping
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Lenny's Lessening
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Hurricane Lenny, armed with winds sustained at 135
mph, drifted toward St. Maarten in the British Virgin Islands. Near
the top of the ring of powerful thunderstorms that encircled the
eye, air flowed efficiently outward away from the center of the
storm, preventing any weighty build-up of air that might cause the
system to weaken. Yet Hurricane Lenny weakened anyway. Lenny's
lessening was caused by the hurricane itself, whose fierce winds
stirred Atlantic seas, allowing slightly cooler water to rise to
the sea surface. Cooler water, in turn, caused the storm to weaken.

`BODY ART': WHEN THE BODY IS AN ART GALLERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Body art: Marks of Identity,'' which opens Saturday
at the American Museum of Natural History, is a transparent effort
on the part of a family-style institution to heat up its image and
pull in a fresh audience, one that probably couldn't care less
about large, extinct reptiles with tiny brains.
</P>
<P>
   The theme is personal adornment of the most intimate kind,
usually applied directly onto or into the skin. The exhibition _
smart, extremely entertaining and assembled in record time _ is
geared to the current fashion-as-art vogue. The packed installation
offers just enough bare, multicultural flesh to inspire viewer
rubbernecking, without actually being an adults-only affair.
</P>
<P>
   Most interesting, though, is the way the show, organized by Enid
Schildkraut, brings art and anthropology seamlessly together. Not
so long ago, one would have been hard put to find a major museum
exhibition in which Greek vases and African sculptures, ethnic
postcards and Indian miniatures, Victorian corsets and Amazonian
nose-plugs got equal time. But they get it here, no problem, and
all in the interest of looking at what people do to their bodies,
and why.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The ``why'' is important. Critical, questioning histories of
fashion are few, but ``Body Art,'' with its cultural breadth and
anthropological bias, at least suggests directions they might take.
</P>
<P>
   The show acknowledges fashion's universal feel-good appeal, but
also its tendency to reinforce hierarchies of superiority and
inferiority along lines of class, wealth and power. It celebrates
fashion's formal inventiveness, but also sees it as a language of
ideas and ideals, in which attitudes _ toward life, sex, age, death
_ as well as cosmological speculations are expressed. Fortunately,
the exhibition approaches such abstract concepts entirely through
concrete things.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And specific techniques for bodily alteration are the subject of
its opening section.
</P>
<P>
   Certain methods, like the use of makeup or shaping through
pressure, are more or less superficial. Effects of the latter are
documented in a 19th-century painting of a Northwest Indian woman
with a flattened forehead, and again, further on, in an early
20th-century field photograph of an African chief with a bound and
dramatically elongated skull topped by a stylish woven hat.
</P>
<P>
   Tattooing introduces invasive procedures and pain, though a 1913
painting by the British artist George Burchett of his flamboyantly
ornamented wife, Edith, could hardly be cheerier. Burchett was
known in his day as the ``King of Tattooists.'' (He was also
tattooist to kings: George V of England was a client). He made his
wife his masterpiece, and she appears here, all smiles, and
covered, indelibly, with butterflies, Crucifixion scenes and
patriotic flags.
</P>
<P>
   Piercing comes next, seen in the figure of a ceramic warrior
from ancient Ecuador who wears spool earrings and a big nose ring.
The ensemble looks impressive, but it's actually fairly
conservative. Other elite males in his culture routinely pierced
their lips, chests, foreheads and chins, and embedded gemstones in
their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's scarification, produced by cutting into the
skin and applying or inserting substances that raised permanent
welts. A male figure on a ceremonial stool from Papua, New Guinea
offers the first illustration of the technique in the show, but
there are many others, including an exquisite African Luba
sculpture of a seated woman holding a divination bowl, her arms
delicately incised.
</P>
<P>
   After this introductory material comes an overview of body art's
ancient history, sketched out in cosmetic pots from Dynastic Egypt,
dainty gold tweezers from Peru and a pair of clay female figurines
from Costa Rica marked with tattoo-like patterns. With their
kewpie-doll faces, they might be taken for toys. In fact, they are
thought to represent shamans of immense power.
</P>
<P>
   The whole question of the perception and misperception of
cultural values, beauty among them, is, naturally, at the center of
this globe-spanning exhibition. And it is tackled head-on in the
jumble of prints, paintings and postcards that make up the thematic
section called ``Representation.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The earliest book in English on body art, ``Man Transformed or,
the Artificial Changeling'' (1650), by the London doctor John
Bulwer, is here; it treats the phenomenon as morally repugnant.
Later accounts of European voyages to Africa and the Americas are
often less censorious; they tend to see their ornamented subjects
as both freakish and fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   And there are stories of travelers who were body art devotees. A
19th-century Englishman, John Rutherford, apparently became a kind
of Charles Saatchi of the South Pacific. He avidly collected Maori
and Polynesian tattoos and displayed his acquisitions on his
person.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The marked, pierced or otherwise self-altered human form has
always evoked an attraction-repulsion response in the
body-conflicted West. It has often been cited as scientific
``proof'' of racial inferiority and used as an ingredient in ethnic
stereotypes. But body art has also been viewed as exotically
amusing, alluring, even sexy, and has been responsible for some
lucrative, if marginal, show business careers, as this exhibition
points out.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for example, Major Horace Ridler, a circus performer
known to his fans in the 1930s as ``The Great Omi.'' He had
zebra-stripe tattoos, could lift anvils by his nose-ring and, when
not on the road, took up residence at Ripley's ``Believe it or
Not'' Odditorium in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Broadbent, according to an exhibition label, was the most
photographed ``tattooed lady'' of the 20th century. A Ringling
Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey trooper, she provided wholesome
entertainment. (She had a Madonna and Child emblazoned on her
back.) And her political tastes were ecumenical; she wore a tattoo
of Charles Lindbergh astutely placed on her right leg, and one of
Pancho Villa on her left.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition branches off in several directions after this
point, each exploring and elaborating various themes. The notion of
body art as a socio-economic indicator comes across in contemporary
photographs by Sandi Fellman of body-suit-style Japanese tattoos.
The gorgeous floral and figurative designs look sumptuously regal,
but were once worn only by lower class men, who were forbidden by
law to own decorative clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In many cultures, transitional stages of life are visually
advertised; scars made during initiations in Africa and auspicious
patterns painted in henna on the hands of an Indian bride are
examples included here. And occasionally the body is given a new,
different, transcendant identity through art, as in the case of men
in Tierra del Fuego, seen in haunting turn-of-the-century
photographs, who transformed themselves into spirits with all-over
body paint.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, while body art has died out under Western
influence in many non-Western cultures, it has recently taken on
highly inventive forms in the West itself, as one sees in a series
of recent studio photographs by Bettina Witteveen. One of Ms.
Witteveen's sitters, identified as Jon of Manhattan, displays
pierced and elongated earlobes, eyebrow rings, extensive tattoos
and a cylinder passed through the nose, in a super-eclectic,
postmodern style known as ``neo-tribal.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The results certainly look avant garde. But such things change
fast. Two decades ago, if a man wore an earring, no matter how
inconspicuous, he had to watch where he walked. Now piercings of
every description can be spotted in any suburban high school. Could
ornamental scarification be the next Western frontier, cosmetically
speaking? Maybe, but it could also be yesterday's news five years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever form it takes, body art is here to stay, so the
American Museum of Natural History is on to something. And although
there are dozens of other exhibitions inside this one screaming to
get out _ one for each of the cultures represented, in fact _ the
museum has broken important ground, done so with aplomb, and made
itself look sexy in the process. And that's pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Body Art: Marks of Identity'' opens Saturday at the American
Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, and
remains on view through May 29.

A LEGACY OF PRIDE MORE THAN PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Aston Martin's origins date to 1913, when Lionel Martin began
racing souped-up Singer sports cars in amateur competitions.
Success in events at Aston Hill, Hertfordshire, led to the
selection of the company name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lagonda side is even older. Its founder, Thomas Gunn,
produced a power bicycle in 1898 before moving on to motorcycles
and grand touring cars. The name is derived from a stream in
Springfield, Ohio, that Gunn recalled from time he spent in Ohio in
his childhood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aston Martin and Lagonda enjoyed enviable reputations among
Britain's fast set between the wars, but neither was a commercial
success. Both had fallen on hard times by 1947, when they were
snapped up by David Brown, an industrialist who had made enough
money out of tractors to indulge his passion for fast cars and auto
racing. (Brown's initials are the ``DB'' in the model names of many
Aston Martin cars.) Brown's investment paid off in 1959 when Aston
Martin's DBR1/300 won the World Sports Car Championship.
</P>
<P>
   But racing success did not put Aston Martin on a sound financial
footing. After years of selling cars below what they cost to make,
Brown gave up and sold the company in 1971. A series of hopeful or
hopeless owners passed through before Ford took its initial 75
percent share in 1987. That was increased to 100 percent seven
years later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lagonda brand is dormant, and is likely to remain so. It
will be enough of a challenge to sell Aston Martin as a credible
alternative to Ferrari.

CATHOLIC BISHOPS URGE MEMBERS TO CHERISH ELDERLY 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's Roman Catholic bishops urged their 61
million members Thursday to see the nation's growing elderly
population as valuable and active participants in church life.
</P>
<P>
   Closing their four-day national session at the Capitol Hill
Hyatt Regency Hotel, the bishops said the United States is a
graying nation. It must revere its elders and ``grapple with the
social, economic and spiritual implications'' of an aging populace,
the bishops said in the pastoral letter ``Blessings of Age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the 20th century, one in every 25 people
in the United States was 65 or older,'' the bishops said. ``Today
one in eight _ a total of 33.2 million Americans _ is at least 65.
A person who reaches 65 can expect to live for 17 more years; many
live well beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2030, 20 percent of Americans will be over 65, according to
the letter. ``Society still values youth over age, doing over
being, individualism over the common good, and independence over
interdependence,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Because stereotypes about aging persist, new responses are
needed, the letter adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope through this pastoral message that we will be able to
energize the people in our own parishes throughout the country to
become very much interested in the plight of old people and the
great resource that they are to us today,'' said Bishop Joseph A.
Fiorenza, head of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston and president of
the bishops' conference.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by a bishops' committee on laity in collaboration with
the conference's Committee on Women in the Church and Society, the
letter speaks to older persons, to their offspring and to their
caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   It urges younger people and caregivers to the elderly to provide
repsectful care, but seek assistance and not bear that burden
alone. It suggests the elderly accept that aging may mean being
more dependent. It notes that many older people to turn to faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you now have the time and the space to reflect more
deeply and to act with greater moral grounding and vision,'' the
letter states, adding that ``facing one's own mortality means
recognizing that death is part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops function as top policy-makers for the American
church. The bishops issued the letter at this session because the
United Nations has designated 1999 as ``The International Year of
Older Persons.'' Pope John Paul II, 79, recently issued a letter
directed to the elderly. And the Vatican has urged Catholics to
``make a new commitment not only to care for older persons but to
learn from them,'' the bishops said.
</P>
<P>
   Closing the national session, the bishops also adopted a
pastoral message on charity, calling for a partnership between
government and private sectors to meet human need. That letter
notes that 13.3 percent of Americans live below the poverty line.

Reagan barely hit double figures _ well after leaving the White

publication of dueling tomes (including one from ``Passages''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOXHAM, England _ What speck in Ferrari's rear-view mirror _
could it be a fancy Ford?
</P>
<P>
   After decades on the side roads, Aston Martin Lagonda, the
high-performance automaker owned by Ford, is back on track and
bearing down fast. Over four years, it plans to bring out two new
models, build them with advanced materials and new techniques, open
another factory, recruit a lot more dealers and quadruple in size.
</P>
<P>
   The dowdy company will surely be gasping for breath; it has
experienced no changes so sweeping in its 86-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the mindset of Aston Martin was, until recently, firmly
stuck in 1959 _ the one year it beat Ferrari to win the World
Sports Car Championship. Then, like many an English aristocrat, it
settled into an existence of genteel poverty and happy memories. It
had class, but no cash.
</P>
<P>
   That is changing. Ford's strategy is to turn Aston Martin into a
globally recognized British alternative to Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking is this: As an automotive benchmark for technology,
performance, prestige and exclusivity, Ferrari has had a halo
effect on Fiat, its parent, and on Italy as a whole. In theory,
Aston Martin could likewise buff the image of both Ford and the
faded British auto industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari has had few serious rivals for most of its existence,
and Ford executives say it is time to change that. So do
Volkswagen, which has acquired Bugatti, another high-end name built
on earlier triumphs; Audi, with its new Lamborghini subsidiary, and
Mercedes-Benz, which is bringing out a very sophisticated roadster,
the SLR, that is likely to be priced around $275,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy automobile aficionados will have a lot of places to put
their money in the next few years. ``All this is brilliant news for
the customer,'' said Aston Martin chairman Bob Dover in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Aston Martin was slow to pick up the pace after Ford bought
control in 1987. Within two years, Ford also acquired Jaguar, which
was soon losing $1.5 million a day. Overnight, the needs of little
Aston Martin were insignificant in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, five years after Ford took charge, Aston Martin made
only 42 cars. Two years later, it introduced its first all-new
model in 27 years, the supercharged six-cylinder DB7. Since 1995,
it has regularly made about 700 cars a year _ a lot by its own
standards, but only a fifth of Ferrari's output.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Reitzle, group vice president of Ford's Premier
Automotive Group and the man who is now ultimately responsible for
Aston Martin, said the brand is ``a little too exclusive.'' He sees
Aston Martin as a laboratory on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look for high-tech solutions, but will always combine
that with understatement, style and bespoke individual
craftsmanship,'' he said. The latest DB7 Vantage is an indication
of what Reitzle has in mind. It is a svelte coupe ($140,000) or
convertible ($150,000) with undeniably firm muscle tone, thanks to
a mighty 6-liter V12 engine that pumps out 420 horsepower. The
DB7's six-cylinder engine _ adapted from a Jaguar design _ is still
available, but Aston Martin's future revolves around the new V12
and its future derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   The DB7 is just the beginning. In a year, the company will
introduce a production version of a show car, the Project Vantage,
which will replace the V-cars _ large, dated, V8-powered
gas-guzzlers that are no longer sold in North America, though their
replacements will be. While Project Vantage looks like a DB7 after
a steroid overdose, the real difference is its construction, a
combination of carbon fiber, other composite materials and aluminum
in sheet and honeycomb form. It will weigh 2,200 pounds less than
the V-cars, a hefty 40 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a third model, probably ready for introduction in
2002. Right now, its looks, layout and performance are being
defined, but it is likely to be the model that brings the big
increase in sales volume that Ford expects, thanks to a
comparatively low sticker price. Limited production capacity at
Aston Martin's twin factories northwest of London, near its
headquarters at Newport Pagnell and here in Oxfordshire make a
third plant almost inevitable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dover's strategy calls for 3,000 annual sales, a level at which
he says Aston Martin can be financially self-sufficient, and it
will need to be after Ford has underwritten its ambitious expansion
plan. Ford paid a pittance for Aston Martin _ believed to be about
$30 million _ but it has invested an estimated $800 million in the
company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aston Martin is being given the sort of top-to-toe makeover that
revived Jaguar. Money went into the acquisition of the factory
here, where DB7s are made, and into the modernization of Newport
Pagnell, where the next new model will be built.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul goes deeper than cars and plants. Aston Martin is
introducing Japanese methods of continuous improvement, called
kaizen, throughout the company. Teams of employees videotape and
time production tasks and later discuss ways to improve them _ a
process that would have been unimaginable a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, though, Aston Martin has to find a lot
more customers. Ford reckons there are enough wealthy buffs who
recall Aston Martin's heritage _ and its starring role in early
James Bond movies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While an Aston Martin is still an obscure and expensive object
of desire, Jaguar's turnaround shows what Ford can achieve. And
Aston Martin's supporters have no doubt that the marque has strong
appeal. Alan Baker, manager of an Aston Martin dealership in the
Mayfair district of London, says his customers buy DB7s because of
the way they perform and the way they look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's the image,'' he said. ``You're immediately
considered to be a gentleman if you drive an Aston Martin.''

past 12 months, it's been like somebody switched on a light,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Internet evangelists, including Scott McNealy,
chairman of Sun Microsystems, forecast that simple devices will
replace personal computers in performing a host of online
activities. McNealy has long been fiercely opposed to Microsoft,
the industry revenue leader, and its dominant Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``My one-and-a-half-year-old can operate a set-top box,''
McNealy said in a convention keynote speech. ``He still hasn't
mastered Windows NT.''
</P>
<P>
   After the laughter and applause died down, McNealy added:
``These new devices are so easy that you won't have to worry
whether your kid is computer literate, unless he's sitting in front
of a PC. There will be sensors on everything. And cameras
everywhere. And that's a good thing, unless you're doing something
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ZuluTV, a small company based in Portsmouth, N.H., that made its
first appearance at Comdex this year, reflects the trends that
Chambers and McNealy cited. Beginning early next year, the firm
plans to market a simple device linked to its Internet service
portal that allows anyone to become an instant daily TV
broadcaster. For example, a ``videographer'' could film a wedding
ceremony that could be watched on the Internet in real time by
distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The book-sized $2,500 ZuluTV device attaches to any camcorder. A
computer isn't required. Batteries and a fast wireless link to the
Internet make the system fully portable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not about technology,'' said Joseph Smith, the
company's president and founder. ``It's all about content. People
with fast Internet links will be able to watch videos of the same
quality now offered by cable outlets and the networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ZuluTV, other Internet devices shown at Comdex need a
high-speed connection, known as ``broadband,'' to perform
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband is the hottest topic by far at Comdex,'' Smith said.
But, he warned, it's ``going to be a lot slower in its rollout to
mass users than a lot of people here are hoping or.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not alone in sensing a ``digital divide,'' as he put
it, that still makes it uneconomical for Internet service providers
to roll out broadband to the home. ``It's also too complex for some
users to install and too expensive for others,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take a look at where we'll be in three or four years,
perhaps a billion people will be connected to the Internet
globally. But perhaps 900 million of them still will be dialing up.
The penetration is just not going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   While such key industry figures as Eric Benhamou, chairman of
3Com Corp., the world's leading modem maker, tout the potential
benefits of high bandwidths that offer rich video services, the
company's Comdex flier takes a more sober approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of computer users in home and home offices rely on
56K analog modems as their primary connection to the Internet _ 96
percent more than any other other Internet access technology,''
3Com reports.
</P>
<P>
   It was to address the slow emergence of broadband that the
Federal Communications Commission on Thursday required local
telephone companies to share their lines with businesses that want
to offer high-speed Internet connections to customers.

 &HT;    COMDEX REPORT: INTERNET DOMINATES ALL, BUT SLOW LINKS PERSIST
 &HT;    Moving in (a) national and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The Comdex computer trade show offers plenty of
evidence that the industry's future depends largely on high-speed
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But for many ordinary home users and mobile phone customers, the
wondrous services promised by these fast links to cyberspace may
prove slow in coming.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, virtually unknown a decade ago, dominated nearly
every public forum and many private talks at the Comdex show.
Visitors stood patiently in long queues to go on line for free at
hundreds of computer kiosks provided by Novell Inc., a networking
software firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every company in every industry is in a state of transition,''
Cisco Systems president John Chambers told a packed house. ``In the
past 24 months, people have really gotten into it, and during the
past 12 months, it's been like somebody switched on a light,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Internet evangelists, including Scott McNealy,

IN A VIOLENT TIME, A LITTLE LIGHT DISPELS MUCH DARKNESS

 &HT;    
 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A friend commented on some of the recent highly publicized
shootings: ``There is really nothing we can do. My kids go to
school and are exposed to random searches for weapons. The Post
Office is not a safe place. Shootings occur in the work areas. Even
the churches, synagogues and day care centers are subject to
shootings.''
 &HT;    His remarks made me wonder. What is happening to our great
country? What can I do about the situation? How depressing this is.
 &HT;    Then I thought of the good things that may take place because of
the bad things. Let me quote the famous psychiatrist, Viktor
Frankl:
 &HT;    ``I can see beyond the misery of the situation to the potential
for discovering a meaning behind it, and thus to turn an apparently
meaningless suffering into a genuine human achievement.
 &HT;    ``I am convinced that, in the final analysis, there is no
situation that does not contain within it the seed of a meaning.''
 &HT;    My family is no stranger to acts of senseless violence. When my
cousin's son was shot dead in a drugstore some years ago I was
devastated.
 &HT;    Soon after, in 1994, another relative, 16-year-old Ari
Halberstam, was shot dead as he traveled in a van with other young
divinity students.
 &HT;    His assailant, a Lebanese immigrant, claimed to have suffered
war trauma while being attacked in a Lebanese refugee camp. He had
purchased a gun through the mail. His act of savage violence and
mayhem on the Jewish students earned him a sentence of 141 years in
prison.
 &HT;    Recently, Mrs. Devorah Halberstam introduced a bill, nicknamed
``Ari's Bill,'' into the Assembly of the State of New York. The
bill states that no gun kit can be sold through the mail and it
would put teeth into gun-trafficking laws between states.
 &HT;    Devorah is my first cousin and the mother of Ari, who was killed
in that senseless attack.
 &HT;    She took her tragedy, a real meaningless suffering, to try to
accomplish something for the rest of our citizens. How much misery
could be averted if guns were not so readily available?
 &HT;    Devorah has now embarked on a second venture, a new museum for
Jewish children. It will promote harmony, cultural awareness and
tolerance. Ari's life will continue through the children visiting
the museum. His memory will be celebrated through other living
children.
 &HT;    There are others who have risen above misery to find ways to
celebrate the good. For example, take my take good friend Yaakov, a
veteran of wars between the Israelis and Arabs.
 &HT;    He is proud that all through his military duty he was always
able to find the bright side of things. Once, he and his company
were grounded for a long period at the Suez Canal. Almost every day
the Egyptians launched howitzer attacks. The Israeli soldiers,
situated on the Israeli side, either fired back or retreated into
their bunkers for safety.
 &HT;    After a few months of this give and take, the soldiers were at
their wits' end. The holiday of Chanukah was approaching and the
men missed their families.
 &HT;    At Chanukah a candelabra -- menorah -- was needed but none of
the men had one. Not one menorah could be found. It was a very
depressing evening. Suddenly Yaakov came up with a brilliant idea.
Why not take the spent shells and set them up as menorahs for the
holiday. The men passed their novel ideal around.
 &HT;    Menorahs of shell casings were filled with gasoline and rag
wicks were soon burning brightly throughout the military area.
Menorahs everywhere! Imagine turning objects of destruction into
symbols of peace.
 &HT;    None of us look for suffering. However, if we are exposed to it,
then, we need to turn suffering into human achievement.
 &HT;    Our response to the shootings should be to make this world a
safer and better place.
 &HT;    Chanukah celebrates the miracle of the Jewish revolution against
the Greek occupation and religious persecution. This took place in
Israel 165 B.C.E.
 &HT;    A handful of Jewish freedom fighters, called Maccabees, waged a
successful war for religious freedom. When the temple was
reclaimed, services were reinstituted. The main menorah, a seven
stick candelabra, was kindled. Miraculously, the flames burned for
eight days without being replenished with oil, hence the festival
became known as the Festival of Lights.
 &HT;    During Chanukah we give thanks to God for the miraculous time.
This year the first night of Chanukah will be Friday, December 3.
 &HT;    Remember the message of Chanukah and the Chanukah lights turning
misery into miraculous times. A little light dispels much darkness.

HOW ABOUT FILMING A FILM ABOUT FILMMAKING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milwaukee's Mark Borchardt looks like a guy who'd ask you for
money, and he does a lot of asking in ``American Movie,'' a slyly
amusing documentary about independent filmmaking. Borchardt hits up
relatives to raise the $3,000 he'll need to produce his magnum
opus, a black-and-white epic called ``Northwestern.'' When that
falls through, he turns to an earlier project, a gory and grainy
short called ``Coven'' (pronounced, in this case, coh-ven).
Borchardt's efforts to make ``Coven'' become the focus of
``American Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Borchardt is a study in contradictions. He's smart but
misguided, charmingly persuasive but prone to obnoxious bullying.
He has a knack for dime-store philosophy but has little sense of
irony; much of ``American Movie's'' humor comes from Borchardt's
dead seriousness. You have to admire Borchardt for pursuing his
dream, but you have to wonder why he doesn't realize that a steady
job would solve most of his problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Movie'' director Chris Smith has his own set of
contradictions, but he uses them to his advantage. Smith flirts
with condescension and sometimes succumbs, especially with
Borchardt's amiably burned-out buddy Mike Schank and his cranky,
barely lucid Uncle Bill. But Smith covers his own behind by making
his film increasingly serious; he's obviously on Borchardt's side,
and he lets you know just what ``Coven'' means to the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Schank _ an acid casualty who's a walking ad for Partnership for
a Drug Free America _ observes at one point that you can't have an
idea unless someone else has had it first. As fuzzy as that logic
is, it's key to ``American Movie:'' Smith, a better filmmaker than
Borchardt, wouldn't have a film if Borchardt weren't so driven.
Smith has shown where his heart is by urging that ``Coven'' be
shown at festivals and by selling the short through his own Web
site (www.americanmovie.com). But Smith's movie is the one getting
the buzz; Borchardt's best bet at fame is persuading Smith to film
a sequel.

SHOCK AND HORROR PERMEATE A&AMP;M CAMPUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M University students and
faculty watched in horror all day Thursday as one of their proudest
traditions descended into tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is just walking around with their heads hanging
down,'' said freshman Michelle Evans of Corpus Christi. ``It's real
somber. It's completely different from what it is supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans and her boyfriend, sophomore Randy Sullivan, watched as
rescue crews meticulously unstaked a 35-foot edifice of logs
erected for the bonfire before the annual Thanksgiving football
game against the University of Texas-Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 3 a.m. Thursday, the log pile shifted as dozens
of students worked all-night shifts atop stacks of wood on the A&AMP;M
polo fields. The top logs crashed to the ground, killing at least
nine students and injuring 28 others.
</P>
<P>
   Although classes were not officially canceled, the tragedy
gripped the 43,000-student campus and dominated an otherwise
pleasant Thursday morning. The sprawling polo fields, a giant
meadow normally used for pickup ball games and other gatherings,
was filled with clusters of onlookers, media trucks, emergency
vehicles and construction cranes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to both of my classes, but we didn't do anything but _
well, we started with a prayer,'' said Sullivan, who pinned a white
ribbon on his shirt in honor of the victims. ``Then the profs just
told us to go home and try to deal with it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Students Tommy Balez of San Antonio and David Conner of Houston
dealt with it by continuing to man a shack where bonfire-building
volunteers take charge of the chain saws and axes used to cut the
thousands of logs that the bonfire requires. Balez and Conner were
at the station early Thuursday morning when the pile collapsed
about 100 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear people yelling for help, and we all started
running out there, trying to do anything we could,'' said Balez, an
electrical engineering major.
</P>
<P>
   Balez and Conner said the bonfire, a tradition started to
demonstrate the Aggies' ``burning desire'' to beat Texas, has long
been a unifying activity for Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the things that makes A&AMP;M what it is,'' Conner
said. ``We honor our traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   On the polo fields and throughout the university that dominates
the Brazos Valley region, students huddled in small groups,
exchanging hugs and using cell phones to contact their folks at
home.
</P>
<P>
   At a campus snack bar called Pie Are Squared, students huddled
around a TV set to catch around-the-clock coverage by local
stations. Although notebooks and textbooks were open on many
tables, few students were paying them much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother called me up at 5 o'clock this morning, asking
me if I was all right,'' said Shawn Sams, a freshman biology major.
``I didn't know what she was talking about. When she told me, it
blew me away.''
</P>
<P>
   University switchboards were flooded with such calls, prompting
officials to establish a toll-free hot line for parents and other
family members to check on students.
</P>
<P>
   University President Ray Bowen called the accident ``probably
the single worst thing that has ever happened on our campus.''
</P>
<P>
   He said scores of counselors, both from the university and from
as far away as the Metroplex, were on hand to help students deal
with events.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on the grounds by 4:30 this morning, helping however
they could,'' Bowen said. ``I'm no psychologist, but I think the
kids now don't recognize that they need counseling. But when you
see kids just sitting staring at the wall or doing nothing, they'll
(counselors) move in. Right now, I think they are out there
trolling for students who need help.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, YELTSIN CLASH AT EUROPEAN SECURITY SUMMIT OVER CHECHNYA
 &HT;    With CLINTON-YELTSIN-1119.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ President Clinton and Russian leader Boris
Yeltsin clashed Thursday over Moscow's bloody military campaign in
Chechnya, where two months of air strikes have left thousands dead.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Clinton to allow Western mediators to try to broker
peace in Chechnya, Yeltsin resisted, agreeing only to permit a
fact-finding mission into the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin warned, though, that he would not negotiate with
separatist rebels he regards as terrorists. He challenged his
critics to identify negotiating parties he considers legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Yeltsin vowed, he would press forward with air
strikes that have killed an estimated 4,000 Chechen civilians and
driven 200,000 more from their homes since August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be under any illusions on this score. There will
be no negotiations with bandits and murderers,'' Yeltsin said. ``We
need to eliminate the bandit formations and to eliminate the
terrorists, or bring them to court.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin addressed his remarks to Clinton and four dozen other
heads of state attending a meeting of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. The OSCE summit was dominated by
discussion of how the group might help to end the conflict in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels there are fighting for independence from the Russian
Federation that Yeltsin governs. He regards them as a terrorist
organization that has exploded bombs in Russian cities _ killing
hundreds _ and kidnapped Russian civilians and visiting executives
to bring pressure on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a wave of criticism from OSCE members, Yeltsin lashed
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to criticize Russia for Chechnya,'' Yeltsin
fumed. ``Russia, as well as the other members of the OSCE, today
particularly needs a respectful dialogue, not mutual reproaches or
sermonizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sharp rhetoric, Yeltsin agreed to a minimalist
measure, saying he would invite the current OSCE chairman, Knut
Vollebaek, to visit Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Vollebaek's
visit, as yet unscheduled, would give the United States and its
allies ``a foot in the door'' toward peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   There was no disguising U.S. frustration, though, over the
OSCE's inability to halt, or even to slow, the onslaught Moscow has
unleashed on the people of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to oversell this,'' Albright told reporters
Thursday. ``I think that we accomplished a lot. But this is a
longer-term problem, and I think that we need to keep pushing it
along.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step, she said, is for the OSCE to try to put together
a credible group of Chechens who have influence among rebel groups
yet can been regarded as legitimate negotiating partners for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not easy to identify them,'' Albright conceded. ``But I
think there has to be an effort made to do so. And that, I think,
is what has been missing, is really looking for people that can
legitimately negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   The 54-member OSCE groups the United States and its Western
allies with former Soviet republics and satellite states.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the speeches, Clinton and Yeltsin held a
private 45-minute meeting, much of which centered on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very vigorous and so was I,'' Clinton told reporters
after the meeting. ``We have a very good personal chemistry, but it
didn't stop us from our clear disagreement here.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen officials claim that several thousand civilians have
been either killed or wounded in bombing Clinton has assailed as
``indiscriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Clinton and Yeltsin met, the Russian flew back to
Moscow, leaving behind his Foreign Minister Igor Ivanoff to
represent Russia at the summit. It concludes here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, signed as a witness to a pair of agreements in
support of two pipelines that, if built, will be able to carry huge
volumes of crude oil and natural gas from the Caspian Sea to the
Mediterranean via Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The pipelines would strip Russia of its monopoly control over
transporting Caspian oil to U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This enhances our energy security,'' said U.S. Secretary of
Energy Bill Richardson. ``It ensures that the West has secure and
stable pipelines.''
</P>
<P>
   All existing pipelines leading from the Caspian flow either
through Russia or to Iran, which is forbidden from selling oil to
the United States under sanctions stretching back 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton leaves Istanbul Friday afternoon for a one-day visit to
Greece, where he hopes to advance planning for peace talks in New
York next month between ethnic Greek and Turkish leaders on the
divided island republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton goes to Florence, Italy, on Saturday on the next leg of
a swing through southeast Europe that will take him to Bulgaria and
then Kosovo before he returns to Washington next Tuesday night.

their burned-out houses from the bitter cold. Food supplies also

called Uighers, they protest Beijing's grasp on their resources and
autocratic rule in mostly quiet ways _ setting their clocks back
two hours to ``real'' time instead of Beijing time, as the Chinese
nearly 2,000 miles away have dictated, or by boycotting Chinese
restaurants. The radical fringes of the 8 million Uighurs continue
waging a hit-and-run campaign of violence from the base of an
underground Islamic party, which is Beijing's number one priority

Vietnam's Christian population is unclear, although the country of

fourth trip to this country _ was to address challenges to the
Catholic Church in the Americas, the most Catholic region in the
world. Mexico is considered a geographic powerhouse for the Vatican
because it is a bridge between South America and North America,
where the church is concerned about the spread of materialism and
secularism. And Mexico, whose Catholic population is second only to
Brazil in number, is home to the Basilica of the Virgin of

JESSE JACKSON IS WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson is having trouble drumming
up support for his crusade to make martyrs out of six black
students expelled from a Decatur, Ill., high school for leading a
violent brawl at a football game that terrified hundreds of others
in the stands. Good.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has a long history of leading noble causes and breaking
down racial barriers. It is painful to criticize him. But this time
he's got it all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He is leading demonstrations in defense of the six teenagers
with the argument that their punishment was excessive. He insists
he does not see this as a racial issue, but of course he does.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is that the facts do not fit his rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the fight has been shown repeatedly on
television. It is clear that this was not an ordinary fist fight,
as Jackson claims, but, as the school board insists, an action in
which several teen-agers pursued others, beating up on fleeing and
cringing figures until police moved in. The fury of the scene was
horrifying, even from the comfort of my living room.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also claims that the brutal six are victims of a general
``national intolerance of our kids'' born of the Columbine High
School killings and other recent episodes of school violence. He
constantly falls back on racial inferences, although of 1,700
students disciplined in the past two years by the Decatur school,
Eisenhower High, 700 were white.
</P>
<P>
   The school had recently instituted a zero-tolerance policy
similar to those now found in four out of five high schools across
the country. It imposes penalties on students who fight or
intimidate teachers and other students. It may be tough, but it
also seems to be generally working to restore order to the chaos of
undisciplined schools.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Jackson demonstrates no similar concern for the
safety and security of the peaceful majority of students who
deserve a right to attend school events without fear. Or that he
has shown no concern for the fact that his demonstrations forced
the school to close, disrupting the education of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   He really lost it, however, when he compared Eisenhower's
strict-discipline policy to the official racial segregation that
spawned the civil rights movement. ``Decatur is not so far from
Selma (Ala.)'' Jackson thundered. ``The schools are 48 percent
black and brown. The teachers and the school board are 90 percent
white.''
</P>
<P>
   This is pure demagoguery, unworthy of Jackson's stature as a
genuine civil rights leader. The Selma march was in a noble cause.
Going easy on six teenage thugs who beat up on defenseless
acquaintances is not a noble cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led the march in Selma to bring
down the legal state barriers that kept blacks from voting and
gaining equal access to jobs, education, public places and economic
opportunities. He transformed American society and saved its soul.
</P>
<P>
   Niger Innis, a spokesman for the Congress of Racial Equality,
was right when he protested Jackson's ``drawing racial lines in the
sand ... There are two winners here: Jesse Jackson for the media
coverage and attention he gets, and the local KKK. Everybody else
loses, including those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   By demanding a slap on the wrist instead of serious penalties
for the brawlers, Jackson is giving their fate more importance than
he gives school discipline and the rights of the other students.
``Work with them, not just eliminate them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Troubled kids deserve our help, but not if it endangers
untroubled kids.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson refused to let up after the school board reduced the six
students' punishment from a two-year expulsion, which did seem
usually harsh, to one year with permission to attend an alternative
school. He escalated his demands, insisting the students be
promptly returned to Eisenhower High.
</P>
<P>
   And he filed a lawsuit seeking $5 million for each student,
alleging that their privacy was violated because officials revealed
that the group had collectively missed 350 days of school in recent
years and that some had repeated grades.
</P>
<P>
   They were, in fact, chronic truants whose sudden desire for a
serious, uninterrupted education represents a jarring personality
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is ridiculous, but it will be costly to the
taxpayers and the school system, which will have to hire lawyers to
defend its decisions. Officials retaliated by filing their own
lawsuit seeking an injunction barring Jackson and his supporters
from protesting near the school. The suit claims that he was
causing an unreasonable disruption of school functions.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has vowed to return to the schoolyard this weekend with
another demonstration. He was hauled off to jail earlier this week,
as he had planned, after a prior demonstration for which his
Rainbow Coalition and Operation Push bused in out-of-town
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   He has inevitably raised racial tensions in Decatur and stirred
up local resentment against non-residents by trying to tell the
schools how to operate. If he is out to discredit the popular
zero-tolerance policy, he is going about it the wrong way with the
wrong so-called victims. If he is merely out to help six students
in trouble, he is overdoing it. Enough already.

SHOCK AND HORROR PERMEATE A&AMP;M CAMPUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M University students and
faculty watched in horror all day Thursday as one of their proudest
traditions descended into tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is just walking around with their heads hanging
down,'' said freshman Michelle Evans of Corpus Christi. ``It's real
somber. It's completely different from what it is supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans and her boyfriend, sophomore Randy Sullivan, watched as
rescue crews meticulously unstaked a 35-foot edifice of logs
erected for the bonfire before the annual Thanksgiving week
football game against the University of Texas-Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 3 a.m. Thursday, the log pile shifted as dozens
of students worked all-night shifts atop stacks of wood on the A&AMP;M
polo fields. The top logs crashed to the ground, killing at least
nine students and injuring 28 others.
</P>
<P>
   Although classes were not officially canceled, the tragedy
gripped the 43,000-student campus and dominated an otherwise
pleasant Thursday morning. The sprawling polo fields, a giant
meadow normally used for pickup ball games and other gatherings,
was filled with clusters of onlookers, media trucks, emergency
vehicles and construction cranes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to both of my classes, but we didn't do anything but _
well, we started with a prayer,'' said Sullivan, who pinned a white
ribbon on his shirt in honor of the victims. ``Then the profs just
told us to go home and try to deal with it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Students Tommy Balez of San Antonio and David Conner of Houston
dealt with it by continuing to man a shack where bonfire-building
volunteers take charge of the chain saws and axes used to cut the
thousands of logs that the bonfire requires. Balez and Conner were
at the station early Thuursday morning when the pile collapsed
about 100 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear people yelling for help, and we all started
running out there, trying to do anything we could,'' said Balez, an
electrical engineering major.
</P>
<P>
   Balez and Conner said the bonfire, a tradition started to
demonstrate the Aggies' ``burning desire'' to beat Texas, has long
been a unifying activity for Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the things that makes A&AMP;M what it is,'' Conner
said. ``We honor our traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   On the polo fields and throughout the university that dominates
the Brazos Valley region, students huddled in small groups,
exchanging hugs and using cell phones to contact their folks at
home.
</P>
<P>
   At a campus snack bar called Pie Are Squared, students huddled
around a TV set to catch around-the-clock coverage by local
stations. Although notebooks and textbooks were open on many
tables, few students were paying them much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother called me up at 5 o'clock this morning, asking
me if I was all right,'' said Shawn Sams, a freshman biology major.
``I didn't know what she was talking about. When she told me, it
blew me away.''
</P>
<P>
   University switchboards were flooded with such calls, prompting
officials to establish a toll-free hot line for parents and other
family members to check on students.
</P>
<P>
   University President Ray Bowen called the accident ``probably
the single worst thing that has ever happened on our campus.''
</P>
<P>
   He said scores of counselors, both from the university and from
as far away as the Metroplex, were on hand to help students deal
with events.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on the grounds by 4:30 this morning, helping however
they could,'' Bowen said. ``I'm no psychologist, but I think the
kids now don't recognize that they need counseling. But when you
see kids just sitting staring at the wall or doing nothing, they'll
(counselors) move in. Right now, I think they are out there
trolling for students who need help.''

 &HT;    IN SPUR OF THE MOMENT, CLINTON DELIVERS DRAMATIC MESSAGE TO
YELTSIN
 &HT;    With CLINTON-OSCE-1119.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Sometimes history unfolds on the fly, even in
the most scripted of moments.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Russian leader Boris Yeltsin tell the rest of the
world to keep its nose out of Moscow's brutal military campaign in
Chechnya, President Clinton was struck by the irony of the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't this the guy, Clinton recalled, who captured the support
of the world and turned the tide of an anti-democratic coup in
August of 1991 by jumping on top of a tank in Moscow and shaking
his fist in the face of tyranny?
</P>
<P>
   What if the world had turned a deaf ear to Yeltsin's cause,
Clinton wondered, as he awaited his turn to speak Thursday before
his 53 counterparts from member states of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And so Clinton pulled out a pen and, in the few minutes
remaining, scribbled into his prepared speech what would become the
most dramatic passage of the day's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Yeltsin, one of the most thrilling experiences of my
life as a citizen of the world before I became president, was when
you stood up on that tank in Moscow, when they tried to take the
freedom of the Russian people away,'' Clinton began. ``Your
standing there on that tank said to those people, you can do this,
but you'll have to kill me first.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he continued, as nearly one-third of the world's leaders
sat listening in rapt silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had put you in jail instead of electing you president,
I would hope that every leader of every country around this table
would have stood up for you and for freedom in Russia and not said,
well, that is an internal Russian affair that we cannot be a part
of.''
</P>
<P>
   White House writers and policy experts spent weeks crafting
Clinton's speech. He told
</P>
<P>
   reporters that he added spur of the moment rhetoric to try to
convey a timeless notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose he hadn't prevailed. Suppose the Russian ... military
had taken him down off the tank, thrown him in jail and announced
they were going to execute him,'' Clinton said. ``I would hope that
the entire world represented around that OSCE table today would
have gone into an absolute uproar of outrage about it and would
have saved his life and helped restore democracy. That's the point
I was trying to make.''

BUSH WOULD CONTINUE ECONOMIC EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
said Thursday that he would continue economic pressure on Cuba to
end its totalitarian regime. But he suggested that he would not
make human rights a priority in most foreign trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, in a national television interview on CNN,
said he would avidly pursue ``free trade'' around the world, except
for Cuba, if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his first major foreign policy address, Bush drew
a distinction between trade with Cuba and with China, which he has
endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade with China will be trade between companies and
businesses, both large and small, on both sides,'' he said. ``I
know it's in our best interest to trade with the entrepreneurial
class in China. It will help spread freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade with Cuba is different, he added, because capital sent to
that island nation ``must go through the hands of the Fidel Castro
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to support the totalitarian regime of Fidel
Castro,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to Mr. Castro is: `Sure, we'll end the embargo, but
you must end political repression, you must have free elections,
you must free the prisoners and you must give democracy a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of human rights was broached by the CNN interviewer,
who asked the governor if special provisions should be included in
trade agreements to hold offending countries ``accountable'' for
employing ``slave labor'' or allowing poor environmental practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what the working people (in the United States) ought
to understand is that free trade will yield higher paying, higher
quality jobs in America,'' Bush responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the important lesson of free trade. In terms of whether
or not there ought to be agreements that burden the ability for our
world to trade freely, it depends on what's in them. But if these
are agreements that really try to undermine free trade, I'll resist
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush later added that the United States rejected slave labor ``a
long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's important to distinguish between what could
be reasonable discussions and laws or amendments that would tend to
undermine trade, which I will resist.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans generally oppose raising labor and
environmental issues in trade negotiations unless those matters
have some immediate bearing on trade.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the sharpest criticism of U.S. trade policy with
China has come from religious conservatives in the GOP's right
wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the human rights situation deteriorates in China, the last
thing the United States should support is China's admittance to the
World Trade Organization,'' said Bill Saunders, a senior fellow
with the Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council used to be headed by Gary Bauer, one of Bush's
right-wing opponents for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer opposes trade with China, while Bush praised an agreement
signed earlier this week to help pave the way for China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government is increasingly guilty of religious
persecution, forced abortions and victimization of political
dissidents and ethnic minorities,'' Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would we reward the government with economic security and
open trade? If we give China membership into the WTO, we lose
future leverage in fighting injustice in China, and we effectively
undermine the cause of democracy and freedom around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who plans to outline his foreign policy objectives in a
speech Friday in California, said it wasn't true that he was
``completely inexperienced'' in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of experience with the country of Mexico,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the North American Free Trade Agreement had benefited
Mexico as well as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helped Mexico to grow, particularly the northern part of
Mexico, a vibrant, strong economy,'' he said.

MITCHELL ASKS DISSIDENTS NOT TO BLOCK NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Former Sen. George Mitchell ended
his mediation effort Thursday with a plea to dissident politicians
not to block the plan it produced to end the deadlock stalling
progress in the Northern Ireland peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither side will get all it wanted and both will endure
severe political pain,'' he said. ``But there is no other way
forward. Prolonging the stalemate will leave this society uncertain
and vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   After 11 weeks of hard bargaining, the Mitchell mission this
week has put in place a series of incremental steps that hold the
promise of ending an impasse over paramilitary disarmament and
starting up the new Northern Ireland government envisioned in the
April 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan must be endorsed by the Ulster Unionists, and their
leader, David Trimble, faces the challenge of persuading a sizable
number of disaffected members to overcome their objections to
entering government with Sinn Fein, the political representatives
of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   In the most important development of the week, the IRA issued a
statement on Wednesday saying it would be willing for the first
time to discuss dismantling the arsenal of guns and bombs assembled
during its 30-year fight against British rule, a notion it had
previously dismissed as tantamount to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatic gesture did not satisfy many Ulster Unionists
who have been demanding the beginning of the actual turnover of
weapons before they will sit in government with Sinn Fein. They
consider Trimble's retreat from that position a betrayal of their
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble is expected to convene a meeting of the 850-strong party
council in 10 days to seek approval for proceeding with the
Mitchell plan, and the lobbying is already intense.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Reg Empey, the Ulster Unionists' chief negotiator, urged
colleagues to ponder the various conciliatory statements that
emerged this week ``so that the true significance and meaning of
them may be forthcoming.'' He said a close reading would produce
the conclusion that ``there is no other way forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to combat Ulster Unionist critics' suspicion that
Trimble had not been tenacious enough, Peter Mandelson, Britain's
secretary for Northern Ireland, depicted him as someone who had
fought aggressively for unionist interests.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting after a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing St. at which
the Mitchell plan came in for praise from Prime Minister Tony
Blair, Mandelson said Trimble ``has at times been frustrating,
almost painful, in what he has held out for, but I must say it has
shown a remarkable reward and dividend for unionists in Northern
Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement set up a new Northern Ireland Assembly and a
number of governmental bodies linking Belfast with Dublin, and with
the new legislatures in Scotland and Wales and the British
Parliament in London in an effort to balance the interests of
unionists and republicans. All these institutions could be up and
running next month if the Mitchell plan is accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists, most of whom are Protestants, favor keeping Northern
Ireland British while republicans, who tend to be Catholic, favor
eventual unity with the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   When the disarmament impasse put the agreement in danger of
unraveling, Blair and Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland held
marathon rescue talks in April and again in July. Those efforts
failed, and they sent for Mitchell, who over a 26-month period
brokered the original agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As Mitchell made his farewell remarks Thursday afternoon before
departing for the United States, political leaders who have lived
in deep distrust of one another for decades lined the walls of the
conference room and then strode one by one to the podium to pay
tribute to his achievement.
</P>
<P>
   One notable success of the Mitchell mission was to create a
spirit of cooperation among sworn enemies, and Mitchell praised
them Thursday for ``having set aside their hostility for the good
of their society.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up his two extended stays in the province, Mitchell
said: ``I have been involved in this effort for nearly five years.
I cannot say that I have enjoyed every minute of it. But while on
occasion it has been difficult, it also has been one of the most
meaningful times of my life.''

NAVY WOULD END LIVE FIRE TO KEEP TARGET RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy would stop using high explosive bombs and
shells and shift to inert weapons at the target range on the island
of Vieques as part of a White House compromise offer aimed at
reopening the bombing range in Puerto Rico, Navy officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's willingness to use duds is part of a White House
effort to persuade Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello and protesters
encamped on the range to allow a Persian Gulf-bound battle group
led by the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower to train on
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been consulting with Rossello by telephone during
the president's 10-day trip to Turkey and Europe. Alfonso Aguilar,
Rossello's spokesman in San Juan, said Puerto Rico's leaders are
expecting a new proposal from the president at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Atlantic Fleet was planning for the Eisenhower battle group to
train at Vieques without using the high explosive weapons that have
antagonized many of the 9,300 civilian residents on Vieques and
stirred concerns that toxic chemicals in the shells contribute to
the island's higher incidence of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy owns two-thirds of the 22-mile island, located east of
Puerto Rico. Sixty percent of the 396,222 munitions dropped or
fired on the island target range in the 16 years ending in 1998
were explosive; 40 percent were non-explosive. The range was used
an average of 187 days a year over the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using inert weapons is better than not training at Vieques,''
said a Navy official at the Pentagon. ``If the only way we get this
training is by using inert weapons, we're willing to do that. The
Navy is the `can-do service.'''
</P>
<P>
   A Navy official at Atlantic Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va.,
said Navy aircraft and warships have access to ready-made
non-explosive munitions that are routinely used in training. ``We
are working very hard to insure that inert training would qualify
our forces according to Navy guidelines,'' said the official, who
also spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's willingness to substitute inert weaponry represents a
turnabout and shows that the Navy is expecting a White House order
to shift to non-explosive weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Navy Vice Adm. William J. Fallon, commander
of the Atlantic Fleet, repeatedly insisted during testimony before
the Senate Armed Services Committee and a Pentagon review panel
that live-fire training on Vieques was essential to prepare
Atlantic-based forces for operations in the Mediterranean and the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., commander of the U.S. Atlantic
Command, told Defense Secretary William Cohen in an Aug. 27 letter
that live fire training on Vieques is ``part of a complex training
regime that allows us to send our men and women into harms way with
a clear conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vieques range, including an 899-acre live fire impact zone
and an adjacent 11,000-acre buffer and maneuver zone, has been
closed since April 19 after a Marine aviator mistakenly bombed a
hilltop observation post on the range. A Navy contract security
guard, David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, was killed in the accident and
four civilian range employees were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy prompted demands by Puerto Rico's political leaders,
backed by allies in Congress, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Democratic presidential candidates in 2000 to urge permanent
cessation to the 58 years of live-fire training on the 33,000-acre
island.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello has already rejected Navy bombardment of Vieques with
either explosive or non-explosive weapons. The Democratic governor
has threatened to seek a federal court order to block any
resumption of bombing, by either live ordnance or inert ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar said Thursday that Rossello ``will have to see the
president's proposal and see whether it takes into consideration
Puerto Rico's proposals to end the bombing'' before deciding
whether to fulfill his threat to seek federal court action.
</P>
<P>
   The target range has been used chiefly by carrier-based aircraft
for bombing, strafing and rocket fire, and by surface warships to
practice firing the 5-inch naval guns that fire up to 20 shells a
minute up to 15 miles to support Marines staging amphibious
landings.
</P>
<P>
   Warplanes assigned to the Eisenhower battle group, scheduled to
the sail to the Persian Gulf on Feb. 18, have carried out live-fire
training at ranges in Nevada and northern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But Navy officials have warned that many of the six surface
warships scheduled to accompany the Eisenhower may not qualify for
one of their principal combat missions without first rehearsing at
Vieques.

</P>
<P>
   Navy Lt. Cdr. Joe Navratil, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet,
said that the moratorium on training on Vieques had already forced
the destroyer USS John Hancock to complete training for operations
in the Persian Gulf after leaving the United States as part of the
battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The 563-foot warship and its crew of 376 left Mayport, Fla., on
Sept. 17 with what Navy officials described as a ``significant
degradation'' of combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The warship stopped en route to the Persian Gulf and practiced
shooting at a target range on the Italian island of Sardinia _ the
first time that a U.S. warship had relied solely on a foreign
target range to qualify for a primary combat mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy hallmark is 'ready on arrival,''' Navratil said. ``It
was disconcerting for us to sail without complete combat
readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   The USS John Hancock was on patrol Thursday in the Persian Gulf
assigned to intercept Iraqi smuggler vessels trying to get by a
weapons and oil embargo imposed on Iraq by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of interdiction is being able to fire a warning shot,''
Navratil said. ``Accuracy with naval guns is critically important
for the mission that the Hancock is doing in the Gulf.''

DO ANIMALS GET BORED? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Do animals get bored?
</P>
<P>
   K.M., Haydenville, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, according to Dr. Nicholas Dodman of the Tufts University
School of Veterinary Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists may not like to give it the human word ``boredom.''
But it is. The animals are finding something else to do when they
aren't stimulated or can't do what they are programmed
instinctively to do.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman cites several examples. ``Horses have what are called
`stall vices,' things they do when they're stuck in their stall for
hours with nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He says 25-35 percent of horses do something called cribbing,
grasping a solid surface like their hay bucket or stall door in
their teeth and pulling backwards on it. It causes air to move
around in their throats making a gulping noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some do it 600 times an hour,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Others pace circles into their stall floor. Some dig with their
hooves, sometimes holes up to their chests.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs will chase their tails, chase shadows, leap into the air at
imaginary insects, gnaw on furniture. Many dogs with nothing to do
for hours will lick their paws excessively, causing sores called
licking granuloma. Some dogs gulp at the air ``until they look
inflated, like they ate a basketball,'' Dodman says. ``The air
eventually comes out both ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Bored cats will eat, as in chew AND swallow, non-food items,
like plastic shower curtains, running shoes, woolen objects. Bored
Siamese cats are particularly known for a condition called ``wool
sucking.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodman says monkeys in research facilities sometimes
self-mutilate, picking at their own skin until it bleeds. Bored
Macaque monkeys are known to do rectal probing. A gorilla at a
local zoo was pulling out his hair and eating it, making himself
vomit, behavior Dr. Dodman attributed to boredom. Polar bears in
zoos pace. One at the Bronx Zoo did the backstroke excessively in
its pool. A Russian bear at the San Diego zoo started drinking
water out of its paw, something those animals don't normally do.
</P>
<P>
   Common anti-depressant drugs like Prozac, also used to treat
humans with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), are sometimes
given to bored animals that have OCD-like behavior. It cured those
bears, Dr. Dodman said, and the gorilla, and prescribed properly
can also help house pets that have adopted compulsive behaviors
because of boredom.

   A couple of elementary corrections. A few weeks ago in a column
we labeled Uranium ``Ur.'' The symbol is ``U.'' And we said the
derivation of the name Hydrogen is from the Latin hudor, for water.
Hudor is Greek. Aqua is Latin. Mea culpa is oops, we messed up.

manufactured by Sacramento-based Glide Ride. They offer a fire
truck ($249), Checker cab ($229), dump truck and a police car (both
$259). They closely resemble the Murray kiddie cars of the '50s,
but these are meant to be played with, not merely collected.
</P>
<P>
   Glide Rides are made of 18-gauge steel and coated with a
lead-free powdered paint that makes them rust-resistant (another
big improvement over their predecessors). Suited for ages 2-6, the
pedal system has five easily adjustable positions for growing
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Kids may not have the good judgment to ask for one but they are
sure to love them, and the cars are incredibly appealing to parents
with happy motoring memories. Sold fully assembled at Cherish'd,
Woodland Hills; Kae &AMP; Shelly's Hallmark, Thousand Oaks; Coppa
Automotive, San Pedro; and G&AMP;L Collectibles, Covina.

   Bop It Extreme is a five-way version of Parker Bros.' already
popular Bop It coordination and reflex game. The hand-held gadget
sets a rhythm and cues the player to bop it, pull it, twist it,
flick it, spin it and pass it in time to the beat or he's out.
</P>
<P>
   Improved coordination is rewarded with faster tempos. Bop It
Extreme was a big hit among Daily News staffers who tried it. The
suggested retail price is $24.99, but we've seen it around town for
$20-$30. Available at most toy and mass merchandise stores.

<P>
   Music Blocks, made by Neurosmith, is a guaranteed painless way
to introduce children to classical music and orchestra sounds. The
electronic toy comes with a cartridge to play Mozart's Night Music,
but exactly how it is played is up to the user.
</P>
<P>
   Each of five blocks plays a certain phrase from the well-known
piece, allowing users to rearrange the measures by moving the
blocks. And each of a block's six sides, marked by a shape,
represents a different performance of that phrase _ say, woodwinds,
strings or vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Neurosmith says there are a million different ways to play one
work. For even more variety, there are Rhythms of the World and
Sounds of the Symphony cartridges sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer says it's suited to ages 2 and older, but don't
let that starting age and the primary colors fool you. This is
stimulating and fun for all ages. About $70 at specialty toy stores
such as Zany Brainy and Store of Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   If wrestling-themed stuff is a must-have, WCW Tuff Talkin'
Wrestlers from Toy Biz can be a lot of fun. Goldberg and Kevin
Nash, sold as a pair, have the technology to recognize each other
and personalize their banter as their mouths move. Each figure also
makes grunting or ``oof'' noises on contact. When pinned on their
backs, an announcer three-counts them out.
</P>
<P>
   Although we didn't push them to the limit, they appear sturdy
enough to withstand a lot of punishment. The series also includes
Sting and Diamond Dallas Page pairing. Each pair costs about $40.
They're available at mass merchandise and toy stores.

   Riding skateboards is not just a boy thing, as Skateboard
Shannen knows. With Shannen, Mattel gives young kids a simple, fun
introduction to radio-controlled toys. With manipulation of two
easy-to-use joysticks, she goes forward, backward and spins
wheelies. She can get up pretty good speed for jumps, and has a
helmet and elbow pads for rough landings. About $40 at toy and mass
merchandise stores.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Marshall collectible dolls are 15{ inches of high-quality
glamour _ what Barbie aspired to be in her early years before
Mattel cut a great deal on hot pink fabrics. Gene is a Hollywood
star of the '40s and '50s whose elegant wardrobe is part haute
couture, part studio costume department.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her fourth season through the Ashton-Drake Galleries mail
order and specialty doll stores, this is the first year the company
offers Simply Gene, a bathing-suit clad doll _ blond, brunet or
redhead _ for $49.95, including a hairstyling guide.
</P>
<P>
   As in past years, there are completely outfitted dolls with just
the right hairstyle and accessories, such as the Champagne Supper
copper satin and fur ensemble, for $79.95. Available at the Doll
Shoppe, Sherman Oaks; Gallery Decor/Carlin's, Glendale; Thru
Children's Eyes, Thousand Oaks; Dolls on Broadway, Long Beach; and
Bea's House of Dolls, Riverside.
</P>

   The end is near for Beanie Babies, or so says manufacturer Ty
Inc., which announced a couple of months ago it will quit
production of all Beanie Babies on Dec. 31. The ultimate
collectible Beanie, a black bear with The End and a fireworks burst
embroidered on its chest, has a suggested retail price around $6,
but some sellers are seizing the opportunity to scalp. You can pay
as little as $5.99 at Play Co. Toys and $6.50 at Amy's Hallmark,
both in Woodland Hills, but blink and you'll miss them. Or you can
pay $49.95 on eToys or $59.95 at the Beanie Baby stall at Woodland
Hills Promenade where they are readily available.
</P>
<P>
   Matchbox CAT Power Machines from Mattel are scaled similar to
Tonka trucks and have no-battery motor actions. For example, a
lever on the side of the dump truck raises and lowers the truck
bed. But unlike Tonkas, they are made of sturdy plastic that won't
rust. Just grab them from the sandbox, douse them in the kiddie
pool or turn the hose on them and they're ready for inside play.
About $15 at toy stores and mass merchandise stores.
</P>
<P>
   For little biker wanna-bes, Power Wheels has a piglet version of
a hog. The Harley-Davidson sports ``outrigger wheels'' on the back
to provide tricycle stability, concealed under exaggerated running
boards and exhaust pipes. About $200 at Toys `R' Us, including a
battery pack and charger.
</P>
<P>
   Most kids love to get dizzy, and Dizzy Disc Jr. from Quantum
Toys offers a pretty safe but challenging way to do it. They can
sit, kneel or stand on the round swiveling platform, which can be
set level or cocked at an angle to make it even more fun. It has a
stabilizing base and a built-in handle for portability, and can
hold up to 150 pounds. Parents will like the idea that Dizzy Disc
improves balance and coordination for sports and dance, but kids
will just like to spin and fall down. About $50 at specialty toy
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Cloth-body Singing Steve and Blue from Nick Jr.'s popular
preschool series ``Blue's Clues'' sing songs from the show, and
come packaged in a box with a red Thinking Chair that can be cut
out. That makes it easy for young fans to make up their own Blue's
Clues games at home. About $35 at most toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   Excalibur Electronics Talking Electronic Dart Board is aimed at
ages 9 and older, but comes with less-than-lethal plastic-tipped
darts. At about $100, it's a bit pricey, but it costs a lot less
than hiring a referee. This board knows the rules to five different
games and keeps score. As with other safety-dart games, some
bounce-outs do occur, but since the board is pressure-sensitive it
counts the contact anyway unless players choose to disqualify
bounce-outs. The package comes with replacement tips and six
American flag and Union Jack flights. Available online through
eToys.
</P>
<P>
   Does someone on your gift list have a hankering to try pottery?
No need to rewire the house for a kiln. Imagine Nation has come out
with a Deluxe Pottery Wheel equipped with air-dry clay requiring no
baking. The kit includes paints and mosaics, and extra clay can be
purchased at art supply stores. The wheel runs on four D batteries
or with an adapter sold separately. About $30 at Store of
Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In board games, everything old is new again. Tried-and-true
Monopoly has a Star Wars Episode I edition that begins at the
low-rent Naboo Swamps and ends at Coruscant, headquarters of the
Jedi Council, deemed equivalent to Boardwalk. The currency is
Republic credits instead of dollars, but there still are familiar
elements, such as the look of the dreaded jail corner. About $60 at
toy stores, mass merchandise stores and specialty stores.
Monopoly's manufacturer, USAoply, also has a new Scrabble Jr. game
with a Madeline theme. The words already are printed on the board,
so players just have to draw the right letters to fill in the board
and score points. Or play it in French on the reverse side. Mais
oui. About $20 at toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   The bad girl of TV's ``Rugrats'' and her African-American friend
have been all dolled up by Mattel as Make-Up Pretty Angelica and
Make-Up Pretty Susie, widely predicted to be hot sellers this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Both soft-bodied dolls have pink tutus, crowns and long skirts
that can be added under the tutu. Angelica comes with her blond
hair in pigtails, but with some work it can be restyled into an
updo, unusual for a vinyl doll. Unfortunately, the main attraction
_ the lipstick, rouge and eyeshadow that emerge or wash off with a
little water _ seems to be their biggest flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Three dolls we've seen did not react as promised on the package,
although Mattel reports it has not received complaints. A very
frank 5-year-old girl said she wasn't interested in playing with
Angelica if she couldn't do her makeup. About $20 at toy and mass
merchandise stores.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie has a desk job and she can't stop talking about it. Press
a button in Working Woman Barbie's back and she says, ``It's
payday. Earning money is fun,'' ``Let's have a meeting'' and other
things we all say at the office, as well as Barbie-isms like ``I
can't wait to go dancing with Ken tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Her accessories include a laptop computer, cellular phone,
coffee mug and file folders. She can shed her blazer and turn her
gray skirt inside out, transforming it into a sparkly red chiffon
number fit for a night on the town.
</P>
<P>
   The enclosed CD-Rom allows players to make their own stationery,
design a cover of Working Woman magazine and do other activities.
Mattel has included replaceable batteries. About $30 at most toy
and mass merchandise stores. &QL;

LITTLE STUFF, LITTLE PRICES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you are desperately seeking Pikachu, Pokemon trading card
sets are hard to come by at Toys `R' Us because of the high demand,
but they are in stock at smaller toy stores such as Play Co., KB
Toys, Gamekeeper and Target, all of which sell starter packs for
about $4.
</P>
<P>
   Tangle Pen is a snaky looking ballpoint that comes in four
interchangeable segments, each with a different color and texture
on the outside and a different color ink. There also is a mini roll
of paper in the end, great for slipping smaller-than-cookie-fortune
notes to friends. About $9 at Store of Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   For babies and older kids who still like to play in the tub,
check out Shakin' Bath Toys, made by Kids II. They are crinkly,
colorful frogs, fish and turtles that start vibrating across the
water when a string is pulled. They sell for $2.99 each exclusively
at Wal-Mart's infants departments.
</P>
<P>
   Bendos from Kid Galaxy are 45 quirky and very pliable characters
that could be the next collectible craze. Bendos are a good
diversion in cars, restaurants, doctors' waiting rooms and anyplace
else kids get fidgety. About $5 at toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   To stash the goods, Zany Brainy has stockings and dreidl bags
that are roomy, nice-looking and well-made for a few years' use _
and they're only $5 each. At that price they make a clever
gift-wrap idea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEB TOYS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Experts are predicting that more toys will be purchased online
this holiday season than ever. There are several options on the
Web, including eToys.com, ToysRUs.com, SmarterKids.com, KBkids.com,
Toysmart.com, eHobbies.com and ZanyBrainy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Online might be the best way to go for the stuff in highest
demand; eToys advises you while shopping if an item is out of stock
and will notify you by e-mail when it's available. Some, such as
SmarterKids and Toysmart, are offering shipping bargains for early
shoppers, and ToysRUs and KBkids will accept returns or exchanges
of online purchases in their stores. If the item is shipped from
out of state, you can save on the sales tax, which defrays the
shipping charges. Many sites also will giftwrap for an additional
charge.

 &HT;    `Ben-Hur' musical hits Florida theme-park circuit
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ After three years in the making, at a cost of $9
million and counting, a new tourist attraction has arrived in this
theme-park city. Once you've trekked up Space Mountain, plummeted
down the Tower of Terror and survived the jostling of The Hulk
coaster, how about relaxing in front of ``Ben-Hur: The Musical''?
</P>
<P>
   A new production company bullishly named Global Impact Concepts
is betting it can attract a half-million people annually to sit for
an on-stage chariot race, a fiery sea battle, the crucifixion of
Christ and two dozen songs. Implied in that multimillion-dollar
wager is that ``Ben-Hur'' can generate a sizable theater-going
habit that Orlando has never had. Global Impact managed to build
the show, as last weekend's premiere performances proved, but still
to be determined is whether audiences in sufficient numbers will
come.
</P>
<P>
   Global Impact President Bob Reeder has a history as a family
entertainment Pied Piper, launching the Fort Lauderdale Christmas
Pageant in 1983. That large-cast show featuring live animals and
flying angels now attracts some 50,000 people each holiday season.
So Reeder figured it was time to move to Orlando and create a
year-round spectacle and spirituality event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be of epic proportion,'' says Reeder, who
began to sketch out a pageant with a plot that he called ``The
Spectacular Light.'' ``And the more we started writing, we found we
really wanted to do something similar to `Ben-Hur.' Because it has
a little bit of everything in it. The more we thought about it, the
more we decided, well, why don't we just do `Ben-Hur'?''
</P>
<P>
   After all, there's no point in reinventing the chariot wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Civil War General Lew Wallace wrote ``Ben-Hur'' in 1880, pitting
privileged Judah Ben-Hur against his childhood friend Messala, who
grows up to be a tribune in the Roman army that occupies Judea.
Their friendship sours when Messala condemns Ben-Hur to life as a
galley slave, an animosity that culminates in an action-adventure
chariot race between them.
</P>
<P>
   The book became a best-seller, and the story soon moved to other
media. It arrived on Broadway in 1899 _ not as a musical _ and
played there and on tour for the next 20 years. A 1926 silent movie
version set new standards for film spectacle and the remake,
released exactly 40 years ago, copped a then-record 11 Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   In part, because of that movie's action sequences, the chariot
race has overshadowed the story's religious themes for many people.
But, as Reeder is quick to point out, ``The name of the book is
`Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.' It parallels Judah Ben-Hur's life
with the Christ's, how they interacted and how his life was changed
at the cross. It really takes on a whole dimension after that
chariot race.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, what people want to know is how do they stage the race?
Set designer Peter Wolf was taken aback by early creative meetings
where live horses were contemplated. ``And I said, `So we're going
to have on the stage some moving sidewalk or treadmill? Once you've
got those on the stage, where am I going to put my scenery? We have
one chariot race for six minutes, but what do we do the rest of the
time?'''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, relief of Wolf _ and the cleanup crew _
mechanical horses were decided upon, eight computerized stallions
that reach full gallop with animatronic technology similar to that
used across town at Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very complicated show technically,'' says director
Amick Byram, who refereed the battle between ``what is going to
fulfill people's expectations and what is physically possible on a
stage.'' He likened the task to being a theatrical George Patton.
``Sometimes you have to be as firm as Patton was, and sometimes
delicate.''
</P>
<P>
   The creative team wondered how they could possibly compete with
theme-park thrill rides. ``We had these discussions early on _ OK,
it's the Orlando marketplace, people come here to see all this
`wow' stuff,'' says Byram. ``But this is the only thing that
tourists are probably going to see in this city that is not only
going to wow them, but also affect them emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, says Reeder, Disney executives have been encouraging.
``We're really not competing with any of those big boys, because we
can't. We only want (audiences) for two-and-a-half hours. They can
go over there and stand in line and do their thing, and then they
come to the theater and sit in an air-conditioned room, hear a
beautiful orchestra and be entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the gnawing thought remains that if ``Ben-Hur'' does
catch on with Orlando tourists, it won't be long before the Magic
Kingdom unveils a nighttime ``Hercules'' chariot-race show. ``You
know what? That could happen,'' agrees Reeder. ``A lot of people
have said to us since we first came into town that as soon as
Disney or Universal figures out how to do it, they're going to want
to do it. We think that will only complement what we're doing. A
good place to build a restaurant is right next to a successful
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando has plenty of restaurants but few theaters. Luckily,
Reeder found the underutilized, oversized, 2,657-seat auditorium in
the Orlando/Orange County Convention Center. But when he told the
center's management what he wanted, they treated him like a leper.
``We said we wanted at least a three-year lease, and they said,
`Maybe three days or three weeks,''' recalls Reeder. He prevailed
but adds that ``it took 18 months to negotiate that contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeder was also persuasive enough to attract investors to
``Ben-Hur: The Musical'' long before the show was ever written.
``We just shared the vision,'' he says, amassing the $9 million
budget from just a handful of individuals, including major-league
pitcher Orel Hershiser. Reeder's pitch included a plea for faith,
plus an upbeat business plan. ``In our projections, we believe that
within two years, we'll have all of our investors paid back. That's
on a conservative basis of 60 to 65 percent capacity,'' he
explains. Conservative, perhaps, but at Sunday evening's
performance _ the fourth before a paid audience _ the turnout was
already far below that level.
</P>
<P>
   Advance ticket sales are projected to be $2 million by the end
of the month. That's puny by Broadway standards, but nothing seems
to dampen Reeder's spirits. His marketing staff is targeting church
groups from across the country, and he expects general tourist
business to be last-minute impulse buys. ``Seventy-five percent of
the people that are going to come to our show haven't even heard
about it yet,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Reeder also likes to point out parallels between ``Ben-Hur'' and
``Les Miserables,'' predicting financial returns on par with that
literary mega-hit musical. ``It's basically the same thing,'' he
says of the shows. ``It's basically all about forgiveness. We're
trusting that we're going to have some of that same success that
`Les Miz' has had.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Ben-Hur'' conquers Orlando, that's when the global
impact kicks in. Reeder mentions the possibility of future
productions in New York and even Las Vegas, cities not previously
known for their interest in spiritual entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Once Wolf catches his breath, he will begin thinking about a
redesign for touring. ``If we don't have a theater of this size,
we'll have to change things and come up with effects that are just
as powerful but done in another way,'' he says. ``This isn't really
geared to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Reeder, theater producers as far away as Japan are
already inquiring about licensing his ``Ben-Hur.'' ``This city,
this world, the timing of the millennium, are ready for this story
to be told again, and to be told in the greatest way it could be
told, in music. We think this is just the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just a matter of faith, hope and chariots.

 &HT;    Florida's little-known Garden of Eden
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORREYA STATE PARK, Fla. _ Here is one of the best views in
Florida, simple, solitary, splendid. The eye wings up over tranquil
miles of tufted forests, fading from green to blue in the distance,
to a horizon of rain-washed pure air. Hundreds of feet below,
beyond a steep tumble of trees and shrubs, the toffee-colored
Apalachicola River runs calmly to the Gulf of Mexico, past
Confederate cannon-emplacements dating back to the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Beholding this panorama is like flying with your two feet still
on the ground: It all looks elemental, enormous, like the first day
of creation. But there is a fascinating tangle of history and loss
behind this place, involving a shipwreck, an abandoned mansion, a
mysterious tree on the brink of extinction, and mythical
recollections of Noah's Ark and the biblical Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Here would be a good place to spend Saturday, when every state
park in Florida will be open free of charge, all 151 of them, to
celebrate Florida's state park system's being named the best in the
nation by the National Recreation and Parks Administration and the
National Sporting Goods Association at an Oct. 23 ceremony in
Nashville, Tenn. Florida beat Missouri, Tennessee and Virginia for
the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, as on most days, you will likely have this
2,495-acre place largely to yourself. Torreya is the second
least-visited state park in Florida, after Lignum Vitae Key State
Park, which you can only get to by boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valleys and ravines filled with massive, ancient trees,
rock-strewn trails and creeks, waterfalls, a thousand species of
plants (some existing nowhere else), hundreds of species of birds
and animals ... this is the magic of Torreya State Park. There is
no other place like it in Florida ... perhaps no place like it in
the world,'' writes Scott Stursa of Wild Florida Online.
</P>
<P>
   Torreya can be reached by car and hiked on foot, but it is so
out of the way, so lost in the leafy wilderness of Liberty County,
that few people are tempted to make the effort. Of the 14,645,202
people who visited Florida's state parks this past year, only
20,469 made their way here.
</P>
<P>
   There are days when, in all of teeming Florida, nobody at all
comes here except park personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other area on earth, when one considers Eden in
Florida, of like size, better blessed with a water supply of pure
water. There is no other area on earth of like size having a better
twelve-month climate,'' declared Elvy E. Callaway, in his 1971
book, ``In the Beginning,'' written to prove that the Paradise of
Adam and Eve _ the Garden of Eden itself _ had been located in
these parts.
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Callaway argued that 27 of the 28 species of
tree mentioned in the Bible are to be found here. He identified the
``Four Rivers'' flowing into the Garden of Eden as modern
Chattahoochee, the Flint/Apalachicola, Fish Pond Creek and Spring
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Some people took Callaway seriously. There is a Garden of Eden
Drive in the western part of Liberty County. In 1967, a law was
actually passed by the state legislature, Florida Statute 67-960,
authorizing the planning and establishment of a replica of Noah's
Ark here.
</P>
<P>
   The ark was never built. Money was lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the aura of Eden lingers still, in the memory of a nearly
lost tree: Torreya taxifolia, discovered here and named in the
early 19th century by Bryan Hardy Croom, a planter and botanist who
perished with his wife Frances and their children in the October
1837 wreck of the steamship Home, off Cape Hatteras.
</P>
<P>
   The imaginative Callaway theorized that the ``gopherwood'' of
the Bible, the wood Noah used to build his ark, was actually
Torreya taxifolia. The tree does in fact yield a light, strong,
durable, fine-grained wood, very resistant to water and insects.
Fenceposts made from it 60 years ago are still standing, still
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Torreya taxifolia is one of the rarest trees in America,
related to the yew-tree that produces the cancer-remedy Taxol. A
mysterious blight, similar to the American chestnut blight, attacks
mature trees with a fungus that can move in any direction, from tip
to roots, from branch-tips to trunk, or backwards, and slay mature
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Then, from the dead tree's seeds, little saplings spring up,
fewer and fewer as years go by, to be attacked in their turn by the
fungus. Nobody knows how to save the tree from extinction. Three
years ago, two little Torreya pines stood near the parking lot of
the state park. Today both are dead, and there is only one specimen
left growing in the whole place. Park personnel can show you
embalmed branches in jars of alcohol, pale emerald in color, kept
in a drawer inside the park office. Preservation in fluid has faded
them: The live trees are a deep green, almost black.
</P>
<P>
   Why this tree is disappearing is a mystery. ``When I was a boy,
they were so abundant on the riverbanks we cut them for Christmas
trees,'' said Angus Kemp Gholson, a retired forester and amateur
botanist who lives in Chattahoochee and who is one of the most
respected authorities on North Florida's flora.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is, when St. Joe Paper cut down the hardwoods in
Gulf, Franklin and Liberty County, and replanted them with pines,
they somehow changed the ecosystem. I may be wrong, but I know that
Torreya has died out within my lifetime. Something happened to kill
it.'' Seven miles of hiking trails are open at the park, and now,
in fall and in winter, is the best time to pace them. June, July
and August are months when insects rule the riverbank, and only the
strongest, hardiest, most bug-defiant visitors dare confront them.
</P>
<P>
   One last reward: There is a magnificent old house on the bluff
overlooking the park today, the Gregory House, built in the 1840s,
on the opposite side of the river. In the 1930s, the place was
falling to pieces, and Civilian Conservation Corps workers
disassembled it and toted it up to this bluff, where it is now open
for tours. In an ever more crowded state, this empty, handsome
house, overlooking a broad arc of faraway forestland, in a park few
people even know about, makes for a spell of magical quiet and
solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Here, less is more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Torreya is one of our hidden jewels,'' said Carrie Canfield, a
spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection's division of recreation and parks. ``Not many people
know about it, but it is a very beautiful place.''

   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   New England (6-3) at Miami (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Both quarterbacks are coming off tough losses and poor play.
Drew Bledsoe is still seeing Jets defensive backs in his sleep, and
Damon Huard looked terrible against Buffalo. The player who will
bounce back is Bledsoe. No way he has back-to-back horrible games
with so much on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 14-12
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (2-7) at Tampa Bay (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   If Tampa Bay had any kind of offense, it would be in the Super
Bowl this year. Last week the Buccaneers held Kansas City to 5
first-half passing yards. Tampa Bay wishes it could throw for that
many. But things are looking up for the Buccaneers. Quarterback
Trent Dilfer is showing a pulse, completing 32-of-47 passes for
five touchdowns in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 9-3
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (7-3) at Jets (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   One day the handsome mug of Bill Parcells will adorn the Hall of
Fame, but moments from this season won't make it into the
acceptance speech. He blew not getting a solid backup quarterback,
and with talent like Keyshawn Johnson and Curtis Martin the Jets
should still be .500 even with the loss of Vinny Testaverde. Ray
Lucas played a great game against New England, but the Bills will
have a few surprises for Lucas as Parcells had for the Patriots.
Lucas' Christmas gift from the Bills is a speedy linebacker who
will ``spy'' on him.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 24-18
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (3-6) at Cleveland (2-8)
</P>
<P>
   The development of quarterback Tim Couch has been one of the few
positives for the Browns this year. He needs only 162 passing yards
to break the club's season rookie record set by Bernie Kosar in
1985. He has shown poise and a nice touch on the ball, and he has a
stronger arm than most scouts believed. This time Cleveland wins a
game when the clock isn't on zero.
</P>
<P>
   Browns, 12-10
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (6-3) at Green Bay (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   Do not ask Bret Favre about his injured thumb. Please. He gets
irate. He says it has nothing to do with his team's 4-5 record, but
when Favre ails, the Packers feel the pain. Green Bay is desperate,
and that is probably why it will win. It also helps the Packers
that the home team in this matchup has won 11 of the past 12,
including one playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Packers 24-21
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (7-2) at Philadelphia (3-7)
</P>
<P>
   What the Colts lacked last season was the maturity to win close
games. Well, mission accomplished. But their game against
Philadelphia will be closer than expected. The last three meetings
between these two teams have been decided by a total of 11 points.
The Eagles are a feisty bunch that play well at home and will shut
down Edgerrin James but not Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 22-21
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (5-4) at Tennessee (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Steelers coach Bill Cowher this week denied he has lost his
passion, and when meeting with the media, he expressed that
sentiment very, very loudly. Cowher may still have the best vocal
cords in coaching but there is no question he is not as hard on his
players as he used to be. He gives them incredible leeway,
especially quarterback Kordell Stewart, who is more erratic than a
seismograph. Meanwhile, the Titans' Eddie George is just beginning
to pick up steam. He gets double-figure rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Titans, 24-18
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (7-2) at Kansas City (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   If any coach can break Kansas City's stranglehold on opponents
at home, it is Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren. He seeks to open the
season 8-2 for the third time of his professional head-coaching
career. This is significant because the first two times he did that
the Packers won Super Bowls. Holmgren is great in this situation.
He does well at preparing his teams for hostile environments, and
the Seahawks make few mistakes on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 19-17
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (3-6) at Cincinnati (1-9)
</P>
<P>
   Rod Woodson loves the Bengals. He has seven career interceptions
against them, his most against any team, and two were returned for
touchdowns. Not to mention Woodson has picked off Cincinnati
quarterback Jeff Blake three times. Woodson is part of a pretty
good Ravens defense that has not allowed a 100-yard rusher or
receiver this season. The Bengals won't be much of a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 21-7
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (4-6) at San Diego (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   One of the best coaching jobs this season comes not from
Holmgren, Jim Mora or Dick Vermeil, but Dick Jauron of the Bears.
That this sorry Chicago team has won four games is one of the great
stories of the season. In fact, five of the Bears' six losses have
been by seven points or less, so the team could easily have two
more wins. The Chargers are still reeling from their 28-9 loss to
Oakland on Sunday, and during the game there was a facemask to
facemask shouting match between quarterback Jim Harbaugh and safety
Michael Dumas. Even without the suspended Ryan Leaf, things still
ugly in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Bears, 28-16
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (5-4) at Arizona (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   Jason Garrett was surprising last week in leading the Dallas
offense past Green Bay. In fact, Garrett is 6-2 in his career as a
starter. He's not great, just solid, and all Garrett needs to do is
keep the Cowboys afloat until Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith return.
Arizona will present a few problems, namely Simeon Rice, whom no
team has been able to slow this season, but Garrett gets the job
done again.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 20-17
</P>
<P>
   Giants (5-4) at Washington (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   New York plans to open up the offense more this week, and that
is a good thing. One player who has taken the brunt of the blame
but shouldn't is quarterback Kent Graham. He has played solidly
despite the poor play of the offensive line and the lack of a
running game. Look for the Giants to throw the ball downfield early
and attack one of the worst defenses this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 21-20
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (7-2) at San Francisco (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had a nice win last week against Carolina and should
have an equally pleasant time this week against the 49ers. San
Francisco is an organization in disarray. Historically, the 49ers
have dominated the Rams, but the situation has now reversed itself.
St. Louis averages 381.7 yards of offense a game. This is the kind
of number the 49ers used to put on the board a long time ago in a
galaxy far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 40-20
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (2-7) at Jacksonville (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   Running back Fred Taylor is questionable with a hamstring pull.
They could use him, and that must sound insane, since
Jacksonville's six-game winning streak is the longest this season
and the Jaguars do have eight victories. But last week Jacksonville
scored only six points against Baltimore, and there is definitely
friction between quarterback Mark Brunell and Coach Tom Coughlin,
who is calling the plays this year. Brunell and Coughlin should get
through this one easily.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 30-12
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (5-4) at Denver (3-7)
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have one of the more brutal schedules in the league,
but still the team plods along. The Broncos have dominated the AFC
West in recent years, winning 12 straight division games at home.
But that was with John Elway and Terrell Davis. Now, Elway is on
the banquet circuit, and Davis is rehabilitating his knee. So the
Broncos will see lots of Wheatley, who is playing like Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 17-14

 &HT;    Dubner goes home again, recounts journey in `Turbulent Souls'
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Stephen Dubner has had a hard time
attending synagogue lately.
</P>
<P>
   It's not because the 36-year-old is having second thoughts about
his reconnection to Judaism after a devout Catholic upbringing. Or
because his struggle with faith has left him alienated from the
service, or even the culture.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing that ethereal. It's just that Dubner is
occasionally put off by the steady parade of people who want to say
hello and shake his hand. It's the price the young author is paying
for writing a best-selling memoir about his 10-year wrestling match
with God.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Turbulent Souls,'' Dubner exposes the fractures he endured
in that match. By opening himself up, he has tacitly invited
thousands of others who have struggled with their own spiritual
dilemmas to compare scars and celebrate the triumph of his choice _
and theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of fun, but it's also a bit of a distraction,''
Dubner says by cell phone from a taxi in New York City. ``People
were really affected by this book.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Turbulent Souls,'' Dubner retraces with poetic elegance his
parents' separate journeys from their Jewish homes, through periods
of religious uncertainty and finally, after they married, into
their rich Catholic faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion would define not only their lives but the lives
of their children. In accepting Jesus, Dubner's parents divorced
their families, their communities and their histories. Immediately
after World War II, when they met each other and married, they
began their journey of reinvention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of a little Yiddish and gefilte fish,'' Dubner writes,
his parents, two Jews from Brooklyn, created a perfect Roman
Catholic family. ``We, the children, were a separate slice of time
like one prehistoric era laid over the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubner grew up knowing that his parents had once been Jewish,
but he didn't know what the word meant. What he knew was the bloody
drama of Jesus. The feel of rosary beads in his fingers. The way
the light looked seeping through the stained-glass window of Our
Lady of Fatima Church, where he was an altar boy and his father a
sometimes orator. What he knew was playing checkers across from a
2-foot-tall statue of the Infant of Prague when none of his seven
older brothers and sisters had time for him.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this house filled with crosses _ and a convert's
fervor for Jesus _ faith never quite lodged in Dubner's heart or
the hearts of many of his siblings. When he was 10 years old, his
father died, leaving even more room for doubt.
</P>
<P>
   After earning an academic scholarship to Appalachian State
University and playing in The Right Profile, a band that knocked on
fame's door, Dubner married an Episcopalian woman and began
pursuing a graduate degree in writing at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   But in the most vibrant Jewish city in the Western Hemisphere,
it was only a matter of time before Dubner collided with his
family's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was really this kind of resonance that would make itself
felt to me in various ways,'' Dubner said. ``Obviously, I can't
prove it, but yes, I think there was some sort of Jewish soul lying
dormant in me.''
</P>
<P>
   What Dubner loved about Judaism was its acceptance of the
imperfections of man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm personally not someone who has great thirst for
certainty,'' Dubner said. ``To me, Judaism is a religion that not
only tolerates but actually encourages questioning and examining
things from different angles.'' Dubner devotes a good portion of
``Turbulent Souls'' to his attempts to make sense of his parents'
choices. In the end, he is able to understand that his father,
distraught by the death of his own mother, found solace in the
Virgin Mary. It is a realization that enables the son to make peace
with the father.
</P>
<P>
   What took a little more time was reaching a detente with his
mother, who was not happy that her youngest had so publicly turned
his back on the faith that she had worked so hard to embody. While
Dubner's mother was living in Lake Worth, Fla., a few years ago,
Dubner spoke with Cardinal John O'Connor of New York. His words,
legitimizing Judaism, helped to bridge the chasm between mother and
son.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which illuminates this bridge, has made Dubner
something of a spokesman for Christian-Jewish relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are obvious differences between the two religions,''
Dubner says. ``But at the root, the differences are not as great as
we often play them up to be.''

 &HT;    'Ben-Hur' music scores, but rest is off key
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The creators of the new $9 million ``Ben-Hur:
The Musical'' intend it to be a spiritual experience, and for me it
was. For most of the evening, I found myself praying. Praying that
the show would somehow get better.
</P>
<P>
   At least you can see where the money went. The numerous
painterly landscapes by set designer Peter Wolf are visually
appealing, even if they and the huge scenery pieces tend to dwarf
the performers. And while the animatronic horses of the climactic
chariot race cannot do much more than kick their legs furiously and
move sideways, that couldn't have come cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Like the animated ``Prince of Egypt,'' this ``Ben-Hur'' spends
time establishing the childhood friendship of the two men who will
grow into enemies _ Jewish Judean prince Judah Ben-Hur and the
future Roman tribune, Messala. Ben-Hur's romantic interest, Esther,
is also introduced as a youngster, with a stroll through the
marketplace song, ``Brand New Day,'' that could have been Belle's
in ``Beauty and the Beast'' with minor adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the adapters want to make sure that tots in
attendance are sufficiently drawn into the story. Could that
explain the laughable close-order march of the Roman soldiers or
the broadly comic depiction of Arab Sheik Ilderim, complete with
idiotic nephew sidekick?
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the musical score by Paul Johnson and Ronald
Owen is tunefully pleasant. If only the lyrics were more tailored
to the story, so they did not sound like generic songs of yearning
(``Where Do I Go From Here?''), generic love songs (``It's Always
Been You'') and generic songs of reunion (``Do You Remember Me?'').
In contrast, a driving, multipart tune about bygones (``Forgive &AMP;
Forget'') stands out as a model of what the rest might have
emulated.
</P>
<P>
   Once the main characters grow up, the show follows the Lew
Wallace novel and the 1959 William Wyler-directed movie version
fairly closely, until after the chariot race. Early on, a rooftop
accident spells bad news for the Hurs, as Messala sends Judah off
to be a galley slave and imprisons his mother and sister. The
stage-wide ship gets attacked in a wimpy sea battle, complete with
a wall of fire that looks like a row of maladjusted butane
lighters.
</P>
<P>
   Judah saves commander Quintus Arrius, who adopts him. Soon our
hero is challenging Messala to a no-holds-barred chariot race.
Well, no holds might be barred if the computerized horses were
programmed to move on a few more axes. As is, the race is a long,
uninvolving six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a break with Wallace's tale, Messala survives the brutal
matchup, so that scripter Chip Hand can give the show a moral about
forgiveness and reconciliation. Meanwhile, Judah seeks out a
certain carpenter from Nazareth who once did him a kindness, hoping
the silent, robed stranger can cure his mother and sister of
prison-contracted leprosy. Jesus's crucifixion upstages the chariot
race and proves more theatrically effective.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Patteri, sporting Fabio hair, is Ben-Hur as matinee idol,
with a rich, creamy baritone singing voice to boot. The same goes
for the lovely trained soprano of Cassie LaRocca (Esther) and the
malevolence of Stephen Jones' Messala, though all three roles as
written are cardboard thin. Most of the rest of the 47-member cast
is there to be human scenery, an assignment they handle well
enough.
</P>
<P>
   For all I know, ``Ben-Hur: The Musical'' may achieve its
intended spiritual uplift for its target audience. Those more in
search of dramatic values would do well to wait for the next
chariot.

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you can't drive nearly 400 miles
northwest this Saturday to get into Torreya State Park for free,
there are other state parks within 100 miles of West Palm Beach,
just as open, just as free on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE INLET STATE RECREATION AREA
</P>
<P>
   It has 340 acres of beach, dunes and coastal hammock, located on
the north shore of Fort Pierce Inlet. Birdwatchers can get an
eyeful on Jack Island. Picnicking and hiking encouraged. Contact

</P>
<P>
   HUGH TAYLOR BIRCH STATE RECREATION AREA
</P>
<P>
   In 1893, Chicago attorney Hugh T. Birch bought three miles of
beachfront in Fort Lauderdale for next to nothing and carved out a
180-acre estate named ``Terramar'' on the property. He donated his
land to the state in 1940, and it has been open to the public since
1949. Nature trails, lagoons and hardwood hammocks show what Fort
Lauderdale used to look like. There is also a bike trail and an
exercise course. Canoe rentals are available. Camping and cabins
are rentable for overnight stays. For more information, contact:
Hugh Taylor Birch State Recreation Area, 3109 East Sunrise
Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33304; (954) 564-4521
</P>
<P>
   JOHN D. MACARTHUR BEACH
</P>
<P>
   STATE PARK
</P>
<P>
   It encompasses 225 acres of uplands and another 535 acres of
submerged lands. Visitors can explore both maritime hammock
(seaside hardwood forest) and mangrove communities. A 1,600-foot
boardwalk spans Lake Worth Cove. Herons, ibises, roseate spoonbills
and ospreys haunt the wetlands, and at the beach end of the
boardwalk on the west side of the dunes lies a coastal hammock. A
trail winds through mixed temperate and subtropical trees,
including cabbage palms, mastic trees, gumbo limbos and strangler
figs. The park is named after the previous property owner, John D.
MacArthur, who donated it to the state in the 1970s. For more
information: John D. MacArthur Beach State Park, 10900 S.R. 703
(A1A), North Palm Beach, FL 33408; (561) 624-6950.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN U. LLOYD BEACH STATE RECREATION AREA
</P>
<P>
   Near Port Everglades in Broward County, this park covers 251
acres of green buffer between the Atlantic Ocean and the
Intracoastal Waterway. Named after Broward County's attorney, John
U. Lloyd, who was instrumental in acquiring the property, the park
boasts a wide, flat beach, shaded picnic areas and canoeing. For
more information: John U. Lloyd Beach State Recreation Area, 6503
N. Ocean Drive, Dania, FL 33004; (954) 923-2833.
</P>
<P>
   JONATHAN DICKINSON STATE PARK
</P>
<P>
   An enormous green firewall between rapidly developing Palm Beach
County and more sedate Martin County, it covers 11,500 acres and
offers camping, canoeing and bicycling, picnicking, fresh and
saltwater fishing and guided tours of the Loxahatchee River. The
44-passenger Loxahatchee Queen II takes visitors up the Loxahatchee
River to the pioneer homesite of Trapper Nelson, who came to the
area in the 1930s and lived off the land by trapping and selling
furs, becoming famous as the ``Wildman of the Loxahatchee.'' After
his death in 1968, the state acquired his land. Four scenic nature
trails and a bicycle trail wind through the park. Contact Jonathan
Dickinson State Park, 16450 S.E. Federal Highway, Hobe Sound, FL
33455; (561) 546-2771.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LUCIE INLET STATE PRESERVE
</P>
<P>
   It occupies the northern 928 acres of Jupiter Island and boasts
a 2.5-mile stretch of beach and mangrove-lined creeks. It is
accessible by boat. A 3,300-foot boardwalk meanders from the dock
to the beach. Along the way, you will traverse two coastal
hammocks. A protected reef runs south from the inlet for 4.7 miles.
More than 150 different species of fish can be seen, as well as
countless sponges, crabs and other marine life. Boating, canoeing,
diving and snorkeling are among the attractions. For more
information: St. Lucie Inlet State Preserve, c/o Jonathan Dickinson
State Park, 16450 S.E. Federal Highway, Hobe Sound, FL 33455; (561)
744-7603.
</P>
<P>
   SEBASTIAN INLET STATE PARK
</P>
<P>
   It covers over 600 acres and spans both sides of the inlet. Its
powerful tides and big waves can be dangerous, but surfers come
from far and wide to enjoy the big swells on the north side of the
inlet, or at ``Monster Hole'' on the southeast side. Swimmers can
enjoy the beach and a tranquil tidal pool. Snorkeling and camping
are popular, the fishing legendary. For more information: 9700
South A1A, Melbourne Beach, FL 32951; (407) 984-4852.

REPORTER FACES STUDENTS' ANGER AT ACCIDENT SITE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ As the tragedy unfolded at Texas A&AMP;M
University on Thursday, Sallie Turner of Fort Worth was in the
heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is the editor of ``The Battalion,'' the daily student
newspaper. A 1996 graduate of Arlington Heights High School in Fort
Worth, Turner is a senior journalism major.
</P>
<P>
   She had left the newspaper office around 1 a.m. Thursday after
completing work on the daily edition. She had less than two hours
to relax before a staff member phoned to tell her that a stack of
bonfire logs had collapsed with dozens of Aggies on top.
</P>
<P>
   Turner rushed to the site and began taking pictures, and said
she was attacked by students who had gathered to pray for the dead
and injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began taking pictures of the group when they started to
attack me,'' Turner said. ``They tore the lens cap off my camera
and hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Turner interrupted her reporting to give
interviews to various TV stations and networks, explaining the
Aggie bonfire tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Turner promised that the student newspaper will use the utmost
respect in covering the story.
</P>
<P>
   The paper had gone to press before the accident, but the front
page was pulled and a special edition was printed to inform the
43,000 students what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said she had been to the bonfire site Wednesday night to
admire the work of students who toiled around the clock to assemble
the structure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dropping a friend off at their car when I thought about
how I wished I could be out there helping,'' she said.

 &HT;    LENNY MAKES ABRUPT HALT, CONITNUES TO POUND EASTERN CARIBBEAN
 &HT;    (725&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Hurricane Lenny stopped dead in its
tracks and pounded the eastern Caribbean all day Thursday, spinning
out powerful winds and waves that smashed piers, tossed boats about
like toys and demolished beachfront homes.
</P>
<P>
   At least four people were confirmed dead from the storm, which
confounded forecasters by forming so late in the season and then
taking an unusual west-to-east track.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EST, Lenny was nearly stationary at latitude 18.1
north, longitude 63.2 west, just offshore of tiny St. Maarten.
Winds had dropped to 120 mph after peaking at 150 mph Wednesday.
Forecasters hoped the storm would resume a northeast track and
quickly clear the islands. There was no threat to the mainland U.S.
except for high surf, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean residents were just hoping the late-season menace
would finally go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty bad,'' said Paul Pyles, a 12-year resident of
Frederiksted on St. Croix's western tip, reached by telephone. ``We
don't have power and the cruise ship pier was damaged. I haven't
been out because there's a curfew, but ... I'd say overall we were
pretty fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland Redfield, an announcer for a St. Croix radio station
that broadcast non-stop reports, toured the island and found
relatively little damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did extraordinarily well,'' he said, citing building codes
that were toughened after several powerful storms over the past
decade. ``The roads are clear of debris, although we've been under
a curfew. We should be up to snuff and back to operation by
Thanksgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Redfield said there were no fatalities on St. Croix, contrary to
some media reports. Electric power had already been restored in
Christiansted, the island's largest town, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The news was likely to be much worse from islands further east,
which were punished as Lenny spun in place Thursday. Islands under
the bulls-eye included Anguilla, St. Barthelemy, Saba, St.
Eustatius, Nevis, St. Kitts, Montserrat and an island that is
divided between France and the Netherlands, called St. Maarten on
the Dutch side and St. Martin on the French side. The Dutch portion
faces the Caribbean and the capital, Philipsburg, was inundated by
Lenny's waves. Officials worried that heavy rains would cause the
Great Salt Pond in the middle of the town to overflow, worsening
the flooding. There were reports of smashed boats and one fatality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very dangerous situation,'' St. Maarten's Lt. Gov.
Dennis Richardson said Thursday. ``We expect conditions to get a
lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined population of both sides of St. Maarten is about
62,000. About 1,200 permanent residents live on Saba; 2,100 on St.
Eustatius; 3,400 on Montserrat; 5,000 on St. Barthelemy; 9,000 on
Anguilla and 42,000 combined on St. Kitts and Nevis.
</P>
<P>
   According to one news report, 100 tourists were evacuated from a
flooded beachfront hotel on Anguilla, a British territory, as
12-foot waves blasted the island's normally placid beaches.
</P>
<P>
   But Lenny's impact was felt as far away as Colombia, where two
fishermen drowned and hundreds of people were left homeless by
flooding and powerful waves.
</P>
<P>
   There was also damage from flooding and pounding waves along
Puerto Rico's south and east coasts, as well as on the nearby
islands of Culebra and Vieques. One Puerto Rican man died when he
fell while boarding up his windows, and a Russian freighter ran
aground near the entrance to San Juan Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny's massive waves raked islands across the Caribbean,
swamping boats against pilings and ripping some free from their
moorings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Huge surf destroyed four homes, chewed up roads and flooded
streets in the business district on Grenada, about 400 miles south
of the storm's center.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On St. Lucia, several people were left homeless when giant
waves destroyed their houses, while a gas station caught fire after
a short-circuit, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Three people were rescued from a harbor in Montserrat after
waves swamped their sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On St. Barthelemy, weather officials reported a wind gust to
124 mph at mid-day, while on nearby St. Maarten, gusts reached 108
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Airports on most islands remained closed, with dozens of
commercial flights cancelled. Some emergency medical officials flew
into St. Croix before the storm, but relief flights were unable to
reach the hardest-hit islands Thursday as airports could not
re-open because of high winds.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Lenny was another blow for a region that has been
ravaged by hurricanes over the past decade, including powerful
Hurricane Hugo in 1989, Marilyn in 1995, Georges in 1998 and a
weak-but-pesky Jose earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny was the eighth hurricane of 1999 and the fifth major
storm. Weather experts rate hurricanes as major when they reach
Category 3, meaning winds of at least 111 mph. Such storms are
capable of extensive damage.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny caught many normally storm-wary islanders off-guard. With
hurricane season winding down toward its Nov. 30 close and the
winter tourist season gearing up, many believed the storm _ which
formed out of a blob of disturbed weather near Jamaica early in the
week _ wouldn't amount to much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It snuck up on us so fast,'' said John Stout, who teaches at
the University of the Virgin Islands on St. Croix. ``We prepared
for a (Category) One or Two.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix was battered terribly by Hugo in 1989, with some 90
percent of the island's buildings damaged. If there was any luck
with Lenny for the 55,000 residents, it was that the storm struck
the island's south coast, which is less populated than the central,
hilly spine and the north coast.
</P>
<P>
   A giant oil refinery on the south shore run by Hovensa LLC was
shut down Tuesday as the storm approached but reportedly suffered
only minor damage.
</P>
<P>
   On the north coast in Christiansted, there were reports of
flooding and damage to the roof of one hotel. But some telephones
were working, and many residents felt things could've been much
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they just wished Lenny would finally move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're okay at the hotel, but it was very bad on the south
shore,'' said a clerk at the Buccaneer Hotel near Christiansted,
reached by telephone. ``It's still blowing. The hurricane is still
just sitting there.''

   KOSOVO-WINTER-$ADV20 _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The international
relief community is significantly behind schedule in preparing for
the Balkan winter. With frost covering the hills, nearly 20,000
families still haven't received basic materials they need to secure
their burned-out houses from the bitter cold. Food supplies also
are problematic as the narrow transportation corridor _ a two-lane
bridge between Macedonia and Kosovo _ into the battered province
has become hopelessly gridlocked. Additionally, aid organizations
are running far behind schedule in getting their own structures for
providing relief in place. (Roughton, Cox News Service). WITH

called Uighers, they protest Beijing's grasp on their resources and
autocratic rule in mostly quiet ways _ setting their clocks back
two hours to ``real'' time instead of Beijing time, as the Chinese
nearly 2,000 miles away have dictated, or by boycotting Chinese
restaurants. The radical fringes of the 8 million Uighurs continue
waging a hit-and-run campaign of violence from the base of an
underground Islamic party, which is Beijing's number one priority
to destroy. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service) WITH PHOTOS and

FOOD FOR THOUGHT :  WEIGH TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Monday, Nov. 22) 
By PHIL DAVIS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Go ahead and eat a little of everything in this food-rich
holiday season _ just be sure to put emphasis on little.
</P>
<P>
   That slice of pumpkin pie should be only 1 to 1{ inches at the
crust, roughly the size of a travel-size tube of toothpaste. And
that heaping helping of turkey and gravy should really only be
about 3 ounces of meat, the size of a deck of playing cards. The
gravy should only fill a ping-pong ball.
</P>
<P>
   Blasphemy, you say? Thanksgiving is supposed to be a feast. But
the feast, nutritionists say, should be a smorgasbord of delightful
tastes, not a gut-busting contest to see who can pack away the most
food.
</P>
<P>
   The key is to think small. It's called portion control _ a
recipe for survival that's not likely to sit well with
overindulgent Americans who live in a world where, at least when it
comes to food and cars, bigger is better.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, waistlines are getting bigger, too. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimate that half of all
Americans are overweight and that roughly 22 percent of the nation
is obese, defined as having fat comprise more than 20 percent of a
person's total body weight. It's a national epidemic with a simple
cause: America suffers from a calorie surplus and an exercise
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, portion control is the way to go,'' said Patty
Carbone, a registered dietitian at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center
in Woodland Hills. ``What you're doing is satisfying a need,
getting a taste _ because we all enjoy the taste of our foods _ but
you're not overdoing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists blame the popularity of fat-free foods for much of
the problem. When a wave of fat-free products hit the shelves in
the early 1990s, consumers figured if they avoided fatty foods,
they wouldn't gain weight.
</P>
<P>
   But the body doesn't see it that way. It takes in calories _ the
body's fuel _ and burns what it needs. The rest is packed away in
the form of fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many mixed messages,'' said Carrie Latt Wiatt, a
registered nutritionist and Hollywood's ``diet diva'' to the stars.
``I say a calorie is a calorie is a calorie. Bring them all down.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt's book, ``Portion Savvy'' (Pocket Books; $24), stands out
among other diet books because it espouses portion control over the
all-protein, all-grapefruit or all-cabbage soup diets that make
nutritionists cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistics show that 90 to 95 percent of the weight people
lose on any those kinds of diets will be regained, so what's the
point?'' said Karen Collins, a registered dietitian who works with
the Washington, D.C.-based American Institute for Cancer Research.
</P>
<P>
   But studies also show people are lousy at sizing up what they
eat. And since not everyone can afford to hire Wiatt to deliver
properly portioned gourmet meals each day, learning how much is too
much is going to take a little homework.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips on learning to eyeball proper portions:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Use visual cues. A 3-ounce serving of meat or protein is
roughly the size of a deck of cards, a woman's palm (fingers not
included) or a cassette tape. A serving of starch _ mashed
potatoes, corn, etc. _ should equal a tennis ball. A baked potato
should be the size of a woman's fist. And a fruit cup should equal
about six cotton balls.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox! Measure it out. It's tough to imagine what half a cup of
corn looks like. Take time to measure out the proper portions
(which are listed on the nutrition label) and size them up. After a
while, it will become easy to eyeball the proper portion. Another
suggestion: Dish out a meal as you would normally eat it, then
measure out the proper portions. The excess food, or calories, was
probably headed straight for your gut or thighs.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox! Remember: Bigger is not always better. When eating out,
split an entree with a friend or ask for a doggie bag up front so
you can portion out the proper amounts before you start eating. A
typical 12-ounce steak is about four times the proper portion size.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox! Go green. Fill up on green vegetables such as broccoli,
peas, green beans and lettuce. ``If there is not a sauce or gravy,
you can have as much as you like,'' Carbone said. ``Light on the
butter, please.''
</P>
<P>
   !bbox! Listen to your body. Stop eating when you feel satisfied,
not full. ``Sometimes we're thinking we've had enough when we can't
eat another bite or we don't want anymore,'' Collins said. ``But
when you can't eat another bite, you've already overeaten.''
Instead of eating something just because it tastes good, save it
for later when you're actually hungry _ the body's signal it needs
more fuel for energy.
</P>
<P>
   !!bbox!Take a walk. Unfortunately, just cutting back on the
calories won't do the trick because the body will consume muscle as
well as fat. This means a feast _ at Thanksgiving or any time of
the year _ should be followed by a walk. The standard prescription
for normal exercise is at least 20 minutes of exercise that boosts
your heart rate three to five days a week. In this case, more is
better _ especially for people packing extra pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People somehow have the idea that an important part of the
holidays is getting stuffed,'' Collins said. ``To be honest, if
people overeat on this one day, it's going to have very little
impact on their weight. But we continue this mode of thinking from
November at least through January, and for many people it continues
365 days a year and that's a problem.''

`FELICIA'S JOURNEY' LEADS AWAY FROM INNOCENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Felicia's Journey'' suggests a depth of directing skill that
one might not have expected from Atom Egoyan (''The Sweet
Hereafter, Exotica''). Sure, he's used a splintered storytelling
style to layer the events that bring together his protagonists, a
tortured leading man (Bob Hoskins this time) and a suffering young
woman, Felicia (Elaine Cassidy). It's another story of innocence
lost, as embodied by a young girl. But Egoyan's fascination with
that theme plays here as much less of a downer. It's as if getting
out of Canada _ his native land, where he's made his previous films
_ has done him some good.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Hilditch (Hoskins) lives his life as a poseur. He runs a
food-processing factory in Birmingham, England, tasting all the
dishes that the plant sends into the marketplace. ``Food is love,''
he says, with a forced twinkle, and his full jowls and stocky frame
indicate that he's had a lot of love. As we learn in flashbacks,
too much love. His mother (Arsinee Khanjian) was a famous TV
cooking-show host and was stuffing him like a Christmas goose,
insulating Hilditch in a world that seemed to be made of tomato
aspic and pink icing _ a world he still inhabits. Every night, he
goes home and prepares a meal that could feed all of London,
following the directions of his late mother _ he watches her on
video _ to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine _ she's the archetypal Irish slip of a lass _ can't
enforce innocence in her life. The young man who seduces her _
offering her the affection she can't get from her stern father _
disappears, telling her he's leaving Ireland for England to seek
work. But the boy's family _ and the entire countryside _ disown
him; he's gone off to join the British army. Her dogged search for
her lost lover leads Felicia to an area near Hilditch's factory.
Hilditch takes the forlorn young woman in, beginning the
cat-and-mouse game that Hilditch is addicted to playing with
desperate, lost runaway girls.
</P>
<P>
   By toying with irony, instead of clinging to the spiritual
desolation that marks all of his other work, Egoyan has made a much
more compelling film. Hilditch and Felicia need to be saved more
than anything, but mordant humor gives ``Felicia's Journey'' a
resonance his work hasn't had before. Generally, Egoyan's films are
easy to shake off _ the misery is too meticulously coordinated. But
there are a few offbeat moments that aren't as laboriously worked
out, a sign that he's developing as a writer and director. (He
adapted the film from a novel by William Trevor and fleshed it out
in a way Russell Banks' ``Hereafter'' apparently didn't allow for.)
Hoskins is remarkably subtle; he's not an actor who works totally
from the head, and his full-bodied investment in the role gives
presence and weight to the film. Let's hope Egoyan uses him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicia's Journey'' is rated PG-13 for adult language, adult
situations and violence.

 &HT;    EDUCATION DEPARTMENT MESSES UP ITS ACCOUNTING
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Education Secretary Richard Riley admitted Thursday
that his department had flunked its audit for the 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The department ``lacked adequate financial management systems,
reports and oversight to prepare timely and accurate financial
systems,'' concluded Ernst &AMP; Young LLP, the big accounting firm
hired by the department's inspector general to audit the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working hard on the (fiscal year) 1999 audit to be
released in March 2000, and we're hoping it will show clear
progress,'' Riley told reporters. The department oversees more than
$70 billion a year in spending on operating costs and on loans and
grants to students, schools, school districts, contractors and
states.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said the biggest problem was that the department purchased
a new computerized general ledger system that doesn't work right.
He said that contributed to two other problems: the department's
failure to meet deadlines for supplying reliable information to the
auditors, and its inability to comply with new accounting
requirements that went into effect for the first time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat wistfully, he noted that the clean audit report
received by the department the previous year had been the first in
its three decades of existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 12 years of the Reagan-Bush administration, the department
had never received an unqualified (clean) audit opinion,'' recalled
Riley, who came into office alongside President Clinton in 1993.
``We undertook a comprehensive effort to improve financial
management and last year ended up with the first unqualified audit
opinion in the department's history, covering 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   That accomplishment was ballyhooed at the time. But this year
the department disclosed little despite constant complaints by Rep.
Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., about delays in releasing the audit, which
was supposed to be finished in March.
</P>
<P>
   The audit report was sent to Congress Thursday by the
department's office of inspector general. From the report, it
appears that department officials repeatedly convinced the auditors
to give them more time to reduce the number of conflicts between
various sets of books.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a half-billion-dollar transaction had been recorded
backwards, with the result that the books were off by more than $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are troubling, and Mr. Hoekstra and other members
of his subcommittee will no doubt be looking at it when Congress
returns in January,'' said Dan Lara, spokesman for the House
Committee on Education and the Workforce.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president's domestic adviser, Bruce
Reed, said he knew the audit report had been delayed, but did not
know that the auditors had refused to certify that the books were
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Secretary Riley's done an excellent job of making the
department work,'' Reed said.

 &HT;    Fla. soccer league requires parents to be good sports
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A local athletic association has a novel
idea for the 6,000 kids in its youth leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Make good sportsmanship mandatory _ for the parents.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Jan. 1, parents who want their children to play in one
of Jupiter-Tequesta Athletic Association's six sports must take a
half-hour course in how to behave at a youth league game and must
sign a code of parental ethics.
</P>
<P>
   If a parent doesn't attend the class (and pay the $5 fee), his
or her child doesn't play.
</P>
<P>
   The JTAA is the first youth group in the nation to require
parents to attend an ethics class, although 23 other leagues from
Minnesota to Texas will encourage parents to attend volunteer
sessions offered by the Parents Association for Youth Sports, based
in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea because a lot of parents open their
mouths a little too much with their opinions,'' said 14-year-old
Nicole Balogh, who plays softball, basketball and soccer in JTAA
leagues. ``In some cases they hurt the players' feelings. They put
other players down.''
</P>
<P>
   She's talking not only of parents of other teams' players, but
also of parents of her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to try to de-escalate the intensity that's being
shown by the parents at these games,'' said Jeff Leslie, JTAA
president and father of four. ``Parents are losing their
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, we've never had a parent physical
confrontation, but we've had parent shouting matches,'' he said.
The JTAA's action highlights the growing national problem of
violence in youth sports, often among coaches and parents, but even
between players.
</P>
<P>
   Many youth leagues require their coaches to attend four- or
six-hour certification courses that show coaches how to work with
children. The courses emphasize player health, safety, the role of
a coach and the skills involved in their particular sport. To
complete certification, coaches must also sign an ethics pledge to
avoid confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Engh, who pioneered coaching certification in 1981, said
the parental ethics class is merely the next step. ``It's finally
come to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of parents screaming at coaches, other parents and
players are legion and more frequent in recent years, said Engh,
who is president and founder of the National Youth Sports Alliance,
the parent of PAYS.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat's off to Jupiter. Ultimately this will benefit millions
of children in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He blames parents prompting kids to specialize in one sport too
early after those parents read about major league pitchers with $84
million contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a kid's bat costs $250, a parent expects that kid to hit
the ball,'' said Jupiter Recreation Director Russ Ruskay, who
supports the parental ethics plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Jupiter-Tequesta plan, at least one parent per family
must watch a 19-minute video, go over a parents' handbook and sign
the Parents Code of Ethics. For their $5, parents will receive a
PAYS newsletter quarterly and get a coupon for a medium pizza at a
Jupiter Pizza Hut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create peer pressure among the parents,'' Leslie
said. Organizers anticipate some opposition from parents who use
youth sports as a baby-sitting service and who might be reluctant
to attend the classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents might think they don't need it, but you can see
yourself in this video,'' said Nicole's mother, Cindy Balogh, who
heads the JTAA softball league and has three sports-playing
children.
</P>
<P>
   Other leagues have taken a less drastic approach. The Soccer
Association of Boca Raton compels parents and coaches to sign a
code of conduct designed to protect children from overbearing,
hyper-competitive adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they act up, we just show them the form and say, `Is that
your signature?''' said Andy Goddard, head of the association for
3,000 kids. ``I tell everyone that we put the kids first and the
parents and coaches are second. That kind of puts everything in
perspective.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WARNS CONSUMERS ABOUT Y2K SCAMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Con artists, relying on public fears of potential
Y2K-related computer glitches, might call consumers with tales of
financial doom this holiday season in an effort to get their
credit-card and account information, the Justice Department warned
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. said the agency has
received an undisclosed number of reports of telephone calls from
people purporting to be from banks, credit-card companies and even
the Internal Revenue Service. The schemers say they need the
consumer's personal information due to so-called Y2K computer
problems that might erase financial data on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem refers to the threat of Jan. 1 malfunctions by
computers and other high-tech consumer goods created in the late
1900s that have not been programmed to read 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Federal, state and local governments as well as companies have
spent great time and expense to ensure that their high-tech
equipment continues to operate after the new year. But many
household goods also have date-dependent programs that might be
affected, such as television sets and central heating and
air-conditioning systems.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the public's concern with this potential difficulty next
year, con artists posing as bankers have called to say, ``We've got
Y2K problems here at the bank and we need your account number so we
can move your money into a special account or bond fund to protect
it while we fix the problem,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, false credit-card agents have told customers that
their cards' magnetic stripes are not ``Y2K compliant'' and that
the ``agents'' need the card numbers so they can send replacement
stripes to be put over the old ones, Holder added.
</P>
<P>
   Callers have also said, ``I'm with the IRS, and we're conducting
a computer test because of Y2K problems. We need your Social
Security number to confirm your identification,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once armed with this personal information, con artists can tap
into the victims' bank and credit-card accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said he suspects the problem of Y2K telemarketing fraud
will increase as the new year approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not seen a major upswing in the number of complaints
about Y2K fraud, but we are anticipating that as we get closer to
the end of this year more criminals will try to con consumers, and
(we) want consumers to know what to look for and how to respond to
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holder added that old people and individuals who have already
fallen for telephone scams might be especially vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen clear evidence yet that they are targeting
just the elderly,'' Holder said of the con artists. ``But
certainly, some telemarketing outfits will have ... lists that are
heavily focused on the older population and people who have been
scammed before and that may give them more of a vehicle to target
the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Justice Department has a history of prosecuting
telephone fraud, Holder said the agency is well-prepared to handle
the Y2K cons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we may be entering the 21st century, but these schemes are
just dressed up old-fashioned telemarketing fraud in high-tech
clothing,'' he said. ``But old-fashioned or high-tech telemarketing
fraud is a federal crime with very stiff penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat the fraud, the department instructs visitors to its
Internet site at www.usdoj.gov to be wary of unknown callers
seeking information related to money. The agency tells people who
suspect potential telemarketing fraud to call the National Fraud
Information Center at 800-876-7060 or the Federal Trade Commission
Consumer Response Center at 202-382-4357 or 202-326-3128.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a general proposition, consumers should always take the
time to investigate carefully any request or demand for money that
any telemarketer makes, and should never be rushed or forced into
making a hasty decision,'' the department states.

mouths a little too much with their opinions,'' said 14-year-old
Nicole Balogh, who plays softball, basketball and soccer in JTAA
leagues. ``In some cases they hurt the players' feelings. They put
other players down.''
</P>
<P>
   She's talking not only of parents of other teams' players, but
also of parents of her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to try to de-escalate the intensity that's being
shown by the parents at these games,'' said Jeff Leslie, JTAA
president and father of four. ``Parents are losing their
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, we've never had a parent physical
confrontation, but we've had parent shouting matches,'' he said.
The JTAA's action highlights the growing national problem of
violence in youth sports, often among coaches and parents, but even
between players.
</P>
<P>
   Many youth leagues require their coaches to attend four- or
six-hour certification courses that show coaches how to work with
children. The courses emphasize player health, safety, the role of
a coach and the skills involved in their particular sport. To
complete certification, coaches must also sign an ethics pledge to
avoid confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Engh, who pioneered coaching certification in 1981, said
the parental ethics class is merely the next step. ``It's finally
come to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of parents screaming at coaches, other parents and
players are legion and more frequent in recent years, said Engh,
who is president and founder of the National Youth Sports Alliance,
the parent of PAYS.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat's off to Jupiter. Ultimately this will benefit millions
of children in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He blames parents prompting kids to specialize in one sport too
early after those parents read about major league pitchers with $84
million contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a kid's bat costs $250, a parent expects that kid to hit
the ball,'' said Jupiter Recreation Director Russ Ruskay, who
supports the parental ethics plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Jupiter-Tequesta plan, at least one parent per family
must watch a 19-minute video, go over a parents' handbook and sign
the Parents Code of Ethics. For their $5, parents will receive a
PAYS newsletter quarterly and get a coupon for a medium pizza at a
Jupiter Pizza Hut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to create peer pressure among the parents,'' Leslie
said. Organizers anticipate some opposition from parents who use
youth sports as a baby-sitting service and who might be reluctant
to attend the classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents might think they don't need it, but you can see
yourself in this video,'' said Nicole's mother, Cindy Balogh, who
heads the JTAA softball league and has three sports-playing
children.
</P>
<P>
   Other leagues have taken a less drastic approach. The Soccer
Association of Boca Raton compels parents and coaches to sign a
code of conduct designed to protect children from overbearing,
hyper-competitive adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they act up, we just show them the form and say, `Is that
your signature?''' said Andy Goddard, head of the association for
3,000 kids. ``I tell everyone that we put the kids first and the
parents and coaches are second. That kind of puts everything in
perspective.''

ANG LEE SPEAKS ABOUT THE `DEVIL' 
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: Not for use before Tuesday, Nov. 23)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taiwanese director Ang Lee has never been one to shy away from
looking at other cultures in his films. He examined the emptiness
of the sexual revolution in 1970s suburban America in ``The Ice
Storm'' and the confining constraints of Jane Austen's England in
``Sense and Sensibility.'' In his latest film, ``Ride With the
Devil,'' Lee tackles his biggest challenge to date: the American
Civil War. For a director who had never made a movie about people
with dirty fingernails, it was a radical shift in material.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, even with its battle scenes and horseback chases,
``Ride With the Devil'' doesn't veer far from the territory that
Lee has staked out in all of his work. He is still obsessed with
people's humanity and how character is tested during moments of
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's important about Ang's films,'' says Lee's
writing and producing partner James Schamus. ``No matter what
language they speak, they are about people relating to each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Those relations are a little less civil than usual in ``Ride
With the Devil.'' Adapted from Daniel Woodrell's novel, ``Woe to
Live On,'' the film tells the story of a group of Southern
Bushwackers engaged in guerrilla warfare along the Kansas-Missouri
border. Confronting an encroaching Union army and the fear of
losing the only way of life they have ever known, the group of
young Southerners struggle to come of age in the worst possible
time in American history.
</P>
<P>
   For Lee, who grew up in Taiwan among older people who complained
that their nation was becoming ``Americanized,'' the Civil War
represents the beginning to today's world of democracy and
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees not only won territory, but a victory for a whole
way of life and thinking,'' Lee says. ``It changed everyone.
Everyone won the right to fulfill themselves. This is the Yankee
principle. As a Taiwanese, I can identify with the Southerners who
looked on as the Yankees change their way of life forever. But at
the same time, I identify even more strongly with the outsiders
like the slaves who grasp and fight for their freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Schamus: ``In many ways the book and the movie are
post-Vietnam rewrites of `Huckleberry Finn.' The book, written from
the point of view of a white Southerner, was, at the same time,
liberating, focusing on the emancipation of all people in the
South.''
</P>
<P>
   The film focuses on three outsiders: a young German immigrant, a
shy woman and a slave fighting for the Southerners. For the part of
the sweet, Southern belle, Lee and Schamus rolled the dice and cast
folk-pop singer Jewel in her first movie role.
</P>
<P>
   With most other directors, the move would smack of stunt
casting, but Lee was looking for a fresh face and a woman who could
convey honesty and a lack of pretension. And Jewel's childhood made
her seem ideal for a character living in what was then the American
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``She grew up in Alaska, lived in a car and rode horses,''
Schamus says. ``She's articulate, independent and intelligent. She
is the character. But that made it difficult for her, too, because
she had to find some way to make Sue Lee different from Jewel.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, for Jewel, character development was the easy part. It
was the technical aspects of acting _ basic things like hitting a
mark _ that threw her for a loop and prompted her to call Lee after
two days of filming to say, ``I think you made a bad decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say? I sucked,'' Jewel says. ``There's nothing like
a good old sucking to teach you a little humility. I had spent a
fair amount of time with Ang preparing for acting, but we never
covered the technical things. So I thought hitting the mark was
like I was supposed to hit some emotional mark for my character,
you know? Let's just say there was a huge learning curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Tobey Maguire, who plays the movie's central character, the
young German immigrant: ``Having worked with Ang before (he starred
in Lee's last film, `The Ice Storm'), I trust him 100 percent. So
when he said he was casting Jewel, I figured he knew what he was
doing. During those first couple of weeks, though, I had my moments
of doubt. But as the days went on, I was impressed. She took a
great challenge for her first job and she did great.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, famous for giving his actors thick syllabuses during
pre-production, made sure Jewel and her castmates were completely
prepared. Required reading for ``Ride With the Devil'' included
Stephen Crane's ``The Red Badge of Courage,'' Mark Twain's ``The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' biographies of Southern
Bushwackers, scholarly studies of slavery, Frederick Douglas'
``Narrative'' and Sir Walter Scott's ``Waverly,'' a chivalric novel
popular among Southern men of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The voluminous background was essential, says Tony Award-winning
actor Jeffrey Wright, who plays the slave Daniel Holt. Before
making ``Ride With the Devil,'' Wright says he would assume the
rare stories of slaves fighting for the South were just propaganda
concocted by the Confederacy. But there are a number of documented
stories about blacks who fought side-by-side with their owners. The
reasons were many, Schamus says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some wanted to prove to white Southerners that blacks could be
as loyal and trustworthy as whites, in the hope that after the war,
if the South won, the treatment of blacks would improve,'' Schamus
says. ``Some were fiercely loyal to their owners. Some saw fighting
as a welcome relief from the drudgery of plantation life. And
probably for most, fighting on the lines meant being closer to the
North _ and that much closer to freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's slave is just one of the movie's main characters
looking for freedom. After several campaigns with the Bushwackers,
Maguire's immigrant grows weary of the bloodshed and longs to
escape. And Jewel's Sue Lee faces loss upon loss and seeks a
simple, safe harbor away from the brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a film about emancipation _ for blacks and whites,''
Wright says. ``It's about emancipation from injustice. And I think
that theme still resonates strongly today.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright says he is disappointed that African-American audiences
typically shy away from films dealing with slavery. (``Beloved''
was the most recent example.) He calls ``Ride With the Devil'' a
``movie that had to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We blacks still have to emancipate ourselves from certain
resonances of our slave history,'' Wright says. ``To ignore that
history is dangerous and disempowering. We need to recognize the
bitterness of the struggle and the glory of our triumph. If you do
that and tap into that power, then you, as a race, live on.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, while Lee and Schamus aren't out to give moviegoers a
history lesson with their movie, they do see the Civil War period
as a key turning point in world history.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me, `How is American culture winning in
Taiwan?''' Lee says. ``And the answer is, they get to the kids and
they promise them freedom. And it's a freedom and at the same time
a subjugation. And it's a subjugation worth fighting sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what people in this film are doing. A Yankee invasion
is threatening the Southerners' way of life and the things they
stood for. Yet, at the same time, that invasion brought with it
principles like emancipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting is that even as America seems to conquer
the world with the promise of freedom, it still hasn't fully
conquered itself or achieved true freedom for all of its people.
It's that ongoing struggle that we set out to express in this
film.''

   COPELAND-2000 (Undated) _ Aaron Copland, born in a tenement flat
two floors above the dry goods store his Jewish Lithuanian father
ran in Brooklyn, N.Y., would have been 100 on November 14 next
year. And the country Copland loved, the only country he ever felt
comfortable in, with the possible exception of Mexico, has already
started the party. Some 200 events, presented by institutions
ranging from the Philadelphia Orchestra, to Martha Graham Dance
Company, to the U.S. Army Field Band, to the Etowah Youth Orchestra
in Gasden, Alabama will be part of an international commemoration
called ``Copland 2000,'' spearheaded by the composer's ever
vigilant and eternally grateful publishing house, Boosey &AMP; Hawkes.

   MODERN-MUSEUM-ART (New York) _ ``Modern Starts: People, Places
and Things,'' is the first of three enormous shows with which the
Museum of Modern Art is fanning the siecle, as it were, while also
examining its unparalleled collection and the way it has
historically been shaped and presented. (``Places'' and ``Things''
are on view through March 14, ``People'' through Feb. 1.) With some
additions fore and aft, ``Modern Starts,'' concentrates on
1880-1920 (the second part, opening in March, looks at 1920-1960;
the third, which arrives next fall, at 1960-2000.) Its organizing
team, headed by John Elderfield, chief curator-at-large, and Peter
Reed, the curator of the department of design and architecture,
decided to abandon the familiar narrative, or any narrative at all,
and let art history take the hindmost. By Roberta Smith. (Moved).

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HOFFMAN-FILMS (Undated) _ Philip Seymour Hoffman, 32, the stocky
blond character actor from the suburbs of Rochester, N.Y., who at
the moment seems a candidate to become the last hot actor of the
20th century. OK, OK, that's sort of a trick; the clock is ticking
fast, and there's no new Skeet Ulrich with a film about to pop out
of the pipeline, and being the last anything of the century is
quite a matter of chance. But it is true that Hoffman is going to
end the year in sensational style, appearing in three
buzz-generating movies _ along with ``Flawless,'' in which he
appears opposite Robert De Niro, he is in Paul Thomas Anderson's
``Magnolia'' and Anthony Minghella's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
Hoffman is not likely to cop a People magazine cover in the next
couple of weeks, but by January, an awful lot of people are going
to know who he is. By Jamie Malanowski. (Moved). Photo.

   DIGITAL-VIDEO-DISC (Undated) _ It's odd about DVD. With three
million players in use, the digital video disc has emerged as the
fastest growing format ever, and that includes the audio CD and the
videocassette. Yet, according to one industry study, 40 percent of
the American public doesn't know what DVD is. By Peter M. Nichols.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PRICE-THEATER (New York) _ Though I saw the original production
of Arthur Miller's ``The Price'' with Pat Hingle and Arthur Kennedy
as the brothers, I have no memory of being as moved and as
peculiarly cheered by it as I was by the current production. As
staged at the Royal Theater by James Naughton (a Tony winner for
his grand performance as Billy Flynn in ``Chicago'', this
``Price,'' like Michael Mayer's recent production of ``A View From
the Bridge,'' realizes all of the text's dangerous tensile
strength. It is both immensely satisfying and, in a way that
straight plays are not often cited for, entertaining. By Vincent
Canby. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LION-KING-THEATER (London) _ Of all the current theater plays in
London, what has left even The Sunday Times's intellectually
rigorous John Peter crying ``wonderful, wonderful'' is Julie
Taymor's restaging of her Broadway production of Disney's ``Lion
King'' at the Lyceum Theater: a judgment confirmed by reports that
the show is booking until next September and that some Londoners
are mortgaging their mothers to meet the prices the scalpers are
asking for seats. By Benedict Nightingale. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TOGETHER-THEATER (New York) _ Bob Morris talks with Carol
Burnett and Ruthie Henshall, who are appearing together in the
revue ``Putting It Together,'' which opens Sunday at the Ethel
Barrymore Theater in a new production of the Stephen Sondheim song
collection. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BALLET-HISPANICO (New York) _ When Tina Ramirez established the
Ballet Hispanico school and company in 1970, it was a revolutionary
act. Hispanics not only had few dance schools, they also had
trouble getting into dance companies, an almost unimaginable
situation now with the dazzling Hispanic dancers in mainstream
ballet and modern companies. This fall Ms. Ramirez and her
groundbreaking enterprise won two major honors. In September, she
received the Hispanic Heritage Award for Education at the Kennedy
Center in Washington. Since its founding, almost 10,000 children
have studied at the Ballet Hispanico School, which now enrolls 600
students yearly for classes in Spanish, modern and jazz dance and
ballet. By Valerie Gladstone. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-DANCE (Undated) _ There could be little argument that
``A Celebration of 100 Years of American Dance on Film'' was one of
the most wildly improbable dance events of 1999. But the program
also suggested profound changes in the nature of dance in America,
and in the relationship between dance and the electronic media. By
Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FELDMAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ After the Flux Quartet's recent
premiere performance of Morton Feldman's String Quartet No. 2 in
its complete six-hour version, the three orchestral works on a new
Feldman disc seem like Webernian essays in atomistic compression.
Feldman wrote few works for orchestra, yet in the three works here
_ ``Coptic Light,'' ``Piano and Orchestra'' and ``Cello and
Orchestra'' (Argo 448 513-2; CD) _ the more varied palette provides
an ideal entry point into his unique sound world, less daunting and
ascetic than the composer's chamber music. By Lawrence A. Johnson.

   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MIDNITE-VULTURES-ALBUM (Undated) _ Laughter is the immediate
response to most of the songs on Beck Hansen's fifth album,
``Midnite Vultures'' _ so much so that it could be called a comedy
record. But it's a comedy record in the sense that intelligent
directors make comedy films: it's one big aesthetic disposition,
rather than the series of bulletlike jokes on what are commonly
called comedy records by the likes of Adam Sandler and Chris Rock.
``Midnite Vultures'' is funny without making actual jokes. By Ben
Ratliff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIAL-ART (Undated) _ Millennial thinking resonates through
American politics, from Manifest Destiny to the ``vision thing''
any presidential hopeful is still required to spin out. It has
always been there in high art: in the nationalist allegories of
Hudson River School landscape painting, in Social Realism with its
demand for a new order, in Abstract Expressionism with its
commitment to the sublime. And nowhere is millennialism more
consistently explored than in vernacular culture. This fact makes
``Millennial Dreams: Vision and Prophecy in American Folk Art,''
organized by Gerald C. Wertkin at the Museum of American Folk Art
through May 14, one of the few genuinely timely museum offerings of
the season. By Holland Cotter. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUFFLER-MEN-ART (Los Angeles) _ Produced by mechanics in the
shops where they work, muffler men are being made as advertising
art, proliferating as roadside attractions outside the shops
throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Their makers _ most
are Hispanic _ repaint them frequently to keep them looking shiny
new. But they weather fast, lasting for no more than a couple of
years. So far, very few figures appear to have survived long enough
to show up in flea markets and art shows, and that may explain why
most people have no idea what muffler men are. Now muffler men are
moving into the world of art. In an exhibition at the Fowler Museum
of Cultural History at the University of California at Los Angeles,
``Muffler Men, Munecos and Other Welded Wonders,'' is the first
museum exhibition devoted entirely to these figures. On display
through April 28 are 34 metal images of people, space creatures and
animals. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   TV-MARY-AND-RHODA (New York) _ From 1970 to 1977, as Mary
Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern, Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper
made ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' one of the most successful
series in television history. Now they are back together making
``Mary and Rhoda,'' an ABC television movie that began as an idea
for a series and may yet lead to one. In the film, Mary and Rhoda
reconnect in New York, where they both have daughters in college.

   NY-RADIO (New York) _ As the WNYC radio station celebrates its
75th anniversary, it faces not only continued high payments for its
broadcasting license but a backbreaking 200 percent hike in charges
from National Public Radio for syndication of several programs,
including the acclaimed news and feature series ``Morning Edition''
and ``All Things Considered.'' The miracle is that they seem to be
pulling it off. By Valerie Gladstone. (Moved). Photo.

   BROKER-DEATHS (New York) _ The Oct. 25 killing in New Jersey of
two stock promoters exposes a seamier side of Wall Street, a world
of low-priced stocks and high-priced dreams, of grimy offices and
sham companies, of swindlers and touts who prey on average people
trying to grab the brass ring in the greatest bull market in
American history. A primer on how the deals are done. By Leslie

 &HT;    Home Depot splits stock, raises dividend 50%
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot shareholders can stop biting their nails.
</P>
<P>
   After months of anticipation, the Atlanta-based retailer
announced a 3-for-2 stock split on Thursday. Home Depot also
increased its quarterly dividend 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company said stockholders of record on Dec. 2 will be issued
1.5 shares for each share held. Those additional stocks will be
distributed Dec. 30. After the split, the number of shares
outstanding will increase to about 2.22 billion from about 1.48
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Following the news, Home Depot stock closed at a 52-week high of
$83.50, up $3.56 1/4. The stock has risen 36 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Stock splits do not affect the value of investors' holdings;
they are akin to slicing the same pie into more pieces. But
historically, companies that split their stock see a greater price
gain over time than those that don't.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming split will be the 13th for Home Depot since it sold
shares to the public in 1981. The last, a 2-for-1 split, came on
May 27, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly cash dividend was raised to 6 cents per pre-split
share from 4 cents, payable Dec. 16 to stockholders of record on
Dec. 2. The dividend is equal to 4 cents per share after the split.

 &HT;    Second chance for specialty tools
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do-it-yourselfers, you know the drill all too well.
</P>
<P>
   The remodeled kitchen looks great. The new bathroom is gorgeous.
But the garage is a bulging graveyard of specialty tools you'll
never use again.
</P>
<P>
   There's a second chance for those tile cutters and wet saws at
ReTool in Kennesaw, on Cobb Parkway. ReTool, which opened its first
store in metro Atlanta this week, aims to put a recycled spin on
the growing home improvement market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to sell a tool that you don't need, instead of
just letting it gather dust in the basement or the garage,'' said
ReTool owner Ben Boston
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that philosophy is the soul of ReTool, where
do-it-yourselfers can buy, sell and trade anything from jig saws to
jumper cables. The store, set up to look like a chock-full
workshop, sells hand tools, power tools and shop tools. There's
plenty of goods for mechanics and contractors, too.
</P>
<P>
   ReTool is a new franchise from Minneapolis-based Grow Biz
International, which calls itself the largest resale company in the
country. Its other concepts include Play It Again Sports, Music Go
Round and Computer Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of ReTool is the price, said Boston, who owns and
operates the shop with his wife, Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tools sell for a fraction of their original cost, he
said. For example, a used Craftsman belt sander may sell for $35,
about half the original price tag. Hammers go for less than five
bucks, and $1 can get a used screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 percent of ReTool's merchandise is bought from
individuals. The rest comes from factory overruns or closeouts.
Some tools are reconditioned.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other Grow Biz chains, ReTool is designed for a
national rollout. The franchise will end the year with a dozen
stores in the East and Midwest. Ultimately, there's room for 500
stores or more across the country, said Ted Manley, president and
chief operating officer of Grow Biz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard in the franchising business to predict (growth),
because you have to find the right owners to operate the stores
first,'' Manley said. The cost to open a ReTool is between $110,000
and $161,000. Grow Biz gets 4 percent of the store's gross sales.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, an avid woodworker, gave up a long-time job at Columbian
Chemicals in Marietta to run the ReTool shop. Tired of nonstop
traveling, Boston spotted an ad for the franchise in a woodworking
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this spring, the couple combed hundreds of garage
sales, sometimes as many as 30 in a day, to gather enough inventory
to open the store. Now most of the merchandise will come from
individuals, the Bostons said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ReTool will certainly get some of the same customers
that Home Depot, Lowe's and Sears does, Boston does not see the
giant chains as competition. If anything, they're good for
business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at some of the brands in here,'' Boston said, pointing to
a wall of used power drills, mostly found at garage sales. ``Most
of this stuff originally came from Home Depot or Lowe's. ''

 &HT;    VOTING IN THE DARK TO SPEND $390 BILLION: NO ONE IS SURE WHAT'S
INCLUDED
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Strewn around an office just off the floor of the
House of Representatives Thursday were bits and pieces of a $390
billion budget to run much of the U.S. civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists, congressional aides and reporters stood
elbow-to-elbow, poring over a single copy of the 11-inch high
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   With voting on the measure just hours away, even the lawmakers
could not say for sure what lurked in its thousands of pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I defy you to tell me what's in it,'' declared Rep. David
Obey, D-Wisc. on the House floor. As ranking Democrat on the
appropriations committee that wrote the bill, he was in a better
position to know than most.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he told his colleagues, ``Long after this bill is done,
we will be trying to find out what's in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainty about the contents, the bill passed the
House 296-135 and headed for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   More than a month behind schedule, negotiators for the House,
Senate and White House had struck the concluding deals in the early
hours of Thursday morning. The bill wrapped five of the 13 annual
appropriations bills that remained to be enacted into one
``omnibus'' piece of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   If many of the final details were still not yet evident, the
general character of the giant spending bill was plain: It included
something for every state and, most particularly, for the districts
of the key congressional members of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   By a preliminary count, the Labor and Health and Human Services
part of the legislation had 152 items that lawmakers had
``earmarked'' for their home districts. That's more than double the
62 counted last year by the office of Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a
self-assigned watchdog for such ``pork-barrelling'' by his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Notations on the spending bill showed pages of typed add-ons and
dollar amounts crossed out and, in most cases, replaced by bigger
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For conservatives who had hoped that the Republican-controlled
Congress would trim back government, the bill is the latest
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans did pretty well in the first few years they took
over Congress,'' said Marshall Wittmann (cq), congressional analyst
at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, they've now lapsed into the old ways of doing
business in Washington, which is, spend for your district, protect
your seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the the spending bill, Wittmann said, ``It's easier
to find Pokemon cards than spending cuts in this bill.'' He
ridiculed the 0.38 percent spending rollback for most government
program _ less than a half penny per dollar.
</P>
<P>
   However, Coburn said what bothered him was that Congress did not
roll back its own $4,600 raise. As of Jan. 1, members will make
$141,300 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to change that,'' the Oklahoma lawmaker said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted it would take days before he and other budget
watchers can grasp all that's in the spending legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In one margin of the drafted agreement was typed, without
elaboration: ``$2 million for the University of Mississippi
phytomedical project; $500,000 for Alaska aviation safety
initiative.'' Mississippi is represented by Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, a Republican. And Alaska's senior senator is Ted
Stevens, a Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Another item, listed on an added page, was ``$2 million for
Lawton Chiles Foundation,'' honoring the late Florida governor and
U.S. senator, a Democrat.

ROCKETTES KICK IT IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Sunday, Nov. 21) 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the holiday season, and that means the No. 1 live show in
America comes to Los Angeles. Is it ``Cats''? No. ``The Lion
King''? Think again. The real high-steppin' kings... er, queens...
of the stage are the Radio City Rockettes, whose Radio City
Christmas Spectacular has become a multicity record breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an amazing total of 2 million people in New York, Los
Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Branson (Mo.) and Myrtle Beach (S.C.)
attended the show, bringing its gross to $83 million. At the
Universal Amphitheatre, the show broke all records for such past
top shows as ``Jesus Christ, Superstar'' and ``Tommy.''
</P>
<P>
   In its second year in L.A., the Radio City extravaganza _ with
more than 50 on-stage performers _ is making a few changes. The
most important one may be that, in addition to live animals, the
show now features live musicians rather than canned music. The use
of tape instead of an orchestra last year caused an uproar among
the musicians' union.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Espinosa, president of Professional Musicians Local 47, says
this year's show will be better for everyone now that musicians are
included. ``When you hear a live orchestra, you don't just hear the
difference, you feel the difference,'' he said. ``I think Los
Angeles audiences are becoming more savvy about what they're
getting. ... When they pay $60 for a show, they expect to get the
works, including a live orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for kids, it's especially great. They get to see musicians
playing on instruments. It really is educational.''
</P>
<P>
   Other new twists include presenting three Los Angeles shows in
Spanish, giving Santa a larger role in the show, spiffing up the
costumes and making it ``snow'' inside the theater. Howard Kolins,
executive producer of the Christmas Spectacular, says it's these
kinds of updates and tweaks that he hopes will make the show a hit
with L.A. audiences for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is considered to be a place where tradition
doesn't stick,'' said New York-based Kolins, ``But I'd like to
think we can get into the heart of every (Angeleno).''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Los Angeles will never catch up with New York in terms of
the longevity of the show: There, it has run every year since 1933.
Kolins attributes the show's popularity to its cross-generational
appeal and its status as a New York legend. ``It's truly a family
show. No one feels put out that they've had to tolerate the show to
make someone else happy,'' Kolins said. ``Plus, it becomes a
tradition among families who may have seen it in New York, or just
heard about it and now can see it in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Hodges, senior vice president of House of Blues Concerts
(formerly Universal Concerts), agrees that the show's broad
demographics are the secret of its blockbuster appeal. ``It's
certainly been record-breaking for us,'' Hodges said. ``We've
gotten a mixture of people _ some who've been here before, and some
who haven't, both locals and tourists. And from what we've heard
from the retailers and the studio tour people,'' Hodges said,
``They've done great because of the show, too.''
</P>
<P>
   With 53 performances this year, the Christmas Spectacular at
Universal will be hard to miss. But if you're looking to make it a
tradition among your own family, it's best to buy early: Strong
group sales and the reduced number of seats for these shows (3,300
rather than the Amphitheatre's usual 6,000) due to the lavish
nature of the production means that tickets for the most popular
nights do go fast.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Radio City Christmas Spectacular runs Dec. 1-28 at the
Universal Amphitheatre, 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City.
Performances will be presented in Spanish Dec. 12, 20 (matinee) and
26. Tickets ($22.50 to $63.50) available through the Universal
Amphitheatre Main and CityWalk box offices, online at
www.jobconcerts.com, at all Ticketmaster outlets or by calling
Ticketmaster at (213) 252-(8497).

 LEDE19-COX &HT;    EDUCATION DEPARTMENT MESSES UP ITS ACCOUNTING
 &HT;    FIXES GRAF 2 subbing ``financial statements'' for ``financial
systems''
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Education Secretary Richard Riley admitted Thursday
that his department had flunked its audit for the 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The department ``lacked adequate financial management systems,
reports and oversight to prepare timely and accurate financial
statements,'' concluded Ernst &AMP; Young LLP, the big accounting firm
hired by the department's inspector general to audit the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working hard on the (fiscal year) 1999 audit to be
released in March 2000, and we're hoping it will show clear
progress,'' Riley told reporters. The department oversees more than
$70 billion a year in spending on operating costs and on loans and
grants to students, schools, school districts, contractors and
states.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said the biggest problem was that the department purchased
a new computerized general ledger system that doesn't work right.
He said that contributed to two other problems: the department's
failure to meet deadlines for supplying reliable information to the
auditors, and its inability to comply with new accounting
requirements that went into effect for the first time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat wistfully, he noted that the clean audit report
received by the department the previous year had been the first in
its three decades of existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 12 years of the Reagan-Bush administration, the department
had never received an unqualified (clean) audit opinion,'' recalled
Riley, who came into office alongside President Clinton in 1993.
``We undertook a comprehensive effort to improve financial
management and last year ended up with the first unqualified audit
opinion in the department's history, covering 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   That accomplishment was ballyhooed at the time. But this year
the department disclosed little despite constant complaints by Rep.
Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., about delays in releasing the audit, which
was supposed to be finished in March.
</P>
<P>
   The audit report was sent to Congress Thursday by the
department's office of inspector general. From the report, it
appears that department officials repeatedly convinced the auditors
to give them more time to reduce the number of conflicts between
various sets of books.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a half-billion-dollar transaction had been recorded
backwards, with the result that the books were off by more than $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are troubling, and Mr. Hoekstra and other members
of his subcommittee will no doubt be looking at it when Congress
returns in January,'' said Dan Lara, spokesman for the House
Committee on Education and the Workforce.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president's domestic adviser, Bruce
Reed, said he knew the audit report had been delayed, but did not
know that the auditors had refused to certify that the books were
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Secretary Riley's done an excellent job of making the
department work,'' Reed said.

JAPAN MULLS REDENOMINATING YEN TO BOOST IT AS A GLOBAL CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Plans to knock two zeros off the yen are gaining favor
here once again.
</P>
<P>
   Mikio Aoki, the Japanese government's chief spokesman, said
Thursday that the three-party coalition was considering changing
the denomination of the currency, a proposal that has come up
numerous times over the last few decades.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, there is strong momentum behind it. The
government's efforts to promote the yen as an international
currency are increasing in urgency as Europe's single currency
gains in popularity among investors and international corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set a target date of January 2002, when the actual
circulation of the euro will start,'' said Hideyuki Aizawa, head of
a Parliament group set up to study the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing to change the yen's denomination might also have
political implications. Changing the currency has been a pet
project of the Liberal Party, which has been threatening to leave
the new three-party governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, changing the currency would probably spur economic
activity and spending, if only temporarily, a goal that has been
the government's primary focus for much of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   In changing the denomination, 100 yen would become 1 yen.
Today's exchange rate of 105.93 yen to the dollar, for example,
would presumably become 1.0593 yen to the dollar, making it a
nearly one-to-one exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The change is cosmetic and would not reduce the Japanese
currency's foreign-exchange value or purchasing power _ prices
would be reduced proportionally. But the yen would seem easier to
use in financial transactions simply because the amounts would look
smaller and the mathematics would be simpler.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not absurd, and I suppose if they're trying to get
companies to spend money, this is one way of doing it,'' said
Marshall Gittler, head of Asian currency strategy at Bank of
America in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some objections to the plan have already been heard.
Opponents say that it would suppress consumer spending by causing
shoppers to refrain from purchases of products like computers
before the change is put into force, and just at a time when Japan
is trying to persuade consumers to spend more.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry has long opposed plans to change the yen's
denomination, but its past objections seem to be outweighed now by
its fears that the yen will lose stature in the global marketplace,
particularly now that the euro is expected to become the dollar's
chief competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a liquid market in dollars and a liquid market in
euros, there's a risk of Japan becoming a sort of second-string
market,'' Gittler said. ``They don't want the yen to become the
Swiss franc of Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing the currency's denomination ``might have a positive
effect in that the yen would be more internationally easy to
understand,'' said Takatoshi Ito, deputy vice minister for
international finance. `One dollar, one euro, one yen _ trading
somewhere within 10 or 15 percent of each other. It would improve
transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   But many international investors and executives have long
preferred dollars to yen, and it will probably take more than the
absence of a couple of zeros to change that opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign companies that import Japanese products do not
accept invoices denominated in yen, partly because the currency's
exchange value tends to be more volatile than some others. Gittler
said he paid a call on a Thai company last week that refused to do
business in yen any more. ``A lot of people have gotten burned very
badly by volatility, so their hesitation is justified,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Japan is not alone in tinkering with its currency. France has
fooled around with the franc, and Israel has swapped pounds for
shekels and shekels for new shekels. Argentina dumped pesos for
australes and then went back to pesos, just two of the currency
adjustments it has made in the last 28 years. And from 1984 to
1994, when it adopted the real, Brazil had six different
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, the loss of two zeros in Japan could have
some economic impact. Companies that would be involved in printing
and minting a newly denominated currency, such as paper and ink
makers and engravers, would benefit from rising revenue, as would
the makers of ledger books and accounting software. Conversely,
those companies that would have to adapt their balance sheets,
invoices and the like to a slimmer currency would incur costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, it probably balances out in terms of revenue and
costs,'' Ito said.

MCCANN (Washington) - John McCain wasn't there when the Senate
voted on raising the minimum wage, and on whether people under 21
should get credit cards. He wasn't there to vote on an African
trade pact, or to weigh in on a highway funding dispute. McCain's
presidential campaign travels and book tour have led him to miss
far more votes in recent months than any other senator. The
perception that McCain may be juggling too many balls at once is
something the campaign has noted, and has wondered privately if the
missed votes could cause negative publicity. We'll look at exactly
what he's missed. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A''

&HT;        U.S. TO SELL BOMB TECHNOLOGY TO ISRAEL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov.18 - The U.S. Defense Department has plans to
sell satellite-navigation technology to Israel that makes bombs
more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon contracts Boeing to make the 700 Joint Direct
Attack Munitions, or JDAM, kits that use inexpensive hardware
tapped into global positioning satellites owned by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The sale -- valued at $45 million, according to the Pentagon --
also includes some unguided bombs, spare parts, and technical
support.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must now approve the government-to-government sale
within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The JDAM makes an old bomb ``smarter'' by tacking a
satellite-navigating cap on the nose of 500, 1,000 and 2,000-pound
conventional warheads. The U.S. Air Force used the JDAMs in the
NATO offensive in Yugoslavia, including the mistaken bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The JDAMs sell for relatively cheap; less than $20,000 a piece.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said Boeing's goal was to make JDAMs an
affordable combination of existing technology. ``Any lab on earth
can duplicate this in nothing flat,'' he said, ``just not so
inexpensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel would be the first country to receive JDAMs, which Boeing
would like to sell to ``most of the 20 or so NATO countries,'' in
the future, said another Boeing spokesman, Bob Algaratti.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon statement said the sale would not affect the military
balance in the Middle East nor impair U.S. defense readiness.

   Asbestos from a now-closed vermiculite mine on a mountain near
Libby, Mont., has killed 192 people and left at least 375 people
with fatal diseases, a Seattle Post-Intelligencer investigation has
revealed. For the 30 years it owned the mine, the W.R. Grace
Company did not stop the tragedy, and neither did any government
agency. And doctors say the people of Libby will keep dying for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer has prepared a special package of
stories, based on a review of thousands of documents and interviews
with more than 110 people. The stories, all by Andrew Schneider,
will be moving today for immediate release.

asbestos from a vermiculite mine. But every official and every
agency has a reason why, so far, they have not been that somebody.

MUSLIMS DISPUTE INTERPRETATION OF CO-PILOT'S PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Islamic scholars cautioned Thursday that the phrase
``I put my trust in God'' that was spoken by the co-pilot on
EgyptAir's fatal Flight 990 does not prove he intentionally caused
the plane to crash into the Atlantic Ocean on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``This phrase is incredibly common and shows nothing about the
intent of the pilot,'' said Ibrahim Hooper, the national
communications director of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations, an advocacy group here.
</P>
<P>
   Revelations that the prayer was uttered by Egyptian pilot Gameel
al-Batouti just before the plane began a steep dive have prompted
some investigators to suspect that he intentionally caused the
Boeing 767 jetliner to crash.
</P>
<P>
   All 217 people on board died when the plane plunged into the
ocean off the coast of Massachusetts. Cockpit voice recorders
recovered after the crash revealed that Batouti said the Arabic
prayer ``Tawakaltu ala Allah,'' which has been translated into ``I
put my trust in God.''
</P>
<P>
   But Islamic scholars argue that Arabic speakers in Egypt and
other countries often use such prayers and phrases before doing
many everyday tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Imam Mohammed al-Hanooti, former Imam of Dar al-Hijrah Mosque in
Falls Church, Va., said that for religious Muslims, God is involved
in almost every single decision and action in life, which leads
them to say prayers throughout the day for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said the same thing as the pilot this morning before I
started my car and before I came into this room to speak with
you,'' Hanooti said, adding that ``if the pilot was a typical
Muslim, it wouldn't be at all surprising that he said this prayer
while in the cockpit where there are many tasks to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the prayer, which can be translated into
several English versions, was a key reason that the National
Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency that investigates
airline crashes, considered turning the investigation over to the
FBI. But Egyptian officials, fearing that the Americans may be
misinterpreting the meaning of the prayer, asked U.S. investigators
to step back and let the Egyptians interpret the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hooper, the many interpretations offered by
American newspapers and television networks of the phrase and its
meaning have confused the debate _ and angered many Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   In USA Today and on several television networks, the phrase was
translated as ``I made my decision now. I put my faith in God's
hands.'' Other newspapers interpreted the meaning as ``There is no
God but Allah and Mohammed is Allah's messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These interpretations simply aren't correct, and they make the
phrase appear sinister when in reality it's not,'' Hooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Yousri Hani, a professor of Islamic studies at Al Azhar
University in Cairo, said the fact that Batouti said a prayer while
in the cockpit actually argues against his attempting suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a religious Muslim would utter this phrase, and since
suicide is one of the worst things a Muslim can do, it doesn't make
sense that this religious man would do something so blasphemous,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hani said a Muslim who was about to commit an act of destruction
would have far stronger phrases to use. ``This prayer is for doing
constructive, everyday things, not a final prayer before death,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hooper admitted that Batouti could have been responsible for
the plane's crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to say what happened on that plane,'' he
said. ``We just want to clear up a cultural misunderstanding so
that this misunderstanding doesn't fill in for fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanooti said the possibility that Batouti was mentally unsound
existed but that the Islamic religion should not be blamed for the
actions of ``one man who no longer knew right from wrong.''

GORE CONTINUES ASSAULT ON BRADLEY HEALTH CARE PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Vice President Al Gore, during a quick stop in Boston
Thursday, racheted up his rhetorical assault on Bill Bradley's
health care plan _ with a little help from a family friend, Danny
Moretz.
</P>
<P>
   Moretz is an eight-year-old boy from Georgia, a heart-transplant
recipient whose years of costly care have been paid for by
Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's health plan would shutter Medicaid in favor of a new
health plan designed to mandate coverage for all the poor, and most
everyone else besides.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, after a private visit to Moretz at Boston's Children's
Hospital, charged that Bradley's move to replace Medicaid would
throw into doubt the health care of families like the Moretz's, who
turned to the federal program after their private insurer dropped
them.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is trying to turn the Bradley health care
plan, with its re-thinking of Medicaid, into a pivotal issue in his
campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in an interview, Gore called former Senator Bill
Bradley's health care plan ``ludicrous,'' ``deeply flawed,'' and
``a disaster.'' He said families like the Moretz's would not be
able to obtain the care they need, and, he contends, the Bradley
plan would imperil existing national standards for nursing homes,
an alarming prospect for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a huge mistake,'' Gore said of Bradley's proposal.
``He spent the entire surplus in his first campaign promise and he
allowed insurance company advocates to pawn off on him a deeply
flawed health proposal that is unravelling before his very eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, for his part, says he is ``deeply disappointed'' in
Gore for what he considers disingenuous attacks on his plan. He
also scorns Gore for using the health care issue to stir up an
array of interest groups and to question Bradley's commitment to
African Americans, Latinos and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he's wrong,'' Bradley said this week. ``He's
defending something that needs to be improved. And I am not the
only one that says that...What Medicaid does not do is cover all
poor people...I want to cover everybody in poverty, and that is the
plan I have laid out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sweeping coverage, Bradley aides said Thursday, would also
clearly cover Danny Moretz.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Longabaugh, Bradley's New Hampshire director, also called
Gore's claim that nursing home standards would be eliminated
without Medicaid ``absurd,'' and ``ridiculous.'' He accused Gore of
distorting the facts, which he called a reflection of the vice
president's character.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's health care plan would, in fact, replace Medicaid, the
principle government program to provide health benefits to 40
million poor and disabled children and adults. The program also
monitors nursing home quality across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire,
102,000 people receive Medicaid benefits, and in Iowa, home of the
first caucuses, there are 302,000 people enrolled in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has proposed replacing Medicaid with a subsidy to be
used to purchase private health insurance. For example, children
would receive about $1,200 each to apply to the insurer chosen by
their family.
</P>
<P>
   Health care policy experts say they admire Bradley for tackling
the thorny universal health problem. But they also say that big
ideas and big changes to any system often result in complications
and problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that some significant portions of the Bradley plan
have not been completely thought through,'' said John E. McDonough,
a former state representative from Boston who teaches health care
policy at Brandeis and is supporting Bradley for president. He
called Gore's criticisms ``legitimate concerns,'' but he also said
the vice president is trying to ``score political points by scaring
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McDonough said he believes it is more important
that Bradley is talking about universal health coverage, rather
than presenting a perfectly polished proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Feder, the dean of policy studies at Georgetown
University and an expert on health policy, said it is a mistake to
eliminate Medicaid as Bradley would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicaid plays a very important role in serving a very
disadvantaged population that private insurance has never served,''
Feder said. ``There's a risk, if one simply shifted from a state
managed arrangement, that disadvantaged people can get lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Gore's attacks on Bradley have gained him some
allies, as some advocates for the disabled, the mentally ill and
the poor have begun to speak out against Bradley's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Dixon, a Concord mother of a son with acute disabilities,
said Medicaid has helped him live at home and attend school with
the help of an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current insurance market is unwilling to help people with
long-term health care needs,'' Dixon said at a Gore-sponsored news
conference this week. ``Medicaid has been a safety net for our
family.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley and his campaign complain that Gore is using scare
tactics in his quest to win the nomination, the vice president said
Thursday that he will not back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Republican had proposed the elimination of Medicaid, and
the spending of the entire surplus without saving a penny for
Medicare on the eve of the baby boomers' retirement, every Democrat
in America would be up in arms condemning such a proposal,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and his allies consider Gore's own health plan, which
carries a much smaller pricetag, ``timid'' and inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's terribly discouraging,'' McDonough said, ``is seeing
the vice president attack Bradley and say, `No, we can't do
anything significant.' ''

&HT;        CONGRESS CUTS LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF NASA BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov.18 - Forty-one million of NASA's $13.65 billion
budget may end up on the congressional cutting room floor.
</P>
<P>
   How NASA would handle it's share of the 0.38 percent
across-the-board cut to all agencies remained unclear Thursday
night. One NASA official told States News Service and Space.com it
would be harmless, as long as it was left up to the agency to
decide what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   GOP budget negotiators, after working into the wee hours
Wednesday night with the president's Office of Management and
Budget, won the attachment of the cut to a massive spending bill,
the last of the session.
</P>
<P>
   When the House passed the spending bill, 296 to 133, Thursday
evening, aides were uncertain how the cut would play out. The
Senate may not approve it until next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to know how the cut will be administered at
this time,'' a congressional aide familiar with NASA's budget said.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Committee spokesman John Scofield said the
cut applies to every program except military personnel, and agency
administrators such as NASA's Dan Goldin would have some degree of
flexibility in deciding what specific programs will be hit by the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   A NASA official who wished to remain unnamed said that no
program would be hurt if the agency took the $41 million out of
'earmarks', items that lawmakers add to the bill as political
hand-outs to research institutions or others in their district.
</P>
<P>
   To take $41 million ``out of congressional earmarks would be
real easy,'' the official said. NASA was forced to cut some
programs to make room for the earmarks when Congress passed its
budget last month.
</P>
<P>
   But if lawmakers refuse to let NASA handle the decision, and
decide to take the money out of programs, that is ``more
difficult'' for NASA, the official added.

COMPANIES HAIL FEDERAL RULING ON HIGH-SPEED INTERNET LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies that compete with Bell Atlantic to sell the intensely
popular digital subscriber line high-speed Internet access service
hailed a federal ruling Thursday they said will help them move even
faster to roll out DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   DSL offers Net connections with download speeds 50 to 125 times
faster than dial-up modems by enhancing the carrying capacity of
the standard copper telephone wires that serve the vast majority of
homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, companies such as HarvardNet, Covad Communications,
NorthPoint and Rhythms must pay to have Bell Atlantic install a
second standard phone line for customers, which is then outfitted
for DSL. Bell Atlantic, however, can add the DSL service to current
customers' existing voice lines, giving it a big head start and
cost advantage over rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC announced Thursday that beginning in six to nine months,
it will order local phone incumbents such as Bell Atlantic to share
their home and business lines with rivals, with the price to be
worked out by state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Washburn, president and CEO of HarvardNet of Charlestown,
Mass., the leading non-Bell DSL provider in New England, called the
FCC ruling ``a watershed event. This ruling will establish a level
playing field on price, letting us compete for new customers on the
basis of our superior service alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn predicted the move will cut DSL installation and
monthly fees, now $150 to $300 for typical business customers, by
probably 20 percent each of the next two years and allow his
company to begin moving into the residential market, which has been
prohibitively expensive to crack so far. HarvardNet serves about
one-quarter of New England and is moving into New York.
</P>
<P>
   Annabel Z. Dodd, a Northeastern University instructor and author
of ``The Essential Guide to Telecommunications,'' said the FCC
ruling ``opens up the residential DSL market to competition. Up
until now, Bell Atlantic has pretty much had the field to itself
and competed with cable modems.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 200,000 DSL lines are estimated to be in
service, compared to about 1 million cable modems such as
MediaOne's RoadRunner service. An FCC board member, Susan Ness,
said that ``prices should decline (and) services should improve''
as a result of the agency's line-sharing order.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell Atlantic and some industry officials fear the FCC
ruling could lead to customer-service nightmares as people face
endless blame-shifting by two rival companies when their DSL lines
experience problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Wake, chief executive officer of Integral Access, a
Chelmsford-based start-up that provides equipment and systems for
delivering voice and data services over a single line, cautioned
that ``service providers will now need sophisticated management
systems to monitor phone line performance and identify the source
of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have two service providers sharing the same line, they
will need to know where the problem is and who is responsible for
fixing it, in order to avoid finger pointing and quickly re-connect
the service,'' Wake said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's vice president for regulatory affairs, Don Evans, said,
``We have concerns with regard to the impacts on consumers. We
didn't see that there was a need for making this kind of policy
judgment. If this is not implemented properly, consumers are going
to run into complications that will give them a bad experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC proposal calls for heavy fines against incumbent
companies such as Bell Atlantic that fail to live up to promises to
cooperate with rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But Dhruv Khanna, a co-founded and executive vice president of
Covad, based in Santa Clara, Calif., called the FCC ruling ``a
winning scenario for both consumers and the phone companies''
because it will help companies like Bell Atlantic increase local
competition, a key step towards re-entering the long distance
calling market.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling heat from RoadRunner, Bell plans to roll out DSL service
throughout Greater Boston by year's end, although it has faced
scattered complaints about delays and bureacratic headaches
installing service.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation to DSL is that it currently can reach only people
who live about 3 miles from a phone company ``central office.'' But
it has the benefit compared to cable modems that each DSL customer
gets a dedicated line instead of sharing capacity with neighbors.

1968 REDUX: NEW ISSUES ARE HOT, VALUE STOCKS ARE NOT

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's beginning to feel a lot like 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the economy was barreling along, nearing the end of
what was to be the longest period without a recession in American
history. Individual Americans had more of their money in stocks
than ever before, and the best performing stocks were the ones that
appeared to offer the worst values _ at least to those
old-fashioned investors who worried about things like earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the government was bragging about its budget
wizardry. The fiscal year that began in mid-1968 produced the first
budget surplus in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The 1961-69 expansion will be replaced as the longest period of
growth if the United States gets through the winter without a
recession. Gimmicks and all, the federal budget is again in
surplus. Households have more of their wealth in stocks than ever,
and investors who pay attention to earnings are missing out on the
best performing stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 18 months, an investor who carefully went through
the stock market and chose a portfolio that was balanced among
sectors and focused on the 10 percent of stocks with the lowest
ratios of prices to earnings _ in other words, a value investor _
would have lost money.
</P>
<P>
   But somebody who took the opposite strategy, buying only the
stocks that were losing money or had the highest ratios of prices
to earnings _ in other words, the kind of companies that seem
overpriced to begin with _ would have a portfolio that rose 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those calculations come from Gina Moore, a research analyst at
Aronson and Partners, a Philadelphia-based money management firm.
She ran the numbers back to 1962, and reports that the only other
time that value stocks trailed by so much was in the 18 months
ended in June 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling,'' said Theodore Aronson, the firm's
founder. ``People are so underestimating risks.'' Aronson, a value
investor, is not having a good year.
</P>
<P>
   There are differences between now and 1968. Then, inflation was
rising, and the Vietnam quagmire was worsening. In the stock
market, the expensive stocks that were flying high were generally
smaller technology stocks with no profits but lots of hype. There
are some such stocks now, most notably among Internet issues, but
the most expensive stocks also include many of the big technology
companies, whose financial success is clear.
</P>
<P>
   But the similarities may be more significant. In 1968, the stock
market had been rising, with only minor interruptions, for two
decades, and the last recession, in 1961, was a distant memory.
Many hot initial public offerings doubled the first day they
traded. American households had a record 23.7 percent of their
assets in stocks _ a figure not exceeded until 1998, when it hit
24.3 percent. (In 1978, after a brutal bear market, the figure was
down to 8.5 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is that long bull markets and prolonged expansions
breed complacency. In 1968, there was talk that central bankers
could ``fine tune'' the economy to prevent recessions indefinitely.
Now there is a ``new paradigm'' in which technological progress
assures inflation-less growth.
</P>
<P>
   Those who profited in 1968 were destined to suffer later, as the
leading stocks of that market crumbled. The laggards of that era
held up better, but virtually every stock was devastated in the
1973-74 bear market.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing visible now to stop the ascendancy of this
year's market stars, and cautious voices have repeatedly been shown
to be wrong as stocks they called overvalued proceeded to double
and more. Just like 1968.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ A digital video camera was perched like a bazooka on
the shoulder of director Mike Figgis as he carved a path through
the oblivious pedestrians on Sunset Strip, following actor Stellan
Skarsgard into a swanky glass-faced office. At the same moment, not
far away, three other digital cameras were following other actors
as they made their way down the sidewalk, chatted on cell phones or
bickered at curbside, the real world swirling all around them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever this film in progress might add up to artistically,
Figgis, the British director best known for the Oscar-winning
``Leaving Las Vegas,'' is at the very least extraordinarily
ambitious, some might say audacious, about exploiting the digital
technologies that are beginning to seep into the Hollywood
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   His film, ``Time Code 2000,'' is being shot in real time; that
is, as one continuous take, without editing, that lasts a
predetermined 93 minutes. The four cameras dance across a half
dozen sets and down city streets with a breathtaking seamlessness,
following the film's characters in and out of meetings,
assignations and confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis thought of doing the film just a few months ago, and he
said the digital technology would require only four to six weeks of
postproduction work instead of the typical several months, time
spent mostly fussing with the sound mix. The film potentially could
be available for theatrical release before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When it appears in theaters, he said, the images from all four
cameras will be shown simultaneously, either in horizontal strips
with four images shown from left to right or stacked two-atop-two,
allowing audiences to edit the film in their own heads as they
switch attention from one image to another and try to follow the
plot.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For years, digital moviemaking has been a grass-roots movement
among aspiring filmmakers who resented the dominance of the
Hollywood aesthetic. ``Time Code 2000'' brings the new technology
inside the walls of the major studios _ in this case, those of Sony
Pictures, which, not coincidentally, is owned by a company that
also manufactures digital equipment. Once inside the walls, many
believe, digital moviemaking will have a major impact on the way
movies are made and how people view them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many predictions that digital technology will transform
the industry, its potential influence is still far from certain.
For one thing, many filmmakers are extremely resistant to using
digital video because of the flat, bland image that videotape often
produces, particularly in comparison with the richer images
recorded by film.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of converting to digital projection systems is also
formidable _ $100,000 per projector multiplied by the more than
34,000 screens in the United States alone _ and theater owners and
studios have very different ideas about who should pay the tab.
Meanwhile, even the adventurous Figgis must transfer his digital
tape to old-fashioned film so it can be projected by the machines
now in place.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, digital proponents remain exultant. ``It's a
revolution,'' said Rodger Raderman, chairman of iFilm, a San
Francisco-based company that distributes digital films on the
Internet. ``And I believe it's coming faster than most people
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Documentary filmmakers, in particular, have been at the
forefront, driven by economic necessity and a lack of interest from
the entertainment industry in financing their projects.
</P>
<P>
   Such respected directors as Penelope Spheeris and Spike Jonze
have done work in digital video, and earlier this month New Line
Cinema announced that it had signed a deal with Spike Lee to make
``Bamboozled,'' a movie entirely on digital video.
</P>
<P>
   When digital filmmaking's full potential is reached, a growing
number of people in the industry believe, it might even threaten a
studio power structure that has held firm since the advent of sound
and has absorbed such technological challenges as television and
VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is beyond imagination what this is going to do to
filmmaking,'' said Figgis, whose roots are in music, theater and
experimental film. ``What has been an exclusive medium of high
finance, banking and financial exclusivity is now going to become
something that is within the reach of everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that even the most modestly financed filmmaker
could afford to shoot a movie and transmit it to theaters digitally
at little expense.
</P>
<P>
   This revolution, if that's what it is, is being driven by the
convergence of several technologies: relatively inexpensive digital
video cameras, only now becoming widely available; digital
projectors that eliminate the need for film; and the growing
ability of the Internet and other information pipelines to transmit
digital sounds and images to multiplexes, living rooms and computer
screens without reliance on a studio's expensive production and
distribution services.
</P>
<P>
   It may even become possible to distribute and market those films
effectively on the Internet if the example of this summer's ``Blair
Witch Project'' is a guidepost to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole economics of the business are basically turned
upside down by digital technology,'' said Bruce Apar, editor in
chief of Video Business, a magazine published by Variety. ``It will
change the movie industry, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging technologies may push change even further. Some will
allow filmmakers to bypass not only film, but digital tape, making
it possible to shoot onto digital sticks, which resemble credit
cards, and computer disks, both of which break down images into
binary code. The images can be downloaded to a computer and
transmitted the same way that any other computer file is
transmitted. They can be edited on the computer screen,
extraordinary effects can be added and the resulting movie can be
sent by modem or satellite to any place in the world. Then theater
owners can download the movies and project them onto a screen with
the new generation of digital projectors.
</P>
<P>
   The financial savings can be considerable, even with available
digital equipment. Digital cameras cost a small fraction of what
film cameras cost, and prices are plummeting. New software allows
anyone to edit film on a home computer. There are no costs for
developing film, no need for reels of celluloid. Instead of paying
hundreds of thousands of dollars to make copies of a movie,
producers could make as many copies as necessary at the click of a
mouse.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Figgis illustrated, picking up a small, hand-held camera that
was resting on a nearby chair. ``See this? It's a new,
state-of-the-art digital camera. Costs about $3,000,'' he said.
``I'd be using it on this movie except the tapes are only an hour
long and I need two hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Code 2000'' is being made on a budget ``in the low
millions,'' Figgis said, about 5 percent of the $60 million that is
spent on the average major studio production. Most of his budget,
though, is going to pay the union wages of those working on the
film and for the handful of sets he is using.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were some young filmmaker in Ohio or someplace,'' Figgis
said, ``and I could use friends and shoot on found locations
instead of on sets, this movie, this very same movie, could be made
for about $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Figgis' film looks little like the slick, visually sumptuous
films that Hollywood studios regularly produce. It is rapid, jerky
and definitely ragged around the edges, but Figgis believes that
moviegoers who accepted ``Blair Witch,'' which had many of the same
qualities, will accept his film, too.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the new technology is most visible on the
proliferation of Internet sites devoted to digital films (even the
major studios have begun to get involved in this) and in the growth
of the microcinema movement, in which digital filmmakers exhibit
their work in cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction to filmmakers is only partly economic. It is also
artistic. Digital video makes filmmakers more mobile, better able
to shoot scenes without cocooning themselves in studios or at
on-site locations, freer to move through the bustle of real city
streets, even interacting with real people they encounter. For most
of the century, filmmakers have been restricted to shots of no
longer than 10 minutes, a length limited by the size of film
magazines. (A 20-minute magazine has recently become available.)
Digital cameras, however, can shoot and shoot and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives, who acknowledge that the technology will
change their business, are not so sure that it will make them as
irrelevant as some filmmakers might hope. Studios, they argue, will
still be the marketplace where creative ferment produces the best
stories. And it will still be the studios _ and the surrounding
world of agents and producers _ that will retain control of the
copyrighted characters (think ``Batman'') and the top-name actors
who will be needed to make a movie, even a digital movie, rise
above the expected glut.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that production on ``Time Code 2000'' ends,
scheduled for Nov. 19, Figgis will have shot the film more than
seven times. Then he will choose the version he considers best.
</P>
<P>
   If his project feels a bit like a stunt, Figgis does not
disagree, though he prefers the term ``performance art.'' His movie
is intended, in part, to draw attention to the possibilities
created by digital technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is to have the film released, at least in a couple of
theaters, before the end of the year,'' he said. Columbia Pictures
has not decided whether it will release the film late this year or
early next year. What is telling, though, is that it is possible to
release a film so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be nice to have this look at the cinema of
the next century come out in the last week of this century.''

CLINTON URGES YELTSIN TO HALT CHECHNYA BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ President Clinton publicly scolded his friend and
counterpart, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in front of nearly 50
heads of state Thursday, saying the bombing of Chechnya threatens
``an endless cycle of violence'' that could hinder Russia's
post-Cold War integration into the world community.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was defiant, saying Clinton and others ``have no right
to criticize Russia for Chechnya,'' and refusing to back down
during a private meeting with Clinton later. The Russian president
then walked out of the summit early, saying he had to get back to
Moscow to deal with the Chechnya situation.
</P>
<P>
   Other world leaders at the session of the Organization on
Security and Cooperation in Europe were more blunt than Clinton;
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, for example, called
Russia's behavior ``immoral and contradictory to humanitarian
international law.''
</P>
<P>
   But the American president got personal with the man Clinton has
described as his good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Yeltsin, one of the most thrilling experiences of my
life as a citizen of the world before I became president was when
you stood up on that tank in Moscow, when they tried to take the
freedom of the Russian people away, and your standing there on that
tank said to those people, `You can do this, but you'll have to
kill me first,' '' Clinton said, wagging his finger at Yeltsin, who
was seated across the room in the ornate Ciragan Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had put you in jail instead of electing you president,
I would hope that every leader of every country around this table
would have stood up for you and for freedom in Russia and not said,
`Well, that is an internal Russian affair that we cannot be a part
of,' '' Clinton continued.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton's comments offended Yeltsin, he didn't show it
publicly. He gave Clinton a big bear hug before they entered their
private meeting, although the hour-long session produced no
agreement on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very vigorous and so was I,'' Clinton told reporters
after the meeting. ``We have a very good personal chemistry, but it
didn't stop us from our clear disagreement here.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia took another hit later in the day when Clinton presided
over the signing of a deal to build an oil pipeline from Baku,
Azerbaijan, through Georgia to Ceyhan, Turkey. The pipeline would
take away some of Russia's control of the transport and sale of oil
from the Caspian Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin left a few hours ahead of schedule, leaving his
delegation behind to participate in the remainder of the summit.
The White House downplayed Yeltsin's early departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not him stomping out of the room,'' said National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Russia did agree to allow an observer mission from OSCE, formed
to keep disputes in the region from becoming armed conflicts, to go
to Chechnya, a concession the White House hopes could pave the way
for a later mediation by the organization between Moscow and
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also offered Yeltsin a a conciliatory gesture, saying
Russia ``has not only the right, but the obligation, to defend its
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have often asked myself, as I hope all of you have, what I
would do if I were in President Yeltsin's place,'' Clinton
continued. ``I think before any of us sit in judgment, we should be
able to answer that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton warned, if Russia continues with its strategy in
Chechnya, ``the global integration Russia has rightly sought to
advance, with our strong support, will be hindered.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's condemnation of Yeltsin, along with his unwavering
defiance, underscores the difficulty the OSCE faces in dealing with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole hope of this thing was that it would bring everyone
inside the tent, so we don't have to worry about anyone making rips
from the outside,'' said Marshall Goldman, associate director of
the Davis Center for Russian Studies at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``But inside the tent, you've got this bear that hasn't been
housebroken. The hope, of course, is to co-opt them,'' Goldman
said. But Russia _ anxious to be considered a player in the
post-Cold War world _ isn't about to toady to the West, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin made that point abundantly clear Thursday, arguing that
the OSCE has no business telling Russia how to handle an internal
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also accuses the United States of hypocrisy, noting that
NATO bombed a sovereign nation, Yugoslavia, when it sought to
combat Serbian attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, which is
Yugoslav territory.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directly addressed that critique, saying the world
community had made a ``grievous error'' in waiting so long to act
during the ethnic conflict in Bosnia, but ``did the right thing''
in moving more quickly in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe there will ever be a time in human affairs
when we will ever be able to say (that) we simply cannot criticize
this or that . . . because it happened within the territorial
borders of a single nation,'' Clinton told the European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The President meant to justify US action in Kosovo, but he was
also sending a subtle message that he did not want Chechnya to
become another Kosovo, said National Security Council spokesman
Mike Hammer later.
</P>
<P>
   The conundrum in both regions in similar. In both cases, the
presidents of Yugoslavia and Russia have insisted that they have
every right to bring down violent insurgents inside their borders.
The international community has struggled to balance its commitment
to the integrity of international borders with its desire to limit
rulers who crack down on their own people in the name of domestic
security.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels in Chechnya are generally perceived to be more
aggressive than the Albanian insurgents in Kosovo, and several
Western leaders qualified their condemnations of Russia by noting
that Russia has the right to fight terrorists _ a point Yeltsin
underscored.

   ``Long-term peace in the Chechnya republic and so-called
peaceful negotiations with bandits are not one and the same
thing,'' Yeltsin said. ``There will be no negotiations between
bandits and murderers.''

ALREADY THE MVP OF RANGERS FANS, PUDGE NOW HAS REAL AWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ They will be forever linked in Rangers lore.
Pudge and Juan. Juan and Pudge. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both arrived in Arlington as full-time players in 1991. Both
were considered young superstars in the making. Both were proud
sons of the Puerto Rico baseball machine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During nine seasons of thick and thin _ but mostly thick _ both
also defied the odds. Together, they reached an elite status in the
major leagues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, however, there was some serious irony to consider.
Within two weeks of Juan Gonzalez's departure from the Rangers _
traded to the Tigers _ Pudge Rodriguez succeeded him as American
League MVP, the league's highest honor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even in making his exit from Arlington, Juan was again
overshadowed by Pudge. Locally, it has always been that way. And
those league MVP awards Juan won in '96 and '98 couldn't change
that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pudge is and was the people's choice, be it in performance on
the field or in all the important intangibles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To the fans, Pudge shows personality and charisma. Juan was
different. That wasn't him. The translation to the fans, fair or
not, was the contrast between warmth and, well, a chill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The language barrier was another factor. And not a small one.
Pudge started early in his career and worked hard at improving his
English. For many seasons, Juan didn't seem to care, although later
he did make an attempt. But Pudge reached many more fans than Juan
just by being able to speak better English. Should that be a
factor? No. Is it? Certainly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago, however, when Pudge cemented his position
as maybe the most popular player ever in Arlington. Against the
advice of his agent and his union, he cut his own contractual deal
with the Rangers, taking less money to continue his career here
long-term. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Juan could have done that three weeks ago. He didn't. He's now
gone. But as of Thursday, the American League MVP still plays in
Arlington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On-the-field comparisons between the two are apples and oranges,
but again, Pudge has that one thing that separates him from all
others: the big arm behind the plate that changes the way the game
is played by the opposition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Juan, Pudge has had his critics _ mainly local baseball
writers, me included _ who often wondered why the complete player
didn't surface. But to Pudge's credit, he has advanced his game
beyond just the arm and the bat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the scouts whispered that Rodriguez was a ``body
risk,'' meaning a weight problem would limit his major-league
career. Instead, Pudge has become the most durable catcher the game
has ever known, mainly because of an intensive daily workout
program. Fitness training became his obsession, and it shows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another long-standing knock on Pudge was he concentrated more on
offensive numbers than refining the key points of catching: calling
a game, working with pitchers, having sound technique behind the
plate, etc. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of that criticism lingers today, but Rodriguez is now
giving these areas more effort. No longer is it necessarily valid
to say he carries a bad at-bat with him to his position, meaning a
lack of concentration behind the plate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But under the guidance of hitting instructor Rudy Jaramillo, the
offensive numbers for Rodriguez reached career-high levels in 1999.
For a free swinger who rarely walks, having 64 strikeouts in 600
at-bats is an incredible tribute to the art of making contact. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is also what happened in the very wide-open MVP balloting:
Pudge made contact with each of the 28 voters, which breaks down to
two baseball writers from each league city. He had only seven
first-place votes (pitcher Pedro Martinez of Boston led with
eight), but Pudge was in the top three on 20 ballots and the top
five on 25. Plus, he won despite splitting votes with teammate
Rafael Palmeiro, who had four first-place votes and finished fifth
overall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To some, Pudge's MVP win was a surprise. It shouldn't have been.
He had an MVP season in all areas. More important to the Rangers,
he seems to be getting better in all areas, despite a workload of
144 or more games caught in four consecutive seasons. Rodriguez
will be 28 in two weeks, and, thanks to fitness dedication, the
physical wear-and-tear question is no longer an issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a joyful Rodriguez properly singled out Jaramillo for
special praise. And he thanked Palmeiro for his guidance. And he
also mentioned a call earlier in the afternoon from a former
teammate who wanted to offer congratulations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, Juan and Pudge were linked again by telephone. But, of
course, it's no longer the same. Then again, it never was. &QL;

BUSH ADDRESS TO FOCUS ON FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PEGGY FIKAC  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ After a series of slips that raised the
stakes for him to show his vision of the America's role in the
world, Gov. George W. Bush is scheduled on Friday to deliver what
is being billed as a major foreign policy speech at the
presidential library of Republican icon Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I will have a foreign policy with a touch of
iron, driven by American interests and American values,'' Bush, who
is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, said in a recent
television commercial addressing foreign affairs and the military.
</P>
<P>
   The speech and advertising come after gaffes including Bush's
inability to name of leaders of three world hot spots. Such lapses
have been dismissed by his campaign, which says people care instead
about the candidate's ideas for America's leadership role in the
world _ the subject of the Friday speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will describe the importance of keeping the peace for
generations to come and for Americans to seize the moment to lay
the groundwork for a new American internationalism,'' said Bush
spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Bruce Buchanan of the University of Texas at
Austin said Bush's biggest vulnerability is that ``he has not been
in the kind of government circles that lead him to have a
familiarity with foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   That focuses attention on the speech at the Reagan library,
Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be watching to see whether his schooling is
starting to take root,'' he said. ``They will look to speeches like
that to see how far he's come.''
</P>
<P>
   The setting _ the presidential library of the man Bush's father
served as vice president and succeeded as president _ is itself a
powerful symbol for the Republican Party, said Dennis Goldford,
chairman of the Drake University Department of Politics and
International Relations in Des Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Republicans try to be the next Ronald Reagan,'' Goldford
said. ``Republicans are looking for a return of a Reagan
internationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of Reagan's foreign policy was the fight against
communist expansion. The underpinning of this policy was peace
through strength, increasing defense spending, but also negotiating
with the then-Soviet Union on arms control.
</P>
<P>
   The public to this point does not have a definitive picture of
Bush's foreign policy, analysts said. For example, Bush has said he
wants the United States to be able to develop a national missile
defense system. He told the Associated Press he would be willing to
share technology to help Russia develop its own an anti-ballistic
missile system, if Russia promised to reduce its stockpile of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Goldford likened such statements to a connect-the-dots picture
in which ``there are no lines connecting the dots yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he is heartened by indications that Bush is
leaning toward a view of America taking a world leadership role in
alliances rather than one of unilateral action. Buchanan said he
believes that is the rational view because the world is
interdependent.
</P>
<P>
   Attention has been focused on foreign policy after Bush earlier
this month could not name the leaders of India, Pakistan or the
restive Russian republic of Chechnya in a pop quiz posed by a
television reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that the pop quiz may have been perceived as
unfair. Even so, he said, ``It's a reminder of the underlying and
more legitimate concern of whether this fellow is up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is scheduled to attend two fund-raisings Saturday
where he is expected to raises $1 million.

CLINTON, EUROPEAN LEADERS SCOLD RUSSIA ON CHECHNYA BOMBINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ President Clinton and European leaders
rebuked Russia on Thursday for its military action in Chechnya, but
Boris Yelstin refused to yield on Moscow's campaign to stamp out an
internal rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Russia agreed to allow Knut Vollebaek, chairman of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, to travel to
Chechnya and work on the possibility of a political settlement. But
Russian officials gave no indication that the eight-week bombing
attack on civilians and rebels would end.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin provided the dramatic moments of the first
OSCE meeting in four years as Europe's 54-member crisis management
group seeks to redefine its role in a post-Cold War era. Many of
the representatives used their opening statements to criticize
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to criticize Russia for Chechnya,'' Yeltsin
said when it was his turn to speak. He referred to the Chechen
Islamic rebels as bandits and terrorists who now threaten Russia
but who could grow to threaten other nations as well.
</P>
<P>
   He said insurgents had claimed more than 1,500 Russian lives in
terrorist bombings in Moscow and other major cities. Chechens also
had kidnapped nearly 1,000 people of many nationalities. He
suggested Islamic fundamentalists were helping finance the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``For terrorists, considerations of proportionality or
humanitarian concerns simply do not arise, because their purpose is
to sow death and destruction,'' Yeltsin complained.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin urged OSCE to stay out of the internal affairs of other
nations, even on the pretext of humanitarian reasons, and he
pointedly criticized ``the aggression of NATO headed by the United
States'' against Yugoslavia this spring as the European alliance
protected the Kosovo province from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who scribbled additions into the margins of his
prepared speech, turned to Yeltsin and urged him to recall the day
he climbed atop the tank in Moscow and stopped a coup against the
nascent democracy. The moment, Clinton recalled, was a ``thrilling
experience'' to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had put you in jail instead of electing you president,
I would hope that every leader of every country around this table
would have stood up for you and for freedom in Russia and not said,
`well, that is an internal Russia affair that we cannot be a part
of.' I don't think we have any choice but to try to work for common
objectives across lines,'' Clinton said, speaking directly to
Yeltsin seated 30 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Russia's critics do not object to Russia's right to
combat terrorism and to control its borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they fear is that the means Russia has chosen will
undermine its ends _ that if attacks on civilians continue, the
extremism Russia is trying to combat will only intensify,'' Clinton
said. ``The strength Russia rightly is striving to build,
therefore, could be eroded by an endless cycle of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Russia agreed to a change in the OSCE charter that would
give the organization greater influence by stating that internal
conflicts threatening regional stability were of interest to all
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also agreed to the wording of a declaration that will
recognize Moscow's territorial integrity, condemn terrorism, offer
OSCE assistance in seeking a political settlement and invite the
OSCE chairman to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the charter change
and declaration allowed OSCE to accomplish what it could in terms
of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to oversell this. I think that we accomplished a
lot. But this is a longer-term problem, and I think that we need to
keep pushing it along and we have been given more tools to deal
with it,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she believed Russians ``heard a general sense of
disquiet'' from OSCE members over Chechnya. She said other foreign
ministers applauded Clinton's hand-crafted remarks for being an
astute way to point out to Yeltsin why it was important for other
nations to care about events within a country.
</P>
<P>
   After the main OSCE meeting, Yeltsin greeted Clinton with a
``big bear hug'' as the two met for a private session, an aide
said. Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the national security adviser, said
Clinton and Yeltsin had a ``vigorous meeting'' in which they both
restated their views on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallmark of this relationship, however, has been the
willingness of President Yeltsin and President Clinton to work
through difficult issues,'' Berger said. ``And, I don't know that
we convinced President Yeltsin on Chechnya, and he certainly didn't
convince us that the course they're on is likely to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton urged Yeltsin to seek a political
negotiation with Chechens. He said Yeltsin invited Clinton to visit
Moscow next year and they would continue their talks. Yeltsin, who
arrived Wednesday in Istanbul, left for Moscow, cutting short a
session with German and French leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Aides denied that Yeltsin left in a huff, contending the Russian
president always had intended to leave the two-day conference
early. Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov remained in Istanbul on
Russia's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to amending OSCE's charter, member nations also are
crafting a revision to the Convention Forces in Europe treaty that
outlines troop levels. The CFE is supposed to be signed Friday
along with the charter, but negotiations are still underway with
Russia over its troop levels in Georgia and Moldova.

 &HT;    DID EGYPTIAN PILOT COMMIT THE ULTIMATE TABOO?
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   10TH OF RAMADAN CITY, Egypt _ In life, pilot Gameel El-Batouty
appeared to be the model of Egyptian gentility. In death, he is
suspected of a cardinal Egyptian sin _ suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Near the villa where Batouty planned to spend his retirement,
people remember that he would not retreat to his enclosed garden,
but rather sit on his small driveway to chat with neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   He smoked the water pipe with his servant and went to the mosque
on Fridays. On holidays, Batouty transcended the structured
Egyptian class hierarchy and had a butcher slaughter a lamb for
curbside neighborhood feasts.
</P>
<P>
   But Western officials, in so-far unsupported leaks to the press,
believe Batouty may have intentionally plunged EgyptAir Flight 990
to dive into the Atlantic Ocean, killing himself and 216 passengers
and crew.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane crashed Oct. 31, less than an hour after it left
John F. Kennedy Airport in New York for Cairo. A flight voice
recorder, officials say, appears to capture Batouty in the cockpit
and muttering a short prayer before the plane dove.
</P>
<P>
   The murder of hundreds of people would be one of the most
heinous crimes in Egypt's modern history. Moreover, suicide is such
an uncommon and detested act that many Egyptians cannot believe it
could be committed by the consummate family man.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide is a sin in Islam. The Koran, Islam's central text,
stresses that only God can give or take life. Muslims commonly
believe that people who commit suicide go to Hell.
</P>
<P>
   But, Egyptian psychoanalyst Ahmed Fayek said, even more
important than religion, the country's emphasis on family
reputation precludes suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suicide and other socially unacceptable behavior would shame
the family. It would not bring sympathy,'' Fayek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of suicide in the United States and Canada is
common,'' said Fayek, who practiced in Canada. ``(In Egypt),
society does not permit you to commit suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   After decades practicing in Cairo, Fayek said he has only heard
of two suicides.
</P>
<P>
   The family of a man who commits suicide, he said, will be
scorned; his daughters will have trouble finding husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the third day since investigators singled out Batouty,
Egyptians were closing ranks as one big family. Namely, they
rejected any suggestion that Batouty, whose wealth and status
represent Egyptian success, could have committed the shameful act.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers slammed the credibility of the American
investigation. Fellow pilots called a press conference to defend
Batouty. Street corners were alive with conspiracy theories and
people urged those being interviewed to reject the suicide
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the crime means that Batouty would not likely have
let anyone know his plans beforehand. Also, anyone with evidence of
a suicide would be unlikely to come forward with the information
for fear of hurting Batouty's family and national prestige.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be scandalized, I'm sure,'' Fayek said.
``People are going to say Egypt is a backward country, a corrupt
country.''
</P>
<P>
   He distinguished Batouty's case and speculation the pilot faced
personal problems from a terror attack, in which fundamentalists
may ``martyr'' themselves as part of a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   Fayek, however, is one of a minority of Egyptians who will not
rule out that Batouty may have taken the Boeing 767 into its crash.
Without evidence of terrorism or mechanical failure, he said, it
must be considered possible that Batouty had a ``severe psychotic
breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said that just a few commonly spoken words of prayer on
the flight recorder are not enough evidence to show that Batouty
committed the mass murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Other evidence appeared to counter the idea of an intentional
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from Batouty's three-bedroom villa, a house
about an hour outside Cairo that served as a family getaway from a
downtown apartment, neighbors say he had plans.
</P>
<P>
   Retired banker Mahmoud Khairy, 63, said he visited with Batouty
a month ago. At the time, he said, Batouty said he would soon take
his 10-year-old daughter, Aya, to Los Angeles to treat her Lupus.
They said she was improving and this was to be a treatment just to
assure her progress.
</P>
<P>
   That matched family statements Wednesday. While some have
speculated that Aya's uninsured treatments were breaking Batouty
financially, it seems illogical he would kill himself just before
his daughter's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very special to him. She was his youngest child,''
Khairy said.
</P>
<P>
   Khairy, who knew Batouty 10 years, said the seasoned pilot gave
no indication of financial problems. Not only was Batouty the son
of a wealthy landowner, his wife is from a wealthy family.
</P>
<P>
   Others questioned speculation that Batouty was frustrated
because, at 59 years old and just months away from mandatory
retirement, he was still just a co-pilot rather than a full
captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, he was not frustrated,'' said Roushdie Zakaria,
EgyptAir's deputy chief for the 767 crews. He and others said
Batouty returned to civil aviation from the Egyptian Air Force too
late in life _ in his mid-40s _ to expect to be captain.
</P>
<P>
   Zakaria said EgyptAir policy forbids promotions after age 55, so
Batouty would have been frustrated for years, not just recently.
</P>
<P>
   According to family members, Batouty was early on recognized as
a skilled piloting prospect and obligated to serve as an air force
flight instructor. They said he was at least once a co-pilot to
President Hosni Mubarak, a former bomber pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with family members over two days, there have been
gaps. For example, while one cousin said Batouty had lined up
post-retirement job with another airline, he would not say which
airline.
</P>
<P>
   But, the evidence of Batouty's affable personality and family
devotion seemed to outweigh the few, possibly, incriminating words
on a flight recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Clouding the issue is the unofficial nature of the reports about
the recording; reports that first said there was no problem in the
cockpit and later gave two different versions of Batouty's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fueling the conspiracy theories,'' said American
University of Cairo political sociologist Saad Eddin Ibrahim. Those
theories include a Boeing Co. cover up of mechanical problems to
suspicions that the CIA altered the voice recorders.
</P>
<P>
   In one of Ibrahim's classes, only one of 45 students said they
considered suicide a possibility in the airplane crash.

ROCKETTES KICK IT IN LOS ANGELES

By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the holiday season, and that means the No. 1 live show in
America comes to Los Angeles. Is it ``Cats''? No. ``The Lion
King''? Think again. The real high-steppin' kings... er, queens...
of the stage are the Radio City Rockettes, whose Radio City
Christmas Spectacular has become a multicity record breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an amazing total of 2 million people in New York, Los
Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Branson (Mo.) and Myrtle Beach (S.C.)
attended the show, bringing its gross to $83 million. At the
Universal Amphitheatre, the show broke all records for such past
top shows as ``Jesus Christ, Superstar'' and ``Tommy.''
</P>
<P>
   In its second year in L.A., the Radio City extravaganza _ with
more than 50 on-stage performers _ is making a few changes. The
most important one may be that, in addition to live animals, the
show now features live musicians rather than canned music. The use
of tape instead of an orchestra last year caused an uproar among
the musicians' union.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Espinosa, president of Professional Musicians Local 47, says
this year's show will be better for everyone now that musicians are
included. ``When you hear a live orchestra, you don't just hear the
difference, you feel the difference,'' he said. ``I think Los
Angeles audiences are becoming more savvy about what they're
getting. ... When they pay $60 for a show, they expect to get the
works, including a live orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for kids, it's especially great. They get to see musicians
playing on instruments. It really is educational.''
</P>
<P>
   Other new twists include presenting three Los Angeles shows in
Spanish, giving Santa a larger role in the show, spiffing up the
costumes and making it ``snow'' inside the theater. Howard Kolins,
executive producer of the Christmas Spectacular, says it's these
kinds of updates and tweaks that he hopes will make the show a hit
with L.A. audiences for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is considered to be a place where tradition
doesn't stick,'' said New York-based Kolins, ``But I'd like to
think we can get into the heart of every (Angeleno).''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Los Angeles will never catch up with New York in terms of
the longevity of the show: There, it has run every year since 1933.
Kolins attributes the show's popularity to its cross-generational
appeal and its status as a New York legend. ``It's truly a family
show. No one feels put out that they've had to tolerate the show to
make someone else happy,'' Kolins said. ``Plus, it becomes a
tradition among families who may have seen it in New York, or just
heard about it and now can see it in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Hodges, senior vice president of House of Blues Concerts
(formerly Universal Concerts), agrees that the show's broad
demographics are the secret of its blockbuster appeal. ``It's
certainly been record-breaking for us,'' Hodges said. ``We've
gotten a mixture of people _ some who've been here before, and some
who haven't, both locals and tourists. And from what we've heard
from the retailers and the studio tour people,'' Hodges said,
``They've done great because of the show, too.''
</P>
<P>
   With 53 performances this year, the Christmas Spectacular at
Universal will be hard to miss. But if you're looking to make it a
tradition among your own family, it's best to buy early: Strong
group sales and the reduced number of seats for these shows (3,300
rather than the Amphitheatre's usual 6,000) due to the lavish
nature of the production means that tickets for the most popular
nights do go fast.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Radio City Christmas Spectacular runs Dec. 1-28 at the
Universal Amphitheatre, 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City.
Performances will be presented in Spanish Dec. 12, 20 (matinee) and
26. Tickets ($22.50 to $63.50) available through the Universal
Amphitheatre Main and CityWalk box offices, online at
www.hobconcerts.com, at all Ticketmaster outlets or by calling
Ticketmaster at (213) 252-(8497).

 &HT;    Texas A&AMP;M alumni mourn loss
 &HT;    By Rebecca Thatcher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As word of the fatal collapse of the bonfire at
Texas A&AMP;M spread through Austin, members of the tightly-knit alumni
club here called each other, fretted over news of the rescue
efforts, and made plans to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
   Attending Texas A&AMP;M is often a family tradition, with an
unbroken line of graduates running from grandparents to
grandchildren. Lou Obdyke, the president of the Capital City A&AMP;M
Club and an Austin lawyer, said many members of the club have
called to ask what they can do to help.
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``pretty rough situation over there in College Station,''
said Obdyke. ``I think the tragedy is what everybody's focused
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, former yell leader, said he was ``deeply
saddened'' by the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to closely monitor this situation,'' Perry
said in a press release. ``I encourage all Texans to pray for those
impacted by this accident, their families, friends, and the entire
student body and faculty of Texas A&AMP;M University.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Immenhauser, a consultant broker in insurance and
investments who graduated in 1994, said she could not understand
how the bonfire could have collapsed or how so many could have been
injured. She recalled only two people being allowed to climb the
structure, and many other safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see how that could happen,'' Immenhauser said.
``Safety has always been a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Immenhauser said she feels Texas A &AMP; M should cancel future
Bonfires. ``Out of respect to the students who were killed, I can't
imagine celebrating Bonfire again,'' she said. ``I just think it's
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Haws, an Austin veterinarian who graduated in 1948,
was concerned about his granddaughter, who is a student at A&AMP;M. He
said heard from his daughter that the granddaughter had helped with
the early stages of the rescue effort and was okay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just real sad,'' Haws said.
</P>
<P>
   Dannielle Cantrell, a real estate agent and the president elect
of the Capital City A&AMP;M Club, said she spent almost all Thursday
morning talking to friends and club members about the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just praying for the ones who are still in surgery and
critical,'' she said. ``We're just worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantrell and Obdyke said it was too early to speculate about the
future of the bonfire. Obdyke, who cut logs for the bonfire as a
corps member in the 1960s, said he trusted the A&AMP;M administration
to decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure President Ray Bowen and the college will take serious
consideration,'' Obdyke said. ``I have faith that he and his staff
will make the right decision.''

`ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER': FASTEN YOUR SEATBELT, EVE, AND YOU TOO,
BLANCHE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``All About My Mother'' was shown on the opening night of this
year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet
Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 24.
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Pedro Almodovar gleefully established himself as ``Spain's
most reputable disreputable young filmmaker'' (in Vincent Canby's
words), it was the dizzy hilarity of ``Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown'' that marked him as an avatar of outrageous,
sexy humor. Eleven years later he is back in a ravishingly
different mode. The antic fizz and bold, theatrical exaggeration of
his earlier work have blossomed (as was clear in the haunting 1997
``Live Flesh'') into a newly sophisticated style that is far more
passionate, wise and deeply felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' is a whole new order of Almodovar
extravaganza. It depends, as so many things do, upon the kindness
of strangers. Starting at that place in Almodovar's great big heart
where womanhood, artifice, Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote and
``All About Eve'' collide, it weaves life and art into a rich
tapestry of love, loss and compassion. This film's assorted females
_ real, theatrical or would-be _ move past the nervous breakdown
stage and on to something much more forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' plays a crucial role in the life of
the film's heroine, a nurse named Manuela (Cecilia Roth). It is
central to the film, too. Stellas and Stanleys abound throughout
the story, beginning on the evening when Manuela celebrates the
17th birthday of her son, Esteban (Eloy Azarin), by accompanying
him to a performance of the play in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban is so captivated by the evening's Blanche DuBois, the
diva Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes), that he waits for her in the
street in hopes of an autograph. In a devastating sequence filmed
by Almodovar with the sweeping visual assurance that binds this
film together so firmly, Manuela's beloved son is mowed down in the
street. The camera stays wrenchingly with an Esteban's-eye view of
the scene until Esteban is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``All About My Mother'' is about splendidly resilient
women rather than wounded ones, it has already begun to entwine
Manuela's shocking experience with a sense of drama. Manuela
oversees donor organ transplants, and before the accident she has
played the role of a widow in a hospital simulation. Now the moment
is real, and the same two doctors who staged it with Manuela are
really helping her to decide the fate of her son's heart. On the
stage, Blanche DuBois searches pitifully for her red heart-shape
jewelry box; in life Manuela leaves Esteban's heart beating in
another man's body and goes on to fulfill her son's last wishes.
And Almodovar, being to the weepie born, presents this womanly
melodrama with an empathy to recall George Cukor's and an
eye-dampening intensity to out-Sirk Douglas Sirk.
</P>
<P>
   But when Manuela travels to Barcelona for her son's sake, the
film enters a buoyant and generous new world. It was here, 20 years
ago, that she and a senior Esteban first met, when they starred in
``Streetcar.'' And even though her husband has since become a
larcenous femme fatale named Lola, Manuela wants to find him and
tell him of her son's life and death.
</P>
<P>
   She goes looking in a nefarious outdoor hangout called the
Field, where prostitutes and their clients move in circles as if
this were a merry-go-round, or a Fellini vision. What passes for
vice in other contexts remains a source of wit and sweetness in
Almodovar's work.
</P>
<P>
   Charging into the story at this point, and bursting into the
film like a drag supernova, is the irrepressible La Agrado, played
by a Spanish nightclub performer named Antonia San Juan. La Agrado
and Manuela turn out to be old friends from the days before La
Agrado had breasts, and soon she has taken Manuela under her wing.
One by one, the women adrift through this story begin to help and
restore one another, as when La Agrado brings Manuela to the
prostitutes' shelter where beautiful Sister Rosa (Penelope Cruz)
ministers to the needy. The nun looks meek and devout, but it turns
out that she knows Lola, too.
</P>
<P>
   Working in a style he has called ``screwball drama,'' Almodovar
also brings in the two ``Streetcar'' actresses (who are stormy
lovers) and lets the group of women gain sustenance as it grows.
This film is lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played
actresses, and it celebrates the self-preserving instincts that can
make an actress of anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Huma and Nina (Candela Pena) have such a Kowalski-like battling
relationship that Manuela is even called upon to play Stella
onstage one night, which is something she can do by heart. There's
a stroke of ``All About Eve'' here, but it comes without malice.
Almodovar would rather show the power of artifice and impersonation
to transcend ordinary truth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. San Juan's Agrado supplies a large share of comic
relief, her most important moment in the film comes after a
``Streetcar'' performance is abruptly canceled. La Agrado takes the
stage and offers to tell the story of her life, which nearly clears
the room. Then, in a funny yet prideful monologue, she recites
chapter and verse on all the costly surgery and silicone that made
her what she now appears to be. ``It cost me a lot to be
authentic,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In ``All About My Mother'' the world of acting becomes a source
of inspiration to women as they improvise their way through their
own lives with the kind of strength, passion and humor this
filmmaker has always celebrated. Almodovar has expressed the idea
of life as a divine form of acting before, but never with the kind
of clarity and beauty that glitter here.
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother,'' his best film by far, is all about how
tragedies of the flesh can yield renewal and hope despite the pain
they leave behind, which is as clear an understanding of what makes
movies tick as Almodovar will ever need. It's the crossover moment
in the career of a born four-hankie storyteller of ever increasing
stature. Look out, Hollywood, here he comes.

 &HT;    Texas GOP divided over senator's fate
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGLETON, Texas _ On a sunny morning in September, state Sen.
Buster Brown stood in a public park facing a young woman who used
to work for him. It couldn't have been easy.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks earlier, Brazosport College student Tiffany Black,
then 20, told police that the Southeast Texas senator touched her
breasts and buttocks and tried to kiss her during an impromptu golf
lesson in his Lake Jackson office. Brown, 58, met Black in the park
to read a short letter apologizing for his ``unwanted sexual
advances'' _ as his wife of 32 years, Black's fiancee, Black's
mother and the local district attorney looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Senate's ranking Republican, hoped the apology would
put the golf lesson to rest: Black agreed to drop her criminal
complaint in exchange for the apology, although she can still file
a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident may have far-reaching political fallout. The
Republican leadership in Brazoria County, which includes Brown's
hometown of Lake Jackson, demanded last week that he give up the
seat he has held since 1981. Capitol observers say the powerful
senator, who wants to replace Lt. Gov. Rick Perry if Gov. George W.
Bush is elected president and Perry takes his place, may have
knocked himself out of the race for Perry's post.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the incident has widened an existing rift in the
Brazoria County GOP. And in a community where the Republican
chairwoman is married to the city attorney, the district attorney
is married to the city manager and virtually everybody knows
everybody else, it is giving rise to some interesting conspiracy
theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't handled properly from the very first,'' said Ross
Ahlstrom, president of the Brazoria County Republican Men's Club
and a fierce rival of GOP Chairwoman Yvonne Dewey, who had led the
call for Brown's resignation. ``It appears it was done so the
senator could receive the maximum amount of embarrassment without
ever being able to defend himself in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who isn't up for re-election until 2002, says that he
won't step down and that he still plans to pursue Perry's job if it
becomes open. In a written statement, Brown criticized the Brazoria
County GOP's executive committee for not giving him a chance to
speak before it voted 19-2 to demand his resignation. He declined
to be interviewed for this story.

   A former high school history teacher, Brown earned a law degree
from the University of Texas and went on to become an assistant
district attorney for Brazoria County before entering private
practice and the Senate. He is conservative, and as chairman of the
Natural Resources Committee he has been a friend to business
interests.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown, who ran unsuccessfully for attorney general in 1990,
is more pragmatic than ideological, and he's often praised as a
lawmaker who can work with both sides to get things done. That
quality, coupled with his seniority, has fueled talk of him as a
potential lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   During his 18 years in the Senate, Brown has sponsored 456 bills
that have become law. He was surrounded by dozens of photographs,
plaques, a silver shovel and other emblems of that success as he
gave Black the fateful golf lesson in his Lake Jackson office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why a man would throw away the opportunity he had
for such a thing as that,'' said Harmon Hoot, an Angleton
upholstery store owner who used to head the Brazoria County
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   People in Brazoria County tend to smile and roll their eyes when
asked about the now infamous golf lesson. Grace Cook, who owns
Royal Hair Fashions in downtown Lake Jackson, said many of her
customers have been talking about the senator. For her part, Cook
can't decide whether Brown should resign, because ``we really don't
know the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Thode, chairman of the Fort Bend County Republicans, is
also reluctant to pass judgment. In addition to Brazoria County,
Brown represents residents in Fort Bend and Harris counties, but
Republicans there haven't asked him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer in three sides to every story: your side,
my side and the right side,'' Thode said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown's critics say his apology makes it clear what
happened. Some also note that an Alvin woman recently told police
that the senator grabbed her and tried to kiss her as she was
leaving his Lake Jackson office more than two years ago. The woman
said she came forward to support Black but didn't want to pursue
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   His critics say that any Republican who called on President
Clinton to resign for his affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky would be hypocritical not to demand the same from
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He openly admitted it, so there's no question about what he
did,'' said Jorene Aycock, a committee member who voted to demand
his resignation. ``If it's enough for her, that's fine. But once
it's public and he admits to something like that and everyone knows
it's in his character and his behavior _ it's just different
then.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's supporters say he deserves more credit for an
honorable _ and fairly speedy _ apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to do the Christian thing, to put this thing to bed
and move on down the road,'' said Ahlstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlstrom argues that family ties between public officials and
county GOP leaders influenced the way the Brown flap unfolded. He
also connects it to a Republican rift dating from a 1996 incident
at the Brazoria County Jail. A videotape of guards using dogs to
subdue prisoners there attracted national attention and split the
party into pro- and anti-sheriff factions. Dewey, the GOP
chairwoman, is angry at Brown for staying out of the fight instead
of supporting the sheriff, Ahlstrom claims.
</P>
<P>
   But Dewey, who notes that Ahlstrom ran against her for party
chair, says she was a Brown supporter until the September incident.
And District Attorney Jeri Yenne insists the Brown case was handled
like any other Class C assault, which is punishable by a $500 fine.
In many of those cases, Yenne said, she asks the victim whether an
apology would suffice. She said the ensuing publicity was
inevitable in such a tight-knit community.
</P>
<P>
   John Toth, the publisher of a local weekly newspaper who opposed
Dewey in the jail fight, backs her on the Brown issue. Toth said
the vote was notable because it united members of both Republican
factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this reflects the feeling of the people around here,''
Toth said. ``When you have all but two members of the executive
committee going against the most powerful senator in the state of
Texas, that tells you something.''

the West square off over Chechnya, as the Russian leader tells a

`BOILING POINT': DEATH, DESPAIR AND BAD MANNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something is rotten in the state of Japan, and the Renaissance
man who goes by the name Takeshi Kitano doesn't mind saying so.
</P>
<P>
   A nation of teamwork, apology and accommodation is giving way to
a generation of egocentricity, disrespect, violence and vengeance.
And in ``Boiling Point,'' his intriguing tragicomedy of ill
manners, Kitano, a ruthless critic of Japan who has described young
people as fools, begins to spell out his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiling Point'' was made in 1990, well before Kitano won
international renown for ``Hana-Bi'' (``Fireworks'') and
``Sonatine'' and a year after he made his debut as a film director
with ``Violent Cop,'' which opened in New York last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Boiling Point,'' Kitano, who calls himself Beat and is also
an actor, stand-up comic, film editor, painter, poet, essayist,
journalist, author, television personality and all-around tough
guy, takes a baseball team as his metaphor for the old Japan of
mannerly behavior, respect for authority and sublimation of self in
favor of the general good.
</P>
<P>
   The sore thumb that sticks glaringly out of the Eagles team
picture is a silent, sullen young man, Masaki (Masahiko Ono), who
doesn't show much zest, talent or team spirit. He is not much more
enthusiastic about his job at a filling station, but when a dapper,
brilliantined gangster complains about his work and begins shoving
him around, Masaki strikes back. Despite a round of apologies from
management and staff, the yakuza demands reparation under threat of
reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   And Kitano is off and running on a tale of widening violence and
vengeance. Told with his characteristic indulgence in sudden
brutality, bloody fights, massacres and casual, sadistic
maltreatment of women, the tale leads Masaki into the underworld of
the yakuza and to adventures and deeds that transform him into a
new and rather frighteningly volatile specimen of Japanese manhood.
</P>
<P>
   Including a scene of a crude butcher-knife amputation of a
finger joint in keeping with the yakuza code, ``Boiling Point,''
like the smoother, sharper ``Violent Cop,'' is not for the
sensitive or squeamish, which is not to say that it is without its
comic touches.
</P>
<P>
   Kitano himself turns up in a striking performance as Uehara, an
independent, perverse gangster who becomes Masaki's guide on a
journey through the Japanese underworld and into the new manhood.
</P>
<P>

A QUIET FAREWELL FOR MEDIATOR MITCHELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Nineteen months ago, the last time
George Mitchell thought his role as mediator in Northern Ireland's
longrunning Troubles was about to end, he was elated,
sleep-deprived and running on adrenalin.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Mitchell, the 66-year-old former US Senate majority
leader from Maine, sat calmly in his spartan office here,
clear-eyed and well-rested, ready to leave Belfast again, five
years after he signed up as President Clinton's adviser on Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good,'' said Mitchell, who, like many a
Downeaster, is a master of understatement.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, at his insistence, there were no deadlines, no
all-night bargaining sessions. In the cold light of day, Mitchell
got lifelong enemies to share the same space, to take meals
together, to talk about fishing, to look deep into each other's
eyes and decide whether they really want to go back to the days
when murder was a form of political discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Mitchell packed his bags for home, convinced that his
work here really is done, that those lifelong enemies have
concluded that while they didn't necessarily like each other, that
while they probably never would be friends, they could nonetheless
do business with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more I can do,'' Mitchell said, glancing at
his watch to make sure he was on schedule to catch the first leg of
his return to his wife, Heather, and their son, Andrew, who turned
2 last month. ``It is up to the parties here to make it work, and I
believe they can.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, in what students of politics consider a masterful
piece of diplomacy, Mitchell got most of the parties here to sign
the Good Friday Agreement, which was meant to transform the debate
over whether Northern Ireland would remain part of the United
Kingdom or merge with the Republic of Ireland from a violent
conflict to one decided by democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   But the two parties most crucial to the deal _ the Ulster
Unionists who represent most Protestants, and Sinn Fein, the
political allies of the Irish Republican Army _ signed up to the
agreement without so much as exchanging a word with each other.
Neither side trusted the other.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists refused to form a power-sharing government with Sinn
Fein, called for under the agreement, until the IRA turned in its
weapons. Sinn Fein said the unionists were using the issue as a
smokescreen because they could not stomach treating Catholic
nationalists as equals. The peace process stalled, and the threat
of a return to widespread violence loomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an agreement, but there was no trust,'' Mitchell
said.
</P>
<P>
   And so, with great reluctance, Mitchell ditched his family and
his Washington law practice 11 weeks ago to try to rescue it.
</P>
<P>
   It was July 16, a glorious, sunny day in London. Mitchell was
knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his work in Northern Ireland.
Heather beamed as they walked in Buckingham Palace. At the very
moment Mitchell was being honored, however, the Northern Ireland
Assembly that was the cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement was
collapsing in a sea of recrimination and farce, as unionists and
republicans refused to budge on their positions.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Mitchell got a call from Mo Mowlam, then the British
official in charge of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need you, George,'' Mowlam said.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, had spent all their political capital earlier that
month, setting deadlines that passed without agreement or sanction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need you,'' Mowlam repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell wasn't flattered. He did not want to go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' he recalled, ``the last thing I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, a former professional tennis player, took charge of
the situation. She told him he had to do it. He had invested too
much of his life. Sounding like Humphrey Bogart insisting that
Ingrid Bergman get on the plane in ``Casablanca,'' Heather Mitchell
told her husband he would regret it, maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow, but someday, if he didn't go back to Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' George Mitchell sighed, ``she was right.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Heather it would be two weeks, three at the most. But
time has a way of dragging on this island. And Mitchell had decided
time could not be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell had set a deadline last year, convinced that the
parties would not reach an agreement without one. But having seen
the hard feelings on both sides after the prime ministers had put
pressure on them to make a deal, Mitchell said he ``discarded any
notion of a deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was about building trust. I had to let them talk it
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of meetings in the drab Castle Buildings office
complex at Stormont here, where the Good Friday Agreement was
negotiated in a series of segregated corners that mirror this
segregated society, Mitchell asked the US ambassador to Britain,
Philip Lader, if he could borrow Lader's mansion in London's
Regents Park.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell says it was a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happened there, people connected with each other,''
he said. ``I arranged for meals to be served at this table that sat
18, 19 people. There were no seating arrangements, so people mixed.
My only order was that, during meals, we talked about anything but
politics. We talked about fishing, sports, families, the weather.
They became better aware of each other as persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, the former IRA chief of staff and Sinn Fein's
chief negotiator, agrees that the atmosphere changed inside Lader's
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to each other, not at each other,'' McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, there was a more intimate gathering in
Mitchell's suite at the Belfast Hilton. Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble, his chief negotiator Reg Empey, Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams and McGuinness joined Mitchell for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lasted three or four hours,'' Mitchell said. ``A lot got
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Trimble told Mitchell that if the IRA was willing to
appoint a representative to discuss turning in weapons, his party
was willing to form a power-sharing government that will include
two Sinn Fein cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell choreographed a series of confidence-building
statements, first by Trimble, then by Adams, who said that the
``decommissioning'' of IRA weapons ``is an essential part of the
peace process.'' On Wednesday, the IRA, which had previously ruled
out even talking about disarming, said it would appoint a
representative to discuss decommissioning after the power-sharing
government is formed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Mitchell said the creation of the power-sharing
government and appointment of paramilitary representatives to the
arms decommissioning authority should take place on the same day.
That can happen only if Trimble convinces his party council to back
him next week.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is not Mitchell's business. Thursday, he looked
forward to getting back to his life. His law practice has suffered,
with countless meetings cancelled. He regrets having missed the
noble pennant race of his beloved Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to get a little more depth in their rotation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Mitchell was stuck in Belfast, trying to resolve
a petty dispute over procedure, when his brother died. He barely
made it back in time to deliver the eulogy. This time around, the
personal toll was even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't around much the first seven months after my son was
born,'' he said, ``but now he is old enough to know when I'm gone,
and it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mitchell says the sacrifices have been worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound corny,'' he says, ``but when you believe
in something, when you believe that what you do can make a
difference for the better in people's lives, your life is never
more meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell looked down at the plum wall-to-wall carpeting
and then out the window that offers a view of bare trees and little
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``has been one of the most meaningful times
of my life.''

VISUALLY STUNNING BUT HORRORLESS, `HOLLOW' IS JUST THAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Depp faints more often than a Tennessee Williams heroine
in Tim Burton's ``Sleepy Hollow,'' a dizzying retelling of
Washington Irving's story of the Headless Horseman. Ichabod Crane
(Depp) is a New York constable sent to investigate a series of
murders in which the corpses have been decapitated. Crane is a man
of science _ as much as a modern man of 1799 can be _ and his
embrace of technology has separated him from the natural world.
Obsessed with his case of vials, solutions, special lenses and
devices, Crane uses them to make sense of the world. But his
struggle to view the world as a man of reason is shattered when
science fails him. When he discovers it is indeed a Headless
Horseman (Christopher Walken) terrorizing the countryside, Crane,
as jittery and fearful as Nancy Drew, has to relax his grip on
logic so he can solve the case.
</P>
<P>
   In this supernatural detective story, Crane is the hero as
ingenue. It turns out that Crane has a horrible secret, which we
learn about in flashbacks. His mother (Lisa Marie) was a witch, but
a good-hearted one: ``a child of nature'' whom his father murdered
because of her unnatural powers. ``Sleepy Hollow'' has mood and
atmosphere, exquisitely detailed set design and ... well, just
about everything but a story. As a filmmaker, Burton enjoys
conjuring explosive and juicy camp; here, he's made a polished gem
of a tribute to Hammer horror films. Most sets are shrouded in fog,
with more tones of muted grays and blacks than you thought ever
existed. (The gorgeous look comes from production designer Rick
Heinrichs, who has also worked with the Coen brothers, and from
cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. It's so crisp and otherworldly,
it looks as if it's set in an Eastern European snow globe _
especially in the stunning last shot.)
</P>
<P>
   As a director, Burton isn't strong on shaping a story. Nothing
much seems to matter except the endless beheadings. Burton also
plunders much of ``Beetlejuice.'' With its spires and covered
bridges, the tiny town could be the ancestor of the little village
``Beetlejuice'' was set in, and the good-luck book that Crane is
given _ a compendium of spells and devices from the spirit world _
is like the ``handbook from beyond'' in that previous film.
Although he's better at presenting action than he was in the past;
the ``Batman'' movies were so badly staged they made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the luscious joke is casting Walken as the Horseman;
he's a demon with ``a love of carnage'' even before he's
reincarnated as one. Before being captured and beheaded, he's had
his teeth filed to razor points and is clad in form-fitting black
togs, galloping about on a horse as dark as his heart; at one
point, there's a stunning image of him sitting on his bloodstained
mount. Crane's also a joke, clutching his instruments of reason and
fleeing scenes of violence. Eventually, he gathers the nerve in a
climax that's like Burton's 18th-century restaging of ``Terminator
2.'' The Horseman stalks a carriage and jumps aboard to get the
lovely Katrina (Christina Ricci, who, with her long blond wavy
hair, looks _ and acts _ like a voluptuous Glinda the Good Witch
from ``The Wizard of Oz.'')
</P>
<P>
   In look and tone, ``Hollow'' is so masterful _ and well-acted,
with Depp's comic talents well-used _ that it takes a while before
you learn Burton's awful secret. His movies lack subtext. There's
nothing going on inside. It's why ``Hollow'' is never really scary,
despite the violence and endless scenes of beheading: It's a horror
comedy with a shortage of horror. And it's why Burton's ``Ed Wood''
seemed likable but flat. There was no sexual charge beneath the
surface there, or here, despite Depp's constant fainting and the
attempt to depict the Horseman as unleashed id. (Irving's crudeness
served him better in the story.) Crane's observation that ``Truth
is not always appearance'' is peculiarly ironic with a director who
seems to believe exactly the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' is rated R for violence, gore and repeated
scenes of beheadings.

VOLUNTEER EMT SAYS SCENE WAS SURREAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tricia E. Jost dug through the collapsed logs at Texas A&AMP;M to
reach a student buried underneath and screaming for help.
</P>
<P>
   As Jost lowered an oxygen mask to his face, the trapped student
repeatedly asked her about the condition of his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 45 minutes I stayed with him and kept him talking so he
would stay conscious. I didn't want him to know that (his friend)
below me was already dead,'' said Jost, the daughter of Fort Worth
acting Police Chief Ralph Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Jost, 20, an emergency medical technician who volunteers with
the Texas A&AMP;M University Care Team, said Thursday that the
unfolding tragedy was surreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the situation was serious, but I couldn't even fathom
how horrible it actually is,'' Jost said by telephone from the
scene. ``I'm on autopilot. I'm not feeling anything. I'm not
feeling sad. I'm not crying. I have work I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jost stayed with the student, whose name she did not know, until
more help arrived. She said that his arms and legs were pinned by a
pile of logs, but that he was pulled out alive.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, Jost was working as coordinator for rescue
volunteers at the bonfire site. She and seven other crew members
had been there since midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Everything appeared to be going routinely.
</P>
<P>
   The EMT volunteers sat in the back of a rented moving truck,
some watching videos, others studying. Jost was reading her biology
textbook.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about 2:30 a.m., one volunteer shouted that ``the stack''
was falling. Sixty to 70 students were on top of the logs when the
accident happened in a field on the northeast corner of the campus.
A maximum of 70 students are allowed on the stack at one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were screaming and running everywhere,'' Jost said. ``I
put a hard hat on and pretty much ran right into the middle of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next few hours, Jost helped pull victims away from the
collapsed log stack and tended to students with fractured arms,
injured legs and cuts. All the while, she and other rescue workers
strained to locate students crying for help inside the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 a.m., Jost called her parents to tell them what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to assure them that she and her sister, Mandi Jost,
an 18-year-old freshman, were not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Cindi Mendoza, a registered nurse with North Texas Affiliated
Medical Group, said she cried for an hour after her daughter
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about all of the other parents whose children didn't
make it or were injured,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she also worries about how those who witnessed the
accident, including her daughter, will cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, there seems to be an overabundance of tragedy, and it
seems to be happening to kids,'' she said. ``Those young people out
there today will be left with images most of us will never have to
experience in our whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Mendoza agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit I'm kind of worried about Tricia. We need to make
sure she is OK.''

MITCHELL ASKS DISSIDENTS NOT TO BLOCK NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs to rewrite and simplify 1st and 3rd grafs. No other
changes.)  
(th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Former Sen. George Mitchell pleaded
with dissident politicians Thursday not to block a plan to end the
deadlock that is stalling progress in the Northern Ireland peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither side will get all it wanted and both will endure
severe political pain,'' he said. ``But there is no other way
forward. Prolonging the stalemate will leave this society uncertain
and vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending 11 weeks of hard bargaining, the mediation mission led by
Mitchell has put in place a series of incremental steps this week
that hold the promise of ending an impasse over paramilitary
disarmament and starting up the new Northern Ireland government
envisioned in the April 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan must be endorsed by the Ulster Unionists, and their
leader, David Trimble, faces the challenge of persuading a sizable
number of disaffected members to overcome their objections to
entering government with Sinn Fein, the political representatives
of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   In the most important development of the week, the IRA issued a
statement on Wednesday saying it would be willing for the first
time to discuss dismantling the arsenal of guns and bombs assembled
during its 30-year fight against British rule, a notion it had
previously dismissed as tantamount to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatic gesture did not satisfy many Ulster Unionists
who have been demanding the beginning of the actual turnover of
weapons before they will sit in government with Sinn Fein. They
consider Trimble's retreat from that position a betrayal of their
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble is expected to convene a meeting of the 850-strong party
council in 10 days to seek approval for proceeding with the
Mitchell plan, and the lobbying is already intense.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Reg Empey, the Ulster Unionists' chief negotiator, urged
colleagues to ponder the various conciliatory statements that
emerged this week ``so that the true significance and meaning of
them may be forthcoming.'' He said a close reading would produce
the conclusion that ``there is no other way forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to combat Ulster Unionist critics' suspicion that
Trimble had not been tenacious enough, Peter Mandelson, Britain's
secretary for Northern Ireland, depicted him as someone who had
fought aggressively for unionist interests.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting after a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing St. at which
the Mitchell plan came in for praise from Prime Minister Tony
Blair, Mandelson said Trimble ``has at times been frustrating,
almost painful, in what he has held out for, but I must say it has
shown a remarkable reward and dividend for unionists in Northern
Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement set up a new Northern Ireland Assembly and a
number of governmental bodies linking Belfast with Dublin, and with
the new legislatures in Scotland and Wales and the British
Parliament in London in an effort to balance the interests of
unionists and republicans. All these institutions could be up and
running next month if the Mitchell plan is accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists, most of whom are Protestants, favor keeping Northern
Ireland British while republicans, who tend to be Catholic, favor
eventual unity with the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   When the disarmament impasse put the agreement in danger of
unraveling, Blair and Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland held
marathon rescue talks in April and again in July. Those efforts
failed, and they sent for Mitchell, who over a 26-month period
brokered the original agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As Mitchell made his farewell remarks Thursday afternoon before
departing for the United States, political leaders who have lived
in deep distrust of one another for decades lined the walls of the
conference room and then strode one by one to the podium to pay
tribute to his achievement.
</P>
<P>
   One notable success of the Mitchell mission was to create a
spirit of cooperation among sworn enemies, and Mitchell praised
them Thursday for ``having set aside their hostility for the good
of their society.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up his two extended stays in the province, Mitchell
said: ``I have been involved in this effort for nearly five years.
I cannot say that I have enjoyed every minute of it. But while on
occasion it has been difficult, it also has been one of the most
meaningful times of my life.''

 &HT;    CDC: Gun violence declining
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fewer U.S. residents are being killed or injured by
guns, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.
But gunshot wounds are still a serious public health concern: More
than 96,000 Americans receive gunshot wounds each year and
one-third of them die.
</P>
<P>
   According to numbers released by the agency, gun violence has
declined since 1993's peak of 39,595 deaths. But guns remain one of
the greatest causes of deaths due to injury, second only to cars,
the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the most recent year for which national surveys have
been done, 32,436 Americans died from gunshot wounds, and an
additional 64,207 were injured seriously enough to seek emergency
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers represent a drop of 21 percent in death rates and
almost 41 percent in rates of nonfatal injury since the high-water
mark of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The declines were consistent for most groups within the U.S.
population, the CDC added. Deaths and injuries dropped by similar
amounts among men and women, and among Hispanics and
African-Americans. In fact, the reductions in death and injury were
greater among nonwhites than among whites.
</P>
<P>
   Other surveys taken recently have recorded a nationwide decrease
of 21 percent in the rate of violent crime. The analysis of death
and injury rates bears that out, the CDC said, with one troubling
exception. Though rates of homicide and of accidental death due to
guns have been dropping sharply, the rate of suicide by gun remains
high.
</P>
<P>
   Harsher gun laws, a better economy, an aging population and a
declining market for drugs may have contributed to the declines in
death and injury, the CDC said.

HISTORY'S HIDDEN SCARS EMERGE FROM A GERMANY UNITED

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOTENSLEBEN, Germany _ This is a country of scars. Some are
evident, some lie deeply hidden, as the story of this village on
the former border between East and West Germany shows.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with the evident scars, stroll into the fields beyond
the village, where the quiet quickly gives way to the disquieting:
a wall, a watchtower and coils of barbed wire rise from the
undulating countryside and mark the Cold War's old frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin Wall fell on Nov. 9, 1989, but elsewhere on the
930-mile border between East and West Germany the end of Europe's
division came more slowly. At Hotensleben, it was only on Nov. 19
that the heavily fortified wall was breached after repeated
protests by local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we watched what happened in Berlin, we thought it was a
one-day mistake,'' said Dieter Buchwald, the mayor of this formerly
East German town. ``We were certain the Russians would never
tolerate it. But then we gained courage, and about 300 of us went
every day to press for the opening of our wall.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days that opening came. Euphoria and emotional family
reunions followed. Then, as elsewhere, came the difficulties: a
sugar factory closed, a mine shut down, hundreds of jobs were lost.
Widespread unemployment was hard, but a deeper pain emerged when
the hidden scar of Hotensleben at last emerged.
</P>
<P>
   That scar stemmed from the story of Alfred and Eva Jaeckel, the
one Jewish family in the village. Owners of the Hotensleben textile
store, German patriots until Hitler decreed otherwise, they were
banished from history between 1945 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   East German history was a science in the service of the
Communist regime. Hitler, seen through this prism, was the last
spasm of reactionary capitalism, a man thrust to power by the
German bourgeoisie and resisted by the socialist worker-heroes of
the future East German state. In this vision, the Holocaust had no
place.
</P>
<P>
   So in communist, postwar Hotensleben, on the front line between
the Soviet and British sectors, the story of the Jaeckels simply
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The end of Europe's division also marked the release of buried
history. Sometimes this has proved explosive, as in the Balkans,
where the past has been manipulated again to serve
communists-turned-nationalists. Sometimes, as in this German
village, a result has been a belated push for truth and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The push began in 1990 with a property claim from Israel that
arrived at the town and amazed Buchwald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had grown up in this village, but nobody ever mentioned a
Jewish family,'' said the mayor, an engineer who took office in
1989. ``We heard about Hitler's fascist atrocities, but not about
the Jews, here or anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The claim came from Alfred's son, Reinhold Jaeckel. Intrigued,
the mayor decided to make use of a government-subsidized make-work
program to give an unemployed person the task of researching
whether a Jewish family called Jaeckel had ever lived in
Hotensleben.
</P>
<P>
   Responses from the town's 2,400 inhabitants were initially
evasive. People old enough to remember the war years seemed
reluctant to talk about the Nazi period; above all, they did not
want their own names linked with any testimony. But gradually the
lost story of the Jaeckels was pieced together.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Jaeckel opened his store in 1907 and fought for Germany
in World War I, earning an Iron Cross for bravery. After the war,
he returned to Hotensleben, where business was good until Hitler
came to power in 1933. Then banners began to appear saying:
``Anyone who buys from the Jews not wanted here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaeckel, like many patriotic German Jews, refused to believe the
worst. He tried to ignore the taunts of the Nazis gathering in the
Knopf hotel next to the store.
</P>
<P>
   But his Zionist son, Reinhold, who was born in 1908, left
Germany for Palestine in 1933, as soon as Hitler gained power.
Having worked most of his life as a teacher, Reinhold Jaeckel died
in Israel in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was always obsessed with what happened in
Hotensleben,'' said Reinhold's son Joram Jaeckel, who lives in
Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv. ``He wanted to know exactly what happened
to his family and he wanted to recover the property. He wrote
countless letters. But until the Cold War ended, we could not do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Cold War hid was the way German barbarism had destroyed
the Jaeckel family. On the night of Nov. 9, 1938 _ the same date in
November that the Berlin Wall would fall 51 years later _ their
store was smashed and ransacked in the Kristallnacht rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred and his wife, Eva, were arrested, taken initially to
Berlin, and then deported to Auschwitz in 1942, where they were
killed. Their son Albert was also arrested and killed by the Nazis
in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a half-century after these crimes, in 1990, that
Reinhold Jaeckel returned to Hotensleben for the first time,
accompanied by his son. ``We felt a terrible ambivalence,'' Joram
Jaeckel said.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, people were nice, helpful, overwhelmingly
polite. ``On the other,'' he continued, ``I knew that these were
the sons and daughters of my family's murderers, and that the older
people may even have participated in Kristallnacht.''
</P>
<P>
   The only trace of the family in the town was the grave of
Reinhold's grandmother Ernestine Lippmann. An 80-year-old woman in
1938, she was beaten by the Nazis during the Kristallnacht attack
and died 10 days later, on Nov. 19, 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Joram Jaeckel, 53, recalled meeting a woman old enough to have
witnessed these events, asking her about his great-grandmother's
death, and seeing a shadow of unease fall across her face. ``She
did not want to tell the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchwald, a devout Christian, is now deeply concerned with
historical truth, which he sees as the only basis for ending
Europe's 20th-century convulsions. His own family was uprooted from
Silesia after 1945 when the area became part of Poland, so he knows
the anguish of displacement.
</P>
<P>
   He played an important role in ensuring the restitution of the
Jaeckel home _ then a ruin _ in 1994. The preservation of the wall
outside the village as a memorial to Germany's division has also
been the mayor's work.
</P>
<P>
   In the hall outside his office, Buchwald has organized a
permanent exhibition of the Jaeckel family story made up of
photographs, letters from Reinhold Jaeckel and unsigned testimony
from local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old people alive at Kristallnacht are still too embarrassed to
sign their name,'' Buchwald said. ``Germans continue to complicate
their history. Some now say it was not really so bad for the Jews
under the Nazis, and so I exhibit these photos. Others say it was
not really so bad in communist East Germany, and so I want the wall
there as a reminder of what that state was.''

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Even with history made so evident, its scars are not quickly
overcome. For four decades, East Germans learned they were the good
Germans, the anti-fascists during Hitler's rule. In this way,
honest confrontation with Nazi crimes was avoided.
</P>
<P>
   One result of this has been the much greater success of neo-Nazi
groups in the former East Germany than in the West. In the last
election in Saxony-Anhalt, the state in which Hotensleben is
situated, the extreme right took 12.9 percent of the vote. This
prominence of rightist groups, in turn, hinders east-west
integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I note that my children, who are in their 20s, are not
interested in the east,'' said Willi Heidemann, the top
administrative official in the nearby village of Jerxheim, which
was on the western side of the border. ``In part that's because
they are apolitical members of what I call a just-for-fun
generation. But they are also put off by right-wing violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Joram Jaeckel, who is now trying to rent out his recovered and
restored property, puts the neo-Nazism of skinheads down to the
follies of youth. Once, staying at an inn in the nearby town of
Schoeningen, he overhead chants of ``Heil Hitler!'' and shuddered.
But he is more deeply disturbed by meetings with older Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I always ask myself,'' he said, ``is `What are they
thinking? What is behind the faces?'''

`HOME PAGE': NO REVOLUTION AT HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the hue and cry about how the Internet is destroying
personal privacy, few have pointed out that for certain
cyberfanatics that erosion is cause for rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   Computer gurus like Justin Hall, the bratty, motor-mouthed
exhibitionist who is the focus of Doug Block's intriguing but
disorganized documentary, ``Home Page,'' see no need for personal
privacy once the utopian electronic community of their dreams is
established. The world Hall imagines is a kind of virtual commune
that recalls the headiest collective fantasies of the hippie
counterculture but is situated in cyberspace instead of the real
world.
</P>
<P>
   When first glimpsed, Hall is an undergraduate at Swarthmore
College in 1996, where he is a cybercelebrity who operates a home
page visited daily by 7,000 people. Dressed in psychedelic finery,
his blond hair teased into a pointed tower, he is the very model of
latter-day hippie proselytizer. On his page, which consists of a
daily journal and photographs of him and his friends, Hall
literally lets it all hang out, revealing himself in nude
photographs (he is a soft-featured, girlish-looking boy with an
impish grin) and disclosing the most intimate details of his
personal history and his relationships with a series of women. Hall
is only too eager to confide to the camera that his father was
alcoholic and committed suicide, that he was brought up by a
succession of nannies and that he has had nine years of
psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows Hall from Swarthmore to San Francisco, where he
teams up with his mentor, Howard Rheingold, the author and World
Wide Web visionary, to help begin a Web site called Electric Minds
whose goal is the establishment of a virtual community. Their
relationship is far from harmonious, and Hall tests it by sneakily
revealing his mentor's background as a writer of purple-prosed
cyberporn.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is the most vivid and messianic figure in this movie's
portrait of a loosely knit band of computer fanatics who use the
Internet to explore the boundaries of communication and human
relationships. In the film's halfhearted subplot, Block establishes
his own home page, in which he writes a confessional journal, talks
his elderly parents into going online and interviews his wife,
Marjorie Silver, and young daughter, Lucy, about the effects of
computers on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The more people Block interviews, the more the film seems to
reinforce cliched images of computer nerds as brainy neurotics who
resort to sophisticated high-tech mind games to try to surmount
discomfort in their own bodies. The relationship of Julie Petersen,
her husband, Jim, and her boyfriend, Patrick Farley, is offered as
a utopian paradigm for cybersexual liberation. While Julie traveled
across the country with Patrick, they related running accounts of
their affair on their personal home pages. Jim insists that he was
grateful for their accounts because it was ``better than living in
the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Carl Steadman, one of the movie's few voices of reason,
observes, endless communication doesn't change human nature.
``People disagree,'' he admits. ``And you very well might not like
your neighbor's opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in front of a giant teddy bear, Steadman, the boyish
founder of his own satirical Webzine, continues: ``We've gone from
this state where the Web was going to offer the perfect
communications medium where everyone could talk to everyone else
and their differences would be erased to this fallout where it's
not as we planned, and the Net is not going to provide what we
wanted it to provide, and it's not going to make us rich. There's
no revolution at hand.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Egyptian officials arrived here to examine and
help interpreting the final remarks made by two of that country's
most veteran pilots, FBI agents continued to gather information on
co-pilot Gamil El Batouty, the man suspected of putting EgyptAir
Flight 990 into a dive from which it could not recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything indicates it was him, but there has to by a why, a
motive, and nothing jumps out,'' said a source familiar with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Agents were believed to be interviewing everyone who knew
Batouty. He spent much time in Southern California, where his
10-year-old daughter was undergoing medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Egyptian officials who arrived here Thursday _
included senior security staff and technical experts _ began
preparing what the National Transportation Safety Board described
as a ``literal, factual transcript'' of the cockpit voice recorder.
That task was expected to take several days.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo-bound Boeing 767-300ER had taken off from New York's
John F. Kennedy International Airport on Oct. 31 and was 30 minutes
into the 11-hour flight when it suddenly began a steep, controlled
descent from 33,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the harrowing roller-coaster ride came to an end
when the jet broke apart and smashed into the Atlantic Ocean about
60 miles south of Nantucket, killing all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty, a veteran pilot who was not scheduled to fly the
airplane for several more hours, had received permission to do so
and was alone in the cockpit when the dive began.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the cockpit voice recorder captures in Arabic what
apparently is a prayer: ``I made my decision now. I put my faith in
God's hands.'' The voice is believed to be Batouty's.
</P>
<P>
   The jet's flight data recorder shows the autopilot was
disconnected, and eight seconds later the plane went into its death
dive.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence gathered from the flight data and cockpit voice
plane's recorders _ the two ``black boxes'' _ points to a cockpit
struggle for control of the doomed jet.
</P>
<P>
   One voice, believed to be that of Captain Ahmed El Habashi, the
pilot is heard exclaiming, ``What's going on?'' Within seconds, he
urged the co-pilot to ``Pull with me! Help me! Pull with me!''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that remark refers to Habashi's attempt to
bring the plane out of the dive by pulling back on one of the twin
yokes in the cockpit. The theory is bolstered by the unusual
position of the plane's elevators, flaps on the rear section of the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The left one, on the pilot's side, was pointed up _ something
that would give the plane lift. But the right one, on the
co-pilot's side, was pointed down, the position for a dive.
</P>
<P>
   Further troubling is data indicating the speed brake _ flaps on
the wing which increase the rate of descent and make it harder for
the plane to climb _ had been deployed. The speed brake handle is
located on the pilot's side of the aisle console, but could be
reached easily by either pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Within 35 seconds of the auto-pilot's disconnection, as the
plane hurtled earthward at speeds that exceeded its design, data
shows the twin engines were both shut down. About 14 seconds later,
the plane's transponder stopped working and its two black boxes
shut off.
</P>
<P>
   While some have speculated the engine shutdown may have been a
gross error, or a preparation for an emergency water landing, one
aviation source familiar with the investigation discounted that.
The source also noted that cutting engine power is a deliberate,
two-step action that could have put the jet in more peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the those speeds, it would have been impossible to relight
the engines and the only reason to shut them down is to crash the
airplane,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources said it is likely the other members of the flight
crew, seated in First Class, could not have gotten to the cockpit
to assist because the dive was so steep it caused a sense of
weightlessness inside the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators have not ruled out mechanical failure as the
cause of the crash, there have been no indications of that yet. If
the theory that Batouty was responsible holds, then the FBI will
take over the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday he expected a
decision within days on whether the bureau will assume full control
of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any decisions are going to take an extended
period of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While US officials were cooperating with Egyptian officials,
Holder said, they were not allowing them to block progress of the
inquiry. ``The investigation has not in any way been put at risk,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seek to work with the Egyptian government and try to
maintain this partnership that we have formed,'' he said. But if
the crash was an act of terrorism, ``our law would cover that
sitation and give the United States government jurisdiction in that
matter, and the FBI would likely be the investigative agency,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, agents would face the daunting task of
trying to determine the motives of the veteran military and
civilian pilot. Friends and relatives have described as a contented
man with five children, including 10-year-old Aya who was being
treated for lupus in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might make sense if the daughter's condition was worsening,
but she was getting better,'' said Vince Cannistraro, former head
of counter terrorism at the CIA. ``Secondly, if the medical bills
were overwhelming that could be a reason, but he comes from a
fairly well-to-do family and the bills were not that onerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he'd spent years at the airline, Batouty, 59, and facing
retirement in March, could have been disappointed that his company,
state-run EgyptAir, had never promoting him to Captain. Family
members have said Batouty was not unhappy with his airline career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened in the US, we wouldn't think twice about it,
we'd just say the guy went postal,'' said Cannistraro.
</P>
<P>
   But because suicide is so unusual in Egypt, the act of
deliberately downing the jet would seem even more baffling.
</P>
<P>
   Both Holder and State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin warned
against a ``rush to judgment'' about the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said ``wild conspiracy theories'' by the Arab media and
``speculative conclusions'' in the American press would only
heighten tensions on both sides of the Atlantic. Though he insisted
relations between the two countries remain stable, he issued a plea
for calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have confidence that Egypt and the United States will
work together on this investigation,'' Rubin said. ``Our long and
close friendship will not be harmed because we have confidence that
the Egyptian government, like the United States government, wants
to get to the bottom of this crash and find out what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   As the diplomatic efforts continued, the search for human
remains, and efforts to locate the jet's cockpit, continued in the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The salvage ship Carolyn Chouest Thursday resumed the search
that had been postponed earlier in the week because of rough seas.
It is expected to be joined by a 520-foot ship used to install oil
rigs, is expected to arrive on scene early next month. The Smit
Pioneer, working under contract with the US Navy, will lead the
salvage effort.

`SECRET DEFENSE': MOURNING, SELF-INDUCED, CERTAINLY BECOMES
ELECTRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly three hours, Sandrine Bonnaire grimly mopes through
``Secret Defense,'' French director Jacques Rivette's dreary
contemporary retelling of the Electra myth. Ms. Bonnaire is Sylvie,
a dour cancer researcher who is interrupted one day in her
laboratory by her emotionally distraught younger brother Paul
(Gregoire Colin), who arrives toting a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting he has evidence that their father, who ran a
guided-missile factory, was murdered by his right-hand man, Walser
(Jerzy Radziwilowicz), Paul announces that he intends to avenge the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Paul is certain that their father, instead of accidentally
falling from a moving train, was pushed. As proof, he produces a
snapshot found among his father's belongings showing Walser, who
claimed to be elsewhere, standing several feet from their father at
the station platform shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, written by the director with Pascal Bonitzer and
Emmanuelle Cuau, doesn't begin to make the details of the story
credible. Yet the movie is reasonably well acted ( Radziwilowicz's
porcine Walser is a weirdly ambiguous semi-villain) and sustains an
atmosphere of glum mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvie, deciding that her brother is too unstable to carry out
the murder, decides to do it herself. And the scenes of the taut,
nervous scientist determinedly boarding a series of trains on her
way to kill Walser have a hypnotic suspense. Confronting Walser at
his lavish country estate with its glowing red interiors, Sylvie
draws a gun but is intercepted by his secretary and girlfriend
Veronique (Laure Marsac). As the two women wrestle over the weapon,
it goes off, accidentally killing Veronique. For the rest of the
film _ and it has a long way to go _ Sylvie is so stricken with
guilt and fear that she can barely speak.
</P>
<P>
   Walser, to Sylvie's amazement, disposes of Veronique's body and
enlists her as an ally in covering up the death. Complicating
matters is the arrival of Sylvie's younger sister Ludivine (Ms.
Marsac). Walser's bizarre strategy for allaying Ludivine's possible
suspicions is to promptly seduce her. It also develops that
Sylvie's mother, Genevieve (Francoise Fabian) might somehow be in
cahoots with Walser. But why? Might it have something to do with
the death years many earlier of Sylvie's teen-age sister Elizabeth?
And why are the technicians at a top-secret project in Walser's
company walking around in rubber space suits?
</P>
<P>
   As the glacially paced film inches forward with its halting
conversations and accusatory glances, it tests your patience. And
when the truth ultimately tumbles out and more violence erupts,
don't expect a catharsis.

   Bolstering Your Career, Off the Time Clock &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Volunteering _ whether to help children, the elderly, the
homeless or the hungry _ translates into improved performance on
the job and, sometimes, better jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That is the conclusion of John Raynolds, the author of
``Volunteering: How Service Enriches Your Life _ and How Its
Unexpected Halo Effect Boosts Your Career'' (Golden Books, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Raynolds is chief executive of the National Peace Garden
Foundation, having come to that post through some pro bono
consulting work he did for the National Executive Service Corps.
While putting a dollar value on volunteer work is impossible, he
said, it helps people become better workers _ improving their
confidence and cheerfulness _ and can open career doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unexpected results are beneficial,'' he said. ``If you're
demonstrating some sort of skill in the volunteer arena, the people
you meet think of you when an opportunity comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer work is also an indicator of character, he added. In
his work as an executive with the Ward Howell search firm, when
faced with choosing between two candidates of similar strengths, he
said he often picked the one whose resume included volunteer work.
</P>
<P>
   Raynolds estimated that about 50 percent of all adults
participate in some form of volunteer work _ and not just during
the holidays. The work ranges from the hands-on (think soccer coach
or soup-kitchen helper) to the clerical (stuffing envelopes for a
political campaign).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this has come about because our society is so
fragmented, and people are looking for ways to connect to their
communities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers may be connecting, but they are doing it in fewer
hours. Independent Sector, a Washington research group, found that
the average volunteer last year cut back on time by nearly an hour
a week, to 3.5 hours. &QL;

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Help with parenting is sprouting from an unexpected source:
employers.
</P>
<P>
   C.R. Laurence, a hardware manufacturer and distributor in Los
Angeles, gave its 675 employees nationwide and in Canada a copy of
``How to Raise Emotionally Healthy Children'' (NMI Publishers,
1999), a 150-page book by Dr. Gerald Newmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in family values, and giving the book to our
employees is a way to enhance these values among our staff,'' said
Michael Sedano, the company's human resources director.
</P>
<P>
   On the same wavelength, Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A. in Manhattan
sponsored a voluntary two-day off-site parenting workshop for its
area executive staff members and their significant others.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Shapiro, vice president of human resources, said the
company ``believes in the well-being of children and wanted to make
available for our employees the tools necessary for understanding
and living with today's children.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Pronk, a principal with William M. Mercer, the human
resources consulting firm, said that in the last few years
companies have been providing more educational information on
topics important to employees' lives. ``They are doing these
things,'' Ms. Pronk said, ``for very positive reasons.'' _Alisa

<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. _ On most days, Don Storholm, an
unpretentious 60-year-old who wears a Mickey Mouse watch, does
business out of his car. For 27 years, he has made a comfortable
living estimating costs for construction projects in the
Minneapolis-St. Paul area, using his mobile office as a base.
</P>
<P>
   But working out of a car can mean chaos: Papers, pens and files
can roll off seats or tumble from the dashboard into under-the-seat
oblivion. To solve the problem, Storholm tried flimsy plastic car
organizers that rest between the seats, but they, too, jumped
around.
</P>
<P>
   So Storholm, in true entrepreneurial fashion, has turned his
need for mobile order into a business, and has been so successful
in turning out a decidedly low-tech solution _ the Executive Auto
Desk _ that he may soon quit his day job.
</P>
<P>
   Storholm is part of a growing legion of people who spend their
days in mobile caves. (italics)``Working(end italics) in their
cars?'' said Faith Popcorn, the trend forecaster. ``People are
(italics)living(end italics) in their cars _ running businesses,
eating, sleeping, studying, giving birth, talking on the phone,
changing their clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   About six years ago, when Storholm got ink on the red velour
interior of a new car, his wife, Sharon, 56, a secretary at a land
development company, didn't just put her foot down _ she picked up
her hammer and nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``She marched out to the garage and just started pounding boards
together,'' her husband recalled. A congenial guy, handy with
tools, he took over and created a portable desk that provided a
flat work surface, a nonskid pad so pens and pencils couldn't roll
away and slots for files, cell phone, laptop computer and fax
machine. There are also compartments for maps, tape measures and an
adding machine. Mrs. Storholm added a detachable wastebasket.
</P>
<P>
   Storholm's work became so much more orderly that he found
himself entering nine bids a day, not the usual seven. And when
clients stuck their heads into his four-wheeled haven, they were
impressed. ``Wow, you're really organized!''' he recalled them
saying.
</P>
<P>
   End of story? Not quite. Other people in the construction trades
told him they could use such desks in their cars and trucks. So he
started making desks for them, too. Then he started receiving
orders from meter readers, real estate brokers, home health care
workers and street pavers.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Storholms had created a sideline that threatened
to overwhelm them. After they set up a Web site (which is now being
reconfigured), orders arrived from as far away as Japan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Mrs. Storholm realized the need for a patent. ``I said
to Don, `When we're in the nursing home we'll be able to say we at
least tried,''' she said. On a car trip to the East Coast, they
went to Washington to turn in their patent application in person.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, two years and one rejection later, their Executive Auto
Desk was officially protected. Of the initial rejection, Storholm
said, ``They didn't like my drawings, so I had to hire an
architecture student to do them on a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Storholms received a plaque from the Minnesota
Inventors Congress proclaiming their prototype work the best
combination of aesthetics, oral presentation and working model.
Asked about the award, which he had to dig out of a closet,
Storholm shook his head with the modesty befitting a Midwesterner
coming face to face with personal achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to be an inventor,'' he said. ``This one is the
first and the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand quickly outstripped the couple's ability to build the
desks themselves, so they found a cabinetmaker in St. Paul to
produce them in cherry and mahogany. They now come in three sizes _
for compact cars, full-size cars and trucks. The price is $110 to
$339, depending on the size and whether the desk is assembled
before sale.
</P>
<P>
   The desk, which sits on the passenger seat, looks functional but
elegant. Secured by a seat belt and a cinch strap, it can be easily
removed and stored in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who like talking on the cell phone and applying mascara
using the rear-view mirror, take note: to work at the Auto Desk,
pull over first. Storholm, father of five, grandfather of seven and
a safety-first kind of guy, slaps a big warning label on every unit
saying exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to control people,'' he conceded, throwing up his
hands. ``But you'd have to be loony to use this while driving. If
this is a problem, they'll have to put warning labels on McDonald's
hamburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Storholms are on the brink of going from proprietors of a
mom-and-pop shop to being co-chief executives. The next step is to
find distributors and retailers, then perhaps license the product
to a manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The Storholms seem to be traveling the right road.
DaimlerChrysler recently began offering buyers of its Mercedes-Benz
vans in Europe a backseat office option (the Storholms' patent is
for a front-seat desk), with a bevy of high-tech goodies, for
$12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Bloomington, the Storholms find that most buyers are
men, given that many orders come from the construction industry.
But some women can't help but notice that the Auto Desk can easily
double as a vanity, to store nail polish, perfume and earrings.
``It's the perfect place to put on makeup,'' Mrs. Storholm
whispered, ``but I'd never say that in front of Don.''

U.S SECURES `HISTORIC' PIPELINE DEAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The old Silk Road may soon carry oil and gas
_ and give the United States unprecedented influence over the
energy-rich former Soviet republics in the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton watched as the presidents of Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan joined U.S. ally Turkey to
sign separate deals for multibillion-dollar oil and gas pipelines
that may be as important for geopolitics as for energy
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The pipelines would lessen Russia's influence over the former
Soviet empire and bypass Iran, a key U.S. goal. The pipelines also
would enhance the international standing of Turkey, the most
reliable U.S. friend in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``These agreements we just signed are truly historic. They will
advance the prosperity and security of the region critical to the
future of the entire world,'' Clinton said after the signing
ceremony at Ciragan Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pipelines will be an insurance policy for the entire
world, helping to ensure that our energy resources pass through
multiple routes, not a single choke point,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials accused the United States of using undo
pressure to secure the agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. administration brought political pressure to bear on
the companies involved in the construction,'' said Ivan Ivanov, a
deputy Russian Foreign Minister quoted by Interfax News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said Caspian Basin oil should be transported across
Russian territory. ``The infrastructure is already in place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson hailed the agreements as a
major foreign policy victory for the United States, which worked
for five years to secure approval for the routes that will link the
East to the West just as the Silk Road through the Caucasus region
once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just another oil and gas deal and this is not just
another pipeline,'' Richardson said. ``It is a strategic framework
that advances America's national security interests. It is a
strategic vision for the future of the Caspian region. These
agreements will help fulfill our commitment to the continued
prosperity and independence of the Caspian state.''
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkey signed documents for
a $2.4 billion, 1,200-mile oil pipeline that would travel from the
Azeri capital of Baku through Georgia to the Turkish Mediterranean
port of Ceyhan. Kazakhstan oil will be transported on the
Baku-Ceyhan pipeline once its completed, hopefully in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The four nations and Turkmenistan approved another document for
a $2.7 billion, 1,200-mile natural gas pipeline across the Caspian
Sea to Turkey expected to open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Turkmen President Sapamurat Niyazov said the Trans-Caspian gas
line will help nurture the region's independence. ``Today, with the
support of the United States, this project has gotten off the
ground,'' Niyazov said. He also asked Clinton to give his nation
``a helping and supportive hand'' in their efforts to build a
pipeline toward Asia to supply China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey and the former Soviet republics, all emerging democracies
with their own internal rivalries, moved forward with the
Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline despite some skepticism within the energy
industry over its viability.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson defended the Baku-Ceyhan project as ``commercially
viable'' and predicted its feasibility will be proven once a
financing package goes to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton again pledged to work with those nations to put together
a commercial financing package through the Export-Import Bank, the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Trade and
Development Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, as part of the agreement, guaranteed it would pay for
any cost overruns above $1.4 billion, the cost of the pipeline
going through its territory. The United States has not committed
any funds.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the oil consortium Azerbaijan International Operating
Co. produces 115,000 barrels per day. Much of its oil is
transported on a 100,000-barrel-per day pipeline from Baku to
Supsa, a Black Sea port in Georgia. The Baku-Ceyhan capacity will
be 1 million barrels a day, far in excess of what's being produced
now.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco, the lead firm in the Azeri consortium, has embraced
the pipeline, but several U.S. companies are reluctant. The Caspian
Basin reserves are projected to be on par with the North Sea but a
major find is still elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North Sea, when that was developed, first brought 100 dry
holes before any substantial resources were found. We are confident
that this has enormous resources,'' Richardson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian-controlled pipeline from Baku traverses Chechnya, a
rebellious province being pounded by the Russian military. Russia
plans to build a pipeline around that troubled area.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also has plans for a gas pipeline called Blue Stream
under the Black Sea. It strongly objected to both the Baku-Ceyhan
oil pipeline and the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-backed routes to the Mediterranean also are being
promoted as more environmentally safe than Russia's Black Sea plan
or Baku-Supsa route that requires tanker traffic to pass through
the narrow Bosphorus, the historic waterway out of the Black Sea
that flows through Istanbul and serves as the dividing line between
Europe and Asia.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like millions of other Americans, Tim Tainter
likes to play along with the contestants on ``Jeopardy,'' the
syndicated game show. Unlike most viewers, however, he uses his
Microsoft WebTV remote control to click on multiple-choice answers
that appear on his screen along with the live telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no learning curve,'' said Tainter, 44, an airline
catering worker, as his latest score was zapped to a database at
Columbia TriStar Television, the Sony division behind the show;
there, he was ranked against other home players. ``You just put
your thumb on a button and press.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say point-and-click simplicity explains how interactive
television, after a history of spectacular flops, may finally be
poised to take off in prime time. And through its WebTV subsidiary,
Microsoft has quietly taken a lead over America Online, seen by
analysts as its chief rival in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Through computer codes inserted invisibly in a standard
broadcast television signal, WebTV can now add features like
play-along games, sports scores, stock quotes and chat rooms to any
program on any television set that is connected to a WebTV box.
</P>
<P>
   This season, interactive features have been added to ``Wheel of
Fortune,'' the popular game show, and to programs like ``The NBC
Nightly News'' and ``Dateline.'' PBS has also inserted them, along
with cable channels like MSNBC, HBO, the Learning Channel and the
Home and Garden Network.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive television has been rethought repeatedly since its
original incarnation, as an information vehicle, was made obsolete
by the personal computer and the Internet before it passed the
pilot project stage. Until recently, the most popular idea was to
provide Internet access to consumers who did not have computers, as
Microsoft set out to do with WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is now repositioning WebTV as a conduit for
services like interactive programming, interactive advertising and
home shopping for the 100 million American households with
television. About 800,000 WebTV subscribers pay $24.95 a month for
the service, and the company hopes to double its membership rolls
each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft really wants to get into the living room,'' said
Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a market research
concern that studies interactive media. ``And they'll do whatever
it takes to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every TV executive is comfortable with the image of
Microsoft charging into prime-time television, especially after a
federal judge said earlier this month that Microsoft wielded
monopoly power in the PC operating system market, to its
competitors' detriment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nightmare is to wake up and discover Microsoft in control
of what I put down the pipe,'' said a senior Hollywood executive
who is planning his own company's interactive television strategy.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has plenty of allies for its own interactive TV
rollout, scheduled for the middle of 2000. The list includes the
DirecTV satellite broadcast unit of Hughes Network Systems; the
set-top box maker Philips NV; a digital video recorder
manufacturer, TiVo Inc., and Liberate Inc., a software concern
partly owned by AOL, Sun Microsystems and the Oracle Corp.
</P>
<P>
   AOL will have some catching up to do. This month, WebTV will
unveil a software upgrade for the DishPlayer satellite TV devices
from EchoStar Communications; the upgrade will allow users to
digitally record, rewind and fast-forward TV programs. And
Microsoft's investments, in the billions of dollars, in cable
operators like AT&AMP;T and Rogers Communications will begin paying off
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The cable companies have agreed to use a stripped-down version
of Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, called Microsoft
Television, in millions of cable set-top boxes in the United States
and in Europe, according to Bruce Leak, a co-founder of WebTV who
now directs Microsoft's TV efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Operating on digital cable lines, the new boxes will give
customers much faster access to WebTV's services than they have now
through 56-kilobit telephone modems.
</P>
<P>
   Leak is tantalized by visions of interactive television
surpassing the personal computer. ``I think it's bigger than the
Internet,'' he said in an interview at WebTV's headquarters in
Mountain View, Calif. ``All the elements are there for it to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In those 100 million television households, the TV is on for an
average of seven and a half hours a day, Leak said, while only 30
million households use computers online, averaging less than an
hour a day. By themselves, ``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune''
have ``all the reach of the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics are not lost on America Online, whose 19
million subscribers, most of them in the United States, make up the
world's largest online community. The company plans to begin
aggressively marketing AOL TV to its current subscribers next
summer, offering popular AOL features like e-mail, chat rooms and
navigation bars through their televisions for an additional monthly
fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the market is ready for another place in the home
with AOL-style things,'' said Barry Schuler, president of AOL
Interactive Services. ``We think we can ramp up to multiple
millions of boxes just within our own audience.''
</P>
<P>
   While Schuler allowed that WebTV fired the ``first volley,'' he
said interactive TV was ``going to go through several generations
before it becomes a mass market,'' leaving AOL plenty of time to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most industry executives and analysts agreed that
interactive TV would need a few years to catch on, just as
mass-market cable did in the early 1980s. But by 2004, Forrester
Research expects that 51 million American households will be using
interactive television, a market it estimates at $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, proponents of interactive TV have made rosy
predictions before. Companies like Time Warner and
Tele-Communications had big numbers in mind when they undertook
expensive trials of interactive TV in the early 1990s, but failed
to commercialize the medium.
</P>
<P>
   It took years of plummeting technology prices and expansion of
high-speed voice and data communications capacity before
interactive television could re-emerge as a feasible idea. WebTV
was one of the first to dive in.
</P>
<P>
   Begun four years ago at a former used-BMW dealership in Palo
Alto and bought by Microsoft in 1997, WebTV now employs 600 people
and occupies three of the five buildings on Microsoft's gleaming
new Silicon Valley campus along Highway 101.
</P>
<P>
   Leak, wearing jeans and a crumpled green sports shirt during an
interview, said WebTV's growth would promote competition, not
stymie it. ``Our strategy has been: `Look, we have the best
technology. Let's license that incredibly broadly to create a
standard,''' he said. ``We want the industry to move forward. We're
happy to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   As large as its ambitions are for WebTV, Leak said, the company
will not get into producing TV shows itself, though it may invest
in them. Partners like Columbia TriStar and NBC will do the
programming work. Leak said he recognized that people have ``more
or less fear of Microsoft'' dominating the emerging interactive
medium. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Hopefully, we can get people who have preconceived notions of
Microsoft to understand that we're trying to work with people,'' he
said. ``Maybe it's the new kinder, gentler Microsoft.''

HILLARY CLINTON LEARNS SILENCE IS NOT ALWAYS GOLDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the perilous political cauldron of the Middle
East, Hillary Rodham Clinton has learned a valuable lesson about
running for public office: Sometimes silence about a crucial issue
can generate as much criticism as exaggerated and ill-informed
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   For the first lady, who would like to become the junior senator
from New York, the incident occurred in the West Bank city of
Ramallah on Nov. 11 when she listened quietly to a blistering
denunciation of Israel by Suha Arafat, wife of the Palestinian
leader.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton sitting near her on a platform, Arafat charged
Israel with using toxic gas to put down Palestinian riots and of
contaminating the water supply. Although Clinton might have
responded publicly with an attack on Arafat's credibility, she said
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   From the point of view of good manners, she did the right thing.
Suha Arafat was her hostess, and the two had embraced warmly when
they met.
</P>
<P>
   From the point of view of a candidate for the public office in
New York, she did the wrong thing. The state has a large Jewish
population that is dedicated to the preservation of Israel and
defensive against critics of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Clinton's anticipated Republican
opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, to castigate her for not
immediately rejecting Arafat's assault on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He told City Hall reporters that, had he been there, he would
have objected to Arafat's attack. ``I would have made my position
clear,'' said the mayor, ``and I wouldn't have embraced the person
who said it ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton waited a day _ after clearing her remarks with the White
House _ to criticize Suha Arafat's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who still has not announced her decision to seek
the Senate seat, will find as she moves into a full-fledged
campaign that many Republican brickbats will be flying her way.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the political furor over the Arafat incident is
that Clinton has been a loyal friend of Israel. She drew
unfavorable comments from some Jewish leaders for declaring a few
months ago that a free and independent Palestine nation should be
established. But her proposal is one that, according to public
opinion polls, is favored by a majority of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Her explanation that she remained silent because she did not
want to do anything to interfere with the peace process did not
deter critics from attacking her.
</P>
<P>
   There probably will be times when Clinton wishes she had adhered
to the policy adopted by her role model, Eleanor Roosevelt, after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Some months after Franklin D. Roosevelt's death in April 1945,
Interior Secretary Harold Ickes and a group of New York Democrats
urged her to run for the Senate in 1946. Their plan called for
Democratic Sen. James Mead to run for governor against Thomas E.
Dewey and for the former first lady to become Mead's successor in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With Roosevelt on the ticket, they explained, Mead could
probably defeat Dewey, who had run unsuccessfully for president
against her husband in 1944. They even proposed that the party
draft her _ a move that would have proved immensely popular with
New York Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Roosevelt was adamant in her refusal to seek elective
office.
</P>
<P>
   Her biographer, Joseph P. Lash, explained that she ``wanted to
be free to speak out, a freedom she would have to surrender in
taking public office.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article written for Look Magazine in the summer of 1946,
Roosevelt said: ``If I do not run for office, I am not beholden to
my party. What I give, I give freely and I am too old (at age 62)
to want to be curtailed in any way in the expression of my own
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The former first lady explained that she preferred her work at
the United Nations, where she was a member of the U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
   In that bygone era, 53 years ago, Eleanor Roosevelt noted that
``no woman has, as yet, has been able to build up and hold
sufficient leadership to carry through a program.'' What is the
purpose of holding elective office, she asked, if you could not put
through a program.
</P>
<P>
   With the passing years, women have moved up in the government
hierarchy. Today we have four women in the Cabinet, 58 in the House
of Representatives and nine in the Senate. In 1946 there were 10 in
the House and none in the Cabinet or Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But as Hillary Clinton has learned, the road to elective office
remains strewn with hazards and with political partisans who are
anxious to see her stumble over them. If she is to win the Senate
race, she must shield herself to repulse attacks on her knowledge,
her courage, her husband and her ability to know when to speak and
when to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if she were to have a conversation with Roosevelt, as she
claims to have done in the past, she might decide that she can live
without being a senator.

 &HT;    Broad charges against club typical of attempts to nab organized
crime
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The sweeping federal charges against an Atlanta strip
club range from violent mob-related crime to prostitution. It is
the type of loaded indictment that prosecutors have used to attack
organized crime since Al Capone was convicted of tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Other prosecutorial tools _ such as the broad Rackeeteering
Corrupt-Influenced Organization law, or RICO, and property
confiscation rule _ have been added over the years. But the goal is
the same: shutting down organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the very expansion of these tools brings an inherent set of
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them is helping a jury follow the complex and
often interrelated charges that have allegedly piled up over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   One criminal defense attorney, Jerry Froelich, questioned the
wisdom of the government bringing such a complicated indictment
against the club, with charges dating back more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be a very large mistake,'' Froelich said. ``I've
always felt the toughest cases to defend against are the shortest
and tightest ... Lengthy cases can lose jurors. They become tired
and weary. The government can put up so many people who have been
given deals, it can boomerang against them big time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Art Leach, who is no stranger to
lengthy trials, said this case has enough interesting details to
keep a jury's attention. And the case does not have to be long if
many of the defendants plead guilty, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept behind RICO is to bring together before one
jury the totality of what has occurred in the enterprise,'' he
said. ``There are things that we as lawyers can do to try and make
the case move quickly and stay interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach was the federal prosecutor in one of the longest federal
racketeering cases in Atlanta this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The three-month trial of 10 members of the ``Loc Lam gang''
included six weeks of jury deliberations on 209 charges. Seven gang
members were convicted. Mistrials were declared against the three
others because the jury deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Club indictment, unsealed Wednesday, lodges charges
against club owner Steven Kaplan and 15 others, including four who
were not club employees. According to the indictment, the nude
dance club overbilled customers, provided free sex to celebrities
and prostitution to patrons. Club officials are accused of bribing
Atlanta police officers, loansharking, obstructing justice and
skimming cash from the club to evade taxes and buy Gambino family
protection.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the club and Kaplan strongly denied the charges
and predicted they will be completely vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said he hopes at least some of the defendants, once they
have digested the 97-page indictment, will decide not to fight the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they sit there in their homes and offices and realize what
we know, they will make decisions as to what they need to do and
what's best for them,'' Leach said. ``We would welcome their pleas
of guilty and assistance in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the goal of the FBI and IRS investigation goes beyond
convicting the nude dance club and Kaplan. Federal prosecutors want
this case to lead them deeper into the club's alleged ties with the
Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a continuing investigation and it's broader than this
case,'' Leach said Thursday. ``The investigation clearly includes
people within the organized crime family.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that some of those involved in the criminal
enterprise _ either those indicted who elect to plead guilty or
sources who already have come forward _ will become prosecution
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You typically need insider witnesses to prove a case like
this,'' Atlanta criminal defense attorney Jack Martin said. ``I
suspect they have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jim Deichert, a former federal prosecutor who once headed
the organized crime strike force in Atlanta: ``When you prosecute
organized crime, you use whatever you've got, whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of Atlanta, meanwhile, was considering its own response
to the charges against the club. Mayor Bill Campbell said he will
decide by noon Monday whether to revoke the club's liquor license.
</P>
<P>
   The city's code allows the mayor to suspend a liquor license if
he finds an establishment endangers the health, safety and welfare
of the public.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor may issue an emergency suspension, which would stay in
effect at least until the next meeting of the Liquor License Review
Board on Dec. 8.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forget about turkey for the moment, both the kind
that's eaten for Thanksgiving and the kind that closes on Broadway.
It is ham that's being served, without apology and with lots of
relish, in the mouthwatering new revival of ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' Cole
Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in
show business.
</P>
<P>
   As presented by a preening, self-delighted cast led by Brian
Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie, who wear a spotlight as though it
were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ``Kate,'' which opened
Thursday night at the Martin Beck Theater, proves that ham can
indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of
vintage musicals _ reverence and condescension _ the director
Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have
shaped a show that is broad, brazen, often shameless and finally
irresistible. The production, which doesn't seem to have a thought
in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it's
entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin.
</P>
<P>
   It had been looking recently as though some Cromwellian
moratorium had been placed on musicals that existed purely to
please, what with shows leaning toward either the robotic (both
``The Lion King'' and ``Saturday Night Fever'' seem to be looking,
in different ways, to a time in which human actors will be
unnecessary) or the solemnly preachy (``Ragtime,'' ``Parade''). But
following on the flying heels of this season's ``Contact,'' Susan
Stroman's blissful paean to dance as a life force, ``Kiss Me,
Kate'' asserts that there is still a place for sophisticated,
grown-up fun in the New York theater.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this ``Kate'' is a groundbreaker like ``Contact,'' with
its choreographic narrative, or the revival of ``Chicago,'' with
its glittering minimalist production. Even in 1948, when the show
opened, few reviews made claims for ``Kate'' as a masterpiece of
innovation, despite the cleverness of its two-tiered structure,
which parallels a Broadway-bound performance in Baltimore of
Shakespeare's ``Taming of the Shrew'' with the backstage love-hate
affair of its stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can say for `Kiss Me, Kate' is that it is terribly
enjoyable,'' wrote Brooks Atkinson, the critic for The New York
Times, who felt the musical was unilkely to join the immortal ranks
of revolutionary works like ``Show Boat'' and ``Oklahoma!'' The
Critics' Circle Award that season went to ``South Pacific,'' a show
with a social conscience that was in the ``organic'' tradition of
``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Kiss Me, Kate'' turns out to have staying power in ways
that other ``terribly enjoyable'' musicals from the first half of
the century (``The Boys From Syracuse,'' for example, and even
``Annie Get Your Gun'') have not. It's not just its top-drawer
Porter score, which ranges from the luxurious minor-key masochism
of ``So in Love'' to the double-entendre-laden bounciness of
``Always True to You (In My Fashion).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' also wallows happily in the romance of actors
as an enchanting, infuriating breed apart, self-created,
self-worshiping gods on their own Olympus. After all, Sam and Bella
Spewack's book, which was been tweaked here and there in ways that
never betray the show's original spirit, was partly inspired by the
highly dramatic behavior of the American theater's married
monarchs, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. And there are few things
an actor enjoys more than playing an actor who behaves badly
beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   This sensibility is conveyed not only by the evening's
splendidly robust leads, Mitchell and Ms. Mazzie as the
tantrum-prone divorced couple who are reunited as scrapping
co-stars in ``Shrew''; it also filters into every character part.
And when two Damon Runyonesque gangsters (gloriously embodied by
Lee Wilkof and Michael Mulheren) suddenly find themselves, for
arcane reasons of plot, onstage and in costume in the play within
the play, you can see them getting drunk on limelight. That
intoxication is what the show celebrates.
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore and Ms. Marshall channel actorly narcissism into a
steady stream of high spirits, even through long stretches of
(deliberately) awkwardly delivered Shakespeare and some jokes that
frankly fall flat. Those who know ``Kiss Me, Kate'' only from the
stilted 1953 movie version may be startled by the raw vitality on
tap here. While the production definitely comes from another time,
it also turns the past into a vital present.
</P>
<P>
   The perspective is beautifully reflected in the fine
contributions of Robin Wagner (sets), Martin Pakledinaz (costumes)
and Peter Kaczorowski (lighting), which create a sumptuously
colored palette that somehow seems tinged with a hint of sepia,
suggestive of hand-tinted photographs. Wagner's big, bravura
designs, which shift seamlessly between the Elizabethan settings
for ``The Taming of the Shrew'' and the glamorously gritty
behind-the-scenes world of a Baltimore theater, never overpower the
people who inhabit them.
</P>
<P>
   The stage has been carefully conceived as a showcase for showing
off. That high-rising triple-leveled view of backstage stairs and
walkways (which brings to mind the David Merrick production of
``42nd Street'') is put to very specific choreographic use by a
frighteningly agile performer named Michael Berresse, who scales it
like a human fly in the show's most inventive dance routine.
</P>
<P>
   Such acrobatics are of a piece with the overall tone of ``Kiss
Me, Kate,'' which never shrinks from the overstated gesture.
Mugging, clowning, overemoting and operatic vocal embellishments
have all been encouraged, yet only rarely do these things slip into
sloppiness.
</P>
<P>
   The expansive performance style, of a silly looseness contained
by theatrical discipline, perfectly matches the prankster aspect of
Porter's songs, with their impish satire of familiar forms (as in
the Viennese waltz ``Wunderbar'') and outrageous innuendoes and
rhymes. (Who else would team ``Sanka'' with ``Bianca''?)
</P>
<P>
   The voluptuous Ms. Mazzie, who verged on statue stiffness in her
roles in ``Passion'' and ``Ragtime,'' unbends in delicious ways
here. As Lilli Vanessi, the stage diva turned movie diva now making
a stage comeback (Hollywood got fed up with her hysterics), she is
as much a theatrical caricature as a Hirschfeld sketch, drawn in
big, looping lines that capture the essence of a real personality.
</P>
<P>
   She flirts perilously with grotesqueness, making faces that turn
her marmoreal beauty into splenetic ugliness. Her outlandishly
entertaining take on that great exercise in animosity, ``I Hate
Men,'' which here includes a vivid simulation of giving birth, goes
over the top, for sure. But it doesn't go out of control. And when
Ms. Mazzie needs to switch to a lyric sincerity, for ``So in Love''
and ``I Am Ashamed That Women Are So Simple,'' her soprano shimmers
like polished silver.

 NEW YORK: polished silver.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the rakish actor-manager Fred Graham, Mitchell, the original
Coalhouse Walker of ``Ragtime'' and the womanizing record mogul in
the Encores concert version of ``Do Re Mi,'' confirms his status as
a rarity in American theater these days: a bona fide musical
matinee idol with a sly sense of humor. It took him about 20
minutes to grow into his full presence the night I saw him; but
once he did, he was unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   His command of the trickier elements of Porter diction, as in
the multilingually rhymed ``Where Is the Life That Late I Led?,''
is impeccable. And when he stands center stage in midsong, flexing
his majestic baritone while his arms reach for the heavens, he
seems to enfold the whole audience into an embrace as generous as
it is self-admiring.
</P>
<P>
   It seems fitting that a backstage musical should have its fresh
young star in the making, and this production's comes in the
intensely centered person of Amy Spanger, who plays Lois Lane, the
saucy cabaret performer making her theatrical debut as Bianca in
``Shrew.'' She gets three of the evening's best songs (``Why Can't
You Behave?,'' ``Tom, Dick or Harry'' and ``Always True to You''),
and she lands each of them with a sharp-edged sensuality that turns
her gold-digging archetype into something newly minted.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall, who emerged as a choreographer to watch with her
work for the Encores series at City Center, brings a crisp and
flavorful wit to the novelty numbers ``We Open in Venice'' and
``Tom, Dick or Harry.'' Her Agnes de Mille-style ensemble sequence,
``Too Darn Hot,'' led by the engaging Stanley Wayne Matthis, though
a show stopper, seemed to me a tad protracted. And I wish that she
and Blakemore could have brought more vigor and focus to the
evening's first number, ``Another Op'nin' Another Show,'' which is
better in concept than execution and scarcely prepares us for the
treasures that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless this ``Kate'' is definitely more than the sum of its
parts. The individual numbers and performances don't all have the
high sheen that, say, those in the revival of ``Chicago'' had when
it first opened. But it possesses a wonderfully heady momentum that
doesn't let up, and it is to the show's credit that you remember it
less for individual, heightened moments than as one exhilarating
whoosh.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is one particular sequence that is now forever
pasted in my memory. That's when Wilkof and Mulheren, as a couple
of hoods who have been hanging around backstage to collect on a
gambling debt, deliver their farewell song before a drop curtain.
</P>
<P>
   That song is ``Brush Up Your Shakespeare,'' a bawdy guide to
using scholarly references for picking up women, and these
gentlemen sell it with priceless deadpan panache. As they
metamorphose from mere thugs into gleeful (if still grim-faced)
vaudevillians, it becomes clear just how potent a virus the theater
bug is. By that time, of course, the audience has already been
thoroughly infected.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What bothers Henry Berber most about the new
``living wage'' ordinance in Los Angeles is the picketing at his
restaurant, La Luz del Dia, during a busy lunch hour. ``The way
they are dressed,'' he said, ``they give the impression they are my
regular customers, very dissatisfied. It hurts me personally.''
</P>
<P>
   The pickets are in fact community advocates who pushed for
passage of the local law, which increases minimum wages for
companies doing business with the city. Because Berber leases his
site in a subsidized tourist zone, the ordinance requires him to
pay $8.76 an hour, not the $5.75 that is standard restaurant pay
for kitchen help in California. The reasoning is that all his
workers should benefit from the public largess that makes the
quaint Olvera Street where his Mexican restaurant is situated so
profitable. Berber has raised his bottom wage, but only to $6.75 an
hour, without health insurance _ and the pickets are trying to get
him to go the extra distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am moving in the direction of conforming,'' he said, leaning
for emphasis across a huge, cluttered desk that almost filled his
small, low-ceilinged office. But to pay the full living wage now,
he said, would put his restaurant in the red.
</P>
<P>
   Here and elsewhere, a small but increasing number of employers
who do business with government are suddenly finding themselves
required by local ordinances to grant big raises and benefits to
their low-wage workers. Forty cities and counties in 17 states,
particularly those with large numbers of low-wage workers, have
enacted living-wage laws since the movement began five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As one follows another, lately at the rate of a new ordinance a
month, the living-wage movement has begun to broaden from a simple
emphasis on higher wages into a wide range of requirements
involving health insurance, vacations, sick pay, job security and
incentives to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the living-wage movement in the context of
the utter failure of federal labor law, now so stacked against
workers,'' said Madeline Janis-Aparicio, director of the Los
Angeles Living Wage Coalition. She cited the failure of Washington
to raise the national minimum wage to keep pace with the needs of
the working poor or to strengthen labor's bargaining power. The
coalition, an amalgam of community groups, churches and unions that
organized the picketing at Berber's restaurant, is out to redress
the imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   As the ordinances spread, business opposition and complaints
about higher costs and patchwork regulation are on the rise. But
the vast majority of affected companies, though often ducking full
compliance, have generally lived with the law rather than give up
profitable contracts, subsidies and leases on choice city-owned
properties like Olvera Street, three studies have found. The early
evidence suggests that relatively little of the extra cost has been
passed on to the cities or to consumers. Companies are absorbing
the higher wages or finding ways to offset them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost increases for companies in Los Angeles were only 1 to
1.5 percent of their total expenses,'' said Robert Pollin, an
economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who led one
of the studies.
</P>
<P>
   The living-wage movement is an increasingly popular tool for
improving the lot of janitors, cleaning people, restaurant and
health care workers, security guards, school bus drivers, parking
attendants and others who earn less than $8 an hour. That group
represents 25.7 percent of the work force, or 28.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only a fraction of these workers _ no more than 44,000,
according to an analysis by Pollin, Mark Brenner and Stephanie Luce
_ are covered so far by living-wage ordinances, the largest group
being the 9,000 or so in Los Angeles. But more than 50 other cities
and counties are considering living-wage bills. One alone, San
Francisco, would nearly double the number of workers covered
nationwide if a proposal now before the Board of Supervisors
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Living-wage ordinances cover the companies that tap the public
till through a tax abatement, for example, or a service contract to
clean schools or leases at a city airport, and the companies can be
cut off if they fail to raise wages. Here in Los Angeles, United
Airlines and Delta Air Lines have accepted the ordinance as lessees
at the international airport, imposing the new wage _ $8.76 without
health insurance, or $7.51 in pay and $1.25 for health insurance
_on the contractors and subcontractors who supply baggage handlers,
security screeners, wheelchair attendants and the like. The
airlines' own employees generally earn more in wages and benefits
than the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``United resisted the ordinance for a while and could have tied
us up in court for a long time,'' said Isaac Nuru, lead organizer
at the airport for the Living Wage Coalition. ``But it did the
moral thing. It did not want a bad press.''
</P>
<P>
   Living-wage ordinances have their limits. They are hard to
enforce even when city officials audit corporate payrolls, as they
do in Los Angeles and only one or two other cities. Further, though
companies like United and Delta comply with the ordinance at the
city-owned airport here, workers employed by contractors at the
airlines' other sites in the city are not covered. And companies do
not have to comply with the ordinances in most cities until
existing contracts and leases are renewed or revised, though some
companies do so anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Host Marriott Services did. It runs bars and restaurants at the
airport here and has applied for a revision of its lease to expand.
Even before submitting the application, the company increased the
pay of 700 airport workers to the levels specified in the
living-wage ordinance, which took effect last January at the
airport. And in a bit of horse trading, Ms. Janis-Aparicio's
coalition has endorsed Host Marriott's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``You monitor every lease that comes up for renewal or
revision,'' she said, ``and you go to the company and say, `We want
to work with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, much of American business, once indifferent to a movement
that seemed to apply to so few workers, is now fighting the effort
more vigorously _ denouncing living-wage laws as an excessive cost
for business and a distortion of wages that should be set in the
marketplace, not by government.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you raise the wage so much, a lot of the people you are
trying to help will lose their jobs,'' said Thomas Larmore, a
lawyer in Santa Monica, Calif. He heads a Chamber of Commerce
committee formed recently to prevent passage of a living-wage
proposal in Santa Monica that would be the first in the country to
go beyond companies that benefit directly from city business. The
ordinance would apply to an entire commercial district, a two-mile
stretch of Pacific coast developed with public funds as a tourist
mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Within this zone, which extends three blocks inland from a
promenade overlooking the ocean, no company with more than 50
employees would be allowed to pay its workers less than $10.69 an
hour. Other provisions, borrowed from the Los Angeles ordinance,
include paid vacations, a health insurance requirement and a
provision to protect workers against retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The zone flourishes, the argument goes, because the city spent
hundreds of millions of dollars to develop it as a tourist and
entertainment center, and limited the number of hotel rooms to help
keep room rates high, often above $300 a night. Low-wage employees,
advocates say, should share more of this public bounty, or at least
earn a high enough wage to live above poverty. Most commute from
poor Los Angeles neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Larmore says such reasoning is spurious. ``It is totally
backward to say that business is subsidized by the city,'' he said.
``It is business that is lifting the city,'' he added, by providing
a huge flow of tax revenue that allows the city to provide many
services.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A majority on Santa Monica's seven-member City Council, which
recently approved a ban on ATM fees for nonbank customers that has
been temporarily set aside by a local court, favors the ordinance.
But rather than act now, the council is likely to wait while the
living-wage issue is fought out in next year's election campaign.
The Chamber of Commerce is raising money to support candidates who
will oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   The living-wage has become a goal of national groups like the
Independent Areas Foundation and the Association of Community
Organizations for Reform Now, which seek to bring community groups
together in social action campaigns. And with increasing frequency,
the ordinances are becoming big issues in local politics.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco's Dec. 13 runoff election for mayor, the issue
divides Willie Brown, the incumbent, who has been lukewarm about a
living-wage law, and his challenger, Tom Ammiano, president of the
Board of Supervisors and chief sponsor of the proposal. It
specifies a wage of $11 an hour, surpassing the current national
leader, San Jose, whose ordinance requires $9.50 with health
insurance and $10.75 without. By comparison, the national minimum
wage is $5.15 an hour; adjusted for inflation, that is nearly $3
less than it was in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bill is watered down too much, say to $9 an hour,''
Ammiano said, ``and nonprofit organizations are exempted and there
is not enough funding for enforcement, then I would advocate taking
the proposal to a referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's first living-wage ordinance was enacted in
Baltimore, in December 1994, largely through the efforts of a
community organization called Build. Last November, Build got
thousands of residents in poor neighborhoods to the polls. Most
voted for the re-election of Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, who
is increasingly using the city's living-wage ordinance as a model
for service contracts that the state makes with private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Los Angeles, Mayor Richard Riordan tried to block the
measure, but his veto was overridden by the City Council. ``I
believe employers should be aware that employees who earn under $10
an hour cannot lead an independent life,'' he said. ``But I do not
believe that government should dictate wages. We have seen this
fail in socialist and communist countries. It will do irreparable
harm.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Riordan said, however, that he agreed with living-wage
supporters that income inequality had increased in part because of
the decline in union bargaining power. Several ordinances try to
reverse that trend through an ``opt out'' loophole that lets
companies partly off the hook if they agree to let their workers
organize.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Berber's 28 employees, for example, have signed a
petition seeking union recognition. If he granted recognition
voluntarily, the opt-out clause would allow him to negotiate a
labor agreement that permits pay and benefit levels below the
city's mandated living-wage, at least temporarily. But he would be
locked into a union _ a central goal of Ms. Janis-Aparicio's
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you rely on legislation solely, the gains can be
lost,'' she said, noting that the Los Angeles City Council's
current pro-labor bent could disappear in a future election. ``So
we need to build union agreements that have community support and
will last.''
</P>
<P>
   After running a refugee center here, Ms. Janis-Aparicio, 39, was
recruited into her present line of work in 1993 by Miguel
Contreras, now the powerful executive secretary-treasurer of the
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras, who had worked with Cesar Chavez's United Farm
Workers, was mindful of the public support _ the consumer grape
boycott _ that had brought such success to the farm workers. So he
asked Ms. Janis-Aparicio to set up a nonprofit organization that
could foster similar community support for labor. She founded the
Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, which operates today with a
$1 million annual budget and 18 salaried staff members. The
living-wage soon became the central cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``This question of job inequities in the public sector, if we
address it as a union, people say we are self-serving,'' Contreras
said. ``But if it has the cloak of religious leaders and community
activists, then it becomes a community issue.''

   NEW YORK _ Even in a great movie like ``The Best Years of Our
Lives'' (1946), World War II didn't look like such a traumatizing
experience. True, Dana Andrews' character couldn't get his old job
at the drugstore back, and he learned that his superficial wife
loved him only when he was looking handsome in uniform. But Fredric
March just went back to his cushy job at the bank and into the
bosom of his beautiful family. And even Harold Russell, who had
lost his hands in the war, was all right once he realized that his
understanding girl-next-door fiancee loved him enough to deal with
that.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't hear these guys talk about being permanently damaged
psychologically because of the horrors they couldn't put behind
them. As Tom Brokaw said outright in his recent book ``The Greatest
Generation,'' ``They were proud of what they accomplished, but they
rarely discussed their experiences, even with each other.'' Vietnam
veterans, on the other hand, talked, and Francis Ford Coppola made
``Apocalypse Now,'' and some people got the idea that dealing with
the horror of war was something new.
</P>
<P>
   The two World War II veterans in Frank D. Gilroy's affecting new
one-act play, ``Contact With the Enemy,'' belong to the old school.
When these old Army buddies meet by chance at the entrance of the
Holocaust Museum in Washington, they're the picture of
well-adjusted all-Americans. Hank Naylor (Nesbitt Blaisdell) seems
the more repressed of the two. Bill Duffy (Christopher Murney) is
open enough to say, even before the museum doors open, that this
visit is ``like going back to a bad dream.'' But soon enough Hank,
asked to describe the day their outfit saw a concentration camp, is
remembering ``the bodies stacked five high like cordwood.''
</P>
<P>
   We have met Duffy before, in ``Getting In,'' Gilroy's 1997
one-act play about a young Army veteran who is determined to go to
Dartmouth. Like Gilroy, still best known for his Pulitzer
Prize-winning 1964 play, ``The Subject Was Roses,'' Bill was born
in 1926, grew up in the Bronx, went to Dartmouth on the GI Bill,
became a writer and at one point saw Ohrdruf, a concentration camp
in what became East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of the play is that the men's firsthand view of the
Holocaust is not what has been haunting them all these years. An
even more terrible memory drives one of them to drink that day,
after years of sobriety, and to propose an unlikely toast to Boris
Becker. It was something that happened right after Ohrdruf _ or was
it right before? That is the crucial question, both men admit, as
they try to deal with what it says about them personally and about
the shakiness of human morality overall.
</P>
<P>
   Murney seems a bit young for his role, and when the script calls
for catharsis, the two men don't always rise to the occasion, but
Gilroy's play makes its point quietly and thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact With the Enemy,'' directed by Chris Smith, continues
at Ensemble Studio Theater through Dec. 4.

`THE BALCONY': UNTANGLING GENET'S PUZZLE OF POWER, LOST AND FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Irma, the madam who has been queen for a day,
dismisses all her prostitutes and customers at the end of the Jean
Cocteau Repertory's production of ``The Balcony'' and stands alone
in her house as the lights go down, a wave of sadness sweeps the
theater. That is exactly the right feeling: the world has been
emptied, for her and for us.
</P>
<P>
   Given the usually comic scenes preceding, that realization is a
jolt. But this Jean Genet play _ about men who pretend in a brothel
to be powerful figures in society and who, after an upheaval, are
thrust into the positions they dreamed of _ is peculiarly
malleable. It is as though Genet, in his many revisions of the
play, stripped it of all authorial intention to force the director
to give it meaning. It can be a political tract, a social satire, a
farce, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   In this production, the director, Eve Adamson, has made it a
psychological puzzle, handing on to the audience much of the task
of supplying meaning, and that twist at the end makes one rethink
the entire piece. As a result some viewers may think Ms. Adamson
might have imagined a few earlier scenes very differently, but none
can deny that the whole performance, every breath and motion, is
hers.
</P>
<P>
   This repertory company is an excellent vehicle for such an
exercise. The actors can pile role on role, like Russian dolls, and
keep us keenly aware of the separate personalities and different
emotional tugs of war and mental games entangling each of them.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Jason Crowl, as a royal emissary, turns up after the
revolution, here called the intermission, to persuade Irma to be
queen and her loutish clients to become bishops, judges and
generals even while he seems to be arguing that there was no
revolution and never had been a social hierarchy at all. And you
wish he'd been given enough lines to spin this out for another
hour, since he seems to believe several versions of his story.
</P>
<P>
   Irma (Elise Stone) has the proverbial heart of gold and really
loves her favorite visitor, the chief of police (Craig Smith). But
he doubts his authenticity, since none of her clients, who get
sexual thrills from fantasies of power, want to be him. Then, when
Irma becomes queen, a failed revolutionary appears at the royal
brothel, or palace of prostitution if you will, claiming to be the
chief, and the chief fairly flies away, exulting: ``I've done it! I
belong to the ages!''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Irma, with a wave of the hand, banishes everyone
else to the shadows and cries as her world dissolves in darkness:
``But what about me? I'm still alive.'' She speaks, alas, for us.

<P>
   Taste aside, Coleman goes high-tech
</P>
<P>
   We all have heroes, people we respect and look up to. Sometimes
those heroes stumble, even fall. And sometimes we get a chance to
do what we can to help them.
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly the case with the Gary Coleman Web-a-thon on
UGO Networks (at www.ugo.com), but hey, it sounded dramatic.
Actually, the Web-a-thon idea started as a bit of a goof back in
August when word got out that Coleman had filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy, after he, his managers and family blew through about
$18 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was contacted and they said `We want to give you money,'''
Coleman said. ``When they first called me, I said I don't know
about this. This doesn't sound like something a lot of people would
want to do. But they love me as a person and as a talent.''
</P>
<P>
   He confesses to never being a technology person. But then
Coleman, the diminutive former child star of the inexplicably
long-running TV show ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' decided he liked this
new Internet thingy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very fun,'' Coleman said. ``I like it. The potential for
income I could realize through UGO Networks is absolutely delicious
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   UGO Networks started out as a gaming site and has branched out
into other entertainment and pop culture areas targeting 18- to
34-year-olds, said Joe Robinson, the company's chairman. The
company jumped on the Coleman event because its employees and
customers grew up watching his show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Coleman is a beloved cultural icon to many people in the
UGO generation,'' Robinson said. ``We wanted to help him any way we
could.''
</P>
<P>
   The site features such weirdness as Pez dispensers, votive
candles, ``Save Me'' T-shirts and Zippo lighters with Coleman's
face; games such as Gario Brothers and Coleman; a 3-D dancing Gary;
and an MP-3 file of a rap song by Coleman, among other surreality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you've made it into the everday vernacular of
American culture when you become a Pez dispenser,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some funny streaming video gags, such as ``Diff'rent
Jobs,'' and ``Gary Coleman TV Auditions,'' where he ``tries out for
television parts to fill the `black actor' quota on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the funniest, goofiest feature is the Web-a-thon itself,
which will continue through Nov. 28. You can bid on signed Coleman
belongings, including a spatula, bowling shoes and ball, leather
couch and 27-inch television. The site is also auctioning off ``a
yellow, pin-striped pimp suit'' Coleman wore recently, and signed
T-shirts and other memorabilia contributed by other entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   You can contact Coleman by e-mail at garycolemanugo.com. Coleman
said he's received plenty already, some quite supportive, others
rather vigorously less so.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens with the Web-a-thon, Coleman's career is
already picking up a bit. He's appeared on the Howard Stern Show
and is shooting a TV commercial for a Florida phone company. He
also is working as a radio DJ intern on the morning drive-time show
of KRQ in Tucson, Ariz. (you can ``tune'' in at www.krq.com).
</P>
<P>
   And if his bankruptcy goes through in early January, Coleman
said he'll have a fresh start on his financial life and his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be in the Internet in such a large way,''
Coleman said. ``But I'm hoping if the outcome is huge, that
there'll be further collaboration with (UGO). And if it's an
Internet thing that pays, that's what I'm going to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Set your heart racing
</P>
<P>
   Between a flurry of conferences, Web launches and other events
lately, I've been running around faster than Jeff Gordon on
amphetamines. In honor of this pre-holiday freneticism, here's a
quick rundown of some of the PlayStation racing titles _ many of
them taking a nicely different take on the genre _ that I've tried
out the past couple of months:
</P>
<P>
   Hot Wheels Turbo Racing (Electronic Arts) I just love this game,
which is also on the N64, and so did my Hot Wheels fanatic of a
young son. What makes this great for even young players is that
your car (choose from a couple of dozen of those fabulous Hot
Wheels designs from over the decades) can't ever jump the track,
letting you focus on performing fun tricks every time you hit a
jump. The game also has ``crash 'em'' and trick modes, all set to a
great soundtrack of rock and metal groups.
</P>
<P>
   Jet Moto 3 (989 Studios): This solid franchise again perches you
on a motorcycle-like hovercraft that zips along a couple of feet
off the ground on tracks twistier and more treacherous than
anything Anakin Skywalker ever essayed. Think of it as Pod Racing
Lite, with only one rocket engine. Excellent graphics, and the
physics of the bikes are cool.
</P>
<P>
   Sled Storm (Electronic Arts): Another oddball racing game that's
actually good fun, even if it is totally foreign to the Southern
California lifestyle. Pilot a big, balky snowmobile against
jostling competition over courses littered with jumps and
obstacles, but minus the frostbite. That's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (Activision): North San Diego County's
finest lends his name (and those of nine other stars) to this
excellent skateboarding game. I love that you can skate off just
about anything, including police cars, who come to bust you in some
of the skating areas.
</P>
<P>
   Chocobo Racing (Square Soft): A cute title featuring characters
from Square's durable Final Fantasy role-playing franchise. Don't
ask why they suddenly all became racers, but the game itself has a
few quirks that make it somewhat distinctive, and likely to appeal
to younger players and FF freaks.
</P>
<P>
   Crash Team Racing (Sony): The big bandicoot returns in a racing
game that's not that far from some of the best levels in his three
best-selling adventures. I like it well enough, but it didn't much
hold the attention of my young children, despite the fact that they
are huge fans of Crash otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Monaco Grand Prix (Ubi Soft): European-style Grand Prix racing
on 16 courses with nicely done physics, and support for linking two
PlayStations together so up to four people can race each other
(this game is also on the Dreamcast and Nintendo 64). I'm not a
huge fan of Grand Prix, but if you are, this title isn't bad to
tide you over between dispatches from the Continent. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Metal on Net
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' much awaited, frequently delayed new online
megasite, Entertaindom (www.entertaindom.com), will give folks a
little taste of what's ahead this weekend when it makes the new
double album from Metallica available in streaming audio format.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Stream-Fest'' of Metallica's ``S&AMP;M'' (technically, it
stands for ``Symphony and Metallica'') actually began Friday and
runs for a week, allowing fans to listen to, if not keep, the new
album. The audio stream also will be available at Elektra Records'
www.metallica.com site and syndicated to 160 sites for local radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Entertaindom is scheduled to debut Nov. 29. The folks at Warner
Bros. Online in Burbank have been putting together what is supposed
to be a huge site of technology-pushing material, including tons of
original content, much of it meant for people with high-speed
broadband connections, and pulled from the huge array of
Time-Warner-Turner entertainment properties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strange days in the Rising Sun
</P>
<P>
   Proof that Japanese gamers are not, to paraphrase F. Scott
Fitzgerald, like you and me: Among the titles spotted at the recent
Tokyo Game Show by reporters for gaming magazine Next Gen was one
from Sega for its Dreamcast console called Typing the Dead.
</P>
<P>
   It's a typing tutor based on the zombie-killing hit House of the
Dead 2, and requires you to type the right letters to fend off
approaching monsters. As Next Gen put it, this one wins the title
of oddest game ever, beating out even the tennis game whose
opponents include Satan. &QL;

RUSSIAN AND WESTERN LEADERS EXCHANGE CRITICISM OVER CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ President Boris Yeltsin and the West squared
off over Chechnya on Thursday, as the Russian leader told a
European summit meeting that the West had no right to criticize
Russia for its campaign against ``bandits and murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton insisted that the West was only trying to
do for Chechnya's civilians what it would have done for Yeltsin
himself when he was on the barricades: defend their rights against
the abusive authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom since the end of the Cold War has Russia appeared so
isolated on the world stage as one by one, Western leaders at the
meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
declared that Russia's indiscriminate bombardment of Chechnya was
needlessly killing and wounding its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, looking unusually hale and combative, mocked the idea
that the plight of civilians justified Western meddling in Russian
affairs. He branded the calls for peace talks as hopelessly naive.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the sharp human rights debates of Soviet times, the
criticism of Moscow on Thursday was more in sorrow than in anger,
as Western officials lectured Russia that its treatment of
civilians in Chechnya fell below civilized norms.
</P>
<P>
   In surprisingly personal remarks, Clinton sought to justify the
West's intercession over Chechnya by recalling how Yeltsin
clambered onto a tank to prevent an assault on his government
headquarters by hard-line Communists during the final days of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Yeltsin, one of the most thrilling experiences of my
life as a citizen of the world before I become president was when
you stood up on that tank in Moscow when they tried to take the
freedom of the Russian people away,'' Clinton said. ``If they had
put you in jail instead of electing you president, I would have
hoped that every leader of every country around this table would
have stood up for you, and not said, well, that is an internal
Russian affair that we cannot be part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin listened attentively to Clinton and later gave him a
bear hug. Still, there was no sign that the Russian leader had been
persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and other leaders argued that moral considerations
sometimes justified intervention in another nation's affairs _
military action in the case of Kosovo and public criticism in case
of Chechnya _ Yeltsin ridiculed the notion as ``humanitarian
interference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to criticize Russia for Chechnya,'' Yeltsin
said at the 54-nation meeting. ``There will be no negotiations with
bandits and murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the public fireworks, the Russians also pressed privately
to deflect the West's criticism of their Chechnya policy.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov gave American officials a
diplomatic paper that hinted Russia would drop some of its
objections to American policy toward Iraq if Washington offered a
private assurance that the issue of Chechnya would not be brought
before the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   A small measure of agreement was reached when Russia agreed to
allow a representative of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to visit Chechnya. That was less then the
role in mediating the dispute that some Western governments had
sought for the organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said, ``I think we got
a good foot in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   With parliamentary elections only a month away in Russia,
domestic politics appeared to be a significant factor in the firey
tone of Yeltsin's speech. The president and other Russian
politicians have discovered that a hard-nosed policy toward
Chechnya and open defiance of the West has become very popular with
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Grigori Yavlinksy, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party, is
one of the few major Russian politicians who have even broached the
idea of negotiating with the Chechens, and for that he has branded
a virtual traitor by some capitalist reformers, including Anatoly
Chubais.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even though the fighting has created more than 200,000 refugees,
many of them ethnic Russians, many Russians seem to think this is
an acceptable price to hunt down the Islamic militants who invaded
Dagestan last summer and who are generally blamed for a spate of
terror bombings in Moscow and other cities. The Chechen guerrilla
leaders accused of the attacks deny the charge.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The antipathy many Russians harbor toward people from the
Caucasus has further tempered their sympathy for the Chechen
refugees. Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister for emergency
situations, has also sought to defuse the talk of a humanitarian
crisis in Chechnya by asserting that the main fighting would be
over by Feb. 1, and the approximately 200,000 refugees could then
return. Then there is the determination of the Russian military to
avenge its defeat in the 1994-1996 Chechen war, and not only to
subdue Chechnya, but to send a message to the region that Russia is
still a power to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Russian annoyance with the West has been further fanned by a
host of other disputes, including the Clinton administration's
interest in pressing ahead with an anti-missile defense and its
position on oil pipelines in former Soviet areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, for example, Clinton watched approvingly as Turkey,
Azerbaijan and Georgia signed an agreement to build a pipeline that
would channel oil from the Caspian Sea to international markets
without passing through Russian or Iranian territory, dealing
another blow to Russian influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Chechnya delayed the signing of a new Charter
on European Security, which was to have been concluded on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In criticizing the Russian policy, Western officials sought to
make clear that they agreed that they were not challenging the
Kremlin's right to use military force to put an end to terrorism
and to prevent the nation from fracturing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, they said, lay in the way Russia was pursuing that
goal _ indiscriminate rocket attacks and bombings that have taken a
heavy civilian toll and have fostered a new generation of
embittered and revenge-minded Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all determined to fight terrorism,'' said Kofi Annan,
the U.N. secretary general. ``But the force we use to fight it
should always be proportional, and focused on the actual
terrorists. We cannot and must not fight them by using their own
methods _ by inflicting indiscriminate violence and terror on
innocent civilians, including children.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder, the German chancellor, added, ``War is no way
to eliminate terrorism.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As much as such comments irritated the Russians, they fell short
of what some Western critics, such as Zbigniew Brezinski, the
national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter, have urged:
the cut-off or Western credits and assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other Western leaders were slow to criticize Russia
during the first Chechen war. Clinton, in fact, even likened
Yeltsin then to President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil
War, while Vice President Al Gore initially insisted that Chechnya
was an internal Russian affair, echoing Moscow's current position.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Thursday's comments by Western officials appeared
designed to persuade their own publics that they are not ignoring
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments were viewed by many observers here as some of
the persuasive. White House officials said that the president
rewrote the remarks as the summit began to include the reference to
Yeltsin standing on the tank. ``The point I was trying to make,''
Clinton told reporters later, ``is there are times in the world we
live in today when we are forced to make judgments about things
that happen within the borders of other countries.''

 &HT;    Bush campaign heads west to California
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ After months of gubernatorial home
schooling, George W. Bush heads to California today for his first
major speech on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   He said he intends to draw a ``stark contrast'' between his
views and those of his GOP presidential rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``America must not retreat within our borders,'' he said in Iowa
Thursday. ``One way to make sure the world is peaceful, as far as
I'm concerned, is to not retreat within our borders.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is elected, Bush said, his administration would
concentrate on four areas: America's ``neighborhood'' of North and
South America, the Middle East, China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   He also brushed aside criticism that as a governor, he is
inexperienced in foreign policy. He noted that three of the
country's last four presidents have been governors and that as
Texas' chief executive, he has had extensive dealings with Mexico.
He also has received intensive tutoring on foreign policy issues
from a team of advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to lead the country,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the policies themselves, the speech offers Bush a
chance to show he has the stuff that presidents are made of. Some
critics, as well as some late-night comedians, have questioned that
as a result of Bush missteps, including his inability pass a
reporter's pop quiz about leaders in world trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some Bush advisers are worried about the image of the
candidate as less-than-smart guy. Throughout this week, they talked
about using today's speech to help counter that by taking questions
afterward, something he did not do at previous policy speeches on
defense, education and faith-based initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has got to give a good speech,'' said Josh Bolten, who has
coordinated the Bush policy team. ``And then he has got to be able
to defend the ideas because he will be questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, as he prepped for his big speech, Bush talked about
the hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people, those are the people who are going to
have the ultimate decision in this campaign. They want somebody
who, who they trust to lead the world to peace,'' he said. ``And
I'm going to make the case that it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not, said Democratic National Committee Chair Joe
Andrew, who branded Bush as a ``cue-card candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is a dangerous world and we need a commander in chief who
can grasp the basic concepts necessary to make our foreign policy
and defense decisions,'' Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of media interviews this week, Bush has been trying
to make his case. And in his autobiography released this week,
Bush, like many Americans, said his view of foreign policy is
colored by what he called the ``the lesson of Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation should be slow to engage troops. But when we do so,
we must do so with ferocity. We must not go into a conflict unless
we go in committed to win,'' he wrote. ``We can never again ask the
military to fight a political war. If America's strategic interests
are at stake, if diplomacy fails, if no other option will
accomplish the objective, the commander in chief must define the
mission and allow the military to achieve it.''
</P>
<P>
   As with all of Bush's major policy speeches, the site for this
one _ the Reagan Presidential Library _ was selected for its
significance: the library is a monument to a chief executive who
had a profound effect on world alignment. But Reagan also struggled
through the Iran-Contra controversy that exposed the secret
underbelly of foreign relations.

A&AMP;M TRAGEDY PUTS TEXAS CABLE NEWS ON THE MAP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   After playing the role of eager bystander in the reporting of
the Wedgwood Baptist Church shooting, Texas Cable News (TXCN) found
itself a front-runner on a major breaking story Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   From the time the call came in from the ``Bryan-College Station
Eagle'' newspaper around 4:30 a.m., TXCN was up and running with
reports of a freak bonfire log accident at Texas A&AMP;M. As the death
toll grew, so did the aggressiveness of TXCN, a news operation
looking for an opportunity to show why it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   On the air since January, TXCN has quietly built an unwanted
reputation as an ongoing experiment more than as a statewide CNN
wannabe. But Thursday, the station managed to prove to its critics,
at least for the time being, that a 24-hour news channel devoted to
Texas events might not be such a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Although local stations, CNN and MSNBC offered updates and went
live during news conferences, TXCN found itself the news station of
record at intervals, scrolling useful information at the bottom of
the screen, such as where to donate blood and how to contact Texas
A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the cable channel relied heavily on reporting and
footage from sister-station KHOU in Houston (both news operations
are owned by Dallas-based Belo, as is the ``Bryan-College Station
Eagle'' and WFAA/Channel 8), TXCN turned in a rather effective
performance as news-report traffic cop.
</P>
<P>
   But with reporter Brian Giesenschlag, on the scene in College
Station and various anchors in the newsroom, TXCN also established
an identity of its own. And with another big news event the same
day _ the guilty verdict and life sentence handed down in the third
Jasper dragging-death trial _ the little channel that could didn't
do such a bad job. It even managed to provide viewers with Ivan
``Pudge'' Rodriguez's news conference announcing his American
League MVP honor.
</P>
<P>
   Was this the defining moment signaling the arrival of a new news
player in town? ``An opportunity'' is how TXCN general manager Skip
Cass described it. ``We're designed to provide viewers with news
and information during the day. When people come in and show up at
3, they can turn us on, get caught up. Or 4. We're there. This is
why we're here. This is what we do.''

U.T. STUDENTS SHARE RIVALS' GRIEF
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _Setting aside their traditional rivalry, shocked
students and officials at the University of Texas offered prayers
and condolences Thursday after a stack of bonfire logs collapsed at
Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of the students, faculty, staff and administration
of the University of Texas at Austin, I extend our deepest sympathy
to the Texas A&AMP;M community as it copes with today's tragic events.
We offer our full support to Texas A&AMP;M as the university confronts
this unfortunate accident,'' UT President Larry Faulkner said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove to the office with a tear in my eye this morning,''
football coach Mack Brown said. ``It makes you want to cry. I can
promise you, nobody here is thinking about football. Our thoughts
and prayers are with those kids and their families, and all of the
people at Texas A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's tragedy occurred as logs from a 40-foot stack came
tumbling while on 60 to 70 students were atop the pile. A bonfire
was to be ignited to ``fire up'' A&AMP;M students for the annual
football game against archrival Texas.
</P>
<P>
   U.T. Student Government President Parisa Fatehi said she and 20
other student government members planned to attend a memorial
service Thursday night in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider them (A&AMP;M students) our friends, our peers, and
just fellow students of Texas,'' Fatehi said. ``We want to share in
this as much as possible, to help them get through this, because it
definitely is a very difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many U.T. students called friends at A&AMP;M to determine whether
any were involved in the accident. Others said they prayed for
friends at the rival university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a few students in the corps (of cadets) and I know the
prayers of the student body here will go out to them. I hope to get
into contact with them as soon as possible. I know they have been
working on the (log stack), and they have been highly involved,''
said Brad Nadal, a corporate communications senior. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a tragedy that will put a damper on one of A&AMP;M's
fondest traditions _ the bonfire _ (and) I don't think it will ever
be the same,'' said Jessica Patterson, a U.T. junior.
</P>
<P>
   In memory of the victims, the flags in front of the Main
Building were flown at half-staff yesterday and the U.T. Tower will
be darkened Monday.

SPORTS COLUMN: BREAKING THE BONDS OF INNOCENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was simply a deal about basketball and business, Don Nelson
said. The Dallas Mavericks made a trade with the San Antonio Spurs
on draft day last June. The Mavericks received the Spurs'
first-round pick, the 29th and last of the first round, 19-year-old
Leon Smith out of Martin Luther King High School in Chicago. There
had been a conditional arrangement to have the 6-foot-11-inch Smith
play one season in a developmental league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed like a logical thing for everyone,'' Nelson
said wearily the other day from his hotel room in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   He had just been interrupted from an afternoon nap, recovering
from a wee-hours arrival and the latest news media attack he was
enduring. No stranger to condemnation for his hard-line dealings
with New Age stars, the onetime reputed ``players' coach'' now had
to explain why Smith was in a Dallas psychiatric hospital after the
police said he had ingested approximately 250 aspirin tablets in
what may have been a suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   How could this have happened, and could Nelson and the Mavericks
have prevented it? Those were the questions demanding more than
knee-jerk responses.
</P>
<P>
   One conclusion being jumped to was how this was a classic
example _ the more common antithesis of the happily-ever-after
Kevin Garnett story _ of what occurs when a high school player
demonstrates his vertical skills by leaping right to the National
Basketball Association. Another conclusion was that the Mavericks,
once they had involved themselves with a fragile young man who was
raised in various group homes as a ward of the state, were
responsible for his emotional well-being.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is merit in each of those arguments, they are
not necessarily solutions. Convincing a Leon Smith that he
shouldn't turn pro is infinitely harder than telling him not to.
Once he has, who can say that Nelson's proposal wasn't the best way
for Smith to pursue long-term success, while forgoing immediate
gratification at the end of the Dallas bench?
</P>
<P>
   David Stern, the NBA commissioner, has correctly argued that the
quickening pace of teenagers' entry into his league is a business
problem, not a moral issue. Tennis players, Stern argues, have been
quitting college and even high school for years. The difference is
that Lindsay Davenport and Justin Gimelstob don't have to fit into
a team's competitive fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is no social service agency, but Stern's commitment to
creating a healthier working environment for his youngest players
was never as clear as his logic. All these years, his league has
reaped the benefits of a free collegiate farm system. A significant
training league _ the kind Isiah Thomas was talking about after his
recent purchase of the Continental Basketball Association _ would
cost plenty. To Nelson's credit, he at least was willing to pay
Smith a season's salary based on the three-year, $1.4 million
contract set by the guidelines of the NBA's rookie scale.
</P>
<P>
   With his own standing shaky at the controls of a wobbly team,
Nelson said he had arranged through a collective bargaining
``loophole'' for Smith to play for St. Louis of the new
International Basketball League under his longtime friend, Bernie
Bickerstaff. ``It was about experience, not a money thing,'' Nelson
said. ``What these kids need is to play. In what league, it doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith agreed to the plan, his former agent, Dan Fegan, said
Thursday from his office in Los Angeles. ``But then he backed off,
and I told him, `You made a deal,''' Fegan said. Soon Smith had a
new agent, Matt Muehlebach, who said no deal. A stalemate ensued,
until this week, when the Dallas police, responding to a call,
found a groggy Smith, his face smeared with green paint, mumbling
about being an Indian who was ``fighting Columbus.''
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Smith's say the team should have anticipated how a
young man who was separated from his siblings at age 5, who had
become one more statistic in the urban bureaucracy, might have
reacted to becoming another basketball transaction. Nelson said he
was merely trying to do ``what everyone in the league knows we have
to start doing for these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In this unfortunate case, the coach is neither saint nor sinner.
His recent history of bizarre player feuds would suggest he lacked
the sensitivity for a case so extreme. That said, if Smith is the
opposite of Garnett, then between them is a more typical kid who
would benefit from what Nelson had in mind for Smith. That is the
more pragmatic path from high school to pro. Leon Smith was
apparently just the wrong player to walk it alone.

<P>
   Paul Bowles, the novelist, composer, poet and quintessential
outsider of American literature, died of a heart attack Thursday in
a hospital in Tangier, Morocco. He was 88, and throughout his
extraordinary career evoked a world of dark Moroccan streets and
scorching deserts, a haze of hashish and drug-induced visions.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles was taken to the hospital on Nov. 7 from his home in
Tangier, where he has lived since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   A man of diverse talents, he was most famous for his stories and
his novels, especially ``The Sheltering Sky.'' He was also known
for his songs, concertos, incidental music and operas; for his
marriage to Jane Bowles; and, simply, for being Paul Bowles.
Together with his wife, a novelist and playwright who died in 1973,
he became an icon of individualism. Although he remained elusive to
his biographers as well as his critics, his life as an expatriate
was as fascinating as his own experiments in art.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last of his cultural generation, what might be called
the post-Lost Generation, he knew and occasionally collaborated
with many of the major artistic figures of his time, among them
Orson Welles, Tennessee Williams and Gertrude Stein. He put a stamp
of sui generis on whatever he chose to do, or not to do. In many
ways, his career was one of avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times in 1995, the last time
he visited New York, he said that a typical Bowles fictional
character ``slips through life, if possible without touching
anything, without touching other people.'' Asked if that was how he
lived, he admitted: ``I've tried. It's hard. If you discover you're
affecting other people, you have to stop doing whatever you
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles' fiction deals with civilization overcome by savagery, a
world in which innocence is corrupted and delirium thrives. At the
core is a feeling of isolation, of self-contained compartments in
which people live alone and fear communication. As he said in an
interview in The Paris Review in 1981, ``Everyone is isolated from
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bowles' 1972 autobiography was titled ``Without
Stopping,'' his career was filled with stops and restarts. At
various points he turned away from music and took up fiction, gave
up writing novels, retreated to Tangier and became a collector of
Arabian stories and songs, and moved farther away from the worlds
of publishing and society toward an unknown destination.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As he said in his autobiography, ``Like any Romantic, I had
always been vaguely certain that sometime during my life I should
come into a magic place which, in disclosing its secrets, would
give me wisdom and ecstasy _ perhaps even death.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to other writers who chose to keep their names in
the spotlight, Bowles steadfastly preferred not to, avoiding
commitments and rejecting offers. ``I'm not ambitious,'' he said.
``If I had been, I'd have stayed in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Instinctively, he did what he thought he was most suited to do.
For example, he rejected an offer from the producer Lawrence
Langner to write the score for the Broadway show that later became
``Oklahoma!'' He did this before Richard Rodgers and Oscar
Hammerstein II came into the project. ``They're lucky I turned it
down,'' he later said, adding that his version ``would have been a
terrible flop.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that he did not plan things; he had no itinerary for
his life. ``I've never been a thinking person,'' he said. ``A lot
seems to happen without my conscious knowledge.'' Or, as he once
said, he preferred ``to leave imagination free to wander in the
unconscious, where it can select whatever elements seem propitious
to the elaboration of a tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles became a magnet for all those envisioning the artist's
life away from the mainstream. It is not surprising that he was
idolized by writers of the Beat Generation, many of whom visited
him in Tangier. Allen Ginsberg called him ``a caviar writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles leaves no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oddities of Bowles' life is that this international
traveler, who was marked by his rootlessness and who was seemingly
a wanderer in the desert of his own choice, was the son of a
dentist, born into a middle-class environment in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Until he was 18, he followed a rigidly formalized life. Then, in
his first semester at the University of Virginia, he suddenly quit
school. He left the United States without telling his parents,
expecting never to see them again. For the first of several times,
he changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   One night in 1947, after he had returned to New York, Bowles had
a dream about ``the magic city'' of Tangier, one of his homes
during the 1930s, and he decided to live there. Before departing,
he had an idea for a novel that would take place in the Sahara, and
he thought of a title, ``The Sheltering Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Published in 1949, ``The Sheltering Sky'' quickly became the
foundation of his estimable career as an author, and it is still at
the core of his literary legacy. Bowles described the book as ``an
adventure story in which the adventures take place on two planes
simultaneously: in the actual desert and in the inner desert of the
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review, Tennessee
Williams proclaimed the author ``a talent of true maturity and
sophistication.'' Williams said it was one of the few books by an
American writer ``to bear the spiritual imprint of recent history
in the Western world.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually his dream city of Tangier was invaded by tourists and
became something of a nightmare. Still he stayed on. ``I haven't
the energy to move out,'' he said in 1995 when he returned to New
York for a festival of his music at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, at 84, he was still a striking figure and retained
his handsome, ethereal looks. ``The marbles are still there,
believe it or not, but the body's a mess,'' he said. Bowles had not
heard most of the music for 50 years, but, as ever, he expressed
his reluctance to be nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in the present,'' Bowles said, and added about the
past: ``I remember it as one remembers a landscape, an unchanging
landscape. That which has happened is finished. I suppose you could
say that a man can learn how to avoid taking the same actions which
he's discovered were errors. I would recommend not thinking about
it.''

 &HT;    Gingrich's wife feeling pain of public divorce
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last May, Newt Gingrich told his wife he was seeing
another woman and wanted a divorce. He didn't mention the affair
had been going on for six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out with the rest of the country,'' said Marianne
Gingrich, who spoke publicly about her divorce this week. The
remarks are her most extensive since the days immediately after her
husband's July divorce petition was filed.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the relationship, which predated Gingrich's
ascension to the speakership of the U.S. House, surprised his wife.
And it jolted many of Gingrich's colleagues still in Congress,
fueling an already bubbling debate over the impact of Gingrich's
divorce on his unofficial role in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gingrich's attorneys said his ``intimate
relationship'' with congressional aide Callista Bisek started in
November 1993, about a year before the Republican takeover of the
U.S. House. The revelation was made before an impromptu gathering
of reporters outside Washington _ and it stung, Marianne Gingrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about a marriage. This is not about politics and
another press conference. This is about my life,'' she told The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich said she heard about the news conference from
a friend, who called her from a cell phone shortly afterwards. She
said her thoughts immediately went back to late 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's attorneys have said he and Marianne were
separated when the relationship with Bisek began.
</P>
<P>
   But Marianne Gingrich says she and her husband were living
together in a Marietta, Ga., condo. And while he was in Washington,
she was traveling between Ohio, where her mother was recovering
from a diabetes-related illness, and Florida, where her brother was
fighting cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, my family was in medical crisis,'' she said. Her
brother later died of lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich says it's been hard to speak of the end of her
18-year marriage and her husband's affair. ``I don't have any way
to express it without getting into some really deep emotions that I
don't want to share right now,'' she said. ``However, it's been
good for me to be involved in a number of community activities,
including the Red Cross and Mission Specialties.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich, 48, is chairwoman of the Red Cross' Northwest
Metro Service Center. She's also helping Mission Specialties, an
international service organization, raise money to buy shoes for
Russian orphans.
</P>
<P>
   In a People magazine article that comes out today, Marianne
Gingrich said she has lost 35 pounds, the result of stress and
diet. She plans to be in a Washington courtroom next week when
attorneys for Bisek, 33, will try to persuade a judge to toss out
Marianne Gingrich's demand that Bisek answer questions and turn
over documents related to her relationship to Newt Gingrich, 56.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the divorce is beginning to concern some of
Gingrich's GOP colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Congress are fretting over whether Gingrich
should be invited to a January celebration of the fifth anniversary
of the Republican takeover of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) said Wednesday that he expects
Gingrich to be invited to the January event. But U.S. Rep. J.C.
Watts (R-Okla.) did not endorse an invitation when he and Coverdell
discussed the event with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-Ariz.) argued that Gingrich's new job
as a political commentator for Fox News makes it inappropriate to
include him in political gatherings. ``Time marches on. He's gone
on to other pursuits,'' Hayworth said. But, then, he added, ``If
you're looking for a spirited defense of the speaker's private life
from me, you'll not get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans in Congress, from Georgia and elsewhere, have
jumped to Gingrich's defense. ``It's only right that we invite Newt
Gingrich to return for any celebration. His ideas and his vision
put together the Contract With America,'' Rep. Mac Collins (R-Ga.)
said. ``His biggest problem was that he thought out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, on the same day Gingrich's attorneys said his affair
with Bisek stretched back six years, Republican House members who
took office in 1995 held a reunion in Washington. Gingrich's
attendance at that gathering had been an issue, too. As it turned
out, he was in New Orleans and couldn't make it, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A scheduling conflict saved us from having to fight this
out,'' said Rep. Gil Gutknecht (R-Minn.), who helped put the
reunion together.

   Paul Bowles, the novelist, composer, poet and quintessential
outsider of American literature, died of a heart attack Thursday in
a hospital in Tangier, Morocco. He was 88, and throughout his
extraordinary career evoked a world of dark Moroccan streets and
scorching deserts, a haze of hashish and drug-induced visions.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles was taken to the hospital on Nov. 7 from his home in
Tangier, where he has lived since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   A man of diverse talents, he was most famous for his stories and
his novels, especially ``The Sheltering Sky.'' He was also known
for his songs, concertos, incidental music and operas; for his
marriage to Jane Bowles; and, simply, for being Paul Bowles.
Together with his wife, a novelist and playwright who died in 1973,
he became an icon of individualism. Although he remained elusive to
his biographers as well as his critics, his life as an expatriate
was as fascinating as his own experiments in art.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last of his cultural generation, what might be called
the post-Lost Generation, he knew and occasionally collaborated
with many of the major artistic figures of his time, among them
Orson Welles, Tennessee Williams and Gertrude Stein. He put a stamp
of sui generis on whatever he chose to do, or not to do. In many
ways, his career was one of avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times in 1995, the last time
he visited New York, he said that a typical Bowles fictional
character ``slips through life, if possible without touching
anything, without touching other people.'' Asked if that was how he
lived, he admitted: ``I've tried. It's hard. If you discover you're
affecting other people, you have to stop doing whatever you
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles' fiction deals with civilization overcome by savagery, a
world in which innocence is corrupted and delirium thrives. At the
core is a feeling of isolation, of self-contained compartments in
which people live alone and fear communication. As he said in an
interview in The Paris Review in 1981, ``Everyone is isolated from
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bowles' 1972 autobiography was titled ``Without
Stopping,'' his career was filled with stops and restarts. At
various points he turned away from music and took up fiction, gave
up writing novels, retreated to Tangier and became a collector of
Arabian stories and songs, and moved farther away from the worlds
of publishing and society toward an unknown destination.
</P>
<P>
   As he said in his autobiography, ``Like any Romantic, I had
always been vaguely certain that sometime during my life I should
come into a magic place which, in disclosing its secrets, would
give me wisdom and ecstasy _ perhaps even death.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In contrast to other writers who chose to keep their names in
the spotlight, Bowles steadfastly preferred not to, avoiding
commitments and rejecting offers. ``I'm not ambitious,'' he said.
``If I had been, I'd have stayed in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Instinctively, he did what he thought he was most suited to do.
For example, he rejected an offer from the producer Lawrence
Langner to write the score for the Broadway show that later became
``Oklahoma!'' He did this before Richard Rodgers and Oscar
Hammerstein II came into the project. ``They're lucky I turned it
down,'' he later said, adding that his version ``would have been a
terrible flop.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that he did not plan things; he had no itinerary for
his life. ``I've never been a thinking person,'' he said. ``A lot
seems to happen without my conscious knowledge.'' Or, as he once
said, he preferred ``to leave imagination free to wander in the
unconscious, where it can select whatever elements seem propitious
to the elaboration of a tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles became a magnet for all those envisioning the artist's
life away from the mainstream. It is not surprising that he was
idolized by writers of the Beat Generation, many of whom visited
him in Tangier. Allen Ginsberg called him ``a caviar writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles leaves no survivors.

<P>
   Collette Andreani's day began at 5:30 a.m. with a phone call
from her youngest son's roommate at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   There had been a terrible accident, she was told. The logs being
stacked for the traditional Thanksgiving week bonfire had
collapsed, and her 18-year-old son, Lino, was helping firefighters
pull logs off the injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just sick; it was just an empty feeling,'' said
Andreani, of Grapevine, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly gathered her wits and called her older son, Nic, 20,
also a student at A&AMP;M. He knew nothing about the accident but said
he would gather his friends, go to the bonfire site and lend
support.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, Andreani was able to talk to Lino, who had
been outside
</P>
<P>
   about 3 a.m. hoping to spot the Leonid meteor shower when he and
his friends heard sirens racing toward the bonfire site.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very shaken when we spoke,'' Andreani said. ``He was
right there when they began to pull bodies from the pile.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreani was fortunate in being able to contact her children at
A&AMP;M, in College Station, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Many panic-stricken parents resorted to calling university
numbers in their desperate attempt for information, said Tim
Sweeney, associate director of student activities at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell they were just holding on as best they could,''
Sweeney said. ``There was a lot of frustration by parents who could
not find a loved one.''
</P>
<P>
   An information hot line was established, but so many people
called the toll-free number that the system overloaded Thursday
morning, Sweeney said. The phone line was down about 10 to 15
minutes, rolling calls over to the University Police Department,
Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the calls were from parents who knew their students
were working on the bonfire. The majority were from people who just
didn't know, though,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Newton, whose 20-year-old son Nathan attends Texas A&AMP;M,
said he went through an agonizing morning. Because of Nathan's
early-morning job in College Station, it is hard to reach him
before 9 a.m. The Newtons finally connected about 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Newton had difficulties grasping the extent of the tragedy and
how it must be affecting the friends and families of the dead and
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately prayed for all of them,'' said Newton, a former
mayor of Colleyville, Texas. ``It's such a tragedy. You wish there
was something you could do for them, but all you can do is pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Ritter, who teaches at Colleyville-Heritage High School,
received a welcome call about 6:30 a.m. from her 21-year-old son,
Zachary, an A&AMP;M senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you so much for calling,'' she told her son. ``Thank
goodness you've learned we need to hear your voice when something
like this happens.'' &QL;

   There were two sides to Bowles' art, as Ned Rorem explained in
his memoir ``Knowing When to Stop.'' Rorem said that his stories
were ``icy, cruel, objective'' and his music was ``warm, wistful,
witty.'' When that criticism was repeated to Bowles, he laughed and
said, ``He has a lot of chutzpah to use the word cruel.'' He said
he would have substituted the word realistic.
</P>
<P>
   It was his feeling that of his 50 stories only two were marked
by violence. In one of the most brutal _ and most admired _
stories, ``A Distant Thunder,'' a professor is captured by nomads
who cut out his tongue and treat him as their slave.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil Thomson said about Bowles' work as a composer: ``Paul
Bowles' songs are enchanting for their sweetness of mood, their
lightness of texture, for in general their way of being wholly
alive and right.... The texts fit their tunes like a peach in its
skin.''
</P>
<P>

   One of the oddities of Bowles' life is that this international
traveler, who was marked by his rootlessness and who was seemingly
a wanderer in the desert of his own choice, was the son of a
dentist, born into a middle-class environment in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   In one family legend, Claude Bowles, Paul's father, tried to
kill his son in infancy by stripping off the baby's clothes and
placing him in a basket on a windowsill during a snowstorm.
According to the story, he was rescued by his grandmother. Although
the incident might not have happened, Bowles thought it was true _
and it haunted him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sparked by such fears of abandonment, he had a sense of
wanderlust even as a small child. In his autobiography he said:
``Very early I understood that I would always be kept from doing
what I enjoyed and forced to that which I did not. The Bowles
family took it for granted that pleasure was destructive, whereas
engaging in an unappealing activity aided in character formation.''
</P>
<P>
   He could read by the time he was 3 and within the year was
writing stories. Soon, he wrote surrealistic poetry and music. When
he was 16, he published poetry in Transition magazine.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Until he was 18, he followed a rigidly formalized life. Then, in
his first semester at the University of Virginia, he suddenly quit
school. He left the United States without telling his parents,
expecting never to see them again. For the first of several times,
he changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   In characteristic Bowles fashion, he fled to Paris. He once said
that he was not running away but was ``running toward something,
although I didn't know what at the time.'' In Paris, he met
Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau and Andre Gide, among others, but he
retained a cool air of indifference about his meetings with such
famous people. ``I took it for granted,'' he said. ``You go to
Paris and you meet all the people you admire.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he returned to the United States, where he met
Aaron Copland and began to study composition with him. For four
months he lived in Berlin, where one of his friends was Christopher
Isherwood, who was gathering material for what would later become
his book ``Goodbye to Berlin.'' Isherwood named his leading
character Sally Bowles after Paul Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, at the suggestion of Gertrude Stein and Alice B.
Toklas, Bowles went to Morocco, where he and Copland shared a house
in Tangier.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1930s, he was back in New York. He wrote musical
scores for Orson Welles, beginning with ``Horse Eats Hat'' at the
Federal Theater Project, and later for works by William Saroyan,
Tennessee Williams and others. In 1937 he met Jane Auer. She was a
lesbian, and he was bisexual; there was an immediate rapport and an
intimacy. Within a year they were married. Through countless
affairs on both sides, they remained married and permanently
attached to each other. Looking back on their marriage, Bowles
said: ``We played everything by ear. Each one did what he
pleased.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   At first, he focused on his music while she began writing a
novel. When she gave a draft of it to him in Mexico in 1945, he
read it carefully and, acting as editor, suggested changes. The
book, ``Two Serious Ladies,'' received mixed reviews, but it was
the beginning of Jane Bowles' literary reputation, and it acted as
an inspiration to her husband. ``It was the excitement of
participating in that that got me interested in writing,'' he said
to Millicent Dillon, author of biographies of both Bowleses.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his wife, who apparently found no pleasure in
writing, Bowles savored the experience and the experimentation. As
he said, ``I enjoyed shaping the lives of nonexistent people.'' He
also said that he wrote ``for the pleasure of seeing one's thoughts
in front of one, on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Bowleses were immersed in a literary world. In
the early 1940s they lived with other artists in a house on Middagh
Street in Brooklyn Heights. The residents included W.H. Auden,
Benjamin Britten and Oliver Smith, the scenic designer. For two
years in the late 1940s the couple lived on West 10th Street in
Manhattan. Smith rented three floors of a brownstone. Bowles lived
on the top floor, putting a Steinway piano under the skylight.
Smith was on the floor below, and another flight down lived Jane
Bowles and her friend Helvetia Perkins. The four shared a cook and
lived communally.
</P>
<P>
   In this period, Bowles wrote scores for seven plays (including
``The Glass Menagerie'') and collaborated with Tennessee Williams
on the song fragments ``Blue Mountain Ballads.'' He also returned
to writing short stories and translated Jean-Paul Sartre's play
``Huis-Clos,'' retitling it ``No Exit.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bowles also reviewed music for The New York Herald Tribune.
During this time, Jane Bowles wrote her play, ``In the Summer
House.''
</P>
<P>
   To others, this would have been considered a highly productive
period, but Bowles ``always seemed to find myself doing what
someone else wanted done.'' Because he continued to accept
theatrical commissions, he was unable to attain the freedom he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One night in 1947 Bowles had a dream about ``the magic city'' of
Tangier, one of his homes during the 1930s, and he decided to
return there. Before departing, he had an idea for a novel that
would take place in the Sahara, and he thought of a title, ``The
Sheltering Sky,'' borrowing it from the popular song, ``Down Among
the Sheltering Palms.'' Later his wife joined him in Tangier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gone to some other part of the world,'' he said.
``But Morocco was a magnet.'' Published in 1949, ``The Sheltering
Sky'' quickly became the foundation of his estimable career as an
author, and it is still at the core of his literary legacy. Bowles
described the book as ``an adventure story in which the adventures
take place on two planes simultaneously: in the actual desert and
in the inner desert of the spirit.''

   The central characters are Port and Kit Moresby, a married
couple who are generally considered to be surrogates for Paul and
Jane Bowles. But in his Paris Review interview, Bowles denied that
possibility: ``The tale is entirely imaginary. Kit is not Jane,
although I used some of Jane's characteristics in determining Kit's
reactions to such a voyage. Obviously I thought of Port as a
fictional extension of myself. But Port is certainly not Paul
Bowles, any more than Kit is Jane.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review, Tennessee
Williams proclaimed the author ``a talent of true maturity and
sophistication.'' Williams said it was one of the few books by an
American writer ``to bear the spiritual imprint of recent history
in the Western world.''

   In a review in The Times of a subsequent Bowles novel, Conrad
Knickerbocker ranked ``The Sheltering Sky'' ``with the dozen or so
most important American novels published since World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   The book became a best seller and was sold to the movies, but it
was to be 40 years before it was filmed. In 1990 Bernardo
Bertolucci's lavish movie, starring John Malkovich and Debra Winger
and with Bowles himself playing a cameo role, received mixed
reviews. The author was disappointed. His one-word criticism of the
film: ``Awful.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The novel was followed, in 1952, by ``Let It Come Down,'' about
an American bank clerk who journeys to Tangier and is caught up in
a world of intrigue and corruption. In his review in The New York
Times Book Review, Robert Gorham Davis said the novel ``drives its
central character relentlessly toward doom, toward the final
orgastic shudder, with the nightmare clarity, the hallucinative
exoticism, of the best of Bowles' short stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spider's House'' (1955) deals with an American novelist
living in Fez during a Nationalist revolt. It was 11 years before
Bowles published his next novel, ``Up Above the World.'' At the
center of that book are an American doctor and his wife, adrift in
Central America and held captive by a charming man of mystery.
Neither novel measured up to Bowles' first success.
</P>
<P>
   His other books include ``The Delicate Prey and Other Stories,''
``Days: Tangier Journal: 1987-1989,'' ``Points in Time,'' ``Too Far
From Home: The Selected Writings of Paul Bowles'' and ``Next to
Nothing: Collected Poems, 1926-1977.'' His musical works included
``Concerto for Two Pianos, Winds and Percussion,'' ``A Picnic
Cantata,'' an operatic version of Garcia Lorca's ``Yerma'' and
``The Wind Remains,'' a zarzuela for piano and orchestra based on a
text by Garcia Lorca.
</P>
<P>
   In Morocco Bowles began translating the stories of Arab writers,
particularly Mohammed Mrabet. Because Bowles seldom traveled,
friends (and journalists and potential biographers) came to see him
as if on a pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually his dream city of Tangier was invaded by tourists and
became something of a nightmare. Still he stayed on. ``I haven't
the energy to move out,'' he said in 1995 when he returned to New
York for a festival of his music at Lincoln Center. He added, ``I
wouldn't know where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He was unhappy about the long journey from Tangier, and he
seemed frail, but at 84 he was still a striking figure and retained
his handsome, ethereal looks. ``The marbles are still there,
believe it or not, but the body's a mess,'' he said. Bowles had not
heard most of the music for 50 years, but, as ever, he expressed
his reluctance to be nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in the present,'' Bowles said, and added about the
past: ``I remember it as one remembers a landscape, an unchanging
landscape. That which has happened is finished. I suppose you could
say that a man can learn how to avoid taking the same actions which
he's discovered were errors. I would recommend not thinking about
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Bowles, the point of life was to have fun, ``if there is any
point at all.'' Enjoyment, he said firmly, ``is what life should
provide.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested to him that others might say that life
should provide a greater moral purpose, he said: ``What is moral
purpose? The word `moral' sets nothing ringing in my head. Who
decides what's moral and what isn't? Right behavior, is that moral?
Well, what's right behavior?''
</P>
<P>
   Years before, in the interview in The Paris Review, he had said,
``If I knew I were going to die tomorrow, I'd think, so soon?'' He
added, ``Still, if a man has spent his life doing what he wanted to
do, he ought to be able to say goodbye without regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   In his strange, exotic life, Bowles apparently did exactly what
he wanted to do, writing fiction and music and continually
searching for that magic place where he would find his twinned
goals of wisdom and ecstasy.

DRUG NEEDS MORE TESTING; GENZYME, BIOMARTIN SHARES DROP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Shares of both Genzyme Corp. and BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc.
fell Thursday after the companies said government regulators want
more testing of a jointly developed drug to treat a rare disease.
</P>
<P>
   A new pivotal clinical trial, which will take six months to
administer and require more than 20 particiants, will delay
Genzyme's marketing plans for the drug by at least a year and
postpone BioMarin's anticipated profitability, which was expected
in mid-2001. BioMarin had been testing the drug in 10 patients.
</P>
<P>
   The additional testing required by the US Food and Drug
Administration prompted shares of Genzyme to close Thursday at 37,
down 1 7/8, while BioMarin stock ended at 12 3/16, down 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously expected approval from the FDA,'' said Alison
Lauton, Genzyme's senior vice president of regulatory affairs.
``But the FDA did not not legally tell BioMarin that it absolutely
agreed with the design of their clinical trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies specialize in developing enzyme replacement
therapies for life-threatening diseases. Fourteen months ago,
Genzyme, of Cambridge, Mass., signed a joint development agreement
with BioMarin, based in Novato, Calif., which had developed a drug
to treat mucopolysaccharidosis, known as MPS-1, a genetic disorder
that affects 2,000 to 3,000 children worldwide, some of whom die by
age 10.
</P>
<P>
   When Genzyme agreed to fund the development and
commercialization of the drug, known as alpha-L iduronidase,
BioMarin had an understanding with the FDA about the clinical
testing needed to measure the drug's safety and effectiveness in
MPS-1 patients. The measurements included a shrinking of the liver
and a urine test. All 10 patients, according to Genzymne, showed
various signs that the drug was effective.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme officials Thursday said the FDA, after reviewing the
BioMarin clinical trial data, felt the results were insufficient to
grant formal approval and have asked for another clinical trial to
show additional results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This delay is not good news for BioMarin, but it's not
terrible either, as there are no real firm FDA rules on approving
drugs for rare diseases, especially when only 10 patients are
involved,'' said Jim McCamant, editor of Medical Technology Stock
Letter in Berkeley, Calif. ``But now that there are a growing
number of companies developing drugs for rare illnesses, and the
ones that get approved command high prices, the FDA and the firms
involved will probably develop better guidelines.''

   CAIRO, Egypt _ As the inquiry into the crash of EgyptAir Flight
990 moves into a delicate new phase, Egyptian and U.S. officials
face high stakes in trying to find conclusive and satisfactory
answers to questions about what brought the plane crashing into the
ocean Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   For the Egyptian government, the results of the investigation
could affect everything from national pride to the fortunes of the
country's tourism industry, one of its economic lifelines. In a
sign of how volatile the issue of the inquiry has become,
conspiracy theories are now circulating wildly in Egypt, troubling
both U.S. and and Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some have blamed Israel's intelligence service for the crash;
others have suggested that the U.S. investigators are covering up
for Boeing, the plane's manufacturer. And as unlikely as the
theories may seem, they have been embraced in Egypt more easily
than the very different hypothesis now being advanced by U.S.
investigators: that the aircraft and all 217 people aboard might
have been brought down by a suicidal Egyptian pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the response by the Egyptian public and the government
to that U.S. suggestion has been so bitter that, to some, it
appears unclear whether the Egyptian government might ever
cooperate fully with the kind of exhaustive criminal probe that is
the next step favored by many U.S. investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they are persuaded that there is reason to suspect
this pilot, I wonder whether Egypt will feel comfortable allowing
an FBI team to come to Egypt and begin asking questions at will,''
said a Western diplomat here who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Egypt are close allies, and both have good
reason for wanting to defuse any possible dispute or tensions.
Egypt receives more than $2 billion a year in assistance from the
United States, making it the second-largest recipient of U.S. aid,
behind Israel. The United States relies heavily on Egypt as a
mediator in Middle East peace talks and as a potential staging area
for U.S. troops in the event of renewed conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
   An Egyptian challenge to the working U.S. theory has already
delayed any decision to shift responsibility for the case to the
FBI. U.S. and Egyptian officials in Washington are now reviewing
the evidence that has been gathered to date by accident
investigators from the National Transportation Board in hopes of
reaching a joint decision on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian experts are expected to help interpret voice recordings
from the cockpit, while diplomats from the United States and Egypt
will try hard to present a picture of partnership. Only with the
permission of the Egyptian government could U.S. investigators
begin any kind of criminal inquiry here into the background of
Gameel el-Batouty, 59, the reserve pilot whom the Americans think
may have been responsible for the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But along with its own reservations about such a course, the
Egyptian government is likely also to listen closely to the public
anger being voiced by ordinary Egyptians who say they see in the
pilot sabotage scenario little more than the product of an
overactive American imagination.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are trying to harm Egypt's reputation by any
means,'' said Mohammed Sami, 62, a retired executive of the
Egyptian railway authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just want to take every small thing and turn it into a
very big complicated thing that backfires against Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin went out
of his way at a briefing Thursday to insist that, to date, the
United States and Egypt had been `working very, very closely
together at all levels in the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our long and close friendship will not be harmed because we
have confidence that the Egyptian government, like the United
States government, wants to get to the bottom of this,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey on Thursday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
amplified his government's reluctance to accept the U.S. theory
that the plane was brought down by pilot sabotage. So far, the
foreign minister said, it was too early to label the crash anything
but a ``technical failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't jump to conclusions from someone quoting the Koran
and say that this was more than an accident,'' Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa's reference was to the cryptic Islamic phrase that
Batouty, then sitting at the controls of the aircraft, was heard to
have uttered at the start of a sequence of events that preceded the
crash. In conjunction with other evidence, the U.S. investigators
at least initially thought Batouty's use of the phrase as an
indication that he might have been preparing for death.
</P>
<P>
   But Egyptian officials have scoffed at that notion, saying that,
if anything, Batouty's language might be a sign that he had
encountered some kind of emergency in the cabin. In a new response
to the U.S. theory, EgyptAir on Thursday dispatched a new team of
medical and technical experts to the United States, and officials
said they would seek to address what Batouty's former colleagues
have called the unfounded allegations against him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the 19 days since the crash, Egypt has allowed the United
States to assume primary responsibility for the investigation into
the cause of the incident. But under international agreements that
spell out which country should take charge of such an
investigation, it could reassert its own authority at any time,
according to experts in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no indication that Egypt might take such a step,
but in an implicit warning, the semi-official Egyptian daily Al
Akhbar newspaper complained in an editorial Thursday that the
publicity given in the United States to the theory of pilot
sabotage developed by the U.S.-led team ``indicates that there is
an intention to rule out any American responsibility for this
tragic accident.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh said Wednesday that if Egypt did assert
primacy in the case, the United States would carry out its own
investigation, but he acknowledged that the scope of such an
inquiry could not extend to Egypt without permission from the
Egyptian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Along with its stated aversion to any rush to judgment, the
Egyptian government has solid practical reasons for at least
wishing that the line of U.S. inquiry would shift away from any
finding of pilot misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Any conclusion that an EgyptAir crew member was responsible for
the crash could subject the state-run airline to heavy liability
claims. And an adverse ruling would also almost certainly rebound
against Egypt's tourism industry, the country's main source of
foreign currency, which has only now recovered from the setback
caused by the 1997 killings of 58 foreign tourists during an attack
by militants in the southern city of Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the suspicion and bitterness with which many
Egyptians have responded to the U.S. theory reflects a view that
runs deep in Egypt: a suspicion that the United States and other
Western powers, for all their claims of partnership, do not have
Egypt's best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments could be heard in conversations around Cairo on
Thursday, as Egyptians from all walks of life spoke with
near-unanimity in rejecting the U.S. theory of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for a scapegoat,'' said Issam Abdel Moneim,
58, an accountant ``They want to escape responsibility,'' said Amr
Abdel Kalik, 21, a student. ``They are not neutral,'' said Manal
Ali, 30, a secretary.

COMMENTARY: GOOSE WARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Hillary Rodham Clinton was having her problems with
international politics last week, the folks in her future New York
neighborhood were engaged in a summit conference of their own, over
one of the most explosive issues in American suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Geese.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are God's creatures. They have every right to be here!''
cried a speaker at the Westchester County Goose Symposium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every right has responsibilities that go with it,'' retorted
another.
</P>
<P>
   Aha. Somebody's been listening to campaign speeches. I can
imagine George W. Bush walking _ gingerly _ down the goose-infested
bikeways and beaches of the New York commuter towns, telling the
birds that it's time to stop living for the moment and take charge
of the goslings they bring into the world.
</P>
<P>
   The goose overpopulation issue is one of those critter crises
that pit the people-first crowd against animal lovers from
California (coyotes) to New England (beavers), and all the places
in between (deer, deer, deer). The biggest complaint about geese is
their guano _ a single bird can produce a pound of droppings a day,
and some lakefront areas have up to 200 geese in residence. They
also eat farmers' seeds, and attack passers-by during nesting
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they're pests. They should be treated as pests. I'm
all in favor of killing the Canada geese,'' said a man who
described himself only as ``a resident.'' The opposition rumbled
ominously.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president, geese are especially attracted to golf
courses. Westchester County, where the Clintons have purchased a
$1.7 million home, has more than 60 courses. This is an area under
siege by fowl who appreciate the virtues of waterfront property and
well-manicured lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the first lady's future neighbors seemed ready to follow
any politician who would promise to make the resident waterfowl go
back to migrating, like their virtuous relatives who fly hard and
play by the rules. This seems like an opening for Mrs. Clinton's
prospective Senate opponent, Rudolph Giuliani. Neither candidate
has taken a specific stance on the goose situation yet, but the
mayor is one politician who doesn't quail before the animal-rights
army. During a recent war with ferret-lovers, Giuliani counseled
one of the critters' defenders to see a psychiatrist about ``this
excessive concern _ how you are devoting your life to weasels.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine Mrs. Clinton aligned with the moderates,
who champion nonlethal but rather expensive solutions, like hiring
border collies to chase the birds into someone else's back yard. If
she had attended the symposium, she probably would have smiled
politely during the ``kill-the-geese'' speech, given the man who
made it a peck on the cheek, and then called a press conference to
denounce him.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley would certainly have wanted to tackle the problem
with a big plan, while Al Gore would hint that he had urged the
president to be more proactive on the goose front. Bud say
that while it is conservative to kill off excess geese, it is
compassionate to give the meat to the poor, preferably through
private charities that march in the armies of compassion. Sen. John
McCain would find some way to blame the whole thing on campaign
contributions by the goose lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The people who actually did attend the symposium represented
practically every facet of modern American politics. A federal
bureaucrat explained the mind-boggling series of permits required
to do anything about the geese, which are protected by the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act even though they never go anywhere. A
conspiracy theorist charged the government with encouraging goose
overpopulation in order to make more money from an excise tax on
bullets. The moderator continually begged the rancorous
participants to ``communicate with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   A farmer complained that even after he received
goose-elimination permits, eradication was a tough job. ``We'd like
your staff to do it,'' he told the bureaucrat hopefully but
futilely. If only the farmer lived in Iowa or New Hampshire, he
could have gotten half a dozen presidential candidates to call for
a special Agricultural Goose Relief Initiative. New York has its
primary in March, but that's still not early enough in the election
season to qualify for full-scale pandering before Thanksgiving.

<P>
   HOTENSLEBEN, Germany _ This is a country of scars. Some are
evident, some lie deeply hidden, as the story of this village on
the former border between East and West Germany shows.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with the evident scars, stroll into the fields beyond
the village, where the quiet quickly gives way to the disquieting:
a wall, a watchtower and coils of barbed wire rise from the
undulating countryside and mark the Cold War's old frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin Wall fell on Nov. 9, 1989, but elsewhere on the
930-mile border between East and West Germany the end of Europe's
division came more slowly. At Hotensleben, it was only on Nov. 19
that the heavily fortified wall was breached after repeated
protests by local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we watched what happened in Berlin, we thought it was a
one-day mistake,'' said Dieter Buchwald, the mayor of this formerly
East German town. ``We were certain the Russians would never
tolerate it. But then we gained courage, and about 300 of us went
every day to press for the opening of our wall.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days that opening came. Euphoria and emotional family
reunions followed. Then, as elsewhere, came the difficulties: a
sugar factory closed, a mine shut down, hundreds of jobs were lost.
Widespread unemployment was hard, but a deeper pain emerged when
the hidden scar of Hotensleben at last emerged.
</P>
<P>
   That scar stemmed from the story of Alfred and Eva Jaeckel, the
one Jewish family in the village. Owners of the Hotensleben textile
store, German patriots until Hitler decreed otherwise, they were
banished from history between 1945 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   East German history was a science in the service of the
Communist regime. Hitler, seen through this prism, was the last
spasm of reactionary capitalism, a man thrust to power by the
German bourgeoisie and resisted by the socialist worker-heroes of
the future East German state. In this vision, the Holocaust had no
place.
</P>
<P>
   So in communist, postwar Hotensleben, on the front line between
the Soviet and British sectors, the story of the Jaeckels simply
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The end of Europe's division also marked the release of buried
history. Sometimes this has proved explosive, as in the Balkans,
where the past has been manipulated again to serve
communists-turned-nationalists. Sometimes, as in this German
village, a result has been a belated push for truth and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The push began in 1990 with a property claim from Israel that
arrived at the town and amazed Buchwald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had grown up in this village, but nobody ever mentioned a
Jewish family,'' said the mayor, an engineer who took office in
1989. ``We heard about Hitler's fascist atrocities, but not about
the Jews, here or anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The claim came from Alfred's son, Reinhold Jaeckel. Intrigued,
the mayor decided to make use of a government-subsidized make-work
program to give an unemployed person the task of researching
whether a Jewish family called Jaeckel had ever lived in
Hotensleben.
</P>
<P>
   Responses from the town's 2,400 inhabitants were initially
evasive. People old enough to remember the war years seemed
reluctant to talk about the Nazi period; above all, they did not
want their own names linked with any testimony. But gradually the
lost story of the Jaeckels was pieced together.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Jaeckel opened his store in 1907 and fought for Germany
in World War I, earning an Iron Cross for bravery. After the war,
he returned to Hotensleben, where business was good until Hitler
came to power in 1933. Then banners began to appear saying:
``Anyone who buys from the Jews not wanted here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaeckel, like many patriotic German Jews, refused to believe the
worst. He tried to ignore the taunts of the Nazis gathering in the
Knopf hotel next to the store.
</P>
<P>
   But his Zionist son, Reinhold, who was born in 1908, left
Germany for Palestine in 1933, as soon as Hitler gained power.
Having worked most of his life as a teacher, Reinhold Jaeckel died
in Israel in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was always obsessed with what happened in
Hotensleben,'' said Reinhold's son Joram Jaeckel, who lives in
Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv. ``He wanted to know exactly what happened
to his family and he wanted to recover the property. He wrote
countless letters. But until the Cold War ended, we could not do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Cold War hid was the way German barbarism had destroyed
the Jaeckel family. On the night of Nov. 9, 1938 _ the same date in
November that the Berlin Wall would fall 51 years later _ their
store was smashed and ransacked in the Kristallnacht rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred and his wife, Eva, were arrested, taken initially to
Berlin, and then deported to Auschwitz in 1942, where they were
killed. Their son Albert was also arrested and killed by the Nazis
in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a half-century after these crimes, in 1990, that
Reinhold Jaeckel returned to Hotensleben for the first time,
accompanied by his son. ``We felt a terrible ambivalence,'' Joram
Jaeckel said.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, people were nice, helpful, overwhelmingly
polite. ``On the other,'' he continued, ``I knew that these were
the sons and daughters of my family's murderers, and that the older
people may even have participated in Kristallnacht.''
</P>
<P>
   The only trace of the family in the town was the grave of
Reinhold's grandmother Ernestine Lippmann. An 80-year-old woman in
1938, she was beaten by the Nazis during the Kristallnacht attack
and died 10 days later, on Nov. 19, 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Joram Jaeckel, 53, recalled meeting a woman old enough to have
witnessed these events, asking her about his great-grandmother's
death, and seeing a shadow of unease fall across her face. ``She
did not want to tell the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchwald, a devout Christian, is now deeply concerned with
historical truth, which he sees as the only basis for ending
Europe's 20th-century convulsions. His own family was uprooted from
Silesia after 1945 when the area became part of Poland, so he knows
the anguish of displacement.
</P>
<P>
   He played an important role in ensuring the restitution of the
Jaeckel home _ then a ruin _ in 1994. The preservation of the wall
outside the village as a memorial to Germany's division has also
been the mayor's work.
</P>
<P>
   In the hall outside his office, Buchwald has organized a
permanent exhibition of the Jaeckel family story made up of
photographs, letters from Reinhold Jaeckel and unsigned testimony
from local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old people alive at Kristallnacht are still too embarrassed to
sign their name,'' Buchwald said. ``Germans continue to complicate
their history. Some now say it was not really so bad for the Jews
under the Nazis, and so I exhibit these photos. Others say it was
not really so bad in communist East Germany, and so I want the wall
there as a reminder of what that state was.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even with history made so evident, its scars are not quickly
overcome. For four decades, East Germans learned they were the good
Germans, the anti-fascists during Hitler's rule. In this way,
honest confrontation with Nazi crimes was avoided.
</P>
<P>
   One result of this has been the much greater success of neo-Nazi
groups in the former East Germany than in the West. In the last
election in Saxony-Anhalt, the state in which Hotensleben is
situated, the extreme right took 12.9 percent of the vote. This
prominence of rightist groups, in turn, hinders east-west
integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I note that my children, who are in their 20s, are not
interested in the east,'' said Willi Heidemann, the top
administrative official in the nearby village of Jerxheim, which
was on the western side of the border. ``In part that's because
they are apolitical members of what I call a just-for-fun
generation. But they are also put off by right-wing violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Joram Jaeckel, who is now trying to rent out his recovered and
restored property, puts the neo-Nazism of skinheads down to the
follies of youth. Once, staying at an inn in the nearby town of
Schoeningen, he overhead chants of ``Heil Hitler!'' and shuddered.
But he is more deeply disturbed by meetings with older Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I always ask myself,'' he said, ``is `What are they
thinking? What is behind the faces?'''

 &HT;    Sale of Hitler silverware leaves bad taste in mouths of
Holocaust survivors
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Over the objections of Holocaust survivors and others,
one of metro Atlanta's poshest antiques shops is turning
swastika-embossed silver into gold. Great Gatsby's Auction Gallery
is raising thousands of dollars for a local family by selling Adolf
Hitler's tableware.
</P>
<P>
   The 125-piece set is a mere drop in a torrent of World War II
material coming onto the market as families of aging or deceased
veterans seek to unload the artifacts. Put on sale by a Woodstock,
Ga., family, the silverware is being sold in 52 separate lots via
the Internet. Bidding concludes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday, more than $87,502 had been offered. Gatsby's
will get 10 percent to 15 percent of the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Kowalik, president of Gatsby's, which is based in
Chamblee, seemed puzzled that the auction had sparked controversy.
``This is what we do. We're not condoning Hitler, for gosh sake.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics contend the auction humanizes _ even glorifies _ one
of the monsters of world history, and that it could fuel the fervor
of Hitler buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Erna Martino, 53, head of the Atlanta Organization of Holocaust
Survivors, said the auction ``brings out people who think this kind
of thing is wonderful, and there are a lot of them in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Martino's brother and sister, 11 and 13, were murdered by Nazis.
She was born in Germany after her parents' liberation from
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Martino said selling Hitler's personal belongings is ``morbid,
like someone saying, `I'd like to buy Charles Manson's T-shirt.'
It's very morose and perverse for people to want to own that kind
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Kaiman, southeast director of the Anti-Defamation League, a
Jewish group that fights bigotry, maintained that thousands of
Americans are gung-ho followers of Nazi ideology. The sale might
create more Hitler fans, he contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It elevates Hitler to celebrity status in pop culture, similar
to, say, Elvis Presley,'' Kaiman said. ``This idea that we
mass-merchandise things that were owned by Hitler _ and that people
would buy them because they would want a part of him _ is
disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   With such concerns in mind, some auction houses have steered
clear of Hitler items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not sell Hitler memorabilia in any way, shape or
form,'' said Diana Phillips of Sotheby's. ``It is completely
inappropriate. Sotheby's would not want to be associated in any way
with the man responsible for the most shameful period in living
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hitler tableware being auctioned had been shipped home from
Germany by a decorated American soldier from the Atlanta area.
Kowalik said the GI ``liberated'' the Hitler items with a group of
other soldiers who in 1945 stormed the dictator's headquarters in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran died recently, and his family, whom Kowalik declined
to identify, decided they needed money more than the World War II
artifacts. They felt they could get more by selling the collection
on the open market than by seeking out museum buyers, Kowalik said.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Cocks, a history professor at Albion College in
Michigan and one of America's foremost scholars on Hitler, said ``a
huge amount'' of captured German material, including some of
Hitler's personal effects, is beginning to show up because American
World War II veterans are dying at a rate of 1,100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Other auctions have sold things such as Hitler's eight-wheeled
Mercedes Benz and paintings. This week, a San Francisco auction
house sold a ledger said to have been Hitler's personal phone book
_ Eva Braun's number is marked ``secret'' _ for $17,000 to an
anonymous buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Most materials going up for sale aren't controversial, Cocks
said _ items like flags and German Lugers. But Hitler's personal
tableware is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an unsavory quality about this stuff,'' he said of the
tableware. ``Most museums wouldn't be interested in honoring such a
person by having it. And they wouldn't want to set up a place of
pilgrimage for neo-Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Laid out inside Gatsby's plush galleries, near four Picasso
masterpieces also up for sale, the silver gleamed, and the initials
``AH'' screamed out from the Nazi eagle-and-swastika emblem.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes a set of small lobster forks, coffeepots
and teapots, sandwich plates, a martini shaker, a humidor, a
toothpick cannister, a cigarette box and a matchbox cover complete
with a paper-and-pine match box inside. The set includes sundry
containers and dozens of forks, spoons, and knives.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Wellman, director of the Center for Ethics at Georgia State
University, said he could understand a family's need to sell such
artifacts. ``Who are we to say you can't capitalize on something
that's going to make a real difference in your life?''
</P>
<P>
   But he maintained the impact of the auction on Jews and others
should have been taken into consideration. ``We can't just say,
`It's my right, and it doesn't matter if you get upset about it,'''
Wellman said.
</P>
<P>
   And many are upset. Herbert Kohn, 73, lost many relatives to
Hitler's death camps. He escaped Germany, joined the Army and
returned to his native land to fight the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even stand to look at a Mercedes Benz,'' said Kohn.
``This should have been smelted and the silver used for some good
purpose. It bothers me that his initials are on it. That makes it
personal. Makes me remember when I was 6, in 1933, and they kicked
me out of school. They arrested my father, who had been decorated
as a hero in World War I fighting for Germany. History needs to be
known, but not glorified, and this auction glorifies Hitler.'' The
folks at Great Gatsby's say they don't see why selling Hitler's
personal items is so controversial.
</P>
<P>
   The same online auction also offers a Rolls Royce owned by Barry
Gibbs of the rock group Bee Gees and a 16 mm master print of the
Beatles movie ``Let It Be.'' Kowalik would prefer that people do
that about the controversy _ let it be.

   According to a recent study by the American Pet Products
Manufacturers, two-thirds of America's pet owners buy gifts for
them, whether it's a catnip mouse, designer collar (Chanel and
Coach have them), or a special bed. If you're leaning to the
latter, check out the soft wool slipper cat bed by English designer
Sheila Parness, priced at $150. It's available in the the Neiman
Marcus By Mail pet catalog, along with other custom beds, plus
jewelry, dishes and leather jackets for your four-legged friends.
To order, call (800) 825-8000. &QL;

   It's the stand mixer used by Julia and Emeril and all the
superstar chefs, and this KitchenAid mixer includes a Master Cook
CD-ROM (valued at $24.99, available by mail-in rebate) to provide
you with recipes for use with your new kitchen tool.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $189.99 at Best Buy, this version of the KitchenAid
comes with beater, dough hook and whip attachments, powered by a
250-watt motor with 10 beating speeds. A 4{-quart metal bowl comes
with it. &QL;

<P>
   Kinko's probably isn't the first place you think of when you
make your holiday gift list, but the company does offer more than
24-hour photocopying service for those last-minute tax return
filers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the usual photo greeting cards and calendars, you
can turn a photo into the cover of a thick, spiral-bound memo pad,
or put your favorite photos or kids' drawings onto laminated
bookmarks, placemats or luggage tags, all for less than $10.
</P>

   Gift services are available at Kinko's stores throughout Los
Angeles and Ventura counties. &QL;

   So you know a child who wants to be just like Mom and Dad,
fixing things up around the house? Give something both authentic
and practical: a kid-size tool belt that'll help Timmy or Tammy the
Tool Kid get the job done. The Little Rig Kids Tool Belt by
Portable Products features a single pouch plus two hammer holder
loops and multiple pockets made of durable fabric. The belt fits
18- to 30-inch waists. Suggested retail price: $7.99. Call (800)
688-2677 to find a store near you or to have a catalog sent to you.

   &UR; AGATE COPY: &LR;  There's not much tastier _ or healthier _ than
perfectly steamed rice and vegetables. The trick is getting it
right. The National Fuzzy Logic Rice Cooker uses computer timing to
produce ``perfectly cooked cups of rice every time.'' It also
serves as a vegetable steamer. The cooker sells for $199 at
Williams-Sonoma in the Glendale Galleria. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   For someone with heavy-duty carpet cleaning needs, Dirt Devil's
new lightweight Easy Steamer, with an 8-foot hose to reach up
stairs, might make the job easier. Three motors give it enough
power to clean an entire house, and a switch turns off the
revolving brush to allow the vacuum to dry the carpet after
cleaning. It sells for $149.99 at major discount and appliance
stores. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   It's just the thing for the on-the-go home do-it-yourselfer: A
bucket outfitted with all the tools you need. Several companies
make variations of the same handy idea, but one of the smartest
designs is McGuire-Nicholas' Rolling Bucket Tool Caddy, a bucket
with pockets for tools, plus a convenient retractable handle and
wheels that make hauling the tools around the yard a cinch. You'll
find it at Home Depot for $34.96. &QL; 
_ Betty Kwong
</P>
<P>
   You can bring the soothing sound of running water to your home
or office with Homedics Body Basics EnviraScape Rock Garden, which
tumbles recirculated water over water-smoothed pebbles. Two
horizontal designs are available, one with a wooden-box base, the
other with a round ceramic base, and one vertical model in which
water trickles down a carved ``wall'' onto a wooden box of pebbles
below. All three models are available at KMart for $39.99. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   For fun in the garden, Greenthumb Nursery in Canoga Park has a
wide choice of sundials _ one thing guaranteed not to break down
when the clock strikes midnight on Dec. 31. Dinner plate-size
sundials in verdigris finish sport Roman numerals and fancy
filagree reminiscent of European and American sundials from the
17th through the 19th centuries. Prices range from $39.99 to
$42.99; pedestals for them to stand on are extra, from $39.99 to
$59.99. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A good soak in the tub can wash away a day of tension. But
wouldn't it be even better to soak in a Jacuzzi? OK, so most folks
can't afford a $5,000 tub, but there is an option _ the Conair Body
Benefits Water Jet Bath Spa. This pump converts tubs into a
bubbling, swirling bath that comes up just short of a real Jacuzzi.
The spa costs $49.99 at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Toss in a BetterBath
three-way bath pillow ($5.99), which can be filled with hot or cold
water or air, depending on the bather's mood. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   If you like fresh bread, there are two new breadmakers available
at local appliance and electronics stores. The Oster 2-Pound Oval
58-Minute Breadmaker ($69.99) bakes a horizontal 1.5- or 2-pound
loaf, has 18 settings (including selecting the color of the crust
you want). The Toastmaster 2-Pound Horizontal Breadmaker ($59.99)
makes a 2-pound loaf, has settings for whole wheat, French and
sweet breads, and has a rapid-bake setting that will produce bread
in as little as 2{ hours. &QL;

   Too often, home improvements come to a halt when battery-powered
tools run out of juice. Enter Skil, which is marketing new
Dual-Source tools that run both on batteries and household current.
The tool line includes 9.6-, 12- and 14.4-volt drill/screwdrivers
(priced at $90, $110 and $130, respectively). There are also 9.6-
and 12-volt three-tool combination kits ($130 and $150,
respectively) that include drill/driver, flashlight and a
high-pressure air gun/inflator. Available at hardware and home
improvement stores. &QL;

   COMPUTER-FUNDING _ (Los Angeles) L.A. Unified officials, after
losing out on $50 million in federal funds last year, acknowledged
Thursday that they are rushing and not confident they will make
this year's Dec. 23 deadline for E-rate monies to wire classrooms
for computers. This year, the district is eligible for $250

sniffing around for a little fear. ``Oh how cute,'' a girl said,
breaking the tension among the students who didn't know what to

   BOWLING-SENIOR _ (Los Angeles) Flo Scorpio walks into a bowling
alley the way Frank Sinatra used to walk onto a stage or Babe Ruth

ball, shakes her arms a little to get loose, lines up her shot, and
takes a three-step approach to the foul line, letting the ball go.
All the pins go flying except one. The ten pin. If looks could
kill, the ten pin would be dead. ``Should'a been a strike,''
97-year-old Flo Scorpio says to the bowling gods. ``I look at Flo
and think to myself, heck, I've got another 25 years of bowling
left,'' laughs Liz Rogers, president of the 4,000 member San

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A billboard labeled ``Countdown to History''
looms over the Hollywood Park winner's circle these days, bearing
the career victory totals for Bill Shoemaker (8,833) and Laffit
Pincay (8,818 and counting).
</P>
<P>
   Each time Pincay wins a race, he strides to the board and hangs
a new number beside his name as a track photographer snaps his
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park and Santa Anita are having contests promising an
$8,834 prize to a fan who predicts the day and race when Pincay
passes Shoemaker. Further promotions revolving around Pincay's
record pursuit are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting exciting, especially on days like Wednesday, when
it seemed like old times, with the Panamanian riding in seven races
and winning three, the last by a neck in classic Pincay Power Play
style.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for ``the great man,'' as track announcer Michael
Wrona referred to Pincay in a plug for the contest between races
Thursday, it's as close to business as usual as he and his agent
can make it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, with Pincay 15 wins from tying Shoemaker, trainers and
owners aren't lining up to book his services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't changed at all,'' said agent Bob Meldahl, who has
booked Pincay's mounts since 1991. ``Nobody's expressed, `I'm going
to put you on all these 8-5 shots.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it'll change when he gets to seven or eight (from the
record).''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, people might be angling to have Pincay ride
!ital!their!off! horse to the record.
</P>
<P>
   But if it doesn't happen that way _ if his winning opportunities
don't increase in the next few weeks _ it appears that will be all
right with Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope I don't ride seven, eight horses a day. It's too
demanding,'' Pincay said after his triple on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The only luxury in riding a full card is that Pincay could eat
100 more calories at dinner that night.
</P>
<P>
   At 52, living on 750 calories a day to maintain his 117-pound
riding weight, Pincay feels stronger riding four or five a day.
</P>
<P>
   Often, he rides fewer than that because fields at Hollywood Park
are typically small, and competition for mounts is as keen as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep it to three or four (a day),'' Meldahl said
in the Hollywood Park racing office Thursday morning. ``He's
fresher.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without extra chances, Pincay is riding as well as he has
in years. He has passed the 140-win mark in 1999, already his best
season since '95.
</P>
<P>
   If he kept winning at the rate that put him third in the jockey
standings at the Oak Tree meet, the countdown to history would end
Wednesday, Dec. 29, at Santa Anita. That happens to be Pincay's
birthday _ the day he has said he'd like to do it.
</P>
<P>
   If he kept winning at his 1999 pace, he'd get the record on
Friday, Dec. 31, the fifth day of the Santa Anita season. Then
Pincay might have to allow himself half a glass of champagne that
night.
</P>
<P>
   If he kept winning at his recent pace _ 15 victories in the past
12 racing days, including one Thursday _ he would blow past
Shoemaker on Sunday, Dec. 5. That's practically impossible, though,
because Pincay is scheduled to be in Panama Dec. 2-5 to be honored
at a Latin American jockeys' competition.
</P>
<P>
   Meldahl said a couple of out-of-town stakes assignments later in
December are possible as well. Although a win is a win wherever it
happens, such trips could slow him down simply by reducing his
number of mounts.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Pincay might be helped along if, as usual,
other veteran riders take vacations in December.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's asking for help. Business as usual has always been
good enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest with you, I don't think Laffit would
want it any other way,'' Meldahl said. ``He wants trainers to give
him good horses. But he's never in his life asked for anything
special, and he doesn't expect it now.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend: Trainer Bob Baffert, going for his fourth
Hollywood Prevue Stakes victory in a row, will have Cameron Pass
(David Flores riding) and Magical Dragon (Chris McCarron) in the
7-furlong race for 2-year-olds on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert won the race with In Excessive Bull, Commitisize and
Premier Property.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Cenicola-trained Joopy Doopy (Victor Espinoza) is the
likely favorite after going 6 furlongs in 1:08 4/5 to win the Sunny
Slope Stakes at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   The Grade III Prevue, a prep for the Dec. 18 Hollywood Futurity,
is the first of 14 graded stakes on the Hollywood Park schedule.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After bowing to an objection by Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, the House passed a hard-fought bill Thursday that would
give satellite television companies the right to broadcast local
channels, assuring that cable companies will soon have competition.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, part of a huge spending package, is now before the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill cuts through much of the current static that has so
confused and frustrated millions of home satellite viewers,'' said
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who helped push the legislation. ``For
the first time ever, it will usher in an era of head-to-head
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is expected to be signed by President Clinton,
preparing the way for viewers in New York and Los Angeles to begin
receiving local programs on their dishes almost immediately. Once
the legislation is approved, satellite dish owners in other cities
should be able to tune into NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox within six
months. In all, 10 million households own satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Christmas this year, consumers across the nation will have
a real choice,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., who heads the
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of tinkering and compromise, the
legislation nearly lost its footing in the Senate over one
provision.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who is known for his parliamentary savvy, threatened a
filibuster when he discovered that his colleagues had inserted a
provision to extend loan guarantees of $1.25 billion to satellite
companies as an incentive to serve rural viewers. The companies say
it is too expensive to launch satellites to reach sparsely
populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise was struck Thursday morning, and the final bill was
resubmitted to the House without the contentious measure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, agreed that the
Senate would take up the issue again no later than April 1, which
appeased lawmakers from largely rural states.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give satellite companies a six-month grace period
to work out agreements with the networks, and would legally allow
them to broadcast local channels to all viewers. After six months,
deals must be in hand for satellite companies to continue carrying
the channels. The legislation also requires that by 2002 those
satellite companies that carry some local stations must carry all
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Armand Musey, an analyst at Banc of America Securities,
estimated that local stations would charge satellite broadcasters
several times as much as they do cable stations, because satellite
systems have a lower market share. ``A local broadcaster has to be
on the local cable system, or they don't have any audience,'' he
said. Still, he said, because the satellite companies will offer
only a handful of local stations in each city, they will be able to
charge an additional $5 a month and still make a good profit.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kaimowitz, an analyst at ING Barings, said the satellite
companies would want to offer local stations inexpensively because
it is a service intended to attract new customers. And
broadcasters, he said, will want their channels carried on
satellite because satellite subscribers tend to be the young and
well-off viewers that advertisers seek.
</P>
<P>
   He said that about 30 percent to 40 percent of satellite
subscribers also subscribed to cable television, mainly to get
local channels. Some will now drop cable, saving about $15 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The small but growing satellite dish industry has spent three
years lobbying lawmakers to change a law that prevents them from
offering subscribers local programming. The law, company executives
argued, was seriously undercutting their ability to compete with
cable, which serves 70 million households, mostly because
subscribers did not want to give up local programs or settle for
fuzzy reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an impediment for people to subscribe to satellite
channels,'' said Bob Marsocci, a spokesman for DirecTV, the
dominant satellite company. ``They walk into a store and find out
they can't get local TV, and they walk out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill was ultimately supported by the cable industry
and broadcasters, officials for one satellite company, Echostar
Communications, objected, saying the bill favored DirecTV, which is
owned by General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Watson, a lobbyist for Echostar, said the bill did not
give smaller companies the leverage to secure reasonable
retransmission contracts from the networks. This, she argued, could
discourage start-up companies from getting into the business and
would dilute competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to pay more than cable pays, we are going to have
to pass that on to the consumer,'' Ms. Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   It is an argument backed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the
chairman of the Commerce Committee. McCain called the bill
anti-competitive for failing to protect satellite companies from
lopsided agreements that he said could still benefit cable
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But executives for the National Broadcast Association and
senators from both parties discounted that theory.

BAD CALL? JUST ASK WILLIAMS

   Pedro was robbed. For our Spanish-speaking readers, Pedro fue
robado.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dominating American League batters like no pitcher in
the last half-century, Red Sox righty Pedro Martinez Thursday
finished second to Texas catcher Pudge Rodriguez in voting for the
American League's Most Valuable Player award.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is a worthy choice, as were Roberto Alomar, Manny
Ramirez, Rafael Palmeiro, Derek Jeter, and Nomar Garciaparra, but
it appears Pedro failed to finish first because of irrational bias
some voters have against pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 28 voters (George King of the New York Post and
LaVelle Neal of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune) failed to list Pedro
among the top 10 on their ballots. If both writers had picked him
as high as fourth, Pedro would have won the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's horseshit,'' said Ted Williams when he heard
the news that Pedro's name was omitted from two ballots. ``What
game were those guys watching? You're always disappointed when that
happens. I know. I went through it as much as any player.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an understatement. For Ted, every MVP vote was a
nail-biting, smoke-filled-room, Cook County experience. Williams
was a two-time American League MVP, but he failed to win the award
when he hit .406 in 1941, and in both seasons in which he won the
triple crown. He also failed to win when he hit .388 at the age of
39 in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always other things to consider,'' said Ted. ``In a
few years, I thought I should have won. In '41, I hit .400 and I
thought that was pretty good, but DiMaggio hit in 56 straight
games, so I never felt bad about that one. But there were others.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams lost to DiMaggio by a count of 202-201 in 1947 (a
Triple Crown year for Ted), Williams failed to appear on the top
ten of one ballot. Boston baseball folklore holds that Ted got
jobbed by an ancient nemesis, the late Mel Webb of the Globe.
Research by historian Glenn Stout contradicts the charge. According
to Stout, who dug deep into the files of the late Harold Kaese of
the Globe, all three Boston voters placed Williams first in '47 and
Webb did not vote. Kaese contended it was a Midwestern scribe _
perhaps the grandfather of Minneapolis's clueless LaVelle Neal _
who omitted Ted.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette spoke with Pedro via
conference call after the voting results were released. The Duke
cited the snubs of Williams from a half century ago, telling
Martinez, ``You're in good company with great Red Sox players.''
</P>
<P>
   Elections like Thursday's assure that the sportswriting
fraternity forever will be tarnished by petty nitwits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Max Nichols of the Minneapolis Star (what is it with
the Twin Cities, anyway?) voted for Cesar Tovar as American League
MVP _ just to make sure Carl Yastrzemski would not be unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Several baseball writers failed to vote for Willie Mays when he
first become eligible for the Hall of Fame in 1979. To a lesser
degree, this happens every year. You can't get two dozen writers to
unanimously agree that today is Friday. Many Hall voters believe no
player is worthy of ``first-ballot'' induction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' said Ted, the voice of experience. ``You get
writers that don't see one guy play as much. Somebody's got a
favorite, but maybe they got a grudge. There was that guy who
wouldn't vote for me and I felt badly about it. I know the kid from
Texas is a helluva player, but boy, I think our pitcher was
absolutely phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro added: ``What the reporters do is not my business. I don't
understand that area. The system was there before I got to the big
leagues. I don't think I'll be the one to switch it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no disgrace in naming Rodriguez, although it's
interesting that both Texas voters had Rafael Palmeiro first and
picked Pudge no better than fifth. But it's crazy to believe Pedro
doesn't belong in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   And please, you head-in-sand purists, let's not have any
rhetoric about pitchers having their own award and not being
eligible. There are awards for pitchers, fielders, hitters, and
other specific baseball functions. MVP is for everybody. A Rookie
of the Year has his own award, but can still be MVP. A goalie who
wins the Vezina Trophy in the NHL can be MVP. If Miss Ohio cops the
congeniality award, that doesn't prohibit her from becoming Miss
America. All players are eligible for MVP, and if voters are going
to invoke their own rules and exclude part of the baseball
population from consideration, those voters should send their
ballots to people who are more open-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there should be discrimination,'' said Martinez.
``Otherwise, change the name of the MVP to `Regular Player Award.'
We're all players. We qualify as players. What would they do
without pitching?''
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination, one form or another, has cost the Sox another
MVP Award. In 1947, personal pettiness was used against Williams
because he was not a helpful interview. Now Pedro is punished
because he doesn't play every day.
</P>
<P>
   Two writers decided they would not consider Martinez no matter
what he did on the field. The worthy catcher from Texas did not
have to overcome the same obstacle. Pedro fue robado.

US AGENTS CONTINUE PROBE OF CO-PILOT IN PLANE'S FATAL DIVE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Egyptian officials arrived here to examine and
help interpreting the final remarks made by two of that country's
most veteran pilots, FBI agents continued to gather information on
co-pilot Gamil El Batouty, the man suspected of putting EgyptAir
Flight 990 into a dive from which it could not recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything indicates it was him, but there has to by a why, a
motive, and nothing jumps out,'' said a source familiar with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Agents were believed to be interviewing everyone who knew
Batouty. He spent much time in Southern California, where his
10-year-old daughter was undergoing medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Egyptian officials who arrived here Thursday _
included senior security staff and technical experts _ began
preparing what the National Transportation Safety Board described
as a ``literal, factual transcript'' of the cockpit voice recorder.
That task was expected to take several days.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo-bound Boeing 767-300ER had taken off from New York's
John F. Kennedy International Airport on Oct. 31 and was 30 minutes
into the 11-hour flight when it suddenly began a steep, controlled
descent from 33,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the harrowing roller-coaster ride came to an end
when the jet broke apart and smashed into the Atlantic Ocean about
60 miles south of Nantucket, killing all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty, a veteran pilot who was not scheduled to fly the
airplane for several more hours, had received permission to do so
and was alone in the cockpit when the dive began.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the cockpit voice recorder captures in Arabic what
apparently is a prayer: ``I made my decision now. I put my faith in
God's hands.'' The voice is believed to be Batouty's.
</P>
<P>
   The jet's flight data recorder shows the autopilot was
disconnected, and eight seconds later the plane went into its death
dive.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence gathered from the flight data and cockpit voice
plane's recorders _ the two ``black boxes'' _ points to a cockpit
struggle for control of the doomed jet.
</P>
<P>
   One voice, believed to be that of Captain Ahmed El Habashi, the
pilot is heard exclaiming, ``What's going on?'' Within seconds, he
urged the co-pilot to ``Pull with me! Help me! Pull with me!''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that remark refers to Habashi's attempt to
bring the plane out of the dive by pulling back on one of the twin
yokes in the cockpit. The theory is bolstered by the unusual
position of the plane's elevators, flaps on the rear section of the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The left one, on the pilot's side, was pointed up _ something
that would give the plane lift. But the right one, on the
co-pilot's side, was pointed down, the position for a dive.
</P>
<P>
   Further troubling is data indicating the speed brake _ flaps on
the wing which increase the rate of descent and make it harder for
the plane to climb _ had been deployed. The speed brake handle is
located on the pilot's side of the aisle console, but could be
reached easily by either pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Within 35 seconds of the auto-pilot's disconnection, as the
plane hurtled earthward at speeds that exceeded its design, data
shows the twin engines were both shut down. About 14 seconds later,
the plane's transponder stopped working and its two black boxes
shut off.
</P>
<P>
   While some have speculated the engine shutdown may have been a
gross error, or a preparation for an emergency water landing, one
aviation source familiar with the investigation discounted that.
The source also noted that cutting engine power is a deliberate,
two-step action that could have put the jet in more peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the those speeds, it would have been impossible to relight
the engines and the only reason to shut them down is to crash the
airplane,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources said it is likely the other members of the flight
crew, seated in First Class, could not have gotten to the cockpit
to assist because the dive was so steep it caused a sense of
weightlessness inside the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators have not ruled out mechanical failure as the
cause of the crash, there have been no indications of that yet. If
the theory that Batouty was responsible holds, then the FBI will
take over the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday he expected a
decision within days on whether the bureau will assume full control
of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any decisions are going to take an extended
period of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While US officials were cooperating with Egyptian officials,
Holder said, they were not allowing them to block progress of the
inquiry. ``The investigation has not in any way been put at risk,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seek to work with the Egyptian government and try to
maintain this partnership that we have formed,'' he said. But if
the crash was an act of terrorism, ``our law would cover that
sitation and give the United States government jurisdiction in that
matter, and the FBI would likely be the investigative agency,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, agents would face the daunting task of
trying to determine the motives of the veteran military and
civilian pilot. Friends and relatives have described as a contented
man with five children, including 10-year-old Aya who was being
treated for lupus in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might make sense if the daughter's condition was worsening,
but she was getting better,'' said Vince Cannistraro, former head
of counter terrorism at the CIA. ``Secondly, if the medical bills
were overwhelming that could be a reason, but he comes from a
fairly well-to-do family and the bills were not that onerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he'd spent years at the airline, Batouty, 59, and facing
retirement in March, could have been disappointed that his company,
state-run EgyptAir, had never promoting him to Captain. Family
members have said Batouty was not unhappy with his airline career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened in the US, we wouldn't think twice about it,
we'd just say the guy went postal,'' said Cannistraro.
</P>
<P>
   But because suicide is so unusual in Egypt, the act of
deliberately downing the jet would seem even more baffling.
</P>
<P>
   Both Holder and State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin warned
against a ``rush to judgment'' about the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said ``wild conspiracy theories'' by the Arab media and
``speculative conclusions'' in the American press would only
heighten tensions on both sides of the Atlantic. Though he insisted
relations between the two countries remain stable, he issued a plea
for calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have confidence that Egypt and the United States will
work together on this investigation,'' Rubin said. ``Our long and
close friendship will not be harmed because we have confidence that
the Egyptian government, like the United States government, wants
to get to the bottom of this crash and find out what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   As the diplomatic efforts continued, the search for human
remains, and efforts to locate the jet's cockpit, continued in the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The salvage ship Carolyn Chouest Thursday resumed the search
that had been postponed earlier in the week because of rough seas.
It is expected to be joined by a 520-foot ship used to install oil
rigs, is expected to arrive on scene early next month. The Smit
Pioneer, working under contract with the US Navy, will lead the
salvage effort.

HERB KOHL: SHY SENATOR UNCHARACTERISTICALLY STANDS ON THE
BARRICADES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)  (With SPEND-CONGRESS) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Herb Kohl hardly resembles the prototypical
senator.
</P>
<P>
   He displays not a smidge of pomposity, pretension or bombast. He
is rather shy and shuns the spotlight, and on the few occasions
when he speaks out, he talks softly and tends to look at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the wealthiest members of Congress. But he lives
simply, has never married and prefers old blazers to designer
suits.
</P>
<P>
   A short, thin, 64-year-old bald man, he is rarely recognized by
tourists here. He usually eats lunch alone in the public restaurant
in the Capitol rather than in the senators' private dining room
where backs are slapped and deals are cut.
</P>
<P>
   In his 11 years in the Senate as a Democrat from Wisconsin, he
has hardly ever made news.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday night, Kohl, objecting to a milk-price feature
of the final spending bill of the year, announced that he would do
everything in his power to obstruct and delay the adjournment of
the Senate for as long as possible unless he received concessions
on the dairy issue. This could keep the Senate in session through
the weekend, if not longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody uses whatever leverage they have, and part of the
leverage I have is the discomfort I can bring to bear,'' Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes this is out of character. ``This is very much unlike
me,'' he said in an interview on Thursday afternoon. He went on:
``I hate it. I don't like to be a pain. I've never been an
obstructionist before. But if this is what it takes, this is what
I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Kohl was born in Milwaukee on Feb. 7, 1935, the child of
Jews who immigrated from Eastern Europe in the 1920s. His father
opened a grocery store in Milwaukee that grew into a supermarket
chain and eventually expanded into department stores. As an adult,
Herb Kohl ran the business, which bore the family name, and by the
time he sold out in 1979, Kohl's dominated the market in the
Milwaukee area.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, when the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team was
threatening to move to another city, Kohl bought the franchise and
kept it in Milwaukee. He still owns the team.
</P>
<P>
   With a fortune estimated at more than $250 million, Kohl
financed almost entirely out of his own pocket his race for the
Senate in 1988, his first foray into politics, and his re-election
campaign in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Each campaign cost him about $7 million. He made it sound
virtuous that he was not raising money from others, using the
slogan, ``Nobody's senator but yours.'' So far, he has no serious
opposition for re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl presents his case for tying up the Senate as a matter of
principle. Under pressure from lawmakers from the East,
congressional leaders stuck a section in the final spending bill
that would prevent the Agriculture Department from putting a new
milk pricing system into effect and would allow the New England
states to maintain a cartel that keeps the price of milk there
artificially high and keeps out milk from other states. This would
work to the disadvantage of dairy farmers in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl complains that no vote was allowed on the dairy matter. He
maintains it is wrong to effectively bar the product from one state
from being sold in another. And he says one of his obligations is
to defend the more than 20,000 dairy farmers in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not just a national senator,'' he said. ``I am a senator
from Wisconsin.''
</P>
<P>
   But in talking with Kohl, it is clear that there is another
reason he is being obstreperous. He may not know the vernacular,
but he obviously feels he has been dissed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he said, a Democratic leader berated him for
inconveniencing other senators. ``I didn't like the fact he was
upset with me,'' Kohl said. ``But then I decided the hell with him.
He's got a different interest. He just wants to keep the train on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then on Thursday morning, he said, he met with Sen. Trent Lott
of Mississippi, the Republican leader, and Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas, an especially aggressive Republican combatant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was particularly upset,'' Kohl said. He continued: ``They
didn't offer me anything. They made it clear they just wanted to
get this thing over as quickly as possible so senators would know
when they were going to have a vote and when they could get a plane
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl understands that he hardly brings to mind Horatius, the
legendary Roman hero who stood at the bridge over the Tiber and
almost single-handedly defended his city from an Etruscan invasion.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that the issue he is taking his stand on is not
one of war and peace or life and death. On those matters, he said,
``you have other senators who are out front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's an issue,'' he said, ``where I'm out front or no one
else will be.''

SLOW-MOVING LENNY WREAKS HAVOC ON ISLANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ Hurricane Lenny stubbornly hovered between St.
Maarten and St. Croix for most of Thursday, battering both islands
with 130-mph winds, sending rooftops flying, washing out roads, and
knocking out power and telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   While the storm lashed at the region, the extent of the damage
remained unclear as emergency and rescue officials could not get to
either island because of dangerous flying conditions. Instead, they
relied on reports from islanders who surveyed the damage once the
worst of the storm had passed.
</P>
<P>
   From those initial reports, Lenny did not appear to cause major
destruction. One man died on St. Maarten when his car flipped over,
and another was missing on St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a reported death on St. Croix, but a Federal
Emergency Management Agency official said the agency could not
confirm if the death was storm-related.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, in St. Lucia's tourism capital of Soufriere,
20-foot waves washed away 40 homes, leaving the families that lived
in them homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, officials said it could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, people were prepared,'' said Carol
Hector-Harris, spokeswoman for FEMA Region 2, which includes the
Virgin Islands. ``That's why you don't have lots of deaths. People
are used to storms here. They know the drill.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenny struck just near the end of the hurricane season, which
officially concludes in 11 days. Though meteorologists tracked its
path and were not surprised by it, ``the intensification came
rather quickly,'' said Ed Tirado of the National Weather Service in
San Juan. At 1 p.m. Thursday, winds whipped at 135 miles an hour.
By the end of the day, they had calmed slightly to 120 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Tirado said the storm was drifting East-Northeast, and by
Saturday should be well north of the Caribbean Island chains.
</P>
<P>
   Friday FEMA officials plan to tour St. Croix to assess the
damage and begin the processes of offering aid for those who might
have lost their homes. They will also coordinate with other
agencies to make sure that families that don't have running water
get bottled water, and utilities are working to restore power on
the island.
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix Governor Charles Turnbull has asked President Clinton
to declare the island a disaster area, making it eligible for
federal disaster aid. The hurricane is a major blow to the
territory, which has a $1 billion debt and still owes $8 million
for federal disaster loans from Hurricane Marilyn and Hurricane
Hugo in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, tropical storms move in a westerly direction, but Lenny
defied that pattern. Wednesday, it seemed to be heading toward
Puerto Rico, but then it shifted away, heading east. That prompted
Puerto Ricans to call Lenny ``zurdo,'' Spanish for southpaw, or
``lefty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were saved,'' said Izzy Jimenez, wearing a Yankees cap as
he strutted through Luis Munoz Marin Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy rains caused several rivers near the pueblos of
Arecibo, Barcelonetta, and Vega Alta to overflow. Residents worried
that continued rains might cause mudslides. In San Juan, one man
who was storm-proofing his house died when he fell off a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Croix, an island of 50,000 residents, Lenny ripped part
of the Ann Abraham Pier in Frederiksted, a cruise ship dock that
was rebuilt after 1989's Hurricane Hugo turned it into shreds.
Lenny ripped planks off a fish pier, partially destroyed the roof
of the King Christian Hotel and the headquarters of the National
Guard, and smashed more than 50 small sailboats near Christiansted.
</P>
<P>
   It broke windows and caused ceilings to collapse in the Paradise
Mills housing project. Heavy rains caused several roads _ including
Queens Cross Street _ to buckle. Several roads were washed out near
Frederiksted.
</P>
<P>
   More than 420 people stayed in shelters overnight in St. Croix,
Hector-Harris said. By the end of the day, a curfew had been lifted
and most had returned home.
</P>
<P>
   On the island shared by St. Martin, a French territory, and St.
Maarten, which is Dutch, the storm caused similar damage. But
details were sketchy. The US State Department's Caribbean division
had not been in contact with officials on the island, and Thursday
phone lines on the island were down.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Thomas, another of the US Virgin Islands, about 115
people stayed in shelters Thursday, Hector-Harris said, but there
were no reports of destroyed homes.
</P>
<P>
   Hector-Harris said Thursday morning that as she walked around
her hotel on the eastern end of St. Thomas, she could feel Lenny's
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hellacious,'' she said. ``I was in a huge concrete
building and I felt it shaking. And you could hear the storm at sea
... it's like a whole bunch of trains in a freight yard going at
once.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Four nations in the Caspian Sea region took a
giant step Thursday toward embracing one of President Clinton's
cherished foreign policy projects, a pipeline that would assure
Western control over the region's vast oil and natural gas
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony in Istanbul, the presidents of Georgia,
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkey agreed to support construction of
an oil pipeline that would bring Caspian oil to ports in the West
on a route that does not pass through Russia or Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of this pipeline, estimated at $2.4 billion, would
give the United States and other Western countries access to an
important new source of energy. But the main significance was that
it would draw the new nations near the Caspian, which were part of
the Soviet Union only a decade ago, away from Russia and give the
United States greater influence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was signed Thursday during a summit meeting of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Only hours
earlier, in the main summit hall, Clinton and other Western leaders
had faced off against Russian President Boris Yeltsin over the
conflict in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   They were unable to persuade Yeltsin to end his war against
Chechen separatists, but their success in engineering the pipeline
accord could eventually prove to have far greater significance in
weakening Russia's hold over the volatile Caucasus and Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major foreign policy victory,'' Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson said after the signing. ``It is a strategic
agreement that advances America's national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no official reaction from the Russian government.
Thursday's accord does not guarantee that the pipeline to the West
will be built. Any pipeline would have to be paid for by oil
companies and their partners, led by BP Amoco PLC, the
Anglo-American energy company, and they have warned that they will
make their decision based on commercial rather than political
considerations. With Thursday's agreement, oil company executives
said they would now begin trying to arrange financing for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much oil lies beneath the Caspian and in its
surrounding lands is subject to some debate. Oil experts say there
is probably at least as much oil as in the North Sea fields and
possibly as much as half of the reserves under Saudi Arabia. Still,
the uncertainty has made it difficult to arrange financing for
pipelines in a volatile region.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the United States has been courting the
leaders of Caspian nations, telling them that their future lies not
with Russia or Iran but with the West. Thursday's accord suggests
that they agree.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline that the United States supports would begin in
Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, cross Georgia and Turkey, and end at
Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. From there, Caspian oil
would be pumped onto tankers and shipped to Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   In order to assure that there will be enough oil to fill the
pipeline, American negotiators have been pressing Kazakhstan, which
lies on the opposite side of the Caspian, to ship its oil and gas
to Baku through an undersea link.
</P>
<P>
   John S. Wolf, the chief U.S. envoy to the Caspian region,
predicted that construction of the pipeline could begin in 2001,
and that oil would begin flowing through it ``by the first quarter
of 2004,'' a crucial date in the minds of some oil companies in the
region. They believe that increased amounts of oil will be produced
in the Caspian by then, and that unless the new pipeline is
completed, there will be insufficient means to transport it to
market.
</P>
<P>
   For now, much of the oil moves by ship through the narrow
Bosporus and by some existing pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said Turkey had guaranteed that building the Turkish
segment of the pipeline, which is by far the longest, would cost
the companies no more than $1.4 billion. If it costs more, Wolf
said, the Turkish government will assume the liability.
</P>
<P>
   Outside powers have been waging an intense political battle for
control of Caspian energy resources and the political influence
that those resources represent. All agree that the battle is not
simply about oil and gas, but will shape the future of one of the
world's most turbulent regions.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has dominated the Caspian region for more than a century,
and considers it part of its natural sphere of influence.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, which is also competing for a decisive role in the region,
has deep historic and ethnic ties to Azerbaijan, where the Caspian
energy boom is centered. It offers what is probably the cheapest
alternative for a pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Many oil executives prefer that route, but U.S. sanctions
against Iran make it all but impossible to build, at least for the
time being. Some executives noted, however, they might be able to
wait for the possibility that the sanctions might be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Russia offered a third alternative route from Baku, but it
passes through Chechnya and is considered unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the region have often expressed their preference for
the Baku-Ceyhan route, and have signed several agreements to build
it. Thursday's accord, however, seemed more substantial than the
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is a real step forward,'' said a Western diplomat
posted in Baku who was skeptical of past declarations. ``The big
difference is that now, the Turks really seem to have guaranteed
the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Townshend, director of international affairs at BP
Amoco, said Thursday's agreement ``actually cemented the terms so
we could now go and take it to interested parties to see if they
want to invest in it.'' In addition to the American and European
companies involved in this pipeline, he said, other energy
companies working in the region would be approached, including
Chevron, Texaco and Mobil, for financial backing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Outsiders from Genghis Khan to Tamerlane to Hitler have waged
war to control the region around the Caspian. The more recent
attraction has been the huge energy potential both under the
Caspian Sea and around it. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the region has appeared to float freely, its leaders anxious for
ties to the West but fearing the consequences of breaking from
their longtime masters in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The accord signed Thursday was accompanied by an
``intergovernmental declaration'' of intent to build a second major
pipeline. It would bring the enormous gas resources of Turkmenistan
to gas-starved Turkey through a pipeline that would be laid under
the Caspian to Baku.
</P>
<P>
   From there it would follow a route roughly parallel to the
Baku-Ceyhan pipeline through Georgia, and then into some
unspecified point in Turkey. If both this line and the oil line
from Baku to Ceyhan are built, the West will have won control over
the key resource of Central Asia and the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   This control would not be without risk. All three of the
energy-rich nations around the Caspian _ Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and
Turkmenistan _ are ruled by autocratic former Communists. All are
crippled by spectacular corruption and a rapidly expanding gap
between rich and poor. None has passed laws to assure that some of
their expected oil wealth will reach their poor and expectant
masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was signed today is only a step forward if it can be
converted into something real, and it's not at all clear that it
can be converted fast enough to make difference in these states,''
Martha Brill Olcott, an American scholar who is a leading expert on
the Caucasus and Central Asia, said in a telephone interview from
Washington. ``It's a sign of activity, but you have to ask whether
it will make these states more stable, or even whether these states
will still exist in a few years as they do today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These regimes will have to deal with crises of succession and
popular expectation long before the big oil money starts flowing,
and that's not even taking the threat of Islamic fundamentalism
into consideration.,'' Ms. Olcott said. ``We're talking about four
or five years down the line, which is half the lifetime of these
states.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important first step, and of course it's better to
have a plan than not to have a plan. But Chechnya is just the
beginning of what we're going to face in this region. Russia is not
going to sit back quietly as, from its perspective, the United
States tries to undermine its vital strategic interests there.''

CAMPBELL ANNOUNCES SENATE BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vowing to limit the role of the federal government,
Rep. Tom Campbell announced Thursday night that he would challenge
incumbent Dianne Feinstein next year for the U.S. Senate seat from
California.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a Republican representing San Jose, said in a
statement that if elected, he would fight to send power and money
to state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the federal government to constrict our freedom less,
in our personal lives, our work, and our schools, so that we can
realize that opportunity to the fullest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken, tenured law professor at Stanford University
also promised to reduce overall federal spending and to ensure that
money earmarked for Social Security is not spent on other federal
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I oppose federal spending because the federal government does
not pay for what it spends _ as you and I have to,'' he said.
``Instead, it just borrows from the Social Security surplus. This
is irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security surplus became a focal point of the budget
debate this year in Congress, with Republicans advocating budget
cuts to avoid spending the money on federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who has spent four terms in the House, is known for
occasionally breaking with his party, including on the important
issues of gun control and abortion _ both of which he supports.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Campbell said he is convinced California
voters want a Senate candidate who votes conservatively on fiscal
issues and moderately on social issues, and that is how he
describes himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government should help those who need it, and help the rest of
us by getting out of the way,'' said Campbell, who holds a
doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago and a law
degree from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, 47, will contend for the nomination with at least four
other conservative Republicans: Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron
Unz, state Senate Minority Whip Ray Haynes, San Diego County
Supervisor Bill Horn and businessman J.P. Gough.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein spokesman Kam Kuwata said the senator welcomed
Campbell's entrance into the race, adding that it will make for a
``spirited'' primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope all the Republicans have fun beating each other up and
exposing each candidate's weaknesses,'' he said laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, a graduate of Stanford University who was mayor of
San Francisco from 1978 to 1989, was elected to the Senate in 1992.
As a senator, Feinstein has focused heavily on crime and the
banning of assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell could face a steep financial challenge in raising the
estimated $5 million needed for the primary and $20 million needed
for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a statewide Field Poll showed Feinstein with a huge
lead over Campbell and other potential GOP nominees. Among all
voters in a hypothetical general election, Feinstein won 55 percent
of the vote, compared with 30 percent for Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Campbell had only a tiny lead among other
possible Republican nominees in the poll's matchups against
Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell will formally announce his Senate bid at a press
conference on Friday in Sacramento.

RODRIGUEZ WINS AL'S MVP AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez failed to win the Most Valuable Player Award for
his own team, but was named MVP of the American League Thursday.
Pedro Martinez received the most first-place votes for Most
Valuable Player, but he finished second, in part because two
writers left him off their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre nature of this year's voting, then, assures that the
selection of Rodriguez will go down as one of the most
controversial in baseball history. ``I'm not going to start crying
about it,'' said Martinez, the Boston pitcher who was picked
unanimously for the AL Cy Young Award earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 28, batted .332 with 113 runs batted in, 199 hits and
25 stolen bases, but his most significant impact was on defense: A
perennial Gold Glove winner, Rodriguez threw out 53 percent of
runners attempting to steal, and because of his presence, opponents
tried stealing only 99 times this year, the fewest in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's special to get this award, because that's the dream of
every player to get this kind of award,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, too, had an incredible season, one of the greatest
ever by a pitcher. He went 23-4 _ the Red Sox were 24-5 in games he
started, while compiling a .507 winning percentage in games he
didn't start _ and his earned run average of 2.07 was 2.79 runs
lower than the league ERA of 4.86.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the Baseball Writers Association of America from
each of the American League's 14 cities vote for the Most Valuable
Player Award, slotting players first through 10th. Among the 28
writers, Martinez received eight first-place votes, while the Texas
catcher had seven, Cleveland's Roberto Alomar, Manny Ramirez and
Rafael Palmeiro had four apiece, Boston's Nomar Garciaparra had two
and the Yankees' Derek Jeter had one first place vote. But
Rodriguez finished with 252 points, ahead of Martinez (239), Alomar
(226), Ramirez (226), Palmeiro (193), Jeter (177) and Garciaparra
(137).
</P>
<P>
   La Velle Neal, who covers the Minnesota Twins for the
Minneapolis Star Tribune, and George King, the Yankees' beat writer
for the New York Post, did not list Martinez in any of the 10 slots
on their ballots. If Neal and King had each placed Martinez as high
as fourth, he would have won the MVP Award. Neal and King could not
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that because pitchers are given their own honor,
the Cy Young Award, they should not be considered for the MVP
Award. But according to the criterion disseminated to the writers
who vote, pitchers are eligible for selection, and there have been
18 instances when a pitcher was picked as the MVP _ most recently
in 1992, when closer Dennis Eckersley of the Oakland Athletics won
the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens was the last starting pitcher to win the MVP, for
Boston in 1986. In the letter that accompanied the ballots this
year, voters were encouraged to ``keep in mind that all players are
eligible for MVP and that includes pitchers and designated
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   The second listed criterion for MVP consideration is the number
of games played, and writers who don't pick pitchers sometimes base
their decision on that reasoning. But Jack Lang, former secretary
treasurer of the writers' association, said that in the past, he
told prospective voters that if they felt they could not consider a
pitcher for the MVP Award, he would reassign the ballot to another
writer. New York Times reporters do not vote in the selection of
postseason awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try everything to convince writers that this prejudice
against pitchers should not exist,'' said Jack O'Connell, the
current secretary-treasurer for the BBWAA.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several controversial votes in past years. In
1947, Boston's Ted Williams won the league's Triple Crown, leading
the league in batting average, home runs and RBIs. But because a
writer who personally disliked Williams failed to vote him among
the top 10 players in the AL, the Yankees' Joe DiMaggio won the MVP
Award.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell, of the Hartford Courant, filled in the other MVP
ballot for the New York area papers this year. He selected Ramirez
for first place and Martinez for seventh. King voted for Jeter for
first place. Both members of the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter selected
Palmeiro for first place and had Martinez listed higher than
Rodriguez. Palmeiro, in fact, was picked as the Rangers' Most
Valuable Player for 1999 by the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed at all,'' Martinez said. ``I don't hold
anything against anybody. There's nothing I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who he would have voted for, Rodriguez replied, ``For me,
Pedro can be second, and Robbie can be third.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez became the ninth catcher to win the award, and of
those, six are in the Hall of Fame, including Johnny Bench and Yogi
Berra. He was on vacation with his family in Florida when he
received word he had won the voting, which was received generally
with surprise around baseball. Many thought that Ramirez or Alomar
would win, but the Cleveland teammates may have split the voting to
the point that neither Indian had enough votes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who finished second in the AL batting race to
Garciaparra, was considered a front-runner early in the season, but
he did not have as many extra-base hits in the second half of the
season.

`PASTORAL DISASTER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US Catholic bishops, already burdened with many
responsibilities, will cause more work for themselves and greater
friction in the church by demanding the allegiance of theologians
in Catholic universities. They can mitigate the damage of their
decision by using the new power with discretion. The real danger
facing the church is not abstruse theological writings but the
increasing secularization of American society, which Catholic
universities are ideally situated to combat.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops approved the ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae'' in response to a
call from the Vatican to get tough with Catholic universities in
the United States. These schools have had an occasional teacher who
strayed from church orthodoxy, but that is a small price to pay for
the maturation of the Catholic university system. Because the
universities stress Catholic values and reach out to all segments
of society, they enhance the mission of the church in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the church's universities these days is how to
promote Catholic values in a secular world. The universities should
focus on integrating their instruction in theology and philosophy
classes with student conduct outside the classroom. Instead, if the
new edict is enforced, they will have to worry about whether a
theology professor has obtained a ``mandatum'' from his local
bishop certifying that he is fit to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles said Wednesday that ``this
is a new moment of collaboration'' between bishops and
universities. Rather than collaboration, universities require
autonomy from authorities to advance knowledge. Tension between
established teachings and new ways of thinking is more an
opportunity than a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee said: ``Passing this
document now will create a great pastoral disaster. . . . It will
only lead to a lot of public bickering, public disputes, where the
church can only be harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' document, which now goes to the Vatican for
approval, will not be implemented for months. Once the bishops get
their new powers confirmed, they will need to consult with
university presidents and show keen sensitivity for the many roles
a university plays lest they diminish the great institutions they
are trying to protect.

 ANDERSON DOMINANT IN FALL LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, ARIZ. - It doesn't take a psychic to know which Peoria
Javelinas player a reporter wants to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You looking for Needle?'' Philadelphia Phillies prospect Pat
Burrell asks.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Anderson, at 6-feet-11 and supposedly still growing, is
stretched out in the training room, a day after yielding one run in
six innings to lower his Arizona Fall League ERA to 2.91.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell yells for ``Needle'' to come out.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Ricky Magdalena says: ``I can answer the questions for
him: `I just blew it by them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is what the Seattle Mariners have been banking on ever since
they made Anderson the 19th pick out of Divine Child High School in
Dearborn, Mich., two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And it is what Anderson has done frequently this fall _ blow the
ball by guys who are on the verge of being in the majors. He is 1-0
in 34 innings, striking out 29 and walking nine. Opposing teams hit
.228 against him.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, however, no longer makes remarks about becoming the
best pitcher in the history of the game, something he said after
being drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Two years in professional baseball have humbled him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when he hears the Randy Johnson comparisons, Anderson,
although flattered by it, simply says, ``I want to be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners would like Anderson to be another Randy Johnson,
but they know if they move him into the rotation now, it could
backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I'll be next season,'' Anderson said.
``They don't tell me. I just try to work on what I need to do
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is built like Johnson without the facial hair and long
locks. His delivery is frighteningly similar. Anderson throws 96
mph with a three-quarters, sling-shot motion. What he doesn't have
is the command.
</P>
<P>
   That will come. Right now, Anderson is working on all phases:
mechanics, command of his fastball, intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He competes, but he's learning what that means, how to attack
hitters, how to really finish a hitter off,'' said Dean Treanor,
the Javelinas' pitching coach who works in the Los Angeles Dodgers'
organization. ``It all goes with experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel he's made some strides down here, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who was given a team-record $2.18 million signing
bonus out of high school, was 6-5 with a 3.23 ERA his first year in
Class A ball in Wisconsin. He struck out 152 and walked 67 in 111
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 season, however, was an awakening. He started the
season 5-10 with a 5.11 ERA at Double-A New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   He said he changed his mechanics three times before Team USA
made him a late addition to the Pan American Games roster. It was
then that he seemed to change.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson started the final round-robin game of the tournament
against Brazil, striking out nine in six innings in Team USA's 3-2
victory. He went on to win four of his last seven decisions in the
minors and lowered his ERA to 4.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back, I just went out there and threw the ball,''
Anderson said. ``That helped me a lot. Before, when I messed up, I
would step back and think about what I had to adjust to.'' &QL; 
Notes
</P>
<P>
   Peoria saw its playoffs hopes dashed Wednesday, losing to the
Phoenix Desert Dogs, 5-4. The Grand Canyon Rafters can clinch the
Western Division title with a win over Maryvale today. The Mesa
Solar Sox are the Eastern Division champs and will host the first
game of the best-of-three championship series at 1 p.m. Friday at
Mesa's HoHoKam Park.
</P>
<P>
   The series moves to Scottsdale Stadium at 1 on Saturday.
Baseballs signed by Randy Johnson will be given to 100 fans. If
there is a third game, it will be played at Scottsdale at 1 p.m.
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Solar Sox have two outstanding pitchers: Doug Davis (Texas
Rangers), who is 5-2 with a 2.25 ERA, and 22-year-old Korean Sun
Woo Kim (Boston Red Sox), who is 5-1 with a 2.27 ERA. The team is
led at the plate by 20-year-old outfielder Corey Patterson (Chicago
Cubs), who is hitting .366, fourth-best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Maryvale's George Lombard (Atlanta Braves) has 11 home runs,
which tied a Fall League record held by Ryan Klesko, J.R. Phillips
and Ron Wright.

A&AMP;M STUDENT REMEMBERED AS SELFLESS

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _There is irony in the name, because friends
and former teachers recall Jerry Don Self as being genuinely
selfless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably volunteered the most of any student we've ever
had,'' said Gayle Nelson, who was a Lamar High School teacher and
student council sponsor when Self attended the school from
1995-1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got in there and did things, which is probably what he
was doing'' Thursday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Self, 20, was among several students who died Thursday when a
40-foot stack of logs being erected for a traditional Thanksgiving
week bonfire collapsed at Texas A&AMP;M University in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   Many Lamar High graduates enroll at Texas A&AMP;M, Principal Jimmy
Jones said, and he worried that some might be involved in the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   He was saddened but hardly surprised when he learned that Self
was one of the students working on the log stack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very dependable kid, very involved, always one of the
first ones to step up and volunteer,'' Jones said. ``If something
was going on, he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Self took average talents and pushed himself to above-average
levels, friends said. He was tall, well over 6 feet, but not an
exceptional athlete. Still, he was disciplined and dependable and
worked his way into a starting position on the offensive line by
the end of his senior year, a former coach recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He studied with zeal, pushing himself to reach his goal of
attending Texas A&AMP;M, joining the corps of cadets and studying
toward an engineering degree. He was the first in his family to
attend college.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fairly decent student,'' Jones said. ``Not too many
kids who choose to go to A&AMP;M are weak in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Self tutored elementary students, served on the student council
and was a Spanish Club member at Lamar. He was spiritual and
attended church often, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar High School assistant coach Bill Riley broke down when he
learned of Self's death. Self and Riley's son, Beau Riley, were
longtime friends and played on the Lamar football team together.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Riley and his son drove to College Station when they heard
the news.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar High School head coach Eddy Peach described Self as ``a
model young man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to find a finer young man than what he was,''
Peach said. ``It's been a tough day for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Self selected Texas A&AMP;M because of its respected engineering
program. He embraced ``the whole Aggie culture,'' said Jeremy Erb,
his former pastor who was serving as a family spokesman Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Self's parents believe that their oldest son died doing
something he cared about, and Erb said they do not blame the
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any animosity,'' Erb said. ``Jerry died
doing what he loved. There's no anger toward the bonfire. He was
proud and loved the A&AMP;M tradition, and I think the family stands
with him on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Self's parents drove to College Station on Thursday not knowing
whether their son was badly injured. They were told about the
accident during an early morning phone call from A&AMP;M officials.
</P>
<P>
   Before driving to College Station, Michael Roy Self recorded a
new message on his telephone answering machine, asking callers to
phone him on his cellular phone and let him know if they had any
news about his son.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after arriving in College Station, he learned that his
son was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Self's younger brother, Michael Self, 18, just completed Army
basic training. Contacted by phone, he said he was too distraught
to talk about his brother's death.
</P>
<P>
   At A&AMP;M, Self enjoyed playing volleyball and golf and liked
dancing and listening to country music. A member of the Corps of
Cadets Squadron 17, he had helped construct the bonfire last year
as well, Erb said.
</P>
<P>
   Self was torn between working as an engineer or becoming a
minister, Erb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really involved in local church ministries and was
considering going into the ministry,'' he said. ``He loved God, and
that was a big part of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Working late into the night to erect the logs for the bonfire
typifies Self's life, Jones said. The young man worked in
anonymity, more concerned with the results of his labors than the
commendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Jerry Don as being one of those kids who didn't get
a lot of recognition, but was one of the ones doing most of the
work,'' Jones said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The following article is based on reporting by David Barboza,
Leslie Eaton and Diana B. Henriques and was written by Ms. Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most Americans may not know it, but there are really
two Wall Streets.
</P>
<P>
   One is the Wall Street of the New York Stock Exchange closing
bell, of brash stockbrokers and hair-trigger traders, of big deals
and big fortunes, of Microsoft and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   But there also flourishes another Wall Street of crooked alleys.
This is a world of low-priced stocks and high-priced dreams, of
grimy offices and sham companies, of swindlers and touts who prey
on average people trying to grab the brass ring in the greatest
bull market in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Like the world of organized crime, with which it increasingly
overlaps, it is a violent place full of colorful characters and
arcane lingo, of ``naked shorts'' and ``pump 'n' dumps.'' And it
specializes in creating illusions that are as complex as a Broadway
play _ and as simple as a game of three-card monte.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this world that Albert Alain Chalem and Maier Lehmann
lived _ and died. The men, who were promoting stocks over the
Internet together, were both shot in the head Oct. 25 and left to
die on the marble floor in the $1.1 million home in Colts Neck,
N.J., where Chalem lived.
</P>
<P>
   Their world might seem arcane _ except that its denizens bilk
Americans out of roughly $2 billion a year, securities regulators
say. The problem is so severe that regulators and prosecutors have
made it one of their chief goals to crack down on what they used to
dismiss as ``penny-stock fraud,'' before it became clear that the
money involved amounted to many billions of pennies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sustained, prolonged bull market really does bring out the
crustaceans from the bottom of the sea,'' said Richard Walker,
director of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission.
``They're attracted to the money.''
</P>
<P>
   While the enforcement effort has succeeded in closing down many
of the big brokerage operations that pushed shady stocks over the
telephone, Walker said, many people who were kicked out of the
securities business have moved their schemes into cyberspace.
``That's where the action is now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where Chalem and Lehmann were before they were
killed. In addition to running a Web site, Chalem was trading
stocks electronically, and may have had an account under an assumed
name at a Manhattan firm called Harbor Securities. Investigators
are examining whether his trading there was linked to his death.
From the very first, investigators have suspected that the slayings
somehow involved the two men's financial dealings, rather than
their personal lives. And, although the investigation remains in
its early stages, law enforcement officials have clearly not
changed their minds about that.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Lehmann, 37, seems to have the more troubled
work history. He had pleaded guilty to mail fraud in an insurance
scheme and settled civil securities-fraud charges. Before his death
he told Barron's magazine that he had secretly worked at Patterson,
Travis Inc., a small brokerage firm with a history of regulatory
troubles; company officials said Thursday that they had no record
of his having been employed there.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lehmann was more than willing to talk. He told
reporters, regulators, prosecutors and, apparently, anyone who
would listen about what he said were various schemes and swindles.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Chalem, 41, who cast the longer shadow in the world
of shady stocks, and it is Chalem who is increasingly the focus of
investigators. He had worked at a brokerage firm, A.S. Goldmen &AMP;
Co., that prosecutors contend was a criminal enterprise _ a charge
that the firm denies. He also worked secretly at a firm called
Toluca Pacific Securities, according to several people who knew
him. Toluca, which is defunct, had a long history of regulatory
run-ins and had links to career felons and to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Mobsters have increasingly turned up in stock swindles. In
January, two men whom prosecutors said were tied to the Bonanno and
Genovese crime families pleaded guilty to federal charges that they
participated in a conspiracy to manipulate the stock of an Arizona
company that owns a health club; the president of the company was
convicted of related charges this month in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In June, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn indicted a group they
said included members of the Colombo crime family and an associate
of the Bor organized crime group of Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who prosecutors said ran rogue brokerage firms that
manipulated stock prices, were charged with conspiracy, securities
fraud and money laundering; they pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Chalem was widely believed, in the penny stock world, to have
dealings with Russian organized crime and to be ``a protected
guy,'' as one lawyer put it.
</P>
<P>
   New information is coming to light about his activities in the
weeks before his death. Last week, federal prosecutors served
subpoenas to retrieve trading records, which may be linked to
Chalem, from Harbor Securities, which catered to self-employed day
traders. Heavy financial losses recently forced the firm to close.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Chalem's trading had anything to do with his death
remains unclear. What is clear is that he and Lehmann were more
accustomed to being predators than to being prey in the dangerous
world they inhabited.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE PERFORMANCE: Everything Fake Except the Money
</P>
<P>
   Their alternative Wall Street is not a big place; its players,
who all seem to know each other, cluster in just a few spots: San
Diego and La Jolla in southern California; Boca Raton, Fla.;
Vancouver, British Columbia; and New York, the ground zero of stock
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   To be successful, stock frauds must look a lot like legitimate
stock deals. But in reality, they are elaborately choreographed
performances, in which everything is fake except the money the
audience will lose when the play is over.
</P>
<P>
   Fraudulent companies issue fraudulent press releases touting
fraudulent products; fake newsletters make fake recommendations
about fake stocks; phantom investors make phantom trades to push up
the price of these phantom stocks. A small claque in the audience
may be tossing tomatoes, but these skeptics _ known as
short-sellers _ can often be bought off by the show's producers.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Chalem and Lehmann seem to have played every
possible role in such productions. Behind-the-scenes operators,
they did business over cellular phones and computers, from
so-called boiler rooms full of desks and phones and fast-talking
salesmen, and most recently, on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how thousands of Americans get taken in by these
shows, it helps to know a little bit about the legitimate side of
Wall Street _ and about how the real thing differs from its evil
twin, as described in court documents, in interviews with
regulators and prosecutors, and in discussions with people in the
stock business.
</P>
<P>
   In the real Wall Street, new companies that want to raise money
pay investment firms a fee to sell shares of stock. In the shady
Wall Street, almost none of the money raised from investors goes to
the company; rather, it lines the pockets of brokers and promoters
and their pals. In one case analyzed by state regulators in
Alabama, a New York company raised $12.5 million from investors;
$11 million of that went to insiders and brokers.
</P>
<P>
   In the real Wall Street, public companies are vetted by
accountants and auditors and lawyers and investment firms, all of
them supervised by regulators. Companies that have stock
outstanding must file quarterly financial reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and must keep investors
informed of major changes in their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the ersatz Wall Street, companies avoid filing regulatory
reports _ lying on such reports is a crime _ and communicate almost
entirely by news releases, the more hyperbolic the better. (Without
admitting or denying wrongdoing, one Florida executive recently
settled regulatory charges over his press releases. These falsely
claimed that the Moscow Ministry of Finance and Walt Disney World
were negotiating to buy his company's miracle process for turning
scrap tires into oil.)
</P>
<P>
   At legitimate companies, insiders, like executives and
directors, must report, publicly, any time they buy or sell their
own stock. People who own even 5 percent of a company must also
reveal that through regulatory filings.
</P>
<P>
   In the fake Wall Street, insiders use false names and dummy
accounts to hide the fact that they control almost all of a
company's stock that is available for trading. In one regulatory
case recently filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, the SEC
contends that a group of stock promoters controlled as much as 95
percent of the tradable shares in several companies.
</P>
<P>
   Though the real stock market is a complicated place,
particularly in the short run, over the long haul a company's stock
price rises when investors are optimistic about its future sales
and profits; the stock price falls when investors worry that the
company's business is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the false Wall Street, a stock rises like Peter Pan in the
stage play, not because he is thinking merry little thoughts, but
because he is attached to a wire strung from the theater's rigging.
(Aptly, these manipulated stocks are called rigs.)
</P>
<P>
   The stage for these stocks is usually the OTC Bulletin Board, a
trading network run by the National Association of Securities
Dealers, which also runs NASDAQ. But unlike the real NASDAQ market,
the bulletin board will trade the stock of almost any company, no
matter how small, secretive or downright preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators predict that more than half of the roughly 6,000
companies that were trading on the bulletin board last year will be
removed by next June, under new rules that require them to file
current financial statements with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of characters includes the promoters, who are often
stockbrokers barred from the securities business, their lawyers and
public-relations advisers. The production also needs someone still
in the securities business who can execute trades. Other starring
roles usually belong to corporate executives, who are mostly in on
the rig, though sometimes they are innocents desperate to raise
money for their companies.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are short-sellers, who are people who bet that
share prices will fall (and make a profit when that happens). In
some cases, they are doing all they can to make sure the production
is a flop.
</P>
<P>
   The production may call on the services of the brokers and
cold-callers to unload shares on the public, although the Internet
is making such brokers increasingly unnecessary; now, investors can
be persuaded to buy stock electronically. ``The Internet has put
this type of fraud on steroids,'' said Cameron Funkhouser, vice
president of market regulation for the National Association of
Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE CHOREOGRAPHY: Hyped-Up Ideas, Controlled Stock
</P>
<P>
   The plot of the play always begins with the company. The ideal
stock-fraud company has some whiz-bang new product that will excite
investors, like a self-chilling beer can, springy shoes for race
horses, or a cure for baldness or for tooth decay. Also popular are
gold mines in obscure locations, theme restaurants in Las Vegas and
anything in cyberspace with a .com after it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the purported business will change in the course of
the scheme; according to a ruling in federal lawsuit, one outfit
called Sky Scientific claimed at various times to be running gold
mines, a financial services company and the first riverboat casino
in Moscow. Occasionally the company is a small operation that has a
real product, but it is just not as thrilling as the company's
public relations makes out. (The vitamins do not really cure
cancer; the Internet service has not really signed up every
household in Peru.)
</P>
<P>
   One company Lehmann was involved with, Electro-Optical Systems,
claimed to be developing a computer gizmo that would read
fingerprints, so that users could sign in without having to
remember pesky passwords.
</P>
<P>
   His original role was to hook up the would-be inventor of the
product with the ``investment bankers'' who were supposedly raising
money for the company, according to a decision in a lawsuit filed
last year by the SEC in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The
inventor was not named as a defendant in the case, which is now
dormant while a criminal investigation continues. Lehmann settled
the regulators' charges and paid $630,000 in fines and restitution.
</P>
<P>
   The key, from the con artists' point of view, is to get control
of the shares of stock, which might be called Act 1. Sometimes
shady brokerage firms stage ``initial public offerings,'' but a
faster and cheaper method _ the one Lehmann's group used _ is to
merge the company with a shell corporation, which already has stock
outstanding but no business.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone involved in the scheme is paid with stock; the
promoters usually control huge blocks in accounts with false names,
often overseas.
</P>
<P>
   They all make money by making the shares rise in price. They
often do this in part by making fake trades at arbitrary prices. In
the case of Electro-Optical, regulators contend that the promoters
put in an order to buy shares at $7 each, far above the 20 cents
for which shares had last changed hands before the promotion began.
</P>
<P>
   Once the stock price has been pumped up, it is time to lure
outsiders into buying the shares. Lehmann helped out with the
public relations. He got an an Internet newsletter to choose
Electro-Optical as its ``pick of the year''; the newsletter's owner
was later sued by the SEC, which accused him of secretly taking
stock and cash from dozens of companies in exchange for
recommending their stocks; he is contesting the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lehmann also approved a press release that claimed, falsely,
that Electro-Optical had just received a big order for its
products. (Neither order nor products existed.) Investors,
entranced with the concept and the rising stock price, began to buy
the inflated stock.
</P>
<P>
   After the pump comes the dump. Those in the know sell their
shares to unsuspecting investors. Lehmann had received 100,000
shares, for which he paid nothing and which he put in an account in
his wife's name; when he sold, he made about half a million
dollars. All told, regulators say, those involved in the
Electro-Optical rigging made $12 million by dumping their shares.
</P>
<P>
   Once the promoters stop pumping the stock, its price usually
plunges. Anyone who wants to buy Electro-Optical today can get 10
shares for a penny.
</P>
<P>
   BAILING OUT: Special Handling For Short Sellers
</P>
<P>
   Some inventive stock promoters find a way to make money on the
falling price, too, by selling short. To do this, a short seller
simply borrows some shares from a brokerage house, promising to
replace them later, and then sells them. If the trader has guessed
right and the stock's price later falls, he can replace the
borrowed shares _ a step known as ``covering'' _ by buying shares
at the new, lower price.
</P>
<P>
   His profit is the difference between the price at which he sold
the borrowed shares and the price at which he bought the
replacements. But if the share price rises, he can easily lose his
entire investment.
</P>
<P>
   While short selling can be a legitimate practice, it can also be
abused. Chalem's friends and former business allies say he
practiced a more aggressive form of short-selling, called naked
shorting. Brokerage houses that deal in a particular stock can
short it without borrowing the shares first. Going through those
cooperative brokers, speculators like Chalem sell, and sell and
sell _ thereby guaranteeing that the stock's price will plummet.
</P>
<P>
   A year or two ago, Chalem's associates say, he was shorting the
stock of Quigley Corp. of Doylestown, Pa., which makes zinc
lozenges that it says relieve common colds. The company blamed
short-sellers for the decline in its stock, which has dropped from
$23 in the fall of 1997 to about $3 today. Skeptics said the
company's share price was too high and, indeed, sales of the
lozenges have been falling.
</P>
<P>
   But a debate over the true merits of most penny stocks is
pointless; in many cases, both the promoters and the short sellers
know that the stocks are rigged. Then, the question is simply who
has enough power _ and money _ to prevail in what is really trench
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters may try to make short-sellers go away by giving them
free shares that the short-sellers can use to cover and close out
their positions with big profits. This has caused some prosecutors
to believe that this sort of short-selling is really a kind of
extortion, though that is hard to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides use rough tactics in their efforts to win. They try
to plant stories in the press. They call regulators and prosecutors
to inform on each other.
</P>
<P>
   And they threaten each other with physical harm, backed up by
visits from burly men. John Fiero, a prominent short seller and
principal at the firm of Fiero Brothers in Manhattan, has
repeatedly complained to the police about the threats he has
received.
</P>
<P>
   And that violence may ultimately be the biggest difference
between the real Wall Street and the parallel universe inhabited by
people like Chalem and Lehmann.
</P>
<P>
   Real Wall Street takes a lot of financial risks. But the crooked
Wall Street ``is not just a financially dangerous world,'' said
Stephen Luparello, a senior vice president of the NASD ``It's also
a physically dangerous world.''

AMID HYPE, PINCAY STEERS CLEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Adds info box) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A billboard labeled ``Countdown to History''
looms over the Hollywood Park winner's circle these days, bearing
the career victory totals for Bill Shoemaker (8,833) and Laffit
Pincay (8,818 and counting).
</P>
<P>
   Each time Pincay wins a race, he strides to the board and hangs
a new number beside his name as a track photographer snaps his
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park and Santa Anita are having contests promising an
$8,834 prize to a fan who predicts the day and race when Pincay
passes Shoemaker. Further promotions revolving around Pincay's
record pursuit are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting exciting, especially on days like Wednesday, when
it seemed like old times, with the Panamanian riding in seven races
and winning three, the last by a neck in classic Pincay Power Play
style.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for ``the great man,'' as track announcer Michael
Wrona referred to Pincay in a plug for the contest between races
Thursday, it's as close to business as usual as he and his agent
can make it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, with Pincay 15 wins from tying Shoemaker, trainers and
owners aren't lining up to book his services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't changed at all,'' said agent Bob Meldahl, who has
booked Pincay's mounts since 1991. ``Nobody's expressed, `I'm going
to put you on all these 8-5 shots.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it'll change when he gets to seven or eight (from the
record).''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, people might be angling to have Pincay ride
!ital!their!off! horse to the record.
</P>
<P>
   But if it doesn't happen that way _ if his winning opportunities
don't increase in the next few weeks _ it appears that will be all
right with Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope I don't ride seven, eight horses a day. It's too
demanding,'' Pincay said after his triple on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The only luxury in riding a full card is that Pincay could eat
100 more calories at dinner that night.
</P>
<P>
   At 52, living on 750 calories a day to maintain his 117-pound
riding weight, Pincay feels stronger riding four or five a day.
</P>
<P>
   Often, he rides fewer than that because fields at Hollywood Park
are typically small, and competition for mounts is as keen as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep it to three or four (a day),'' Meldahl said
in the Hollywood Park racing office Thursday morning. ``He's
fresher.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without extra chances, Pincay is riding as well as he has
in years. He has passed the 140-win mark in 1999, already his best
season since '95.
</P>
<P>
   If he kept winning at the rate that put him third in the jockey
standings at the Oak Tree meet, the countdown to history would end
Wednesday, Dec. 29, at Santa Anita. That happens to be Pincay's
birthday _ the day he has said he'd like to do it.
</P>
<P>
   If he kept winning at his 1999 pace, he'd get the record on
Friday, Dec. 31, the fifth day of the Santa Anita season. Then
Pincay might have to allow himself half a glass of champagne that
night.
</P>
<P>
   If he kept winning at his recent pace _ 15 victories in the past
12 racing days, including one Thursday _ he would blow past
Shoemaker on Sunday, Dec. 5. That's practically impossible, though,
because Pincay is scheduled to be in Panama Dec. 2-5 to be honored
at a Latin American jockeys' competition.
</P>
<P>
   Meldahl said a couple of out-of-town stakes assignments later in
December are possible as well. Although a win is a win wherever it
happens, such trips could slow him down simply by reducing his
number of mounts.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Pincay might be helped along if, as usual,
other veteran riders take vacations in December.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's asking for help. Business as usual has always been
good enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest with you, I don't think Laffit would
want it any other way,'' Meldahl said. ``He wants trainers to give
him good horses. But he's never in his life asked for anything
special, and he doesn't expect it now.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend: Trainer Bob Baffert, going for his fourth
Hollywood Prevue Stakes victory in a row, will have Cameron Pass
(David Flores riding) and Magical Dragon (Chris McCarron) in the
7-furlong race for 2-year-olds on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert won the race with In Excessive Bull, Commitisize and
Premier Property.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Cenicola-trained Joopy Doopy (Victor Espinoza) is the
likely favorite after going 6 furlongs in 1:08 4/5 to win the Sunny
Slope Stakes at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   The Grade III Prevue, a prep for the Dec. 18 Hollywood Futurity,
is the first of 14 graded stakes on the Hollywood Park schedule.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Hollywood Park leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Isaias
Enriquez and Pat Valenzuela, 7 wins; Laffit Pincay, 6; Corey
Nakatani and Alex Solis, 5. Trainers: Ian Jory, 4; Mike Mitchell,
3; six tied with 2. &QL; 
Handicapper helper: Until Wednesday, when horses led from gate to
wire in two of the five sprints, front-runners were only 3 for 25
in races up to 7{ furlongs on Hollywood Park's tiring main track. &QL; 
On the stakes schedule: At Hollywood Park: Saturday, $100,000

NEW OBSTACLE ARISES TO PROPOSED OVERHAUL OF ORGAN DISTRIBUTION
SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ill., N.J., Pa.)  (th) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bitter fight over the nation's system for
distributing donated human organs has erupted in Congress, and a
deal struck last week that would have cleared the way for the
Clinton administration's long-planned overhaul was on the verge of
falling apart Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement reached last week between Donna Shalala,
secretary of health and human services, and a bipartisan group of
congressional members, new federal rules governing organ allocation
would take effect by late December or early January. The agreement
was attached to a spending bill that is due to be considered by
Congress soon.
</P>
<P>
   But in a move late Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
and House Speaker Dennis Hastert inserted a countermeasure into a
package that includes two popular bills, one that would help
disabled people get back to work and another that would extend
certain tax credits. That measure would delay the effective date of
the federal rules by three months, giving Congress enough time to
return from its winter break and overturn them.
</P>
<P>
   The package containing the tax credits and work incentives
passed the House on Thursday night. So now there are two major
pieces of legislation working their way through the House and
Senate, each with minor amendments governing organ allocation that
are diametrically opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Because the differing provisions cannot be stripped out of the
bills, it is possible that both could be approved. In that case,
Senate staff members on both sides of the issue said, the bill
signed last would take precedence. But on Thursday, no one was
quite certain how it would turn out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who
supports the Republican leadership and is pressing to delay the
federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli is not the only member crossing party lines. As
chairman of the Senate subcommittee that governs health spending,
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., worked with Shalala to reach last week's
agreement. On Thursday, a very angry Specter predicted that the
matter might wind up in court, and he threatened to filibuster the
tax-credit legislation to block the actions of his fellow
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the action of the Republican leaders placed
the Clinton administration in a ticklish position. The
administration strongly supports both the tax credit and workplace
bills, and Clinton is not likely to veto them to keep the organ
allocation deal intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have a very serious problem,'' said Dan
Mendelson, associate director for health at the Office of
Management and Budget. ``At this point, it is unclear what is going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute stems from a bitter political and economic feud over
which patients should have priority in receiving human organs, the
nation's scarcest medical resources.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 62,000 Americans are now waiting for a heart, lung,
liver, kidney or pancreas; last year alone, 4,000 people died
waiting. But waiting times vary greatly from region to region, and
in February 1998, Shalala declared the current system unfair and
said she intended to change it.
</P>
<P>
   The country is now divided into 62 local areas, which range in
size from a few counties to several states, and in population from
1 million to 12 million; those areas are subsets of 11 regions.
When an organ becomes available, it is offered locally first, then
regionally, and, in rare cases, nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala's proposal, twice delayed by Congress, would force
organs to be shared across bigger regions, with the sickest
patients getting first priority. The proposal would also greatly
increase the secretary's authority over the United Network for
Organ Sharing, the private agency that contracts with the
government to distribute donated organs. The network has opposed
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has also touched off a fight between large and
small transplant centers, with small centers insisting that
Shalala's rule would put them out of business by steering organs to
big-city hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   This is a major reason why the issue does not divide along party
lines. Members of Congress who represent states that have big
transplant centers tend to support the administration, while those
who represent states with smaller centers want the current system
to remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are extremely high,'' Torricelli said. ``In New
Jersey, a 26-day waiting period for a liver transplant could be
transformed into a 250-day waiting period. Hospitals will close,
donations of organs will be altered. This is an issue that deeply
divides the Congress, and it is something that should be debated
and voted upon in the Congress.''

 &HT;    Stewart arrives as future of racing
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Look into the face of Tony Stewart and catch the glint
of the unwavering eyes, the even teeth, and you're seeing the new
image of the stock-car racer. The features are those of a young
executive, feet on the ground, head tuned into business. Pleasant,
easy nature, although he does have a temper, which apparently goes
with left-handers, and accommodating. A rookie at the top of his
game.
</P>
<P>
   Then you flash back to the weathered faces of Fireball Roberts,
Cale Yarborough, on down to Darrell Waltrip and Dick Trickle. The
crow's feet gathered at the eyes, the hard lines around the mouth,
all etched there by thousands of hard miles inhaling fumes, and in
earlier times, dust. They laid the foundation for what a major
television network invested millions in the other day. Indianapolis
was once the big dog, the top of the heap, the major leagues.
That's what you drove NASCAR for, to get there. Bobby and Donnie
Allison, Cale Yarborough, Leroy Yarbrough were some who made the
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart represents the reversal in trend. He worked the
Indianapolis gig to get to NASCAR. He has driven everything from
go-karts to the Indianapolis 500, which he won't be running next
year. That doesn't mean he's restricting himself to stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm driving in a midget race next week,'' he said. ``After
three years of the Indianapolis cars, I lost interest. I didn't
want to run street courses, really didn't want to run road courses.
The midgets I really missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when he ran Indianapolis and Charlotte the same day
and into the night, he drove himself into exhaustion. After
finishing ninth at Indianapolis, he was flown to Charlotte, on a
liquid diet, without eating, and finished fourth, after which he
was rushed to the track infirmary and treated for exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had driven 1,090 miles in one day. I raced 500 miles at
Charlotte, then just tried to hang on for another 100. I won't try
that again, until I forget how bad I felt. I do want to drive Indy
again. I want to win it before I die.''
</P>
<P>
   From the time he was 8 years old, Stewart has had nothing but
racing on his mind. He has worked his way up, as latter-day
wunderkinder have done. He was laid up in his mother's home in
Columbus, Ind., three years ago, recovering from a broken pelvis,
broken collarbone and other calamities, Las Vegas crash mementos,
when the phone rang. His mother said Joe Gibbs was calling.
</P>
<P>
   ```Yeah, right,' I said. But it was. How he got the number I'll
never know. Awhile later, I'd just checked into a hotel in Phoenix
when the phone rang. It was Joe Gibbs calling. He kept calling, and
I guess it was his persistence, but we got together.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Bobby Labonte became teammates, and last week, after
bumping Labonte's car, Stewart went ahead to win at Homestead,
Fla., his third of the season. ``It was an accident, and I
apologized to Bobby. We're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us dreamed he'd win a race,'' Joe Gibbs has said.
``We'd thought he'd be up close. None of us dreamed he'd be in the
top 10, much less top five.''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and his affiliate, Home Depot, are NASCAR rookies. Gibbs
by this time is a seasoned veteran of the stocks, a guy who quit
pro football at the top and switched to horses of another nature.
Nobody has ever won a Super Bowl and a Winston Cup, and for that
matter, nobody else has ever worked both jobs before, but with
Stewart on his team, Joe Gibbs is looking good down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the easiest car owner I ever worked for,'' Stewart said.
``He doesn't give you X's and O's like a coach. He doesn't try to
tell you how to drive a race. You see him with a headset on during
the race, but he never says a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Being more than just a driver, Tony understands. He owns cars
himself on about three different levels. One of his drivers in
midgets next year will be another Stewart _ his father, age 62.
</P>
<P>
   Tony is out of the Winston Cup race. Dale Jarrett has that sewed
up. But nobody ever had a rookie season like his, and, win the NAPA
500 at Hampton Sunday, that's like serving notice that here comes
Tony Stewart in 2000.

 &HT;    Driesell, Tarkanian still coaching after all these years
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia State coach Lefty Driesell is not sure when he
and Fresno State coach Jerry Tarkanian became close friends.
Driesell remembers only the place and the circumstances _ and that
both he and Tarkanian were beginning to go bald.
</P>
<P>
   The place was Hawaii, the circumstances a summer junket
sponsored by a shoe company. The time perhaps was the late 1960s or
early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of coaches were there, but they either spent their time
playing golf or were somewhere shopping with their wives,''
Driesell recalled. ``Tark and I didn't play golf, so we got
together on the beach to swim a little and talk a lot of
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   That scenario was repeated at least five years in a row,
Tarkanian, 69, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd joke about going out and getting our bald heads tanned,''
Tarkanian said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   They are now coaching old-timers. They have a combined total of
1,425 victories in Division I and have outlasted most of their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, they face off for the eighth time, when Georgia State
opens its season against Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, when I started coaching (at Davidson in 1960), Adolph
Rupp was still going strong,'' said Driesell, who turns 68 on
Christmas Day. ``Now, Dean (Smith) is gone, Norm Stewart, Don
Haskins.... Bobby Knight is still coaching, but he's younger than
Tark and me. We're probably the oldest guys around now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Smith of North Carolina, the late Adolph Rupp of Kentucky,
Missouri's Norm Stewart, UTEP's Don Haskins and Knight of Indiana _
are among 12 Division I coaches with more than 700 career wins.
Driesell and Tarkanian are on that list with 716 and 709,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we still coaching? I asked my wife that same thing the
other morning, and she said it was probably because I never
considered it a job,'' Driesell said. ``It's always been something
I've enjoyed doing. I know it's not the money, because I've got
plenty of that. You ask Tark and he'll probably tell you the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian coached at California junior colleges for seven years
before stints at Long Beach State and UNLV. He returned to his alma
mater in 1995 with the intent of fashioning Fresno State into a
national power before riding off into the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back here because I want to win and win big here before
it's over. That hasn't happened yet, because every year we've had
some kind of problem. We thought this would be the year, but
something has come up already,'' said Tarkanian, who in 28 years in
Division I has won 20 or more games 27 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something'' is the stress fracture sustained by All-America
candidate Courtney Alexander in his left foot and the fractured
tibia that will sideline center Melvin Ely for at least two games.
</P>
<P>
   Driesell was at Maryland and Tarkanian at UNLV when they first
coached against each other. Tarkanian has won six of seven
meetings, including UNLV's victory over Maryland in the '86 NCAA
Tournament at Long Beach State. Fresno State last season beat
Georgia State 83-62.
</P>
<P>
   The battles on the court, however, have not affected their
friendship. They relish the time they have spent together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out in Las Vegas visiting Tark one New Year's Eve and he
took me to one of those parties,'' Driesell said. ``We sat at the
table with Frank Sinatra (who had been a close friend of Tarkanian)
and Elizabeth Taylor. It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian was with Driesell the night before each of UNLV's four
Final Four appearances in Tarkanian's 19 seasons with the Running
Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Before UNLV's '87 tournament game against Indiana, the two got
together after Tarkanian broke a dinner date with Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Tark not go out with Bobby, because what (Knight) was
going to do was try to mess up his head,'' Driesell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lefty gave me (grief),'' Tarkanian said. ``I called Bobby and
canceled. But his team beat us anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having a choice of basketball powers clamoring to play
Fresno State, Tarkanian responded in the affirmative when his old
friend approached him in the spring of '98 about playing
home-and-home dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of Lefty,'' Tarkanian said.

CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HARASSING AMERICANS, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government of Croatia, an occasional U.S. ally
in peace efforts in the Balkans, is behind a campaign of harassment
against U.S. diplomats and others promoting democracy in Croatia,
according to senior administration officials. Among the actions
were break-ins last month at the homes of a diplomat and a U.S.
government contractor, they added.
</P>
<P>
   The officials say U.S. intelligence agencies have evidence tying
the government of President Franjo Tudjman to the break-ins, which
appear to be an effort to intimidate U.S. diplomats into cutting
off their contacts with opposition political parties in the final
weeks before a parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official has said a listening
device was found in the home of the government contractor _ a U.S.
representative of the National Democratic Institute, which works
closely with the U.S. Embassy in ``democracy building'' projects _
after the break-in at her home.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt in the break-ins, although U.S. officials say
they now fear that government-controlled newspapers and magazines
are trying to incite violence against Americans in Croatia by
portraying them as spies determined to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary elections are due by late January, and opinion
polls suggest that Tudjman's ruling party may lose. The country
also may soon face presidential elections because Tudjman, who has
run the country with nearly dictatorial powers since it won
independence in 1992, is extremely sick with stomach cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has not formally accused the Croatian
government of ordering the break-ins, but it has demanded that the
culprits be identified and brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two members of the embassy community in Croatia have
experienced break-ins,'' said James P. Rubin, the State
Department's chief spokesman. ``We have referred these cases to
local authorities and are awaiting results of their
investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. diplomat whose home was ransacked was so alarmed that
she left her post weeks ahead of schedule _ her tour ended this
year _ and returned to the United States with her young children,
State Department officials said. She had overseen projects of the
Agency for International Development that were intended to bolster
the organizational skills of opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A department official said the woman's house, in a relatively
isolated neighborhood of Zagreb, had been ``turned upside down''
while she and her children were away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bedroom and an office area were ransacked,'' the official
said. ``Nothing was taken. Nothing was really damaged. It was
outrageous. This was a clear political message to us.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the break-in at the home of the woman
representing the National Democratic Institute was similar in that
no valuables were taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody just rummaged through it,'' said Robert D. Benjamin,
the institute's deputy director for Central Europe. He refused to
speculate on the identity of the intruders, but said, ``We share
the concerns of others who have experienced harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Zagreb office of the institute's Republican
counterpart, the International Republican Institute, recently
installed steel doors in her home to prevent a similar intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the harassment is tied to U.S. government
efforts to assist the opposition parties in mounting a credible
electoral challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Through state-controlled newspapers and magazines, Tudjman's
ruling party, the Croatian Democratic Union, has denounced the U.S.
efforts as interference. U.S. officials said it was unclear what
role, if any, the Croatian leader might have taken in organizing
the harassment of Americans, but they said there is no doubt that
senior officials in his political party are directing the campaign.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tudjman, 77, who has had stomach cancer for years, has been
hospitalized, and Western diplomats and Croatian news organizations
have reported that he may be close to death.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years since Croatia won independence from
Yugoslavia, Tudjman has been alternately condemned and praised by
the United States. He has been criticized for his human rights
record and his brutal treatment of Croatia's Serb population. But
his military assault against Serbian forces in August 1995 in the
Krajina region of Croatia helped force the Serbs to the bargaining
table and prevent a larger war in the Balkans. He also pleased
Washington in 1994 when he persuaded his Bosnian Croat allies to
form a federation with Bosnia's Muslim-led government.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ As scores of students were busily
constructing a wooden tower for Texas A&AMP;M University's traditional
football bonfire, the massive 40-foot structure collapsed early
Thursday morning, killing at least nine students beneath a deadly
rubble of logs, some as large as telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
   Even as rescuers continued working into the night, the death
toll seemed likely to rise as officials conceded that the bodies of
two missing students were probably buried beneath the
pyramid-shaped wreckage. Throughout the day, more than a hundred
students wearing hard hats and local firefighters carefully picked
through the rubble, rescuing several students who had been trapped
for hours. At least 28 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where football is often described as a secular
religion, the news prompted immediate and widespread grieving as
many television and radio stations interrupted regular programming
to broadcast the rescue efforts. The bonfire is a 90-year-old Texas
A&AMP;M tradition held on the eve of the school's Thanksgiving weekend
game against its archrival, the University of Texas, and this year
it had been scheduled for Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   The early-morning construction might seem unusual, but
traditionally students work round-the-clock on the tower during the
week leading up to the game. Dr. Ray Bowen, the university
president, said investigators had not yet determined the cause of
the accident, and officials refused to confirm reports that a
55-foot center pole had snapped, saying that experts would work
into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great tragedy,'' said Bowen, noting that the bonfire
will now be canceled. ``Everyone is brokenhearted.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most universities enjoy the allegiance and loyalty of
their students and alumni, few schools elicit the sort of lifelong
passion common at Texas A&AMP;M. Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a Texas A&AMP;M
alumnus who worked on the construction crews as a student, said the
bonfire was a symbol of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary coming together of the student body
to build this bonfire,'' Perry said, in explaining the sentiment
many Aggies, as students and alumni are known, hold for the
bonfire. ``It is very much a part of Aggie lore and traditions and
values. It represents great teamwork. It represents friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Students at the scene described a horrible collapse in the
early-morning hours when much of the campus was sleeping. Tommy
Balez, 20, an electrical engineering student who started working on
the pyramid around midnight, had taken a break about 50 yards away
when he heard a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a loud crack, then another loud crash when it went
over,'' Balez said. He spent more than 12 hours as part of a rescue
team. ``I'm staying until I know everybody is out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Lawson, an acting university spokeswoman, denied any
speculation that carousing by students might have contributed to
the collapse. ``There was no horsing around,'' she said. ``This is
very serious business. They were working, not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Thompson, a Texas A&AMP;M staff member assigned as a student
adviser on the bonfire project, who visited the site at about 10:30
Wednesday night, said he saw no indications at that time of any
problems. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, he said,
``There was no indication of anything unusual. It apparently
collapsed without warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students apparently told rescue officials that the center
log snapped at the beginning of the collapse. Thompson said the
center pole is actually two poles bolted together and wrapped in
about 600 feet of steel cable.

 &HT;    Gators await humbled Warrick
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Humility, particularly for someone young and
extremely talented, is never easy. But Florida State wide receiver
Peter Warrick says he has had a truckload of it dumped on him since
October.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, once the leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy, saw
that dream disappear with his Oct. 7 arrest on felony theft
charges. A cashier at a Dillard's department store in Tallahassee
sold him and fellow receiver Laveraneus Coles about $400 worth of
merchandise for about $21.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after he was charged, Warrick pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor, and he avoided jail time in his sentence. After a
two-game suspension, he returned for Florida State's game at
Clemson on Oct. 23. Then he went into a shell, on and off the
field, for several weeks. This week, he broke his silence with the
media and once again apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that a real man admits his mistakes, apologizes
and moves on,'' said Warrick, a senior from Bradenton, Fla.
``That's what I've tried to do. But it hasn't been easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick said he knew that public reaction to his behavior would
be negative. However, he never imagined that on talk shows across
the nation he would become the latest poster child for all that is
wrong with college athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those people can judge me until they've walked
in my shoes,'' Warrick said. ``I know what I did was wrong. I know
now that I'm a role model to young kids who look up to me. All I
can do is say I'm sorry and promise that I will never do anything
like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's return to the team after his suspension was in body
but not in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell that he was basically going through the motions
because he was hurting,'' offensive coordinator Mark Richt said.
``Pete has always set the tempo of our practices, because he was
the hardest-working guy out there. But he'd be the first one to
tell you that he wasn't all there.''
</P>
<P>
   After road games at Clemson and Virginia, during which Warrick
received less-than-warm receptions, Florida State returned home for
last week's game against Maryland. It was the final home game for
the Florida State seniors, and Warrick received the loudest ovation
when he was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick responded with nine catches for 134 yards in the
Seminoles' 49-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in a long time, the old Pete was back,''
quarterback Chris Weinke said. ``Just in time, too. Because now we
really neeed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick knows that the always-vociferous Florida fans will be
waiting for him Saturday at The Swamp. The Dillard's in Gainesville
is giving out shopping bags this week in honor of Warrick's
arrival. One entrepreneur has printed T-shirts with the words
``1999 Heistman'' on the front, with a picture of Warrick holding a
Dillard's bag. The shirts flew off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to stay focused,'' Warrick said. ``This team can
still win the national championship. I've lost the Heisman, but I
can do something about (winning a national title).''
</P>
<P>
   In last year's Florida game, Warrick was the difference. He
caught eight passes for 119 yards and a touchdown, and he threw for
a touchdown in Florida State's 23-12 win.
</P>
<P>
   If the Seminoles win Satuday, they will play in the Sugar Bowl
for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I came back to school _ to play (against Florida)
and to help us win a national championship,'' Warrick said. ``With
everything that's happened, I know this is the game that people
will remember me for.''

WITH CHECHEN WAR IN BACKGROUND, U.S. DELIBERATES CURBING AID TO
RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Texas)  (With EUROPE-TALKS) 
(js) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is quietly reassessing
whether to slow two major loan programs to Moscow as the war in
Chechnya accelerates and the two leading candidates for the
Republican presidential nomination call for a cutoff of aid to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In public, White House officials have said that they continue to
favor modest economic support for the Yeltsin government and that
termination of the aid could further destabilize Russia before two
major elections there. Sandy Berger, the national security adviser,
reiterated that position on Monday when he told reporters that
despite the Russian military offensive in Chechnya, it would not
``make sense for us to affect'' a forthcoming loan from the
International Monetary Fund, ``assuming the economic and
transparency criteria are met.''
</P>
<P>
   But within the administration, divisions on the question are
growing; advocates of both views say there is a movement to go slow
on two major loans _ one from the International Monetary Fund and
another from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a debate brewing in our government over
engagement versus disengagement for a year now,'' one senior
administration official said Thursday. ``But in recent weeks it has
gotten much more intense, and there are some strong voices for
disengagement.''
</P>
<P>
   The first issue is whether the United States should allow the
International Monetary Fund to release a long-delayed payment of
$640 million to keep Russia from defaulting on past monetary fund
loans. The money, part of a $4.5 billion program, would actually
never enter Russia; it would simply be transferred from one IMF
account to another.
</P>
<P>
   But its delivery would take economic pressure off Russia's
central bank, which officials in several departments of the
administration fear could send a political message that Moscow will
not have to pay a price for its continued military action in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that they are making the decision
on the merits, and are ignoring the political impact on Vice
President Al Gore, who played a major role in the development of
the administration's economic support program for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's staff appears increasingly worried about his
vulnerability on the issues, especially because Gov. George W. Bush
Jr. of Texas, the Republican front-runner, has said he will call
for a complete cutoff of the aid to Russia in a foreign policy
speech he is expected to deliver on Friday. And Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, Bush's leading challenger for the nomination, has already
opposed the loan while the war in Chechnya continues.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger issue is the Export-Import Bank loan, a half a
billion dollars for the export of U.S.-made oil equipment to
Russia. Unlike the monetary fund loan, this money would come
directly from an agency of the U.S. government. Again, it would not
go directly to Moscow but rather to U.S. companies supplying
Russian oil companies with equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it would constitute the first resumption of direct
U.S. aid to Moscow in more than a year, and officials say the
semi-independent Export-Import Bank has come under pressure from
the administration to put the loan on ``administrative hold,''
perhaps for a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   In both instances the administration is making the case that, at
the moment, the loans should be slowed for economic reasons that
have nothing to do with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   That enables it to avoid the question of whether it should seek
to cut off the money as an act of political protest over the
Chechen military campaign, as it did to Indonesia during the
violence in East Timor earlier this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the case of the monetary fund loan, lengthy negotiations with
Russia have yet to resolve some issues of ``transparency'' _ public
explanations of how Russia is spending money and regulating its
banks. The fund is insisting, for example, that Russia commit to a
public audit of Sberbank, a major bank owned by the government, and
make a series of amendments to its bankruptcy laws, among other
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time Russia has not met the economic criteria,'' said
one senior administration official deeply involved in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But asked whether Russia's behavior in Chechnya would be
considered in coming weeks, the official added, ``These things are
always complex and there is a desire to maintain flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two Export-Import Bank loans pending, both of which
have received preliminary approval from the bank's board of
directors and were referred to Congress for a 30-day review period,
now complete. The board is now free to approve the loans whenever
it feels ready. But that moment still seems weeks or months away,
and could be longer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deals involves $203 million in financing for the sale
of equipment and services by ABB Lummus Global Inc., a Bloomfield,
N.J., company, to update the Ryazan Oil Refinery near Moscow. The
second is $292 million in financing for exports by Halliburton Co.,
of Dallas, to rehabilitate the Samotlar oil field.
</P>
<P>
   The loans were controversial before the Chechen fighting because
the Russian company that will benefit, Tyumen Oil Co., is a player
in a complex takeover effort that involved the bankruptcy of
another oil company. The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, 10 percent controlled by the U.S. government, is a
major creditor of the bankrupt company.
</P>
<P>
   The European Bank has been involved in a long-running dispute
involving Tyumen. The case has already been in the Russian courts,
and it has involved charges that the bankruptcy was manipulated by
Russian oligarchs. Because of the on-going dispute, some
administration officials have argued against aiding Tyumen.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King has a new work out, but you won't be able to read
it. Like Tom Wolfe's ``Ambush at Fort Bragg'' in 1997, King's
``Blood and Smoke'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23.50) is available only as
an audiobook.
</P>
<P>
   King says the stories pick up where ``Quitters Inc.'' and ``The
10 O'Clock People'' leave off and focus on ``the horror of the evil
weed, tobacco. There are stories here that scared even me _
psychopathic killers, torture chambers, haunted hotel rooms ... and
wafting through each story, the deadly, seductive scent of
tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories, read by King himself, include ``1408,'' in which an
author accepts a challenge to spend a night in New York City's most
haunted hotel room _ without being able to smoke; ``In the
Deathroom,'' about a man held captive in a South American hideout;
and ``Lunch at the Gotham Cafe,'' a tale of a man going through
withdrawal symptoms from cigarettes and from his soon-to-be
ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the works: Former Miami Herald columnist Tannarive Due has
agreed to write a fictionalized narrative of the legendary Madam
C.J. Walker, the first black millionaire. ``The Black Rose,'' which
will be published by One World/Ballantine in June, was acquired as
part of a two-book deal. The second work, ``The Wisdom of Madam
C.J.,'' set for release in December 2000, will be a collection of
inspirational nonfiction. Due will continue the project begun by
``Roots'' author Alex Haley, who died in 1992. Walker, the daughter
of former Louisiana slaves, was orphaned at 7, worked as a domestic
until she was nearly 40, and then built a hair-care empire that
made her a millionaire by the time of her death at 51.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Orchids and Rose: Director Spike Jonze (``Being John
Malkovich'') has agreed to direct the film version of Susan
Orlean's book, ``The Orchid Thief.'' Originally a New Yorker
article, ``The Orchid Thief'' is an account of John LaRoche, a
legendary exotic plant poacher in Florida. Jonathan Demme's Clinica
Estetico productions bought film rights. ... Pete Rose wouldn't
tell NBC reporter Jim Gray, but he promises to reveal all in a
memoir that agent Frank Weiman is shopping to several publishers.
However, Steve Ross of Crown Publishers told the New York Daily
News that Rose does not address the gambling issue and, as far as
he could tell, there was nothing new in the book.

 &HT;    Billy Carter's son wants to set the record straight
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 21.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, Tenn. _ Most Americans who were around during Jimmy
Carter's presidency remember first brother Billy Carter as a
wisecracking, beer-guzzling good ol' boy.
</P>
<P>
   That was one image, but it wasn't the complete picture. At least
not to William ``Buddy'' Carter, who wants to set the record
straight about his father in his biography, ``Billy Carter: A
Journey Through the Shadows'' (Longstreet, $22).
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know he wasn't a joke, which is how the media
portrayed him,'' says Carter, 38, a landscaping foreman for the
city of Franklin. ``Most of the time he was photographed with a
beer in his hand. But he also was a shrewd businessman and a good
father. He read four newspapers a day and six or seven books a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a well-worn vinyl booth in Dotson's Cafe in downtown
Franklin, the slender, sunburned Carter munches on the meatloaf
special of the day and talks about what happened to his father when
a media circus descended on Plains as Jimmy Carter campaigned for
the presidency in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters discovered Billy Carter immediately. They hovered
around his service station, bought him beers and coaxed outrageous
comments out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he was quotable,'' the younger Carter acknowledges.
``Sometimes embarrassingly so. But in the beginning this was OK; it
was harmless. Then it wasn't long before pictures of him with a
Pabst Blue Ribbon in front of his face began appearing in
newspapers all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jimmy Carter was elected president, the media attention
escalated. And so did Billy Carter's drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the book, I talk about how he was an alcoholic,'' Carter
says. ``He always had been, but it was accelerated by the fame.
When somebody calls you up and says they'll pay you $10,000 a day
and fly you out to California and all you have to do is drink all
day and just talk off the top of your head, most people are gonna
agree to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Carter was having his own problems at the time. He admits
that he was rebellious and aimless. He worked hard at the family
peanut warehouse, but there were no father-and-son chats. Usually
his father would come home to read or sit silently in his favorite
chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody could figure him out,'' Carter says. ``Not even my
mother, who knew him better than anybody. And not the doctors in
the rehabilitation clinic at Long Beach when he went there for his
alcoholism. They tried to get inside his head, and they couldn't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Billy Carter died of
</P>
<P>
   cancer in 1988, any problems between father and son had been
resolved, the son says, but he still didn't understand his father
or the demons that had tormented him.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he could find answers by writing a biography of his
father. Initially it was going to be a traditional biography,
complete with historical details. But after digging through
newspaper clippings and TV tapes, he realized that all the research
was unnecessary. What he really wanted to do was write about how he
felt about his father. And he wanted to set the record straight
about who his father really was.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, says the son, Billy Carter was not a redneck
buffoon. He never hunted, cared little for wrestling or auto racing
and spent most of his free time reading.
</P>
<P>
   And, Buddy Carter adds, contrary to published reports, his
father was not an inept businessman who ran the family peanut
business into the ground. After Jimmy Carter became president,
Carter's Warehouse was placed in a blind trust, which left
management of the company in the hands of lawyers who knew nothing
about farming. Unable to influence the decisions of the management
team, Billy Carter quit the business and quietly accepted the
criticism when the company ended up $1 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no response to the book from the former
president, but reaction from the rest of the family has been
positive. Sybil Carter praises her son for portraying her husband
honestly, even though some of the memories are painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it took a lot for him to write the book,'' she says.
``But if you're going to present a true picture of someone, you
have to show warts and all. Billy was a very complex person, very
smart, but he had an illness. The book shows him in another light,
through his son's eyes in a way they may not have seen through the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter will return to Plains this month for book signings and to
visit his father's grave. And, as usual, he will take a beer with
him to the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' he says, staring into the distance, ``it's my way
of talking to him.''
</P>
<P>
   BOOK SIGNING
</P>
<P>
   William ``Buddy'' Carter will sign books Friday from 10 a.m. to

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``After Life'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Taketoshi Naito,
</P>
<P>
   Arata and Erika Oda.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Hirokazu Koreeda's quietly powerful look at
life, seen from the viewpoint of the dead. Newly deceased making
the jump to heaven are allowed to take only one memory. The film
includes nonactors recalling moments of their lives on-camera: A
listless day in an autumnal park. A secret tryst in a hotel room.
It's a very simple movie with a surprisingly complex emotional
undertow. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere but Here'' PG-13 (sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon
</P>
<P>
   and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   A monster of an Oscar-nomination machine. Both Susan Sarandon
and Natalie Portman deserve to be on the short list come Academy
Awards time for breathing fresh air into an all-too-familiar
mother/daughter act. Sarandon, the brassy, indomitable mom, brings
her teenage daughter (Portman) to Hollywood to become a star. The
plot is negligible, but the performances are the point. (ERG) 1
hour, 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bachelor'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris O'Donnell
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Chris O'Donnell plays Jimmy, a San Francisco playboy who loses
his girl, Anne (Renee Zellweger), then finds he'll inherit $100
million if he marries within 24 hours. A clumsy remake of Buster
Keaton's silent classic ``Seven Chances,'' it retains the
original's surreal image of thousands of potential brides chasing
the groom-to-be. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Taye Diggs,
</P>
<P>
   Nia Long and Morris Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Better than ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' In Malcolm D. Lee's
often funny, sexy and prickly new comedy-drama, Taye Diggs heads a
talented ensemble cast in a glossy wedding film punctuated with
soul-stirring music (Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder, Meshell
Ndegeocello, Maxwell), flurries of flesh and real dramatic bite.
The ensemble cast is all good. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak'' PG-13 (profanity, violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   A decent, disposable Martin Lawrence vehicle. He's a crook
posing as a cop to recover a $17 million diamond he stashed years
ago. Basically a series of quick skits, there's enough action
scenes to mollify audiences who can't get enough of gunfire and
breaking glass. While it doesn't exactly streak along, at 93
minutes ``Blue Streak'' gets the job done. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead'' R (profanity, violence and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Patricia Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Scorsese offers a savage, sorrowing look at a few days in
the life of a paramedic whose beat is Hell's Kitchen. As played by
Nicolas Cage, he's alcoholic, burnt-out and haunted by the spirits
of those he couldn't save. A kind-of romance with Patricia Arquette
doesn't work, but there's excellent work by John Goodman, Ving
Rhames and Tom Sizemore as Cage's various partners. (ERG) 2 hours,
1 minute. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy in Alabama'' PG-13 (violence, thematic material,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Melanie Griffith,
</P>
<P>
   David Morse and Lucas Black.
</P>
<P>
   An odd mix of civil rights drama and Southern Gothic comedy that
goes down just fine. The movie splits time between the wild
adventures of Lucille (Melanie Griffith), who breaks out of a small
Alabama town and heads west, and a graver story back home. Griffith
does her best work since ``Working Girl.'' Antonio Banderas'
direction throws off some sparks, even if it doesn't fully catch
fire. (SM) 1 hour, 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma'' R (profanity, sex-related dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   violence, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Damon and Linda Fiorentino.
</P>
<P>
   As if God can't take a joke, ``Dogma'' has already been
lambasted by a Catholic anti-defamation group and dumped by its
original studio Miramax (the indie Lions Gate picked it up). While
the film pulls no punches in roasting organized religion, it does
so with such minimal spunk and spare inventiveness you have to
wonder what all the fuss is about. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' R (violent anti-social behavior,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt
</P>
<P>
   and Helena Bonham Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Bound to be this fall's most controversial studio release, the
Brad Pitt-Edward Norton flick will have as many people loathing it
as liking it. Either reaction is justifiable. The film, about a
pack of guys beating each other to bloody pulps, is violent,
nihilistic, intoxicated by its own bad-boy humor. But it's still
one of those rare films that creates an electrifying alternate
universe onscreen. (SM) 2 hours, 21 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeremy Northam,
</P>
<P>
   Steve Zahn and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon get ``Happy.'' This sunny crowd-pleaser stars Jeremy
Northam and Steve Zahn as escaped convicts who hide out in a small
town by posing as a gay couple who stage beauty pageants for little
girls. A last-minute plot device is a bad idea, but by then the
picture has built up so much good will you can't help but go along.
The cast is excellent, especially William H. Macy as the sheriff.
(ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``House on Haunted Hill'' R (violence, gore, sexual images,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geoffrey Rush,
</P>
<P>
   Famke Janssen and Taye Diggs.
</P>
<P>
   A redo of the 1958 Vincent Price spookfest, it's a loud assault
on the senses and a (literal) bloody mess. But as a
meat-and-potatoes (or guts-and-eyeballs) scare machine, it has its
moments. Geoffrey Rush invites five strangers to spend the night in
a haunted house to win $1 million each. Then the gore begins. (SM)
1 hour, 55 minutes C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   More smoke than fire in this reality-based film about what
happened when former tobacco consultant Jeffrey Wigand (Russell
Crowe) agreed to tell his story on ``60 Minutes'' at the behest of
producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). Bergman gets the star
treatment (one senses a certain pandering to Pacino), but Wigand's
predicament is more riveting, with Crowe in an Oscar-worthy
performance. (ERG) 2 hours, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legend of 1900'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Tornatore's first English-language movie is an epic
poetic fable. Tim Roth stars as a piano prodigy born on an ocean
liner at the turn of the century who lives his entire life without
ever setting foot on land. The movie offers images so remarkably
stunning that they more than make up for the narrative excesses.
This is a picture for all of us at sea, seeking the courage and
faith to make that first step off the boat. (ERG) 2 hours. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Light It Up'' R (violent content and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Usher Raymond,
</P>
<P>
   Forest Whitaker
</P>
<P>
   and Vanessa L. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   They should have burned the script. Atlanta's Usher Raymond
leads students from a horribly overcrowded high school in taking a
cop hostage and demanding a good education. Every moment of painful
injustice is rendered in slo-mo. Every cry of anguish
ever-so-slowly erupts from some kid's wrenched guts. It's about as
soapy a movie as you're likely to see. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 43
minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Messenger:
</P>
<P>
   The Story
</P>
<P>
   of Joan of Arc'' R (graphic battles, a rape, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   When Joan (Milla Jovovich) rallies her troops to victory against
the British, the film has considerable visual oomph. But when the
sword play slows and the characters talk, you realize the film
doesn't know what to make of its heroine. It hedges its bets,
presenting her as equal parts saint and teenage fanatic. The result
is, pardon the term, half-baked. (SM) 2 hours, 21 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of the Heart'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep
</P>
<P>
   and Angela Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   The Meryl Streep Show _ and what a show it is. Streep and
director Wes Craven (``Scream,'') have delivered a rarity: an
inspirational movie that is actually inspirational. The film
follows a single mom (Streep) who overcomes reluctant kids,
confrontational parents and an indifferent school board in her
battle to teach violin to inner-city kids. It's a glorified TV
movie, but it's got Streep and that's all it needs. (ERG) 2 hours,
3 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and Redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' PG-13 (several scenes of shootings)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Casper Van Dien,
</P>
<P>
   Michael York, Catherine Oxenberg
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Ironside.
</P>
<P>
   Michael York and Casper Van Dien star in this overly talkative
tale reminiscent of the book of Revelation. As wealthy businessman
Stone Alexander, York steals and uses a secret biblical code to
effect a world takeover. The hammy Van Dien plays Gillen Lane, a
glam gadabout and motivational leader who uncovers York's plot and
must act to save the globe. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature
</P>
<P>
   directed by Kunihiko Yuyama.
</P>
<P>
   Hokey Poke. Based on the infinitely popular Japanese toy phenom,
the animated movie features Mewtwo, a Pokemon clone with psychic
powers who kapows his creators and starts cloning other Pokemons
into his personal arsenal for a world takeover. The movie has
intentionally stilted animation, uninspired music and lame jokes.
Includes the short cartoon ``Pikachu's Vacation.'' (Bob Longino) 1
hour, 29 minutes. F
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' PG-13 (violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton,
</P>
<P>
   Claire Danes and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Disney kid stuff. There's so much going on in this
astonishing, mystically complex animated epic from Japan that it
makes Wagner's Ring Cycle look like the Teletubbies. Essentially,
it's a ``once upon a time'' tale about the battle between nature
and civilization. Boldly innovative (often savagely so) yet eerily
innocent, it's the sort of thing you simply have to see for
yourself. (ERG) 2 hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' R (violence, sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Harrison Ford
</P>
<P>
   and Kristin Scott Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   A meandering mystery/drama/romance that never hits the right
groove. Harrison Ford is a cop and Kristin Scott Thomas a
congresswoman who discover their spouses, both killed in a plane
crash, were having an affair. The stars' ensuing romance never taps
beneath the surface. (SM) 2 hours, 11 minutes. C-

<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG) At area discount
theaters. 1 hour, 56 minutes. B

   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:
</P>
<P>
   The Magic Box'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Siegfried Fischbacher
</P>
<P>
   and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal. Siegfried and Roy _ those
hocus-pocus, Las Vegas glam guys _ star in this dumbfoundingly
watchable 3-D Imax that's girded like some weird Wagnerian opera.
Elephants disappear. Furry white tigers leap over your head. Giant
metal dragons spew fire. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't
die with Liberace. (Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and gore, a scene of sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp,
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. His latest is a blend of scary
swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with tongue
planted firmly in cheek. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane,
who's sent to investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy
Hollow. The movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's
single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women or children.
(SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-

<P>
   ``The Story of Us'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis
</P>
<P>
   and Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Reiner's breezy, laugh a lot, cry a lot, big hankie
of a movie with Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer as a couple
wondering if they'll survive after 15 years of marriage. It's a
steady stream of sex jokes, butt jokes and guy and gal pals
dispensing weak-willed truisms. It may not be deep, but it is
entertaining. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 38 minutes. C+

<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his 1966 John Deere riding mower more than
300 miles to reconcile with his estranged brother (Harry Dean
Stanton). The movie is a sublime celebration of America at its most
beautiful: kind, welcoming, gloriously eccentric. A perfect
Thanksgiving movie. (ERG) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' PG-13 (sex-related humor
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Molly Shannon,
</P>
<P>
   Will Ferrell and Elaine Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Saturday Night Live'' big-screen transfer that doesn't bite.
As the ebullient Catholic schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher,
Molly Shannon delivers a memorable mix of adolescent brazenness and
self-mortification. It's clear Shannon loves this character, but
she's never afraid to push the envelope of outrageousness, whether
talking baby talk to her breasts, or fantasizing that a tree is her
lover. (SM) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' R (graphic war violence, profanity,

<P>
   sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube play three U.S.
soldiers in the Persian Gulf War who go after Saddam Hussein's
stolen Kuwaiti gold. Their consciences are tested when they see
anti-Saddam civilians rounded up by Iraqi soldiers. While the
film's script cynically bashes George Bush's political stance, its
visuals pop with energy. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 51 minutes. B

<P>
   Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   This 19th 007 movie is more of the same old same old. Bond is
assigned by M (Judi Dench) to protect an heiress (Sophie Marceau)
and her oil pipeline from a nut-case terrorist (Robert Carlyle).
There's the usual eye-popping opening stunt sequence. It's as if
everyone involved knew how to make a Bond movie, but they were
thinking about something else at the time. (ERG) 2 hours, 8

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a throw-away line on NBC's ``West Wing,''
biting in its indictment of an inventive, sometimes outlandish bid
by Congress to spend taxpayer money. There, amid a list of
appropriations requests recited by a fictional White House aide,
was a gem: $2 million to monitor Alaskan skies for volcanic ash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are volcanos in Alaska?'' a ``West Wing'' aide asked,
smirking.
</P>
<P>
   Cue laughter and eye-rolling.
</P>
<P>
   But in the chandelier-studded offices of Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, who as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee
controls billions of dollars, the joke was not funny. That is
because the item was not a made-up bit of drama, something writers
of the series knew when they used it. It was a genuine Stevens
request and a sparkling example of the senator's mastery at
steering copious amounts of money to his home state.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Stevens has gotten so good at sending taxpayers' money
Alaska's way that he is threatening to outdo even the legendary
Sen. Robert Byrd in that department, a man whose name adorns many a
highway and building in his home state, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They laughed hysterically about that: $2 million to track
volcanic ash in Alaska,'' said Connie Godwin, Stevens' press
secretary. ``They would be lucky about the $2 million if they were
on that KLM plane 10 years ago that dropped thousands of feet
because of the ash it sucked in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by a fat economy and a budget surplus, this year
promises to set new records in Congress when it comes to funneling
taxpayer money to projects like counting walruses and fixing YMCA
swimming pools. Detractors call it pork, but those who benefit call
it filet mignon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest pork barbecue of all time, and
unfortunately, at this barbecue, it's the taxpayers who are getting
cooked,'' said Jim Campi, a spokesman for Citizens Against
Government Waste, an organization dedicated to eliminating
``pork,'' or the billions of dollars routed to projects back home
that among other things are not requested by the White House or
reviewed by a congressional committee. The organization's pork
busters will be busy tallying all the special projects in all the
final spending bills over the weeks to come, but right now,
Congress is primed to surpass last year's numbers easily, Campi
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the pork estimate in 7 of the 13 spending bills for the
fiscal year 2000 is $14.65 billion, Campi said, while the record
for pet projects, set in 1997, was a total of $14.5 billion. And
this under a Republican regime devoted to less government.
</P>
<P>
   For Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is seeking the presidential
nomination and has made pork-busting a mission, this increase in
pet projects, under Republican watch, ranks among his greatest
disappointments. He calls it an evil linked to special interest
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't judge the projects on their merits,'' McCain said. ``I
can judge the fact that the entire legislative process has been
turned on its head.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tussle for pet-project money, known as earmarks, few
lawmakers hold greater sway than the chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, the panel that divides billions of
dollars to keep the military churning, farmers afloat, research
institutions financed and highways built.
</P>
<P>
   For Stevens, the 76-year-old veteran of three decades in the
Senate, what is remarkable is not so much that he carves out
millions of dollars for projects in his home state, with the help
of the other two members of the Alaskan delegation, Sen. Frank
Murkowski and Rep. Don Young, who are also Republicans. It is that
he manages to do so despite the fact that his home state has about
the same number of people as Milwaukee, 614,000.
</P>
<P>
   In some places in rural southeast Alaska, townspeople are so
appreciative that they have dubbed the dollars ``Stevens money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been able to master the art of putting his state first
in line, even though it was the last to join the union,'' said
Marshall Wittmann, director of congressional relations for the
conservative research group, the Heritage Foundation. ``This was
the art of Byrd: take an underpopulated rural state and just pour
in millions upon millions of federal money.''
</P>
<P>
   Wittmann added, ``The joke was that the federal government was
going to move to Martinsburg, West Virginia, and now there is a
danger it will move to Anchorage.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Alaska received more money through earmarks per
person _ $273 _ than any other state, according to Citizens Against
Government Waste. Hawaii came in second, at $155. The national
average was $19. Mississippi led in earmarked money in 1998, thanks
to the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   This coming year could be a tossup between the two states,
considering the $375 million that Lott wrangled to begin building a
$1.5 billion Navy ship that the Pentagon never requested.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Stevens was gung-ho about pet projects ``because he
feels that Alaska has never been given the equal consideration that
other states have been given.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for Alaska, it will find itself with a bevy of new projects
in the new year, with some already signed into law, and others
waiting in the wings pending Senate approval. Stevens regularly
secures millions for projects in and around Alaska's military
bases, as well as for its fishing, oil and timber industries, and
millions more to create jobs, build highways and finance smaller
projects in communities.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, $900,000 for an airport on St. George's
Island, a speck of a place off Alaska's coast. There is $2.5
million to train Russian and other foreign workers in oil field
management in Alaska, $7.9 million to build the Alaska Maritime
National Wildlife Refuge and visitor center in Homer, $2.2 million
for a senior citizens center in Anchorage and $15 million for the
University of Alaska to study the aurora borealis, a perennial pet
projetevens.
</P>
<P>
   Military bases in Alaska also benefit. There is $9.5 million to
fix a highway at the Elmendorf Air Force Base, $12 million to
refurbish the barracks at Fort Richardson and another $13 million
to build a parking ramp for a C-130 there.
</P>
<P>
   Sea life, too, would be well tended. There is $100,000 to
conduct a census of Pacific walruses, $4 million to help stranded
sea lions and $5 million to monitor fish.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting fish and its fishermen ranks high on the list, with
millions of dollars earmarked for salmon related projects,
including $900,000 to the Bering Sea Fisherman's Association, which
is so well cared for by Stevens that it does not even have to
demand money for its struggling fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Stevens, God bless him,'' said Jude Henzler, the
executive director of the association, based in Anchorage. ``He's
been a godsend to the fisherman in general. You can't lard it on
too thick.''
</P>
<P>
   One amazing feat of Stevens this year is a request for $22
million in emergency financing over a three-year period for four
tiny towns in southeast Alaska that were hard hit by restrictions
on tree cutting.
</P>
<P>
   But in the spirit of ``one person's pork being another's prime
cut,'' as Wittmann, of the Heritage Foundation, put it, the money
has gone, and will go, a long way to helping these communities stay
alive. And this, Stevens' press secretary said, is the unspoken
value of pork, which the senator believes is categorized much too
broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Senator Stevens, we'd be in a lot of trouble
for sure,'' said Stan Filler, the mayor of Sitka, a southeastern
Alaska town of 8,000 people that suffered from the timber
industry's decline. Sitka would receive $4 million over three years
to set up new businesses and repair roads and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of years, we didn't get anything, flat nothing,''
Filler said. ``It wasn't like we were even here.''

 &HT;    Henry Gates set on putting Africa on the cultural map
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 21.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In the haze of memory, the night's marination
is clearer than any meal set before them or how the idea took
shape. It was at an Indian restaurant in London, sometime in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Louis Gates Jr. recalls that it was Wole Soyinka's order
of protocol that the number of bottles of wine brought to the table
be in direct proportion to the number of diners. Three sat down to
eat that evening 26 years ago, and ``we got drunk as skunks,''
Gates says.
</P>
<P>
   Indiscretion is more easily admitted to here when the passage of
years bathes it in the glow of youthful abandon. It helps, of
course, to have achieved something in the interim, and a Nobel
Prize for literature, in Soyinka's case, will do. Henry Louis Gates
at the time was a mere graduate student, and a lonely one at that.
He'd arrived at a place _ Cambridge University _ where African
literature wasn't recognized as a real course of study. Ask around
in the anthropology department, someone told him. Isn't that where
they study Africa?
</P>
<P>
   Gates, speaking recently to an hors d'oeuvre-nibbling,
wine-sipping audience at a Boston public television station, was
saying _ in so many words _ that it was a time in a young man's
life when he thinks grand thoughts, wants to do what hasn't been
done.
</P>
<P>
   And now he had done them, fulfillment of not only the quixotic
idea three black men drank to a quarter-century ago but also the
dream W.E.B. Du Bois had in 1909. Soyinka, the only one remotely
well-known at the time, noted that there was an Encyclopaedia
Britannica and an Encyclopedia Americana, but no Encyclopedia
Africana. It had been Du Bois' dream to validate Africa's cultural
worth to the world in just such a way.
</P>
<P>
   Because Du Bois did not live to see it realized, Soyinka said
that night, the obligation for seeing it through was left to others
_ to Africans like himself and Anthony Appiah, the third member of
their party that night, and to African-Americans like Henry Louis
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasms run high when the wine flows, and many a dreamy idea
is put forward, embraced with hearty approval and forgotten by the
time the tab comes around. But Henry Louis Gates swims ceaselessly
in ideas and projects, and now one had taken permanent possession
of him. They would produce the Black Britannica.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, Sir Kenneth Clark's television series
``Civilization,'' along with a book of the same title, captured a
huge popular audience. ``I wanted to do for Africa,'' Gates says,
``what it never would have occurred to Kenneth Clark to do.'' To
Clark no less than to Hume, Hegel and other Western thinkers
through the centuries, Africa had not yet seen civilization. It had
produced no Newton, no Shakespeare, no Dante, no Michelangelo, no
Leonardo, no Goethe. ...
</P>
<P>
   But Gates knew that it had had its glories, too, and that they
were a legitimate part of the human fabric. Ever since he was a boy
growing up in Piedmont, W.Va., a town of 2,000 in the panhandle of
that oddly picturesque state of mountain hollows and exhausted coal
fields, Skippy Gates' imagination was fired by romantic images of
ancient Nubian kings and queens in Africa, regal and beautiful,
powerful and mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   He was recounting all this to a very hoity-toity crowd of
perhaps 300 at WGBH, a good half of whom were black. They were
there for a preview of Gates' PBS series ``The Wonders of the
African World,'' as well as for a talk about the newly published
``Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American
Experience,'' edited by Gates and Appiah.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Gates had called to suggest I drop by for the
preview. My plane from Atlanta was scheduled to land in Boston half
an hour before it started, and I hadn't planned to travel in coat
and tie. ``How dressy is it?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeans are cool, man,'' Gates said. And then, as if further
assurance would seal it, he said, ``Hey, we all a bunch of
Negroes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was silk tie all the way, but Gates cannot help
being disarming and ingratiating in the same breath. He is that way
in public and in private, a self-confessed ``race'' man who doesn't
believe in race as a biological condition, a man who ``loves
everything about African-American culture'' but wears a neatly
pressed white shirt every day, a black man who had a white
girlfriend in elementary school, another in high school and today
is married to a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   If they are contradictions, they help to explain why Henry Louis
Gates has rapidly become a black man for all seasons, showing up on
PBS, in The New Yorker, on the op-ed page of The New York Times
and, now, on book tours promoting ``Wonders of the African World,''
the companion volume to the PBS series, and ``Africana.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year he was elected to the American Academy of Arts
and Letters, and last year he was chosen as a member of the
Pulitzer Prize committee.
</P>
<P>
   He is everywhere. Plop him down in Ethiopia and who does he run
into in the hotel lobby but Louis Farrakhan, clearly surprised and,
a viewer gathers, not enormously pleased. ``I knew he didn't like
the piece I wrote about him in The New Yorker,'' Gates says in his
Harvard office, ``but I asked one of his bodyguards if I could get
a few minutes with him. He's looking at me through those dark
glasses and says with absolutely no expression in his voice, `If
you think he's going to let your jive-ass interview him, you're
crazy.'''
</P>
<P>
   But of course he did, and the strained exchange on camera _
suspicion and dislike transparent through the icy civility _ is one
of the humorous moments in ``Wonders of the African World.'' It is
also, in its way, typical of Gates _ open to everyone, black or
white. Not only does he bump into the minister of the Nation of
Islam, but on the same trip he buttonholes the archbishop of
Canterbury and the patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church. All
are in Ethiopia because of reports that the ark of the covenant _
housed in the temple built by King Solomon, lost after the temple
was destroyed by the Babylonians in 581 B.C. _ is buried in the
ancient Ethiopian town of Axum. Whether the claims are true or not,
they reaffirm for Gates the centrality of Africa in the human
family and in the march of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Africa itself means more to him than the sanctity of
the blood. ``My ethnicity is not the most important thing about
me,'' he says. ``In my classes, I ask my students: `When you're on
your deathbed, do you think you're going to be thinking about what
race you were?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had a hip replaced last year, the last thing on my mind
was my blackness. I was wondering if I was going to wake up from
anesthesia. What do you think about when you're in love? You want
to know if she loves you, not if she loves your black self.''
</P>
<P>
   They are questions _ Love &AMP; Death _ closer to the bone than to
skin pigment.
</P>
<P>
   The man saying these things is the same man who, when he was
applying for admission to Yale University, wrote in his Personal
Statement: ``My grandfather was a colored man, my father is a Negro
and I am black.'' (``If that doesn't get their attention, nothing
will,'' he thought.)
</P>
<P>
   But aren't we, someone asks him, greater than the sum of our
demographic parts _ our race, our sex, our ethnicity? He pauses.
``That's a good way of putting it,'' he says. ``You would like to
think so. Race shouldn't matter, but it does. It does because of
slavery and segregation.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 49, Gates is a caramel-colored man for whom race is
essential, perhaps even primary, but not all-defining. His
sentences are often punctuated by an infectious sotto voce chuckle.
``Skip is the happiest, most joyful, optimistic person I've ever
met,'' Sharon Adams, his wife of 20 years, says. They met in 1972
when both were campaigning for former West Virginia Gov. Jay
Rockefeller. ``He loves people. It comes from having had fantastic
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In his gold wire-rimmed glasses, he can convey a teasing
impishness but more often a sense of being comfortable in his own
skin. He calls himself an African-American, but says, ``I don't
believe liberation lies in what we call ourselves.'' Race, for
Gates, is more a question of historical and cultural heritage than
blood pride. ``If you're counting heads,'' he says, ``I got as many
white ancestors as black,'' and he reaches for a picture on a
credenza behind his desk. ``Look at my father,'' he says. In the
picture, Henry Louis Gates Sr., 86, a paper mill worker who worked
nights as a janitor to send his two sons to school, is shown
alongside Skip and Paul Gates and their late mother. They are all
light and yet black at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard University, barely 10 years after becoming prominent
in the small and remote galaxy of literary criticism, Henry Louis
Gates is almost an industry unto himself _ W.E.B. Du Bois professor
of the Humanities, chairman of the department of Afro-American
Studies, recruiter of faculty members, speakers, benefactors. In an
atmosphere that takes eminence for granted, Henry Louis Gates is
something more. He is a bona fide star, known not just within the
academy but in the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fish, the former chairman of Duke University's
much-publicized English department, is as responsible as anyone for
launching Gates' career. Gates was teaching English at Cornell
University in the late '80s when Fish, now dean of the College of
Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois-Chicago,
spotted him at a meeting of the Modern Language Association. ``My
first impression of him was that this is an incredibly energetic
person,'' Fish says. ``He tossed out ideas and projects faster than
anyone I've known. I told him I wanted him to come to Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish's livery came to include a number of high-profile
academics, and their salaries created considerable sticker shock
elsewhere in the university. Gates may have been the least
well-known at the time; he may be the only one whose name still
rings a bell.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not a happy experience, at least for Gates. ``I don't
think Duke was prepared for him in any sense,'' Fish says. ``When
you hire Skip Gates, in a sense you're hiring Skip Gates
Enterprises.''
</P>
<P>
   If Duke wasn't sure that's what it wanted, Harvard was. ``One
day the phone rang,'' Gates says, ``and it was Harvard. Listen,
getting out of Duke was like getting out of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he left, he became the larger cultural figure he is today.
The speed of his ascent has led some to see in him a streak of
self-promotion. Ali Mazrui, a professor of political science and
African studies at the State University of New York at Binghamton,
calls himself a friend of Gates' although he is no fan of his PBS
special. ``There's a striking and gifted entrepreneur in him,'' he
says. ``The fact that he moved from Cornell to Duke to Harvard so
fast should be evidence of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others view him more generously. ``He's very strong on
African-American achievements,'' Fish says, ``but he took care from
the beginning to distance himself from the stronger forms of
Afrocentrism and from those forms that are tied to anti-Semitism.
Skip would be comfortable in a conversation with the
poststructuralists, the feminists, the deconstructionists and all
the other `ists,' but he also gets along with conservatives _
except perhaps for people on the far right like Thomas Sowell and
Shelby Steele.''
</P>
<P>
   His flexibility and independence have made him what Fish calls
``a national social critic.'' ``His pieces in The New Yorker are
chock-full of information and just brimming with intelligence
without knocking you over the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates' book ``The Signifying Monkey,'' an exercise in literary
criticism, won an American Book Award in 1989, but you sense that
he is happier bestriding several worlds. Late on an October
afternoon he hangs up the phone in his office and says, ``That was
The New York Times. They're going to run my op-ed piece.'' The
piece is an argument for bringing more black content _ more color,
you could say _ to the Internet as a means of attracting
African-Americans. As the Internet becomes more a part of American
life, Gates is troubled by what he calls a digital divide _ whites
online, blacks largely not online.
</P>
<P>
   The same week, in New York, he will be speaking alongside the
other Gates _ Bill _ at a symposium addressing the issue. ``It's
going to be the Gates Brothers,'' he says. ``You should come up and
catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Five o'clock has come and gone, and Gates is getting ready to
leave for the day. In a few hours the first episode of ``The
Wonders of the African World'' will air. He ducks his head into the
next-door office of Cornel West, the African-American philosopher
and social critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What're you doing tonight?'' Gates asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to watch the show,'' West says.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon over and watch it at our house,'' Gates says.
</P>
<P>
   Stars hang out with stars.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gates is the best-known African-American intellectual in
the country, he is not every black intellectual's cup of tea. For
some, he has played to a white gallery, and succeeded all too well.
A few days after ``The Wonders of the African World'' aired,
postings on the Internet gave voice to a resentment that would not
have been heard five or six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been receiving a lot of e-mail from colleagues _
specialists in Africa on one level or another,'' says
SUNY-Binghamton professor Mazrui. ``They were overwhelmingly
critical, many of them angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Few could have been more critical than Mazrui's own posting,
which says in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the TV series is more divisive than the book. The
first TV episode sings the glories of ancient Nubia
(understandably) but at the expense of dis-Africanizing ancient
Egypt. On the evidence of a European guide, Gates allows ancient
Egyptians to become racist whites trampling underfoot Blacks from
Upper Nile. Are ancient Egyptians no longer Africans?''
</P>
<P>
   Gates has heard the criticism. ``That's fine. I'm sure not
everyone agrees with everything I write,'' he says. ``But there's a
group of people who don't believe in airing dirty laundry in
public.'' He means, in particular, his interview with Akosua Perbi,
a historian at the University of Ghana at Legon. Africans, Perbi
told Gates, had engaged in slavery long before the Europeans
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It is a delicate question, seldom discussed with candor. ``It's
easier to blame the Europeans,'' Gates says. Perbi also explains
how the system of slavery that existed in Africa was not based on
race, and why it was not always a permanent condition of life or
the fate of the slave's children. Then came the Europeans, and they
brought to it real brutality. But there could have been no
trans-Atlantic slave trade without the complicity of West Africans
rulers and merchants who profited from the sale of human beings to
the Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a scholar,'' Gates says. ``I welcome debate. But if these
people have a problem with what Akosua Perbi said, they need to
take it up with her.''
</P>
<P>
   He is sitting in his Harvard office, on a campus where, a
quarter-century ago, the history and cultural heritage of Africa
meant little more than it did at Cambridge. ``I'm a `race' man, as
they used to say, but I get paid to teach courses in
African-American literature,'' Gates says. ``And I love it. It's
got a double charge. It excites me intellectually, and it enables
me to make a political statement.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's more important to know what people thought and did than
what they looked like, then Africa has its own repository of
achievement _ and cruelty _ like Europe and every other continent.
If not all of it is heroic, ``why should we expect history in
Africa to be less messy than it is anywhere else.'' For Henry Louis
Gates, what matters more is that it is not a curiosity or an
aberration but a part of the human story _ and thus a story in
which we mutually share.

 &HT;    `1900' awash in bittersweet beauty
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are moments so remarkable in ``The Legend of 1900'' that
they more than make up for the movie's narrative excesses. One such
moment occurs early in the film. As Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince), our
down-and-out narrator who once played trumpet aboard a luxury
liner, recalls, ``It was always one guy alone. He'd see her first
and he'd just stand there, his heart racing and every damn time
he'd turn to the ship and scream `America!'''
</P>
<P>
   And as Max speaks, we see on screen a giant ocean liner named
the Virginia, filled to the brim with cheering turn-of-the-century
immigrants, passing under the fog-enshrouded gaze of the Statue of
Liberty. The juxtaposition is so breathtakingly over the top that,
for a brief moment, cynicism seeps through and you wonder whether
Barbra Streisand is spread-eagled on the prow, a la ``Funny Girl.''
But then you give in to the sheer operatic audacity of the shot.
That's the kind of movie this is, and if you're not romantic enough
to take it, best take a pass.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first English-language film for Italian director
Giuseppe Tornatore, who had such a success stateside with his
``Cinema Paradiso.'' Tornatore calls his movie a ``poetic fable,''
and it's so unabashedly emotional, so lushly overdone (even with a
good half-hour dropped for the U.S. release), that you have to
think subtitles might've helped. But the director has the
confidence of his countryman, Sergio Leone. Max could be speaking
for Tornatore when he says, ``You're never really done for as long
as you've got a good story and somebody to tell it to.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``Legend'' is one heck of a good story. It begins in the
year 1900. A genial stoker (Bill Nunn) on the Virginian finds an
abandoned baby in the ship's ballroom. Naming him after the year _
hence the off-kilter title _ he raises him aboard ship. Officially,
the lad doesn't exist; he's an ocean-born being, a fact that will
shape his entire life.
</P>
<P>
   This 1900 grows up to be a piano prodigy (Tim Roth) whose talent
is so prodigious that no less than jazz legend Jelly Roll Morton (a
peacock-perfect Clarence Williams III) challenges him to a piano
duel (like the Statue of Liberty scene, it's another of the film's
astonishing set pieces).
</P>
<P>
   On board the Virginian, anything seems possible for 1900. He has
his music. He has an enthralled audience every crossing. He has
friends like Max, who joins the ship's band. What he doesn't have
is the ability to set foot on land. He is a true creature of the
sea _ apart, disconnected, viewing life from the safety of a piano
bench or a ship's deck. In some ways he's as sadly isolated as
Quasimodo perched among Notre Dame's spires.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can get him to leave. Not Max's entreaties. Not a record
producer's offers of fame and fortune. Not even an enigmatic,
beautiful girl who represents all the promise of the unknown. The
ship begins as 1900's floating cradle and ends, metaphorically and
more, as his floating crypt.
</P>
<P>
   Not given much in the way of dialogue or character, Roth goes
for a kind of sober Stan Laurel impersonation _ a genial but
impossible-to-read innocent. Vince handles the often overripe
narration with conviction and a kind of Depression-era panache. But
for the most part, this is a movie about dreams and images and
choices. In one haunting sequence, a poor steerage passenger who's
been buffeted by one tragedy after another encapsulates the
optimism essential to the human condition when he tells 1900,
``Life is immense. Change life. Start fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   How to follow this advice is the movie's central theme. In a
sense, ``The Legend of 1900'' is a film for all of us at sea,
seeking the faith and courage to take that first step off the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legend of 1900''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Roth. Directed by Giuseppe Tornatore. Rated R for
profanity. 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A visually stunning fable for poetically minded movie lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects: Lajos Koltai's cinematography, Francesco
Frigeri's art direction and Maurizio Millenotte's costumes.

 &HT;    Chilling special effects and a touch of humor cast their spell
as the Headless Horseman rides again
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the head-rollingly entertaining ``Sleepy Hollow,'' director
Tim Burton returns to peak form, delivering the best Hammer horror
movie that never was. A blend of scary swordplay, witchcraft and
self-spoofing humor, it's a brew served with tongue planted firmly
in cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Like Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and Pedro Almodovar,
Burton is among the few working directors who create a signature
climate in their movies, from ``Pee-Wee's Big Adventure'' through
his unbalanced (but still fun) ``Mars Attacks!'' ``Hollow'' unfolds
in a landscape that's like a John Constable painting forested with
the tortured trees you find in fairy tales illustrated by Arthur
Rackham. The constant mist is the same ghostly gray as the sheep in
the fields, and sunlight almost never touches the scene. (Much of
the movie was shot on sound stages.)
</P>
<P>
   This is the gloomy upstate New York setting, circa 1799, where
Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent by his superior (a cameo by
Christopher Lee, longtime star of those 1960s Hammer films). In
Washington Irving's story, Ichabod was a teacher, but here he
undergoes a career change. He's now a constable investigating tales
of the Headless Horseman, a phantom blamed for three deaths, and
soon to cause a whole bunch more, despite the presence of the
big-city detective.
</P>
<P>
   One of the movie's running jokes is that the fastidious, fussy
Ichabod's forensic assessment of the situation is usually two or
three steps behind the townsfolks'. These Hollowites include
Ichabod's host, Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), his wife
(Miranda Richardson) and daughter, Katrina (Christina Ricci), who
gravitates toward the pallid newcomer despite the jealous
attentions of her cousin Brom (Casper Van Dien).
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the cast are character actors Jeffrey Jones, Ian
McDiarmid and Michael Gough as leaders of the town, who clearly
know more than they care to reveal. Burton's girlfriend, Lisa
Marie, turns up in dream scenes as Ichabod's spell-casting mother,
and Christopher Walken (fitted with pointy teeth and creepy contact
lenses) plays the Headless Horseman in flashbacks (prior, natch, to
his own decapitation).
</P>
<P>
   Among the movie's memorable images are a levitating witch and a
witch whose eyes pop out on stalks, a portal to hell that allows
the Horseman (fully mounted) to make spectacular entrances, a
bagful of ghoulish medical instruments for Ichabod, eerie
pumpkin-headed scarecrows, and an iron maiden that gushes more
blood than the elevators at the Overlook Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   While many of these sights are distinctly Burton's babies, he
draws on other movies for inspiration. An action scene in a creaky
windmill pays tribute to James Whale's ``Frankenstein,'' which
Burton previously quoted in his short ``Frankenweenie.'' The dank
storybook setting recalls the atmosphere of Neil Jordan's Freudian
fairy tale, ``The Company of Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kevin Walker's script blends the convoluted and the
intentionally predictable. It's easy to guess the identity of the
behind-the-scenes villain just by noticing the way a key character
is shoved into the background for half the movie. But that seems to
be Burton's point: ``Sleepy Hollow'' is less about whodunit than
how it's done. The fun comes from the collaborative work of the
full film team: production designer Rick Heinrichs' textured gray
sets, Colleen Atwood's lush costumes and Danny Elfman's shivery
score.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's steady comic relief is a useful balance for the
Horseman's single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women
nor children. Burton stages these action scenes with impressive
timing and a casual brutality as precise as the blade that keeps
whacking off heads. It helps that the Horseman's fight scenes and
stunts are performed with athletic menace by Ray Park, whose Darth
Maul was one of the few bright spots in ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   In his third film with Burton, Depp has a fine time repeatedly
getting things wrong, or going into a virginal dither at the sight
of a spider. His hysterical reaction after an encounter with the
Horseman is a comic highlight. In a departure from her usual
snide-teenager roles, Ricci gets to play an old-fashioned heroine
(with a few tricks up her sleeve); her blond wig and porcelain skin
give her the glow of a Botticelli goddess.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was reportedly upset that ``Hollow'' got an R rating, but
the frequent head-loppings _ and their realism, thanks to sharp
special effects _ justify that ruling. The decapitations include an
uncredited star of an earlier Burton film, losing his head in a
prologue that sets up the movie's wicked sense of humor, galloping
momentum, and ability to scare and surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Michael Gambon and
Miranda Richardson. Directed by Tim Burton. Rated R for graphic
horror violence and gore, and for a scene of sexuality. At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Heads up: Tim Burton is back.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar potential: It's
</P>
<P>
   strongest in the produc-
</P>
<P>
   tion categories such as
</P>
<P>
   costumes, art direction, dramatic score and special effects.

 &HT;    Bond's `World' is not enough
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pierce Brosnan is so likable as James Bond because he believes
in James Bond. Timothy Dalton didn't believe; he almost sneered.
Roger Moore made Bond a joke. And Sean Connery ... well, he doesn't
need to believe. He was, is and will forever be Bond, whether he
likes it or not.
</P>
<P>
   But Brosnan, despite rumors that he was tired of the role,
clearly still buys into the whole Agent 007 bit _ from the
outrageous stunts to the outlandish double entendres.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, even Brosnan isn't enough to rescue ``The World Is Not
Enough.'' Though it boasts some of the classiest credentials ever
attached to the series _ director Michael Apted (``Coal Miner's
Daughter,'' ``28 Up'') and actors Judi Dench (``Shakespeare in
Love''), Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle _ the movie seems dated
and confused. As if everyone involved knew how to make a Bond
movie, but they were thinking about something else at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The picture opens with the usual bang. It's a thrilling set
piece that sends speedboats racing through the middle of London.
Then it settles into the expected groove. Agent 007 sparring with M
(Dench), Q's gadgets, beautiful women and lots of opportunities for
the stuntmen and second unit to strut their stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, if it matters, has to do with rival pipelines being
built to send oil westward from Central Asia. After Marceau's
father, an old chum of M's, is murdered by a nut-case terrorist
(Carlyle), Bond is assigned to protect her and her pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   He does both without much help from either Apted or the
by-the-numbers script. Brosnan is game, but you have to think that,
after the success of ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' he may want to
switch to a different 1960s sex-symbol franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the best thing in the movie is Denise Richards
(``Starship Troopers,'' ``Wild Things'') as a nuclear scientist
wearing tight tank tops and short shorts. Not only does she have a
nostalgia-perfect sex-kitten pout, but she delivers her lines in a
flat centerfold-wannabe monotone. Because she showed that she can
act in last summer's ``Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' you can't help but
wonder whether the cardboard characterization is intentional. If
so, it's absolutely brainy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle.
Directed by Michael Apted. Rated PG-13

 &HT;    Hollywood rolls out the big guns, from an encore of those
quirky, comic toys to heavy-hitting dramas
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 21.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ollywood is planning on ushering in the new year with a Y2 KO.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best family films in years kicks off the holiday
season. Disney's ``Toy Story 2,'' opening Wednesday, is a nonstop
visual joy ride punctuated with plenty of laughs to last through
infinity and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   As the '90s close, film biographies are also coming on strong.
Jim Carrey dons the impish, cunningly wacko veneer of stand-up
enigma Andy Kaufman for December's ``Man on the Moon,'' laced with
new songs from R.E.M. Denzel Washington makes a potent case for a
best actor Oscar nomination for his blistering portrayal of boxer
Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter in ``The Hurricane.'' And three young
unknowns play writer Frank McCourt in ``Angela's Ashes,'' director
Alan Parker's moving and sometimes devastating version of the
author's immensely popular memoirs of his impoverished childhood in
1930s-'40s Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz is building for Tom Hanks' ``The Green Mile,'' another
prison drama from the makers of ``The Shawshank Redemption.'' And
you'll be seeing massive Oscar campaigns for Jodie Foster's lavish
remake of ``Anna and the King,'' Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow's
unsettling character thriller ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' and
Oliver Stone's pro football drama ``Any Given Sunday,'' fronted by
Al Pacino in his tour de force follow-up to ``The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   We've snagged several early peeks at the more than 30 films
coming to metro Atlanta between now and early January. Here's a
rundown (as always, opening dates are subject to change):
</P>
<P>
   `RIDE WITH THE DEVIL'
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   You expect detail from director Ang Lee. The resonating crunch
of frozen water under a young boy's footsteps as ``The Ice Storm''
nears its painful conclusion. Hugh Grant's perfect-pitch, bumbling
discourse in ``Sense and Sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lee has turned a perceptive ear and lens toward the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ride With the Devil,'' Lee's third English-language film,
stars Tobey Maguire (center), Jeffrey Wright (left), pop's
neo-folky Jewel (right) and Skeet Ulrich in a finely tuned
remembrance of the Union-Confederate struggle in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The characters' diction twists on the gentle formality of the
period. ``Our horses' backs remain our only residences,'' one
character says in relating how teen and twentysomething boys and
men band to fight on the conflict's frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Gripping fight scenes contain the same sort of audible zing-ping
bullet trajectories moviegoers heard in ``Saving Private Ryan.''
And off the battlefield, ``Devil'' is unhurried in its intricate
depiction of a young man's coming of age under extreme
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   `ANGELA'S ASHES'
</P>
<P>
   Opens in December in Los Angeles and New York; Jan. 7 in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCourt's popular memoirs about growing up in impoverished
Ireland arrives on the big screen as bleak and beautiful as fans
might hope for.
</P>
<P>
   Three talented young actors portray McCourt through more than a
decade of his ``miserable Irish childhood,'' brimming with death,
the sting of regional hatred and adult alcoholism. And following
Oscar nominations for last year's ``Hilary and Jackie'' and her
1996 breakout film ``Breaking the Waves,'' Emily Watson (from left,
with Ciaran Owens and Robert Carlyle) could well find herself in
the running again for her authoritative performance as McCourt's
mom.
</P>
<P>
   At times nearly as heartbreaking as Francois Truffaut's ``The
400 Blows,'' ``Ashes'' is also infused with sweet humor (McCourt
prays to ``the Father, the Son and the holy toast'') and the warm
glow in a boy's eyes as he watches a bigger-than-life James Cagney
in ``Public Enemy'' at a ramshackle Limerick moviehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Director Alan Parker (``The Commitments,'' ``Mississippi
Burning'') says he was determined to make the film after reading
McCourt's book. ``It was the beauty of Frank's writing. I thought
it was incredibly engaging and had incredible heart. In Frank's
very Irish way he also made it very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   And Parker was committed to making it authentic, right down to
Limerick's foggy, watery weather that contributed so much to the
period's health problems. ``We did have rain machines in pretty
much every scene,'' he says. ``There were a lot of damp, soggy
feet. For three months I didn't talk to the crew without somebody
blowing their nose at me.''
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE'
</P>
<P>
   Opens in December in Los Angeles and New York; Jan. 14 in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington is on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   This month, his new serial killer thriller ``The Bone
Collector'' opened as the No. 1 movie at the box office. He's in
metro Atlanta filming the Disney football flick ``Remember the
Titans'' for producer Jerry Bruckheimer. ``60 Minutes'' plans to
profile him in January.
</P>
<P>
   And in the middle of it all, he'll unveil ``The Hurricane.'' He
plays Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the talented boxer unjustly
imprisoned for decades for a crime he didn't commit. Directed by
Norman Jewison (``In the Heat of the Night''), it's easily
Washington's best performance since he won an Oscar as the ex-slave
soldier Trip in 1989's ``Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington added muscle mass and a 10-ton attitude to play the
sometimes hot-tempered, often gentle, spiritual Carter.
</P>
<P>
   He's backed by a solid supporting cast, including Rod Steiger,
David Paymer, Dan Hedaya and, especially, Vicellous Reon Shannon as
the teen who corresponds with Carter in prison and believes in his
innocence.

 &HT;    Holiday movies first look
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are more early looks and updates on select holiday movies.
As always, opening dates are subject to change. Unless otherwise
noted, material is written by movie critic Bob Longino.
</P>
<P>
   ``TOY STORY 2''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Who would ever think Tim Allen could upstage Tom Hanks? Allen's
Buzz Lightyear may get second billing to Hanks' Woody, but he
steals the sequel. This boisterous, fun, computer-animated frolic
moves at light speed as Woody is captured by a toy rustler, and a
commando team of little Andy's playthings, led by Buzz, goes to the
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``LAST NIGHT''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   David Cronenberg (``eXistenZ,'' ``Dead Ringers'') joins an
ensemble cast in Canadian filmmaker Don McKellar's oddly funny,
certainly peculiar vision of what people might say, think and feel
in the final hours leading up to the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``TUMBLEWEEDS''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The mother-daughter films just keep coming. Janet McTeer and
young newcomer Kimberly J. Brown turn in fine performances as a
family duo heading west after yet another of mom's failed
relationships. McTeer's portrayal _ a combination of sultry
seductress and staunch protector in full Southern drawl _ is
especially effective. The English-born actress won a Tony for the
Broadway revival of ``A Doll's House'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GREEN MILE''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment Weekly already seems to be handing the Oscar to
Tom Hanks' Depression-era prison drama, directed by Frank Darabont
(``The Shawshank Redemption''). Hanks plays a death row guard
mesmerized by a hulking convicted killer (Michael Clarke Duncan)
with apparent mystical powers. Audience test responses reportedly
have been through the roof. And that's with an unsettling scene
involving a botched electric chair execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``ANNA AND THE KING''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 53 years since Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison filmed the
story of a 19th-century governess in the Siamese court, based on
Margaret Landon's memoirs. It was followed by two musicals _ an
unforgettable one (1956) starring Oscar winner Yul Brynner and an
animated version (1999) best described as forgettable. Now, Jodie
Foster and Chow Yun-Fat take the lead roles in a showy production
with an estimated budget of $65 million. With a PG-13 rating,
expect a big family push.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CIDER HOUSE RULES''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Purists may miss the hunks of plot that don't make it onscreen
in this streamlined version of the novel, adapted by author John
Irving himself. But director Lasse Hallstrom (``My Life as a Dog'')
delivers a well-crafted tale that visually makes the most of its
New England setting. The ubiquitous Tobey Maguire plays the orphan
Homer, who's taught by the orphanage's Dr. Larch (Michael Caine)
how to deliver babies, and also, illegally, perform abortions.
Charlize Theron plays the daughter of a fisherman, and the
instrument of Homer's sentimental (and sexual) education. The
movie's standout: Caine's tender, surprisingly modulated
performance. (Steve Murray)
</P>
<P>
   ``MAN ON THE MOON''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the only comedian more bizarre than Jim Carrey was Andy
Kaufman, who died in 1984 at age 35. Carrey and what seems like the
whole team from ``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' _ director Milos
Forman, co-star Courtney Love and screenwriters Scott Alexander and
Larry Karaszewski _ have made this cryptic movie bio. Among the
film's potential Oscar nominations: R.E.M.'s music. Many from the
cast of ``Taxi,'' the TV series in which Kaufman co-starred, play
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``ANY GIVEN SUNDAY''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone's pro football film about the fictitious Miami
Sharks has had many player cuts. Like Tom Arnold and Sean ``Puffy''
Combs. And David Duchovny and Ving Rhames (both for reported
scheduling conflicts). The cast is still a heady list: Al Pacino,
Dennis Quaid, Lauren Holly, Cameron Diaz, James Woods, Jamie Foxx,
Lawrence Taylor, LL Cool J, Mickey Rourke, Ann-Margret and Charlton
Heston. Among the touchstones:
</P>
<P>
   racism and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``MAGNOLIA''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Director Paul Thomas Anderson's follow-up to ``Boogie Nights''
has been a hush-hush project from the get-go. The film's Web site
details the story line in the same manner as the trailer: It just
doesn't give much away. Basically, it's a family and friends story
where relationships need mending. And, apparently, frogs fall from
the sky. The big ensemble cast (Julianne Moore, William H. Macy and
Jason Robards among them) includes Tom Cruise playing a sleazy
late-night infomercial sex-advice guy. Originally Cruise was cast
in a bit part, but it mushroomed to a reported 45
</P>
<P>
   minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``MANSFIELD PARK''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Jane Austen's novel, it's another love story among the
English upper class. Frances O'Conner portrays Fanny Price, a poor
relation sent to live with rich relatives in Northamptonshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``LIBERTY HEIGHTS''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Levinson's latest take on Baltimore involves a Jewish
family in the era of school desegregation and the birth of rock
music. Among those in the ensemble cast: Joseph Mantegna and Bebe
Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   A touch of evil with all the right players. And filmed in Italy
to boot. Matt Damon (Oscar-winning screenwriter for ``Good Will
Hunting''), Gwyneth Paltrow (``Shakespeare in Love'' best actress
Oscar) and Anthony Minghella (``The English Patient'' best director
Oscar) star. Plus, there's Jude Law and Cate Blanchett. It's the
existential tale of a young, ambitious American (that would be
Damon) who schemes and kills his way into a privileged lifestyle.
Based on the book by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote ``Strangers
on a Train.''
</P>
<P>
   ``FANTASIA 2000''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Jan. 1
</P>
<P>
   It's out with much of the old (but not, of course, Mickey
Mouse's ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice'') as Disney's 1940 classical
music masterpiece gets an overhaul with many new scenes. And it
plays on the big, big screen _ Imax. James Levine conducts the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``SNOW FALLING
</P>
<P>
   ON CEDARS''
</P>
<P>
   Opens Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Director Scott Hicks' anticipated follow-up to ``Shine'' stars
Ethan Hawke, Max von Sydow and Youki Kudo in a visually stunning if
emotionally underwhelming adaptation of the best-selling novel.
Hicks creates a fluid, moody mosaic that shifts back and forth in
time in its look at small-town racism toward Japanese-Americans in
the 1940s. (Steve Murray)
</P>
<P>
   ``TOPSY-TURVY''
</P>
<P>
   Opens in December in Los Angeles and New York; maybe in January
in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the holidays' most opulent film, ``Topsy-Turvy'' is, at
first, an intricate look at the oddball teaming of England's
Gilbert and Sullivan and how their relationship began to unravel.
Then, with great precision, it becomes a blow-by-blow accounting of
the staging of ``The Mikado.'' Theater purists will likely eat it
up. At times, director Mike Leigh (``Secrets &AMP; Lies,'' ``Naked''),
has created a movie as beautiful to look at as Ingmar Bergman's
``Fanny and Alexander.'' And just as long.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE END OF THE AFFAIR''
</P>
<P>
   Opens in Los Angeles and New York in December; likely in January
in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Fiennes plays a writer and Julianne Moore a married woman
who kindle passion in a remake of the barely tepid 1955 version
with Deborah Kerr and Van Johnson. It's based on Graham Greene's
novel and directed by Neil Jordan (``The Crying Game'').

 &HT;    Already, signs point to 4th Holyfield reign
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The loser continues to receive the accolades normally
reserved for the winner. That's because everybody at the Thomas &AMP;
Mack Center last Saturday night in Las Vegas saw Evander Holyfield
ease by Lennox Lewis for the undisputed heavyweight championship.
</P>
<P>
   Well, everybody, except the judges and those wearing blinders or
stuff featuring the Union Jack of Lewis' home of England.
</P>
<P>
   So Holyfield chatted with David Letterman on Thursday night.
Showtime threw a party for the guy in New York. With more
high-profile stops on the way for Holyfield, he will tell the world
sooner than later that he just isn't ready to stop throwing punches
for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'll tell us now.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not yet,'' Holyfield said Thursday, chuckling from his
hotel room in Manhattan. ``I'll wait until the end of the year
before I decide whether or not to retire. The more I think about
it, I want to fight, of course. But that's ego. That's getting
caught up in emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Translated: Holyfield is coming back. They always come back in a
sport that is among the leaders in guys hooked on adrenaline. Not
only that, Holyfield is 37 only on his birth certificate. He was so
energetic after his 12 rounds with Lewis that he spent the early
morning dancing before catching a flight back to Atlanta. Holyfield
said, ``I keep proving that age ain't nothing but a number.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Holyfield will return, because he is so close to
becoming greater than Muhammad Ali. They are the only three-time
champions among heavyweights, but Holyfield is an easy scenario
away from snatching a fourth title and doing even more to advance
his legend.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is required to fight Henry Akinwande within the next 90
days or lose the World Boxing Association portion of his
three-headed crown, which includes the International Boxing
Federation and the World Boxing Council. The thing is, Lewis and
his handlers say they won't deal with Akinwande. They still fume
over a 1997 fight that ended in the fifth round after Akinwande was
disqualified for hugging Lewis most of the night.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've forgotten, Holyfield's bout with Akinwande was
canceled last year because of Akinwande's health problems. If
Lewis' camp continues its stance against Akinwande, look for
Holyfield and Akinwande to battle early next year for that vacant
WBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Take Holyfield against Akinwande, and then consider the rest of
our scenario: Boxing is about styles. ``If Lewis wants Mike Tyson,
like he says he does, he's going to put Mike Tyson back on the
map,'' Holyfield said. ``Tyson likes fighters like Lewis who keep
moving backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Lewis' heart remains a mystery. If Tyson becomes his
snarling self again by pounding a couple of patsies before facing
Lewis by the end of next year, then Tyson definitely is destined to
grab Lewis' championship belts in the aftermath. That would leave
Tyson as king of the IBF and WBC, with Holyfield on the throne of
the WBA.
</P>
<P>
   That also would push boxing toward one of its biggest moments
ever with Tyson-Holyfield III, and Holyfield's style would baffle
Tyson a third time. You know, if Holyfield doesn't retire.
</P>
<P>
   And he won't.

 &HT;    Bargain dressing for the holidays
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 21
 &HT;    Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who says dressing like a diva this holiday season has to be
expensive?
</P>
<P>
   You can have a snazzy new outfit for Thanksgiving, another for
your office Christmas party, plus something for all the dinner
parties, family gatherings and other holiday functions you plan to
attend. And you can have it all on a budget.
</P>
<P>
   It just takes a little coordination, an eye for fashion and a
knack for finding good buys.
</P>
<P>
   The key is selecting one outfit, preferably a suit, that can be
worn with several different tops or bottoms. We started with one
pantsuit, two blouses, a skirt and a handbag, and ended up with six
stylish outfits _ for less than $150.

 &HT;    Atlanta to feel the punch of Maher's cynicism
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In an era known for its sweeping cynicism, Bill Maher
is here to tell us that we've still got a ways to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say we're too cynical, but I say we're stupid, we're
not smart enough,'' says the comic, political commentator and host
of ABC's ``Politically Incorrect.'' That's why he's titling his
next HBO special, which tapes soon for airing next year, ``Be More
Cynical.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred Atlantans will get a taste of Maher's latest jabs
tonight at the Punch Line (both shows are sold out), and a few more
will get a chance to joust with him Saturday when he holds
auditions for ``citizen panelists'' for his talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically Incorrect'' (12:05 a.m. on ABC) is Maher's round
table of celebrities, politicians and professional talkers,
matching the likes of, say, Internet gossip Matt Drudge, singer
Debbie Gibson, the Rev. Jerry Falwell and comedian Jon Stewart for
a half-hour of duking it out. The ``citizen panelists'' are viewers
chosen for their outspokenness who sit in on one show.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are so thoroughly vetted by the audition
process,'' says Maher, ``that you almost never get somebody who's
bad at the skill of arguing on a talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike our regular panel,'' he cracks.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 auditioners will be whittled down to a few finalists at
WSB's headquarters Saturday; the 50 have already been selected
after sending in postcards to ``PI.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta weed out the crazies,'' Maher says of the
auditioning process during a telephone interview. ``We had a lady
on, we think she didn't take her Prozac that day. She came on in
pyjamas and a boa and sat next to Joe Piscopo, who doesn't need
these problems at this point in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher's new stand-up routine, which he says is fully formed but
still being tweaked, is as up-to-date as the bizarre death of
golfer Payne Stewart (he obsesses over why President Clinton had to
be informed of the progress of Stewart's doomed flight), and as
dated as the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, which he swears is not last
year's news.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just like the monologues last year, with Monica
(oral sex) jokes. This is more about the culture war that went on.
People kept saying, why can't we get this behind us and get on with
the business of the country? My contention is this was the business
of the country. What was the greater sin: a middle-aged man
cheating on his wife, or was the greater sin to democracy letting
Mary Bono vote on that?''

 &HT;    An undogmatic director tackles a very touchy issue
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Some people think that if you believe in religion, you're
stupid,'' says writer-director Kevin Smith. He describes his
Catholic-tenet fantasy ``Dogma'' as a defense and celebration of
faith _ one that includes a giant poop monster, homicidal angels
and the sort of raunchy, sexually explicit chatter that blistered
his films ``Clerks,'' ``Mallrats'' and ``Chasing Amy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-emptive strike, its original distributor, Miramax, sold
the movie to Lions Gate to keep the heat off Miramax's parent
company, Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Raised a Catholic in New Jersey and still attending Mass
regularly, Smith, 29, seems surprised by the controversy that
``Dogma'' sparked long before it ever reached screens. It was
denounced, sight unseen, by the Catholic League, based on a reading
of an early version of the script that appeared on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the things that they objected to never made it to the
shooting draft, let alone the finished film,'' Smith says.
``Three-quarters of the things they had hard-core objections to
aren't even in the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Those bits were scrapped strictly to keep the film's running
time down, he says, not because he was censoring himself. Among the
more wounding accusations made against Smith was that he is a
``self-hating'' churchgoer, trying to bash his own religious faith.
``I'm a practicing (expletive) Catholic,'' he says, exasperated.
``Why would I make a movie that bashes myself?''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker talked about ``Dogma'' during a recent stop in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard you say that you wrote this film as a response to
your own struggles with faith. Is that right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Once you become a certain age, it gets harder and harder to
hold on to your faith, because the world throws so much at you.
Also, you start to learn a lot more. And with education comes the
danger of replacing God with science or knowledge or something like
that. Some people fall out of faith just because they don't like
their priest. Some people come to the conclusion there is no God,
it's all hokey nonsense we believed as kids. But I was one of those
people that really wanted to stay with it, because it was so much a
part of who I was when I was younger. But there are times in life
when it is hard to reconcile your faith with the world around you.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in church sometimes doesn't make it any easier, when you
hear a priest rail on again about abortion or the gay community or
something as stupid as ``Don't park in my spot out in the lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: But the movie is ultimately an endorsement of belief.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I wanted to do something to celebrate the faith, and
also make it kind of cool to be a Christian or a Catholic or just
think about God without being looked at as hokey or boring or
stupid. I wanted to take a vested interest in some form of theology
without seeming like I believe in the Tooth Fairy as well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's really pretty rare for anyone to address religion at all
in movies.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Song of Bernadette'' is a lovely little movie, but it
doesn't play now. We don't live in such an innocent time anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And religion often seems to be so compartmentalized in
mainstream society, something that's kept separate from people's
day-to-day routine.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think that's how the mainstream looks at it. But for the
hard-core people, they live it and breathe it every moment of their
day. I think I fall somewhere between the two. It's not something I
treat like a Sunday-only kind of behavior. But it's also not
something that, every moment of the day, I'm trying to think about
how I'm probably disappointing God or how I could be a better
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you think about ``Stigmata?''
</P>
<P>
   A: First, I thought it was overdirected. Second, I'm sitting
watching that movie, and I think, ``I'm the bad guy?'' We made a
movie with a rubber poop monster in it. This guy makes a movie
about a huge Vatican conspiracy to hide a hidden Gospel in which
Christ supposedly speaks about how he doesn't want a church. It's
such a conspiracy that a cardinal will try to kill a woman to keep
it secret. I sat there and thought, ``Why am I on trial here?'' . .
. That movie went on to open for 18 million bucks, and there was no
press conference or an ad in The New York Times. The Catholic
League wasn't going after it. That solidified the suspicion I've
had all along that it was never about me or the movie; it was about
Disney. The Catholic League loves to go after Disney. They've done
it before; believe me, they'll do it again in the future. Going
after Disney gets you covered in the papers or on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So have you had to deal with pickets protesting your movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: We had them outside Lincoln Center for the screening at the
New York Film Festival. I don't really fault any of them, because
they believe the movie they're picketing is this horrible movie
that attacks their faith and mocks them. That's not the movie at
all.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a lot of harsh language in this movie, and by virtue
of that, most of the church people aren't gonna like it anyway.
They didn't like our other three flicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma''
</P>
<P>
   Grade C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Linda Fiorentino. Written
and directed by Kevin Smith. Rated R for profanity, sex-related
dialogue, violence and drug content. 2 hours,
</P>
<P>
   5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mini-review: While the film pulls no punches in roasting
organized religion, it does so with such minimal spunk and spare
inventiveness that you have to wonder what all the fuss by
Catholics has been about. (Bob Longino)

 &HT;    Unfazed by media to-do at zoo, two bear cubs hang out happily
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lun Lun and Yang Yang were exposed to their first big
Atlanta crowd Thursday, and from all appearances, they weren't
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   As dozens of media types oohed and aahed during a Zoo Atlanta
press tour, the giant panda cubs slept soundly, without flinching
or even bothering to take a glimpse at the scribbling reporters or
furiously clicking photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Yang, the male, curled in a cubbyhole chiseled out of a
gray rock wall. Lun Lun, the female, snoozed nearby atop a wooden
climbing structure.
</P>
<P>
   But if the cubs weren't excited, Zoo Atlanta officials were. And
so were a handful of dignitaries, including Wo Zurong,
Houston-based consul general of the People's Republic of China, and
Dr. Kurt Benirschke, president of the San Diego Zoological Society.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Atlanta Director Terry Maple, speaking to reporters in
advance of the exhibit's public opening Saturday, declared that the
bears were ``doing great,'' acclimating to their new home ``much
faster than anybody expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other giant panda pair in the United States is at San
Diego. There, Bar Yun, the female, and Shi Shi, the male, don't
appear to like each other much, Benirschke said. Bar Yun required
artificial insemination to produce a baby, now 3 months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The male is just not interested,'' Benirschke said. The last
time Bar Yun made a pass at Shi Shi, he slapped her in the snout.
</P>
<P>
   But Maple said he doesn't think Lun Lun and Yang Yang will have
that problem. Since their arrival Nov. 5, they've played together a
lot and seem to enjoy each other's company, which means the rare
animals might be more likely to naturally mate _ which is a goal of
the zoo's panda project.
</P>
<P>
   Maple predicted record attendance Saturday _ between 10,000 and
15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo-goers will be issued a stub at the gate, reserving a time
for a five-minute tour of the panda habitat. The stubs are
first-come, first-served and are not expected to last all day.
</P>
<P>
   Mammal curator Rich Sartor said visitors will be urged to stay
calm when viewing the pandas. The inside viewing areas are
soundproof, but he won't abide anyone pounding on the thick glass
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bears appeared oblivious to the throng of reporters
Thursday, Sartor's worried that too much noise might upset the
emotionally sensitive animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should keep in mind, `You're visiting someone's home.'
Enjoy them, but be respectful. We don't want to cause them
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials cautioned that the small parking lots near the zoo
in Grant Park might not be adequate for the crowd. A special
shuttle will run continuously to the zoo from Turner Field's gold
lot, where parking will be free, from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Saturday and
Sunday. Also, MARTA buses will run from the West End station every
20 minutes instead of the normal 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Police have a plan for the expected flood of traffic, but
zoo-goers should expect jams, said zoo marketing director Gail
Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo's gates will be open from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,
regular hours. Zoo members can enter a half-hour sooner, at 9 a.m.
Admission is $12 adults; $10 senior citizens; $8 ages 3-11; free
ages 2 and under. More information: www.zooatlanta.org or
404-624-5600.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect a lot of people to come early,'' she warned. ``There
will be long lines before the zoo opens.''

 &HT;    Activities, amenities reeled us in
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 21.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORACABESSA, Jamaica _ You may have seen the families and couples
swaggering through the Atlanta airport. Sunburned. Sandaled. Hair
in tiny braids with clattering beads. Toting boxes of duty-free rum
and sporting brand-new ``We Be Jammin''' T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been to Jamaica, mon,'' is the message their carefree
stride and I-know-something-you-don't-know expression suggests. Too
cool for words.
</P>
<P>
   We had seen them, too. And we wanted to go. But feeling a little
long in the tooth _ and wide in the midsection _ for the wanton
world of, say, Hedonism, we opted instead for the
family-togetherness vibe of Boscobel Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The SuperClubs-owned, 207-room resort claims good credentials.
It's included in ``100 Best All-Inclusive Resorts of the World''
(Globe Pequot, $16.95) and ``Best Places to Stay _ Caribbean''
(Houghton Mifflin, $18). Family Travel Forum, an online publication
(www.familytravelforum.com), named it the Best Beach Resort in its
Top Getaways for Families listing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the guarantees. We were pleased to discover that
the resort has a No Hurricane Guarantee, which means that if a
hurricane strikes, you will be reimbursed for the disrupted night
and given a voucher for the same number of nights to be used during
a future stay. And the Jamaica Sunshine Guarantee provides that on
any day the sun does not make at least a brief appearance, you get
a voucher equal to the value of another day's stay.
</P>
<P>
   Sounded like a winner _ but you really never know until you
experience a place.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are, months later, in this tropical garden spot where
the virgin strawberry daiquiris flow (along with headier
concoctions), a big fuzzy brown bear mascot in swim trunks strolls
the sands, and the buffet boasts everything from macaroni and
cheese to curry goat.
</P>
<P>
   While the kids paint T-shirts, scramble off on a treasure hunt
or play arcade games, we adults settle under beach umbrellas with a
good book or relax beside the adult pool with a frosty beverage.
Although the children's program is always an option, family
activities such as pool olympics or sandcastle-building contests
are scheduled throughout the day. Every evening, there's Family
Showtime, with entertainment that ranges from steel band music to
an islands-flavored floor show.
</P>
<P>
   And most of us are happily snoozing in our beds before the
stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, this used to be one of Hugh Hefner's Playboy
resorts back in the swinging '60s before it reopened as a family
resort in 1987. The only bunnies here now are the ones in the
hutches at the petting zoo.
</P>
<P>
   We weren't the only ones caught up in the laid-back allure of
this tropical playground.
</P>
<P>
   Like our family, the Haushers from Appleton, Wis., visited in
early fall and ``absolutely loved it,'' says mom Jennifer Hausher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls (Elizabeth, 8, and Emily, 6) really had fun making
new friends, getting their hair braided, having strawberry
daiquiris whenever they wanted, and hanging out at the pool to
their hearts' content. In their words, this place is `better than
Disneyland.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Gould, a British Airways flight attendant from Newcastle,
England, found ``a lot for the kids to do,'' too, including ski
lessons and rides on a boat-towed, giant banana float.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been to Jolly Harbor in Antigua, and the quality of
the food is much better here and they have premium (liquor)
brands,'' adds Gould, vacationing with her husband, Peter, and
children, Becky, 13, and James, 12.
</P>
<P>
   I watched the Greenaway family from Petawawa, Ontario, take a
spin on the banana and caught up with the mom and dad _ Irene and
Drew _ at the adult pool bar later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Irene and Shelby, 7, and Tal, 10, were
rendezvousing with Drew, a Canadian Forces captain running training
sessions at Camp Newcastle in the Blue Mountains, home to the
Jamaica Defence Force. ``From talking to all the locals and
officers who came before me,'' Drew says, ``Boscobel Beach is best
for families.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the most part, he agrees. But he finds the shabby life
preservers at the water sports shed in need of replacing. (He's
right.) And he isn't comfortable with the access afforded the
surfboard entrepreneurs who paddle up to (and sometimes inside) the
roped-off beach area to hawk carvings, trinkets and conch shells.
</P>
<P>
   These guys do add local color. I make the acquaintance of Smoky
Joe, a one-man tourism board who sells ratty-looking conch shells
and rattles off his services. ``I can take you snorkeling or
fishing _ what you want to do. I show you my country, and you tell
me about your country.''
</P>
<P>
   I decline the side trips, but agree to buy a shell for $12 _ he
originally asks $20 _ after he scrapes off sediment and deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why you want me to take all the nature off,'' he
chides me. ``You want it to be pretty. But this is nature!''
</P>
<P>
   Other vacationers wade out to cut deals with Smoky Joe's
competitors. There's Spice Man and George, who carve animals from
local wood, and Mike, whose conch shells have all the ``nature''
scraped off and shine pearly pink.
</P>
<P>
   Later that afternoon, there is trouble in paradise. During a
beach volleyball game, my husband and daughter witness an offshore
altercation provoked by a local who apparently has a score to
settle with George.
</P>
<P>
   Security officers _ who are stationed throughout the resort and
provide a certain peace of mind _ get medical attention for George,
who reportedly was stabbed. The offender flees.
</P>
<P>
   Management assures me this is an isolated incident. No guests
are harmed, and technically speaking it took place off property _
as resorts don't ``own'' water rights.
</P>
<P>
   So much for local color. It makes me think that Drew Greenaway
is probably right.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn and Ken Snider _ American-born pastors of New
Celebration Church in Mandeville, Jamaica, for the past 14 years _
actually chose Boscobel for a family getaway because of the tight
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``In August we were staying in St. Mary's (parish), and we were
robbed,'' says Kathryn. ``In Jamaica you have to b aware.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she concludes that ``Jamaica is a great place for any
family to visit. It's close enough you can get here in a day, and
it's really a different culture.''
</P>
<P>
   We agreed, which is why we thought the T-shirt our daughter
selected at the Montego Bay airport was just perfect. It read:
``One Problem _ Leaving.''

</P>
<P>
   BEST OF BOSCOBEL
</P>
<P>
   Here are four reasons why we'd come back to Boscobel Beach
resort:
</P>
<P>
   1. The staff is fabulous: I've never encountered such a smiling
bunch so eager to please. Observes Jennifer Hausher of Appleton,
Wis.: ``The folks at Boscobel seem to work very hard to make sure
everyone's stay was very pleasant and were always asking if they
could help us, if they could get something for us. The housekeeping
staff worked very hard every day making sure our room was clean, as
well as the hallways.''
</P>
<P>
   2. The entertainment crew is tireless: ``We couldn't believe how
hard the entertainment crew worked,'' Hausher adds. Whether hosting
a water polo and reggae party at the family pool before lunch or a
festive Jamaican stage show with conga-line dancing at the Terrace
after dinner, Bashful Brian, Awesome Audene, Ravishing Rachel, D.J.
Tony and Powerful Patrick keep moving like Energizer bunnies with
fresh batteries. They will not allow anybody to have a bad time.
</P>
<P>
   3. The children's programs are way cool: The four children's
clubhouses include Tiny Town for little ones 4 and under, Bears'
Bungalow for ages 4-7, Boscobel Bunch for ages 8-12 and Jump Up
Club for ages 13-17. Activities planned from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m.
might include arts and crafts, bicycle rides, beach games, a
glass-bottom boat trip, snorkeling, tennis, movies and theme
parties _ depending on the age group. Kids can eat together at the
Barbecue Park or the Terraces, where a special kids area offers
fare such as macaroni and cheese, hot dogs, burgers and fries.
Also, there's a petting zoo where children are introduced to goats,
pigs, ducks and rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   4. The adults-only areas provide welcome respite from the small
set: OK, we love our kids, but it's nice having time to ourselves.
We can escape to the adult pool and bar while our offspring are
being taken good care of. And we find blessed air conditioning at
the piano bar and the Italian-style restaurant Allegro. Many of the
resort's public areas are open to the breezes _ even the Pavilion
restaurant, which is the resort's only other table-service
restaurant. (The Terraces features buffets at breakfast, lunch and
dinner, and the Beach Grill is a short-order walk-up.) The disco,
the Escape Hatch, seems to be geared to a younger adult crowd _ it
doesn't get cooking until 10 p.m., and we were all played out by
then.

   ORACABESSA, Jamaica
</P>
<P>
   o way am I going to rip through the blue Caribbean hanging on
for dear life astride a big inflated yellow banana.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced in a chaise lounge on the sands of Boscobel Beach, I
watch for two days with guarded curiosity as the whimsical craft
peels offshore again and again, towed behind a ski boat that churns
through the surf with an insouciant vro-o-o-om.
</P>
<P>
   It looks reckless _ yet, um, sorta fun. But the sign at the
resort's water sports area clearly warns: The banana boat is likely
to tip over. That's enough for me. There could be sharks out there.
I'm no fool.
</P>
<P>
   But the fearless keep queuing up. All ages. All sizes. And so at
last I find myself straddling the floating fruit with my
11-year-old daughter and Christopher Lindo of Kingston, also 11, in
front of me. I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm too old for such
nonsense. Oops, too late to bail. The boat lurches and Christopher
cries, ``Ohhhhh, we're all going to di-i-i-i-eeeeeee!''
</P>
<P>
   But we don't. We don't even fall off. We r-- de this bucking
banana like a bunch of Caribbean cowpokes. We holler, laugh and
wave to sunbathers on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   I tame the wild banana, and, as they say here: Everyting's cook
and curry.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the sort of family-fun-in-the-sun we'd come to
Jamaica for. Another round of those yummy (alcohol-free) frozen
strawberry daiquiris, please _ and a Red Stripe on draft for dad.
</P>
<P>
   Boscobel Beach, a lushly landscaped resort on a private bay 10
miles east of Ocho Rios, is one of SuperClubs' all-inclusive
properties, including the adults-only Grand Lido, Hedonism (I, II
and, since September, III) and Breezes. It's the only one that
permits children under 16.
</P>
<P>
   Boscobel isn't just kid-friendly _ it's kid-indulgent with
almost nonstop activities for tots to teens, supervised by
counselors who seem devoted to showing kids a terrific time.
</P>
<P>
   While Boscobel boasts adults-only areas (a private pool and bar
and the Italian restaurant Allegro), the resort is obviously
designed with families in mind _ no nude beaches, no drunken
revelries, no all-night debauchery (only at the rather laid-back
piano bar are drinks served as late as 2 a.m.). The Sunday night
beach party is about as wild as it gets. Moms, dads and kids vie
for prizes in heated three-legged races and egg-in-spoon relays in
the sugary sand, running to a reggae beat. Kids score Boscobel logo
merchandise; adult winners get bottles of Appleton rum.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the de rigueur hair braiding _ which can run as much
as $60 for a full head of cornrows and plaits if you aren't savvy
at bargaining _ and perhaps a splurge at the gift shop, crafts
market or massage salon, you won't need to worry about spending
money.
</P>
<P>
   All-inclusive means just that: Your up-front payment covers
accommodations, all meals, snacks, beverages (alcoholic, too),
entertainment, water sports (sailing, skiing, windsurfing,
snorkeling and scuba diving) and a children's program that keeps
kids busy from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. Gratuities are included.
</P>
<P>
   Early this fall, our family of three paid $1,762 for a
three-night Air Jamaica Vacations package that included round-trip
airfare from Atlanta to Montego Bay and airport transfers. Children
under 14 visit the resort for free; we paid only $174 for our
daughter's airfare. We traveled in the low season; prices rise
during the winter months, but deals always seem to be available.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of going the all-inclusive route _ especially on a
short vacation _ is that you see little of the country outside the
resort. We were tempted to at least sign up for a tour to Dunn's
River Falls and some shopping in nearby Ocho Rios. But with only
two full days and two half days at Boscobel, we felt we needed the
time to fully explore the possibilities under our noses.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, our van driver on the two-hour jaunt from Sangster
International Airport in Montego Bay to Boscobel provided a running
commentary in lilting patois. And the view from the van windows
provided a vivid, if fleeting, slice of day-to-day Jamaica life.
</P>
<P>
   As we sped down a narrow highway along the northern coast,
chickens flapped to get out of the way, little girls in green
jumpers ambled home from school and tethered goats grazed lazily
just yards from the highway. While some roadside entrepreneurs
hawked their wares from open-air huts, others stood precariously
close to the asphalt with strings of fresh-caught fish or bravely
thrust out hands full of guineps, which resemble large scuppernongs
but are in the lychee nut family.
</P>
<P>
   Our driver pulled off the road at a rest stop where we bought
spicy meat-filled patties, jerk chicken and Red Stripes. We caught
glimpses of sights such as the 1796 Anglican church in Falmouth and
the place where Columbus landed in 1494. And along the way we
picked up some Jamaica-speak: Call Ocho Rios ``Ochi,'' Montego Bay
``Mo'Bay'' and casually toss out those all-purpose replies ``No
problem'' and ``Yah, mon.''
</P>
<P>
   We arrived at the gates of Boscobel shortly after 1 p.m. An
eager young man whisked away our bags and showed us to our junior
suite with an incredible view of the jewel-like water that changes
from blue zircon near the beach to deep sapphire further out at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Would we be needing anything else, the smiling bellhop inquired.
Well, perhaps he could ...
</P>
<P>
   But before we could finish our request, we heard the two words
that would become our mantra in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem.''

IN FANTASY BOWL, USC TAILBACKS TOUGH TO BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marcus Allen. Mike Garrett. Anthony Davis. Ricky
Bell. Jon Arnett. Morley Drury. Cotton Warburton.
</P>
<P>
   Football fans from the 1920s to the 1980s recognize these
household names as among the greatest backs in USC history, or in
some cases, in the history of college football.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know how strong an all-time USC team's backfield
might be, consider that this would be our bench in Part II of the
Daily News' mythical matchup between USC's and UCLA's greatest
players.
</P>
<P>
   We wouldn't hesitate to use any of those players against an
all-time UCLA defense, but first the Bruins would get to look at
Heisman Trophy winners O.J. Simpson and Charles White.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fascinating to ponder how a game like this might
unfold. Would the Trojans try to play power football, hoping they
could manhandle UCLA defensive linemen Cliff Frazier, Fred McNeill
and Jack Ellena?
</P>
<P>
   Would an offensive line featuring Outland Trophy winner Ron
Yary, Lombardi Trophy winner Brad Budde, NFL Hall of Famers Ron Mix
and Anthony Munoz and All-American Tony Boselli even care who
played on the defensive line?
</P>
<P>
   How big a hole would Simpson have on student body right?
</P>
<P>
   It might be a classic battle of strength against speed. UCLA
linebackers Jerry Robinson and Carnell Lake would certainly be
swift enough to cause headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Are you worried about USC having a playmaker? Simpson's 64-yard
touchdown run against UCLA in 1967 is perhaps the most-recalled
play in the 68-year history of the rivalry, and gave the Trojans a
dramatic 21-20 victory en route to the national championship. And
the only above-mentioned lineman he had on that team was Yary.
</P>
<P>
   White went 4-0 against the Bruins from 1976-79, so let's assume
he'd be able to make a few plays too.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Pat Haden was 3-0 in the crosstown rivalry, with the
closest margin of victory 10 points. And who was better in a clutch
situation? Remember his two-point conversion to Shelton Diggs in
the 1975 Rose Bowl that gave the Trojans an 18-17 victory over Ohio
State?
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and White would certainly never get tired, with two
Heisman winners (Allen, Garrett) itching to play on the sidelines
along with the other top backs mentioned above. There are still
fans from the 1950s who believe Arnett's runs were the most
exciting in Trojans history while Drury was USC's first 1,000-yard
runner in 1927, a feat that wasn't repeated until Garrett did it 38
years later.
</P>
<P>
   But this USC team can do a lot more than run. Haden threw 26
touchdown passes in his two years as a starter, and he would only
have Keyshawn Johnson and Lynn Swann as his wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   A better question might be who would cover tight end Charles
Young, an All-American who led the 1972 national championship team
in receptions before enjoying a 13-year career in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Young was as good a tight end as there was in college
football,'' said former USC coach John McKay, who coached Young and
Swann together in 1971 and '72. ``Swann, our flanker, and Young
could catch anything. I wasn't worried.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the running game would dominate this matchup, a more
interesting dilemma would be how Keyshawn Johnson and Swann would
be covered by cornerbacks Carlton Gray and Jim Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Johnnie Morton would come in as a third receiver, to
recreate his last-minute touchdown reception in the Trojans' 45-42
victory over UCLA in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: This game would feature top-notch talent on both
sides of the ball. Something no one is saying about this Saturday's
game.

SAFETY WOVEN INTO TEXAS A&AMP;M BONFIRE TRADITION, FORMER STUDENTS SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Safety is as much an ingredient of the Texas A&AMP;M bonfire as the
thousands of logs that fuel it, former students said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And it is as woven into the tradition as ``red pots'' and crew
chiefs and University of Texas outhouses.
</P>
<P>
   There are strict rules about how the bonfire is constructed,
about who does what jobs and about the safety equipment used for
tree-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Work crews are overseen by a hierarchy of supervisors and
managers. There are limits on how high and how wide it can be
built. Training classes are conducted covering each phase of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the way it works is you have overkill when it comes
to safety,'' said James Fuqua, a ranch worker in the North Texas
city of Quanah and a former ``red pot,'' or senior bonfire
supervisor, in the early 1980s. ``Our main job as red pots was to
be the safety guys and make sure that no one got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   At least nine students were killed and nearly 30 others injured
early Thursday when a 40-foot-high stack of logs collapsed on the
College Station campus.
</P>
<P>
   Fuqua said that the ultimate authorities on the bonfire site are
the senior red pots, so named because of the red hard hats they
wear. Under them are junior red pots, picked by the seniors as
apprentices in the art of bonfire building.
</P>
<P>
   Below them in the hierarchy are ``brown pots,'' who are
responsible for the equipment, ``yellow pots,'' who are leaders
from the dormitories, and crew chiefs, who supervise each work
crew.
</P>
<P>
   The student body makes up the bulk of the work crews and are
assigned tasks according to experience level and seniority at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   The most inexperienced crews on the site, usually freshmen, are
fitted with white tape on their ankles to signify ``that they need
to be watched out for,'' said Fuqua, and that they are not
permitted on the stack.
</P>
<P>
   Fuqua said only red pots are allowed to work on the three top
stacks of the bonfire, anywhere from 30 to 50 feet above the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets pretty dang touchy up there sometimes,'' Fuqua said.
</P>
<P>
   The most important part of the bonfire is the center pole
constructed of two long telephone poles spliced together end to
end. This pole is posted in the ground to a depth of about 15 feet
and held in place with four guy wires.
</P>
<P>
   Logs are then placed in concentric circles, from smallest to
largest, around the center pole until the diameter of the bonfire
is about 45 feet. The logs are tied together with three pieces of
wire each.
</P>
<P>
   The next layer of logs is then similarly arranged on top of the
first and so on, until the entire structure is about 55 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Wolfskill, a commodities broker in New York who was a red
pot in 1974-75, said that safety has always been the prime concern
of any crews building the bonfire. Because it is a student-run
event, he said, safety has to be a priority, or the university
administration would intervene.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped the university wouldn't end the tradition,
although university officials weren't discussing that Thursday.
Instead they kept focus on rescuing the injured and recovering
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, the only deaths associated with bonfire
construction were recorded in 1955, when a student was hit by a
swerving car, and in 1981 when someone was crushed by a tractor
hauling wood.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1935, when students dismantled an irate farmer's barn for
use in the fire, &UR;  &LR; the annual bonfire was an ad hoc affair, not
sanctioned by the university. The first all-log fire was burned in
1943 and the first fire using a center pole occurred in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, the bonfire reached its record height of 109 feet 10
inches, but because of concerns about violating a College Station
safety ordinance, the university limited it to height of the
structure to 55 feet in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonfire has evolved over time,'' Fuqua said. ``In the
beginning they were little more than trash fires, but over the
years it developed into a highly organized, tightly controlled
event in which relatively few people have been hurt. Of course,
there are injuries, people cutting themselves and falling, but most
of the time the reason has been stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad deal.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Speed. Sleep. Greed. Recruiting. Role models like
Thomas Edison and Ayn Rand. Losing money, yet turning away capital.
New-found wealth and an ensuing change in lifestyle _ or not.
</P>
<P>
   Those were some of the topics on the table when four chief
executives from dot.com companies _ Candice Carpenter of iVillage,
a women's Web site; Fernando J. Espuelas of StarMedia Network, a
Spanish- and Portuguese-language service; Kevin O'Connor of
DoubleClick, an online advertising network, and Stephan J. Paternot
of Theglobe.com, a shopping, news and business information site _
gathered late one afternoon early this month at The New York Times
for a wide-ranging discussion about managing in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   These pioneers from Silicon Alley, an area in the Flatiron
district of Manhattan that is populated by many fledgling Internet
companies, were joined in the two-hour discussion by Saul Hansell,
Patrick J. Lyons and Judith H. Dobrzynski of The Times.
</P>
<P>
   As founders of young companies, each executive had experienced
the adrenaline highs and the growing pains that accompany the
transformation of an idea into a business and then into a publicly
traded company. They don't worry about nonexistent earnings in a
topsy-turvy environment where not producing a profit is, for the
moment, a virtue. For them, the bigger pressure is to build
organizations _ fast _ before opportunities slip away.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the difference between running the kind of company you
run and running a big company? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER Speed. Leading in conditions in which speed is a very
big factor. It puts a lot of additional pressure on all the
systems. And you have a lot of very young people, and you're
teaching them to be managers at a very accelerated pace without a
lot of formal programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT Tying into that is just the idea of keeping your
entrepreneurial spirit. Things are shifting fast enough that you
need to be able to jump into any new idea, shift your company into
it and move at light speed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS I would say the absence of a road map. Not that any
business is particularly easy, but when there's nothing that you
can follow except your instincts and the little bit of data you're
able to gather in this context of a lot of speed, I think there's a
lot of intuition that goes into these kinds of very fast-moving
environments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR In large corporations, you need to spend a lot of time
quantifying what the market's going to look like and how you're
going to go about it and what the expenses are going to be.
</P>
<P>
   And here it's very much speed, it's intuition, it's trying to
figure out, ``Is this a big market or a small market?'' If it's a
big market, you go after it. You spend a tremendous amount of money
and you go after it quickly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the first thing that's sacrificed in the name of
speed? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR Facts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER Sleep. We're trying to really come up with graded
solutions to burnout caused by exhaustion. We have people who have
been at this for four years in our company and we have to figure
out a way to get them to learn how to completely refresh themselves
in short increments of time.
</P>
<P>
   I've stood at the elevator with people going on vacation and
actually taken the laptop and the cell phone out of their hands and
said, ``Great, now you can actually have a vacation.'' The only way
to truly regenerate yourself enough to be truly creative and
inventive again is to be unwired at times in the year and to be in
the other part of the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do any of you have programs for dealing with burnout? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT Sometimes it's frequent rotation of some of your stars.
You'll often find that in your company you have a few stars, and if
you leave them in the same position too long they'll burn out. And,
quite frankly, you don't want to lose them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER
</P>
<P>
   We're starting a sabbatical program. It's for people who've been
there three years who would love to be there 20. We're giving them
a month to go and just do whatever they want. Sleep probably will
be at the top of most people's list. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS Are you going to take it yourself? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER Yeah, I am. I have to, otherwise no one else will take
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR We have a very strong policy that people can move to
wherever they want to move. Any job in the company's open. So we
try to force rotation, because doing the same thing, day in and day
out, tends to cause burnout.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consciously Reaching Out &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Tell us a little bit more about how you're managing growth so
far. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS I travel all the time. And I try to talk to as many
people as possible. We do monthly all-hands meetings and we
actually Web-cast them simultaneously and have people call in and
try to have an ongoing dialogue. And now we're doing things which I
never thought we'd ever do. We're going to create an employee
newsletter. We're doing a lot of things that I used to scoff at
when I worked at other companies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What I've also found is that things I said two years ago are now
on a plaque, and that people are still acting the same way: ``But
Fernando said that.'' Yeah, but that was two years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is communication a common problem? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT Absolutely. We've seen ourselves have to increase the
rate of communication dramatically. When we started four or five
years ago, it was a group of 20 to 25 people. My partner (Todd
Krizelman, co-chief executive) and I could just make decisions very
quickly, hoping everybody can keep up. But eventually it starts to
hurt you more when you get to 200, and people in departments don't
understand what's going on. And we've had to deal with a lot of
organizational changes over the last year, but everybody
understands why we're doing stuff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR We start off with a week of training. It's a week of
indoctrination for every employee _ whether you answer the
telephone in the German office or you're a vice president, it
doesn't matter. You sit, you learn what we do, why we do it, what's
the core culture of the company, so everybody's got a good, firm
foundation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do managers who have worked at large companies fare in
your kinds of companies? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR On average, they've fared pretty well. You've got to
pre-screen them very carefully. You tend to get people who expect
to have two assistants. But our first test is, we make them take a
pay cut. If they won't take a massive pay cut, you've pretty much
got them pegged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do they have options, though, on the other end? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR Absolutely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER The structure that I've seen be the most successful is
a solid infrastructure of senior managers from big companies, very
seasoned, very good at creating structure. That gives you room to
promote people with less management experience, and have someone to
go to when wisdom and time around the track is the issue. &QL;

   Mountains of Resumes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How hard is it to find employees? Are strangers handing you
resumes as soon as they find out who you are? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR I probably get 10 resums myself a day. We probably get,
as a company, 100 resums a day. There's a lot of talent that wants
to get in, that absolutely wants to get into the dot-com company.
To get great, smart people is always tough. But it's relatively
easy for a dot-com company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS We have two realities. One is in the U.S., which
mirrors that. But in Latin America, it's totally different: There's
no such thing as us. There's a lot of big companies that are owned
by families, so the best you can hope for is to work for so and so,
as opposed to being one of the owners of the company. So in Latin
America we're able to really tap into really great people who don't
have an equivalent to go to. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT Even though we get a hundred resumes a day, we're at a
point where we're trying to find the perfect person to fit this
type of software development. It's easier for us to find people in
marketing and sales, because New York has a lot more of these
people and they're easy to train.
</P>
<P>
   But finding the right technical person, whether it's for
infrastructure or for software, we still find it tough. These
people can command huge salaries from the banks. And finding a
seasoned database manager, for instance, can mean that you have to
pay huge cash, because some of these people want the options and
they want the cash, and they're not going to leave their cushy job
at Goldman Sachs unless you throw it all at them. The fact is, if
you're a well-known dot-com company, it helps immensely over the
unknown dot-com companies and over a lot of the other companies.  &QL;

   How to Set Priorities &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you find that your thinking about the way you run your
company changes over time? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS For the last two years, I've been thinking about, well,
what happens in 10 years and what happens in 20 years? Which is
kind of a ridiculous thing to think about on the Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR Making that transition from a total entrepreneurial
world with no rules or anything to where you've got to have
professionalization, you've got to have systems; you've got to have
order. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT You have to learn to delegate. Todd and I were
completely attached to the product, had to test everything
ourselves. We were the chief QA (quality assurance) guys.
Eventually, you have to stop that. As much as I still use the
product now, when I have to use it, I want to be able to rely on 50
people who think about this more than I do and who know it better
than I do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR On the flip side, I still spend half my time with new
products _ because that is the entrepreneurial side and new
products are the key to rejuvenating the company, growing the
company. We set out to create a big company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you, from the beginning, do something differently than
other start-ups might have done, because you were planning for
growth? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR Definitely. I was fortunate because I started my first
company right out of college. So I went through the ``how you could
have done things differently and better?'' We tried to avoid all
the mistakes. I was building the human infrastructure, getting the
people who could build their own business and leverage. When I look
at DoubleClick, we're actually a collection of about 50 companies:
People who were running their own thing, whether it's their own
country, and there were 22 countries, or we have a bunch of
business units with people running their own businesses. The thing
we most tend to look for in people is intelligence and _ I call it
_ athleticism: people who love to compete, don't like to lose. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS I don't think anybody stumbles onto a big company. You
have to visualize where you're going. You don't know the path
necessarily, but there's a goal. There's something I always think
about and try to get people to think about. I'm not a martial-arts
guy, but when you break a board with your hand, what they teach you
is that if you were able to project the energy, not on the surface
of the board, but behind the board, you will break it. And you can
break three boards, then four boards. But if you aim it for the
surface, you will break your hand. And that's a little bit of what
you dream about. You have to make choices accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   When we were looking for venture funding, and we were out of our
money and we got offered by not-so-great VCs (venture capital
firms) who wanted not-so-great terms, we knew we'd never go there.
So we held out. And we got good funding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER I can think of a number of examples where we turned
down advertisers, we turned down money, because to do (otherwise)
would create a precedent which would limit us later. And as a very
tiny company, it's very scary to do or have to do it. And once you
do it, it inspires everybody. &QL;

   Of Churchill, and Branson &QL;

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Other chief executives want to be Jack Welch of General
Electric. Is there any model you think about? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS I spent a lot of time learning how Winston Churchill
ran the Second World War. I bring that up as a metaphor _ not
having information, not having clarity, the stakes being very high.
Of course, the stakes he had to deal with were somewhat higher than
what we have to do. But that was part of the encouragement _, to
think that something so important could be managed, and all the
mistakes that were made and the chaos of the moment. And the other
thing, which he said, which I love as a philosophy, is: You don't
have to get it right all the time. You just have to get it right 51
percent of the time, and that will carry you through. And that's a
very, very liberating philosophy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER I admire two people. Steve Ross, who turned a funeral
parlor into one of the great media empires in the world (Time
Warner). He did it by empowering people tremendously. And he was a
bit of a cowboy, but that's the only way you get from a funeral
parlor to one of the largest media companies in the world. When you
were in the room with him, you would want to just get up and run
and help him to fulfill this vision.
</P>
<P>
   And then in the dot-com world, I personally admire Tim Koogle
(chief executive of Yahoo) so much. I think Yahoo has an elegance
in the way they do things. They never sacrifice. They're the only
portal that never charged money for carriage. And they did it
because they only want to have the very best content. They want to
invite the best people in. Everything they've done has been for
long-term greatness.
</P>
<P>
   There's all these fancy dot-com buildings down in Silicon
Valley. And you go to Yahoo and it's so very understated. We send
our architects out there to visit it because, we said, this is the
model. And the employees love it because they really thought about
how the employees could have a great day there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT Todd and I have the same idol: Richard Branson (founder
of the Virgin Group) _ just his philosophy of wanting to be a
successful businessman and having fun while doing it. And he's one
of those guys that's really built up one of the best-recognized
brands in the world. And after reading his book, ``Losing My
Virginity,'' you can see how he's had a lot of similar experiences
to what Todd and I had. Seeing how he started from some
inexperienced young guy and turned it into some major media empire.
And seeing how this man embodies the brand, Virgin, is extremely
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Todd and I have always had a philosophy since we started, that
we're only doing this as long as we have fun. The day that you're
just doing it for the money, that's the day we get out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR Mine's more historical. Edison was a horrible CEO but a
hell of an innovator. He pretty much innovated the 21st century.
And then Ayn Rand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER Yeah. Champion of capitalism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR Her philosophy of capitalism and the individual is just
how we pretty much run the company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think Koogle is great. I think Steve Case (chairman of America
Online) is amazing. How many times did people write Case off? And
he's always come back. Gates (Bill Gates of Microsoft) is an
incredible entrepreneur that everyone really respects _ an
entrepreneur who was successful in transitioning from an
entrepreneur to building a phenomenal company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you imagine out a couple of years? If you have a
10,000-person organization, is it going to be like every other
10,000-person organization?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER No. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR There's nothing wrong with big companies. We all want
to become one. And we all want to create a company that stands the
test of time. Look at the great companies: General Electric _ what
they do is something to be idolized. Disney _ they keep innovating.
IBM _ we all want to be like that. But we all want to stay away
from the bureaucracy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS I'm sure that some Internet companies will become
stodgy old media companies in the next five years. The challenge is
how do you maintain that freshness and how do you organize yourself
and how do you develop a culture that it doesn't matter whether
you're 500 or 5,000 or 50,000 people. At Microsoft, they have
30,000, 40,000 employees. They move fast. They have that drive.
That's cultural. &QL;

<P>
   The Price of Profits &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How long do you think you can exist without producing
profit? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR It's clear what the market's telling us. They want to
give us a lot of money, so we take it and we invest. Why? We look
back, and what was the biggest mistake that we made? We should have
invested even more money. We should have lost more money. Why?
Because this is the biggest thing that's ever hit. Market share is
everything.
</P>
<P>
   But it depends on what stage the company is in. People are going
to start expecting profits from us in the next one to two years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT The reason we all lost money and all went crazy for
this is because we realized how big it could be. And it's worth
losing the money for the sake of becoming that much bigger down the
long road. And I think that investors traditionally, by default,
will say ``yes, we'd prefer a profitable company,'' but not if they
know it's at the expense of getting that company to be way bigger a
little bit further down the road. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS Things have changed. In '96 when we started our
company, nobody knew if anybody could make a profit on the Net. And
now we look and we see that there are certain models, in our case
the advertising model, and the e-commerce models, actually can be
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest risk is that we under-invest, as Kevin said, because
this won't come again. And if we don't own that waterfront before
everyone else, somebody else will. We don't want to be in a
situation next year having to buy someone for a billion bucks that
we could have invested $25 million to build or buy them when
they're little.
</P>
<P>
   We have invested over the last two years much more in building
our brand than the advertising revenue available in the whole of
Latin America. Now we're either very stupid or clever and I'd like
to think that we're clever, because it means that we are now
capturing more than our fair share of that revenue opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much longer will it be before people begin to say ``wait
a minute''? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER Off the Internet, media companies take five to seven
years to become profitable. Everybody knows that in the media
business. AOL took eight years, because they were early. Let's say
Yahoo took four and a half. So that kind of defines it.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what's interesting is that many of the investors came
out of technology. They don't have models of the dynamics of a
media company. They're applying a different model and then
wondering, ``Gee, this doesn't look like anything I've seen,'' but
it's not like the world has never seen it before. You can look at
media models and see exactly where we all are on the curve, because
it's a business where you do spend a lot up front to build brand,
to build advertising-revenue generation capability, and then your
revenue starts scaling past it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR It is starting to happen. The scary thing that's
happened is what's coming out public today are companies that have
no revenue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you pay your employees? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS We pay good salaries, but fair salaries within the norm
for that kind of job in other industries. And then we try to get
people to really think about the stock being their major
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does everybody have stock? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS Yeah, after I believe it's six months _ after your
first review _ everyone gets stock options. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT Same policy exactly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. At a couple of your companies, the stock price today is a
quarter of where it once was. Does that linger as a question in the
hallways? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT You've got to have open communication with your people.
You've got to tell them not to look at your day-to-day stock price,
but at the same time they deserve to have an explanation and
understanding of where things are going in the long run. Give them
enough vision so that it's their decision: ``Well, I don't care
what the stock's at today, I think that we had a great internal
story, and a year from now I think things could be way better; I'm
going to stick around.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER At that time of the IPO, we pulled out the stock
charts of five companies and we said, ``Well, here's what you're in
for.'' The pattern was so ridiculously consistent. &QL;

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Risk vs. Executive Reward &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Many big-company chief executives think you're overpaid. The
whole world thinks they're overpaid. Are you overpaid and are they
overpaid? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR Am I working a million times, or whatever it may be,
smarter than someone else? No. Am I overpaid? No. It is what it
is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS We win when the stockholder wins and not otherwise,
which is, I think, a perfect alignment of value.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT If those traditional media types all want to complain
about it, they can always start their own Internet companies and
take a chance, and I think they'll realize what the risk-reward
ratio is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER It is a little bit like the lottery, because the
person brought in to run eBay hit the lottery. She, Meg Whitman, is
great, but she would be the first to say she got really lucky. The
risk of walking away from what's known and guaranteed and starting
over in one room that you're sharing with eight people, in
retrospect, looks like no big deal. But when you do it, you're
taking a big risk. Our culture happens to reward that behavior,
which is one reason it's a great country.
</P>
<P>
   My old media colleagues say, you know, ``damn, this is really
annoying that you guys went and did this,'' but there's something
in you that allows you to go take that risk. It wasn't guaranteed.
In the end, it could have been worth absolutely zero. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you worry that the Internet economy isn't a fair economy,
that you have to be lucky to get rich in it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR No, I think the market's very discriminating, and
customers are very discriminating.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT In many senses, it's this wealth creation _ even though
sometimes I don't like the fact that a lot of people are jumping
into this industry to make a buck _ that is driving every single
business out there to want to give it a chance. No one disputes
that the Internet, in some way _ business to business, business to
consumer _ is improving the lives of consumers. &QL;

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wealth, but No Time &QL;
</P>

   &QL;

<P>
   Q. What do you tell people who want to be entrepreneurs about
your lives and the impact that sudden wealth has had on your
lifestyle? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR I tell everyone just to pursue what you love. If you
pursue what you love, you're either going to put in the effort, and
you become the best at it, and then you're going to create a
successful company, and lots of money, and do well and have fun, or
you're going to die poor and happy because you pursued what you
love. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS I was just meeting with entrepreneurs talking about
this in Argentina and saying: Forget the money. You probably won't
go public. You probably won't be able to raise money. You're
probably going to die as a company, so you have to focus on the
fundamentals. What is it that you're going to do that's going to
change the world? And if you pick something that changes the world
really well and you do it very well, then you'll make money off of
that. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER You have to have leisure time to change your
lifestyle, and no one has leisure time yet, so I don't see people
rushing out and capitalizing on the money to change the way they
live. Everyone's too busy building a franchise right now.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is going to create huge shifts in wealth. And I
think it's going to open up charitable giving in a wave that we
haven't seen for 50 years that's going to change this country
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   I did go out and buy a few Versace gowns. It was really
therapeutic. And I've just bought a little fur jacket, and all of
that's really fun, but at the end of the day, that all takes time,
and I basically have to go back to work and keep building. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have time to follow politics? What do you want from
Washington? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR I think the Internet is changing the world like no
other system _ in such a short period of time _ that it's causing
industries to become entrenched in wanting to limit the Internet.
People want to stick their hands on the Internet through
regulations, so I think we're all finding ourselves spending a lot
more time educating governments and senators and Congress people to
make sure that they understand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT A coalition has been formed _ Netcoalition.com _ that
is specifically for the purpose of having someone there, including
the CEOs of those member companies, going to Washington and
speaking with senators, just educating them, so that eventually,
when they do make a policy decision they haven't made it completely
out of thin air. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER We're involved in politics on the consumer side. We
have each of the presidential candidates coming in to do a town
meeting in which the questions are not created by the people of
iVillage but are filtered up through the membership. It's just
having this fabulous rejuvenating impact on democracy that we
haven't even seen the beginning of yet. &QL;

   To Change the World &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a difference in culture between now and the 1980s?
Are we just a ``greed-is-good.com'' culture or is anything
different motivating people now? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS At least in the first couple of waves of the Internet,
you'll find a lot of people who think they're actors in a play to
change the world, which is very different than money for money's
sake.
</P>
<P>
   We're not investing in glamour and luxury; we're investing in
our product and our people and basic business stuff. So I think the
culture is very different.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT If you look at the movie ``Wall Street'' as the
quintessential example of that, nothing really new was being
created. We're in positions here where I think the reason there is
wealth is because we're doing something completely different than
playing with money. We are literally shaping, in some way, the way
people are going to live and the way businesses are going to run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER I was talking to someone about this whole thing, about
why this thing grabs hold of you. And then you feel like you don't
have it; it has you. For some reason, some number of people have
been tapped on the shoulder, like `you're going to be part of this
thing that is going to be born.' There is nothing that's going to
stop this particular transformation.
</P>
<P>
   It is great sometimes. Other times, it's just so consuming that
you wish you could just dial down and have 60 percent of the
experience. But that's not available. You're either in, tapped, put
to work, on the road crew, or probably you're not in. There is no
kind of convenient, ``this really works for my life.'' And I think
that's probably when any big transformation happens _ it just sort
of puts people to work in the service of itself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Kevin is burning to say something. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR It's something I probably shouldn't say, because it's
contrarian. I think that without question there's a real temptation
for some really bad things to happen. And you start to see signals
of it. We had the highest turnover in our Silicon Valley office.
</P>
<P>
   I'll talk to an employee who's leaving the company and saying:
``Love the company, love the compensation, love DoubleClick, love
everything, but I'm going to go and really throw my hat in the ring
with a hot new start-up over here. The guy next door made $20
million. I've got to make my $20 million or I'm a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   So you start to see greed. Money creates greed, and greed
creates corruption. And you're going to see more and more of this.
You're going to see bad companies. Wherever there's an incredible,
immense amount of money, there's going to be bad people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>

   Q. What do you all really hate about being a chief executive?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS Having to be ``on'' all the time. Everyone you meet
sees you through that optic. So much so that now, unless it's a
business context, I never say what I do. I always work for ``a
Latin American company.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATERNOT That's exactly what I do as well. A nameless company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change I saw to the negative is going from a private
company to a public one. All of a sudden you have to be that much
more careful with the random people that you meet, because
sometimes you'll start off in a perfectly casual conversation and
before you know it, you realize that person's just wanting to know
where your stock's going next week. That can get annoying.
</P>
<P>
   It's constantly feeling like sometimes you're being taken
advantage of by people who do know who you are, and you just want
to be anonymous. You don't want to necessarily be a public profile
24 hours a day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there anything else you dislike? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARPENTER Travel. Today, being a CEO means an enormous amount of
travel. Often, you go somewhere and you talk for an hour and it's
critical. You have to do it, but you think, ``God, this whole thing
took me 12 hours and it was an hour of something that actually
happened.'' We can be more and more productive on planes with
computers, but travel takes a huge personal toll. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS I arrived this morning (in Miami) at 5 from Buenos
Aires, had a press conference at 8:30, gave a speech at 9:30 and
got on a plane at 11 (to come to New York).
</P>
<P>
   Something I don't think is at all a positive is that the CEO
figure has become a bit of a starlet. Literally, there's probably
30 people or more in our company who could have done that speech
today, and done it much better than I, since I was half dazed
anyway. But people want to meet you, and that makes a difference.
Sometimes it is a bit overwhelming. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR To me, it's just family. You just don't get to see
them. Wife can understand, but two kids, two young kids, they have
a tough time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will you still be the chief executive of DoubleClick when
you're 60? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR The board willing. Hopefully, I'll drop dead behind my
desk of old age and the board doesn't shoot me. So far they like
me, though. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You envision that kind of career? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'CONNOR Yeah, if the board thinks I'm the best person for the
job, then, yeah, I'd love to keep it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How about the rest of the panel? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPUELAS Sixty's a long way away. I love what I do. I can't
imagine doing anything else, but I've also seen people who've been
at the same job for 20 years, and it's not pretty. I'd like to also
think that I'm imminently replaceable and that within the 700
people we have in our team are at least 100 that could have my job.
I like to think that anybody can actually replace me and that that
should be everyone's desire at our company, that they should want
my job and that they should work for it and get it.

   PURSUIT OF STOCK WEALTH BRINGS A WORLD OF SWINDLERS
</P>
<P>
   Along with the greatest bull market in American history comes a
world of low-priced stocks and high-priced dreams, of grimy offices
and sham companies, of swindlers who bilk Americans out of roughly
$2 billion a year, securities regulators say. The problem is so
severe that regulators and prosecutors have made it one of their
chief goals to crack down on what they used to dismiss as
``penny-stock fraud.'' It was in this world that Albert Alain
Chalem and Maier Lehmann lived _ and died. The men, who were
promoting stocks over the Internet together, were both shot in the
head on Oct. 25 and left to die on the marble floor in the $1.1
million home in Colts Neck, N.J., where Chalem lived.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are examining whether there is a link between the
deaths of the two stock promoters and an account one of them may
have had at Harbor Securities, a small stock trading firm that
closed this week.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY SEEPS INTO FILMS
</P>
<P>
   Mike Figgis, the director of ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' is seeking
to exploit the digital technologies that are beginning to seep into
the Hollywood mainstream. His latest film, ``Time Code 2000,'' is
being shot in real time with four digital cameras as one continuous
take. When it appears in theaters, he said, the images from all
four cameras will be shown simultaneously, either in horizontal
strips with four images shown left to right or stacked two atop
two, allowing audience members to edit the film in their heads as
they try to follow the plot. Once inside the walls of major
studios, many think, digital movie making will have a great effect
on how movies are made and how people view them.
</P>
<P>
   BOEING AGREES TO SETTLE BIAS CASE
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has agreed to pay at least $4.5 million to women and
minority employees who the Government says are paid less than their
white male counterparts, according to people involved in the
settlement, the largest ever under a Labor Department affirmative
action compliance program.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P 500 AND NASDAQ HIT RECORDS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rallied, led by computer-related companies, after
Hewlett-Packard sold shares in its measurement instruments unit.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 14.23 points, or 1
percent, to 1,424.94, a record. The Nasdaq composite index climbed
77.72 points, or 2.38 percent, to 3,347.11, also a record. The Dow
Jones industrial average climbed 152.61 points, or 1.4 percent, to
11,035.70.
</P>
<P>
   4 NATIONS BACK CASPIAN PIPELINE
</P>
<P>
   Four nations in the Caspian Sea region _ Georgia, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Turkey _ took a step toward embracing one of
President Clinton's cherished foreign policy projects, a pipeline
that would assure Western control over the region's potentially
vast oil and natural gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
   SHARES OF HEWLETT INCREASE 21%
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Hewlett-Packard jumped nearly 21 percent, one day
after the company posted stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings,
set an aggressive sales goal for next year and began spinning off
its test and measurement business. Hewlett-Packard closed at
$94.3125, up $16.3125. Shares in Agilent Technologies, the test
business, were up $12.75, at $42.75, in their first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE DEFICIT IS SEEN STABILIZING
</P>
<P>
   The nation's trade deficit appears to be stabilizing as foreign
economic growth picks up and the American demand for imports slows,
Commerce Department figures showed. While the gap widened in
September, to $24.4 billion, analysts said it would have narrowed
had it not been for surging oil prices and an off month for
aircraft delivery.

   28 REGAL HOTELS ARE SOLD IN U.S.
</P>

   Millennium &AMP; Copthorne, a London real estate company, has agreed
to buy the 28 Regal hotels in the United States for about $253
million plus the assumption of $387 million in debt from Regal
Hotels International of Hong Kong. The hotels include the Regal
U.N. Plaza in Manhattan, the Regal Biltmore in Los Angeles, the
Regal Bostonian in Boston and the Regal McCormick Ranch in
Scottsdale, Ariz.

CONNECTICUT IS CHOICE FOR TOP HONORS IN WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Except for one charity doubleheader last Sunday and the first
two rounds of the Preseason National Invitation Tournament Monday
and Wednesday, the women's college season will begin in earnest
Friday night. But a few games already played have hinted that the
women's game, which boomed in the 1990s, will be forever different.
</P>
<P>
   The best teams figure to be such old reliables as Connecticut,
Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, Rutgers, Georgia and UCLA. But they will
be joined by a dozen or so others that may be ready to drag some of
the marquee teams down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee had upset the U.S. national team the week before,
after the national team had routed UCLA and Stanford by at least 50
points each. That hardly impressed Louisiana Tech, which outhustled
Tennessee and won, 69-64.
</P>
<P>
   While Pat Summitt, the Tennessee coach, was publicly critical of
her players, she also realized that the loss could provide them
with a wake-up call. She played down the victory over the national
team because those pro stars had spent all night flying to
Knoxville, Tenn., and were flat. Against Louisiana Tech, her team,
which started three juniors, a sophomore and a freshman, lacked
leadership and played as if it expected to win simply because it
was Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more people accountable on both ends of the court,''
she said. ``The junior class has to grab this team and take
responsibility for leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The best of those juniors, and the most outspoken, is the
all-American Tamika Catchings. Summitt expects her to take over the
team the way Chamique Holdsclaw did before she graduated to the
Women's National Basketball Association last summer. Catchings is
willing to assume the burden, but on her terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' she said, ``it was Chamique and the Lady Vols. I
don't want it to be like that. When we make it to the national
championship, I want it to be the Lady Vols, not Catchings and the
Lady Vols or Semeka Randall and the Lady Vols. We don't want that
individual stuff. We want it to be a team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss by Rutgers in that Knoxville doubleheader was a concern
because the North Carolina State Wolfpack was barely a top-20 team,
yet it humbled Rutgers, 68-55. Rutgers is a running team, but most
of its players seemed baffled when North Carolina State outran and
outhustled them.
</P>
<P>
   This should have been a wake-up call for Rutgers, too, and for
all the other good teams that may have forgotten why they became
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of good teams out there,'' said Gail
Goestenkoers, the Duke coach. ``Last year, the fact we saw new
faces in the Final Four gave more teams hope they could be there.
That's half the battle _ believing you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Final Four teams in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association's 64-team tournament were Purdue, Duke,
Louisiana Tech and Georgia. Purdue beat Duke for the championship.
Georgia and Louisiana Tech are strong again, but in an example of
how much depth has come to the sport, Purdue and Duke face a
struggle just to make this season's top 20.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue lost its excellent guard combination of Stephanie
White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs to graduation. Tiffany Johnson, who
would have started this season at guard, was killed in an auto
accident. Coach Carolyn Peck left for the pros. Graduation took
three Duke starters, including 6-foot-6-inch Michelle Van Gorp.
Tennessee graduated Chamique Holdsclaw, maybe the best female
college player ever, and point guard Kellie Jolly, the glue of
Tennessee's champion teams.
</P>
<P>
   While Tennessee and Rutgers lost Sunday and Georgia beat
Alabama-Birmingham by only a point Monday night in the Preseason
NIT, Connecticut has been awaiting its opener Sunday at Iowa. Coach
Geno Auriemma said he felt good about his team, which is ranked No.
1 in the two major preseason polls. Auriemma was especially pleased
with the return of the 5-9 point guard, Sue Bird, who missed most
of last season after reconstructive knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Bird is one of three sophomores who will start. The two others
will come from Tamika Williams, Swin Cash and Asjha Jones, all 6
feet 2 inches, all pitiless on the boards and capable of scoring
spurts. Williams, Cash and Jones are so athletic that three taller
centers _ 6-5 Paige Sauer, 6-5 Kelly Schumacher and a 6-6 transfer,
Christine Rigby _ will struggle for playing time.
</P>
<P>
   The other starters are juniors _ 6-2 Svetlana Abrosimova, an
all-American from Russia, and 6-0 Shea Ralph, healthy again after
three knee operations. The only freshman on the team is Kennitra
Johnson, a 5-7 point guard who seems sure to get major playing
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potentially,'' Auriemma said, ``we can be very good, as good
as any team I've had at Connecticut, but we're still a young team.
Svet and Shea are the two keys. Sue Bird is about two months away
from being all the way back. Our style is predicated on the
pressure we put on people, and last year we never fully recovered
from the injuries to Sue and so many others.''
</P>
<P>
   That UConn team was upset by Iowa State in the regional
semifinals. This year, UConn expects to play in the Final Four
March 31 and April 2 in the First Union Center in Philadelphia. As
Abrosimova said, ``We're going to be really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma said he welcomed the rise of Rutgers, Notre Dame and
Boston College in their Big East Conference, which UConn has
dominated for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always difficult when we were the only big team in the
conference,'' Auriemma said, ``because if we lost a league game it
was on `the CBS Evening News.' You would never imagine this 10
years ago. It's something we always hoped would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marsha Sharp, the Texas Tech coach, the increase in national
contenders has been a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago,'' she said, ``there was never a chance
probably for someone that wasn't in the Top 25 to beat someone who
was in the top five. Now it happens all the time. I think that says
a lot about the growth of the game and how it's changed. I think
it's a great statement for the sport and for universities who have
made that commitment to build strong women's basketball programs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Frank Litsky thinks these are the 16 teams most likely to reach
the regional rounds of the NCAA women's basketball tournament and
provide the lineup for the Final Four in Philadelphia. (Last
season's records in parentheses.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAST TEAM STANDING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT (29-5)
</P>
<P>
   Graduation took only one starter (Amy Duran), and the two
remaining seniors have become backups. So this team is young yet
experienced, and it plays defense with a morale-breaking fury.
Svetlana Abrosimova, the 6-foot-2-inch, 19-year-old junior from
Russia, and the 6-0 Shea Ralph are fiery with the ball. Sue Bird,
her surgically repaired knee almost sound again, returns at point
guard; it's not her natural position, but that does not matter with
this uptempo offense. ``If Sue has a great year,'' Coach Geno
Auriemma said, ``we have a chance to be a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THREE MORE FOR THE FINAL FOUR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE (31-3)
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols have won three of the last four national titles.
Although Chamique Holdsclaw is gone, this team could repeat behind
three gifted juniors _ Tamika Catchings (6-1), Semeka Randall
(5-10) and Kristen (Ace) Clement (5-11) _ but the operative word
must be ``we.'' Coach Pat Summitt knows she has work to do because
Clement, the point guard, sometimes does not spot an open teammate,
and those teammates sometimes forget there is a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   LOUISIANA TECH (30-3)
</P>
<P>
   Year in and year out, Coach Leon Barmore replaces graduation
losses with guards who can fly and post players with muscle. He
lost three starters from last season's Final Four team, but the 5-8
Betty Lennox has joined the super-quick, 5-5 Tamicha Jackson in the
backcourt and Shaka Massey (6-3) is punishing under both boards.
The Lady Techsters are fast and deep.
</P>
<P>
   RUTGERS (29-6)
</P>
<P>
   A quick, athletic team that seems ready to challenge for the
national title. At 5-6, Tasha Pointer is a mercuric point guard,
and the 5-10 Shawnetta Stewart is a gunner, but more physical play
underneath would help. ``With nine juniors and seniors,'' Coach C.
Vivian Stringer said, ``we have depth, maturity and experience. I
think we'll do well. I'm an eternal optimist.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOUR THAT COULD KNOCK ON THE DOOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA (27-7)
</P>
<P>
   Despite three losses to Tennessee, the Bulldogs reached the
Final Four last season. Four starters return, including the
high-energy backcourt of the Miller twins _ Kelly (18.5 points a
game) and Coco (18.4). Tawana McDonald and the newcomer Shala
Crawford, both 6-4, provide power under the boards.
</P>
<P>
   IOWA STATE (25-8)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone returns to the team that knocked Connecticut out of the
last NCAA tournament. Four players, led by the 5-8 Stacy Frese,
averaged in double figures. The goal is the Final Four because, as
Coach Bill Fennelly said, ``If you don't believe it and don't think
about it, why do you come out and practice?''
</P>
<P>
   NOTRE DAME (26-5)
</P>
<P>
   Sheila McMillen, a 3-point gunner, is gone, but the 6-5 Ruth
Riley, a big scorer in the low post, returns. ``We're not going to
rely on Ruth to carry us all season,'' Coach Muffet McGraw said.
``I've got six people who can score a lot. This is the most
athletic team we've had. We're going to be very good.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (26-8)
</P>
<P>
   All the starters return, including Maylana Martin (6-3), a
preseason all-American, but Martin (back), the 5-9 Erica Gomez
(shoulder) and the 5-7 LaCresha Flannigan (knee) are recovering
from surgery. Although this scoring powerhouse averaged 85.2 points
a game last season, it tends to get careless on defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EIGHT THAT COULD HANG AROUND LATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA STATE (17-12)
</P>
<P>
   In its season-opening upset of Rutgers, the Wolfpack showed how
energetic it could be. The 5-10 Tynesha Lewis is a smooth off
guard, the 5-7 point guard Terah James and the 6-3 forward Kaayla
Chones hardly play like freshmen and the 6-6 Summer Erb is so big
that opponents must alter offenses and defenses.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA (28-8)
</P>
<P>
   There are no seniors but there are three top-rate juniors _
Nikki Teasley (6-0), the point guard; Juana Brown (5-11), the off
guard, and LaQuanda Barksdale (5-11), the rebounder. Size is
desperately needed under the boards, and the Tar Heels hope that
LaShonda Allen, a 6-5 sophomore, can provide it.
</P>
<P>
   ILLINOIS (20-9)
</P>
<P>
   More consistency would have helped last season. Only Alicia
Sheeler is gone from that team, so this edition has experience and
depth. Susan Blauser, a 6-2 forward who averaged 17.2 points a
game, will get help from the 6-1 Tauja Catchings (sister of
Tennessee's Tamika) and Allison Curtin (5-9).
</P>
<P>
   PENN STATE (22-8)
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions live on 3-point shooting, and they may go far
if they learn to play tough against the bad teams as well as the
good. Their five top scorers return, led by the 6-3 center Andrea
Garner (14.4 points a game), the 5-11 off guard Lisa Seepherd
(14.1) and the 5-7 point guard Helen Darling (12.4).
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN (20-9)
</P>
<P>
   There is great potential here. Everyone returns from last
season, notably center Conswella Sparrow (6-2) and forward Tasha
Hamilton (5-10). Sparrow averaged 14.4 points a game on 61.4
percent shooting, Hamilton 14.6 on 56.3 percent. Rebounding is
excellent, but 3-point shooting (29.3 percent) not so good.
</P>
<P>
   LOUISIANA STATE (22-8)
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those Southeastern Conference powerhouses that
loses its share of league games, but beats almost everyone else.
The four returning starters include Katrina Hibbert, a 5-11
Australian wing player, and Detrina White, a 5-11 center who has
trouble guarding bigger opponents in the post.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA-SANTA BARBARA (26-4)
</P>
<P>
   A superstrong team from the supersoft Big West Conference; once
the conference season starts it is seldom tested. Everyone returns,
and still there are only three seniors. Watch for Erin Buescher, a
6-3 junior guard who last season averaged 19.9 points and 47.3
percent 3-point shooting.
</P>
<P>
   OLD DOMINION (28-4)
</P>
<P>
   An uphill battle awaits because Mery Andrade, the best player
and best defender, is gone, along with the other 3-point shooters.
The burden falls on Lucienne Berthieu, a 6-2 junior forward-center
from France. The well of foreign talent has dried up, so the Final
Four seems just a dream.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Sunday it was just a conference call, and it
lasted little more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than two hours on Monday afternoon, and then again
Monday night, and then again Tuesday afternoon, several of George
W. Bush's leading foreign policy advisers and top aides sat with
him in the yellow-walled parlor and blue-walled dining room of the
governor's mansion in Austin, Texas, and trotted the globe: Russia,
China, North Korea, Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Their principal mission was to put the finishing touches on a
foreign policy speech that Bush is scheduled to give on Friday. But
there was another, equally important goal: the education of Bush on
the subject _ international affairs _ that has caused him the most
trouble in his presidential campaign so far.
</P>
<P>
   And there was awareness, among advisers inside and outside the
gilded chambers, that the scrutiny given to Bush's words on this
topic would only intensify in the coming days and weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to have a live, hour-long interview on ``Meet
the Press,'' his first appearance on a Sunday morning talk show
this campaign. Then, between Dec. 2 and 13, he will participate in
three televised debates with his rivals for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will almost certainly be challenged to demonstrate the kind
of international fluency that eluded him during an unanticipated
grilling about foreign leaders by a television reporter two weeks
ago. These events will provide a fuller, fairer test of just how
well he has been preparing.
</P>
<P>
   The way that Bush handles them, several advisers acknowledged,
could be critical for the continued success of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always felt there would be a moment when people would start
looking at us differently,'' said one adviser. ``That moment's
come, and we've got to rise to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser conceded that even though the televised pop quiz was
almost universally dismissed as inappropriate, ``people viewed that
episode as potentially illuminating. We know that it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite that assertion and all of Bush's preparation, the
Texas governor still seems a bit shaky on foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone interview with an Associated Press reporter
on Tuesday, Bush made a reference to the Russian military attacking
women and children in Chechnya, the breakaway republic. When the
writer asked if the attacks were still occurring, Bush could be
heard asking someone near him if he was correct in his belief that
they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Condi Rice is shaking her head in agreement,'' Bush then
answered, referring to his chief foreign policy adviser,
Condoleezza Rice.
</P>
<P>
   For several days now, in television interviews, telephone calls
with reporters and comments on the campaign trail in Iowa, Bush has
been conducting what seems to be a nonstop rehearsal for the speech
he will deliver Friday in Simi Valley, Calif., and for his
television appearance on Sunday. Advisers say he recognizes the
interview as an essential rite of political passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has said privately to people, `I've got to take some
questions given to me by people who are pretty good at it and get
dirtied up a bit,''' one adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   In his previews of the speech, Bush has vowed to be a fierce
advocate for what he calls a new internationalism, with the United
States playing an active role in promoting peace. He has said he
will strongly support free trade, especially with China. He has
said that international aid should be withdrawn if Russia persists
in its aggression against Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In Davenport, Iowa, on Wednesday, Bush acknowledged that voters
may have questions about his readiness for the global stage, but
said, ``I think the American people have questions about every
person running for president in terms of foreign policy, and they
should.''
</P>
<P>
   His advisers, he said, have helped him translate his bedrock
beliefs about the U.S. role in the world into specific policies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he added, ``They help me understand the nuance _ a
word I'm learning. In Texas politics, we don't spend much time on
nuance. But there's nuance in foreign policy. I'm beginning to
learn that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's education began early this year with a stream of visits
to the governor's mansion by Ms. Rice and other experts, including
George Shultz, President Reagan's secretary of state, and two
people who served under President Bush _ Paul D. Wolfowitz, a
senior defense official and Robert Zoellick, an undersecretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
   These experts and Bush's aides quibbled with the frequent
characterization of these sessions as tutorials, saying that the
discussions have been more free-wheeling than that, with Bush doing
as much talking as listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a blank slate at all,'' said Dov Zakheim, who was a
senior official in the Department of Defense under President
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   These advisers added that what Bush lacked in detailed
knowledge, he made up for in curiosity. Richard L. Armitage, who
was a senior official in the Pentagon under President Bush, turned
to a sports metaphor to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``In basketball,'' Armitage said, ``you can't coach height. In
foreign and defense policy, you can't coach liking it. And he likes
it.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Bush has demonstrated a particular fondness for asking his
advisers hypothetical questions about possible developments in the
world's hot spots. Several advisers said he seemed to prefer
discussions to in-depth reading, although he has been known to
needle advisers when something they say diverges from something
they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor is focused, but the atmosphere is relaxed. If a
meeting begins at the end of one of Bush's runs, he may show up in
sweaty workout clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush hit the campaign trail and began taking unscripted
questions from reporters, these advisers and Bush's policy
director, Josh Bolten, have frequently provided him with written
information about current events. The material, sometimes in
question-and-answer form, supplements Bush's own reading of daily
newspapers and magazines, advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rice, a specialist who once worked with the National
Security Council, said that in addition to visiting Bush in Austin
about once a week, she calls or sends him electronic mail every few
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to say, `Here are some breaking issues that you may want
to pay attention to,''' she explained. ``I consider it my job to
sort, and to say, `Gee, Chechnya has reached the point where we
have to think a little more about it.' It's partly for the long
haul, but it's also, frankly, because he may be asked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a newspaper columnist, writing about the pop quiz,
suggested 10 more relevant foreign policy questions that Bush
should be asked, Ms. Rice and other advisers pulled together
background information on each one and provided it to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush's aides and advisers have not done is riddle him with
the kinds of simple facts that they say have nothing to do with his
ability to make proper decisions about foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thinks it's important for him to memorize names in
order to deflect criticism,'' Ms. Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Other advisers said that Bush has also been encouraged, in
answering questions, to stick to the broad themes and priorities
that he is trying to articulate.
</P>
<P>
   That is Bush's sensibility, anyway, advisers said. ``Like
Reagan, he's got a predisposition for certain broad ideas,'' said
Richard Perle, an assistant secretary of defense under President
Reagan. But, Perle added, ``I think he's intellectually more
curious than Reagan was.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advisers also noted Bush's inquisitiveness. ``Some people
can ask you the first question, but I was more impressed when he
asked a follow-up and another and another,'' said Shultz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has convictions and he's testing them,'' Shultz said.
``He's honing his views.''

 COLLEGE STATION, Texas: steel cable.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout a day plagued by heat and dust, more than 100 rescue
workers labored as cranes and bulldozers picked delicately through
the wreckage. ``We're not sure what might be holding up what, and
the crew has to be meticulous at what they're doing,'' said Dr. Kem
Bennett, director of Texas Task Force One, a statewide emergency
rescue unit. ``This is far worse than in a building collapse in
that the structure twisted as it collapsed and all of the pieces
are tangled together.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams of about a dozen male and female students in hard hats
worked quietly, hoisting logs the size of telephone poles onto
their shoulders and moving them away from the collapsed structure.
At different times rescuers detected tapping noises and followed
the sounds toward trapped students. Officials said the last rescue
occurred at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a game of pick-up sticks. The logs are all
intertwined. It's a slow process, very meticulous,''' said Bart
Humphreys, public information officer for the College Station fire
department.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the yellow police tape, several hundred students hugged
and consoled one another, their dust-streaked faces also streaked
with tears. Several female students pinned white ribbons to shirts,
while others stood in a circle saying prayers. Everyone seemed
shocked and horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine what I saw when I came here last night,''
said Will Hurd, the student body president. ``Bonfire started as a
symbol of our burning desire to support our football team and
defeat our rival in the state, the University of Texas. It has now
turned into an act of kinship, an act of love, and an act of
friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for Texas A&AMP;M, the nation's third-largest public
land-grant university with more than 43,000 students, the bonfire
is a revered tradition. The first was set ablaze in 1909, and until
now the tradition had been interrupted only once, after the
assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. In 1994, the structure
collapsed after torrential rains caused the ground to shift, but no
one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   University officials estimate that harvesting the logs and
building the bonfire structure involves 125,000 work hours by about
5,000 students. Students take training classes to participate in
the harvest _ or the cut, as it is known on campus. Until 1970,
when school officials limited the height of the structure to 55
feet, students had built towers as high as 110 feet.
</P>
<P>
   This year, construction began on Nov. 5 when the guiding center
pole was placed in the ground. In keeping with tradition, student
guards have since patrolled the site 24 hours a day. Traditionally,
the week before the bonfire is known as Push, as in pushing to
finish the job, and students were working in round-the-clock shifts
to complete the tower. Before the accident, students had erected
about 40 feet of the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Often teased for its traditions by outsiders, particularly
anyone affiliated with the University of Texas, Texas A&AMP;M students
and alumni say traditions like the bonfire create a bond and a
kinship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to view the world through maroon-colored glasses,''
said Brent Adam, a New York stock trader who oversees an alumni
group known as the Wall Street Aggies. He said news of the accident
had quickly spread among alumni everywhere. ``I've had people from
all sides of the planet e-mail today,'' Adam said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ United by a desire to proclaim victory and leave
town, Republicans and Democrats in the House joined on Thursday
night to pass the final budget bill of the year, seven weeks after
the fiscal year began.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted, 296-135, for a package of five spending bills
containing $385 billion, sending the measure to the Senate. An
avalanche of oratory from three Senate Democrats seeking benefits
for their states blocked the bill's path and briefly threatened a
government shutdown, a threat that evaporated when the Senate
extended the budget deadline until Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties claimed political victory in nearly identical
language after the House vote, in which 170 Republicans were joined
by 125 Democrats and one independent in supporting the bill.
</P>
<P>
   After seven months of haggling over the year's 13 spending
bills, and after 10 days of intense negotiations between the White
House and the Republican leaders in Congress, both sides said the
result represented the essence of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called it ``a hard-won victory for the
American people.'' His chief of staff, John Podesta, simply said,
``We're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said that Congress
had ``basically turned the corner on how this town does business''
by limiting spending in a booming economy, allowing the government
to pay down a small part of its $3.6 trillion debt instead.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans fought for and won a $17 billion spending
increase for the Pentagon, along with more money for politically
popular health research and education. They said they kept their
promise to refrain from using excess contributions to Social
Security to pay for the spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats and the White House were able to assert that they
had won the funds for hiring more primary school teachers and local
police officers, underwriting Middle East peace agreements and
finally paying some of the $1 billion withheld by Congress in dues
the United States owes the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed on providing $12.8 billion over five years to
teaching hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers
who were suffering financially from cuts in Medicare imposed by
Congress in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The 84 Republicans voting no were protesting spending increases
won by the White House for programs like foreign aid and
environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
   The 51 Democrats who voted no, a quarter of their party in the
House, split with their president over the compromises the White
House made in its final budget negotiations with the Republicans.
Some rebelled over restrictions Republicans sought on aid to
international family planning groups in exchange for freeing up the
back dues owed the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to a ban on using such aid to promote abortions
to free nearly $1 billion that the United States owes the United
Nations. He can waive the restrictions, but then $12.5 million in
federal grants to women's health groups would be shifted to a
children's fund.
</P>
<P>
   Angry at this tradeoff, 19 female House Democrats demanded that
the White House make amends. Steve Ricchetti, a deputy White House
chief of staff, told them on Thursday that the administration would
ask Congress next year for more than $500 million in federal grants
for the groups.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats protested what they called bookkeeping tricks in
the budget that allowed the Republicans to claim that they had
protected Social Security surpluses. The Congressional Budget
Office says the bills dip into the retirement reserves for at least
$17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The final budget deal, agreed to early Thursday morning,
included some of this sort of sleight-of-hand, such as delaying the
last payday of next September for Pentagon personnel and some
civilian government employees so it falls in the next fiscal year.
That saves no money, but eliminates expenditures in the 2000 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These accounting gimmicks may appear to be funny,'' said Rep.
David Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee. ``But they're corrosive of democracy and
of our role in it.'' &QL;

NO SIGNS OF MECHANICAL FAILURE FROM EGYPTAIR RECORDER DATA, SAY
OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AIRCRASH-EGYPT) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A re-examination of information from the flight
data recorder on EgyptAir Flight 990, from the time of takeoff to
just before the aircraft plunged toward the sea, has uncovered no
sign of a mechanical malfunction, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was ``rock steady,'' said one aviation expert involved
in the case, who, like others, expressed doubt that anything could
have been mechanically wrong with the plane, a 10-year-old Boeing
767, without an indication of some kind on the flight data
recorder, which keeps track of 155 categories of information,
involving dozens of aircraft systems.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of even a hint of an equipment breakdown was the
strongest piece of evidence, according to both aviation
investigators and law enforcement officials, that someone at the
controls of the aircraft may have been responsible for the crash,
deliberately forcing the jet into a steep dive. The crash in the
early morning hours of Oct. 31 killed 217 people, including 106
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A g official involved in the case said that while the Egyptians
continued to believe that the plane's dive and remarks on the
cockpit voice recorder could be the crew's a rational response to
some mechanical problem with the plane, they had not thus far
proposed a theory of what that problem might have been.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said that a relief pilot whom they
identified as Gameel el-Batouty, was in control of the Boeing 767
as the catastrophic events began to unfold about a half-hour into
the New York to Cairo flight. They said that a cryptic remark he
made that may have been a prayer made them suspect that he
deliberately crashed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, the agency that took over the investigation when Egypt
delegated its responsibility for the inquiry to the United States,
said that the main focus of his agency was to decide whether the
crash has been properly investigated as an accident, or whether it
was a crime and thus the province of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from Cairo arrived in Washington about 1 p.m.
Thursday. But with the contents of the tape now a delicate
diplomatic issue, the NTSB, which is leading the inquiry, made no
official statement and would not even say who the new Egyptian
experts were. A spokesman said he believed there were ``four or
five of them.''
</P>
<P>
   One investigator contrasted the lack of any hint of trouble on
EgyptAir 990 with Swissair Flight 111 disaster, another recent
crash at sea of a big passenger jet with a modern flight data
recorder. In that case, he said, problems were evident from
information picked up on the flight data recorder on the MD-11 long
before the crew radioed for help. The plane crashed off Halifax,
Nova Scotia, on Sept. 2, 1998, killing 229 people.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Justice Department official said Thursday that a
decision about whether to transfer the case to the FBI from
aviation safety officials would probably be made in a few days. The
decision is significant because it would, in effect, declare that
authorities suspect the crash was caused by a criminal act, not a
mechanical malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department official, Eric Holder, , said that while
U.S. officials would coordinate with Egyptian officials, U.S.
authorities would reach their own independent judgments about the
crash. ``We need to have some further discussions with them before
any decisions are ultimately made,'' said Holder, the deputy
attorney general. ``But I would not say anything is contingent upon
the approval of the Egyptian government.''

FINAL DRAGGING DEATH DEFENDANT GETS LIFE TERM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Shawn Allen Berry, a 24-year-old cinema manager
and bull rider who said he counted African-Americans among his
friends, on Thursday became the third white man to be convicted of
capital murder in the gruesome dragging death of a disabled black
man.
</P>
<P>
   But Berry was spared the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   An all-white jury, which deliberated about 10 hours over two
days to reach a verdict, took 75 minutes to sentence Berry to life
in prison, meaning he has no chance for parole until he's 64.
</P>
<P>
   The other men convicted in the killing of James Byrd Jr. _
avowed white supremacists John William King Jr., 25, and Lawrence
Russell Brewer Jr., 32 _ were sentenced to death earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got better than Byrd! Rot in hell!'' Ethel Parks of Jasper
shouted as Berry was led in a bulletproof vest to a car that would
take him to prison in Huntsville. At the wheel was Curtis Frame,
the lead investigator at the crime scene after Byrd's decapitated
remains were found dumped at a black church five miles outside this
East Texas town.
</P>
<P>
   Berry stared straight ahead and made no response. In the
courtroom, he turned to his fiancee Christy Marcontell after
hearing the sentence, kissed her full on her lips as she copiously
wept and then let himself be escorted out by sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors issued a joint statement saying the verdict was reached
unanimously after ``long hours of painful and prayerful
deliberations.'' In a questionnaire returned to Judge Joe Bob
Golden, they indicated that they did not think that Berry would be
a threat to society when he's eligible for release in 40 years _ a
necessary element to reaching a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sympathize with his family,'' said Clara Taylor, a sister of
the victim. ``We also lost someone. But their pain was was caused
by what Shawn did.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury was swayed by ``emotionalism'' in the punishment phase,
she said. ``I'm glad it's over, and I accept their verdict. But I
think they shared equally in the crime and should have received the
same sentence,'' Taylor said of Berry.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the third trial could not come too soon for this
timber industry community of 7,100 _ 45 percent black, 55 percent
white _ where life has been unsettled since Byrd's remains were
found on June 7, 1998. There was an evident pride among residents,
black and white, that justice prevailed with all-white jurors in a
racially charged case, one that attracted international notoriety
and revived memories of Old South white-on-black violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that we can start healing,'' said John Matthews, a
white real estate agent whose office is directly across the street
from the century-old courthouse. ``And it establishes that hate
crimes won't be tolerated in Jasper. We've set a precedent for all
East Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry's attorney, Joseph Columbus ``Lum'' Hawthorn of Beaumont,
expressed disappointment with the verdict but said he was happy
that his client did not get the death penalty. Berry will likely
appeal, Hawthorn said, citing Golden's rejection of the last-minute
motion for a change of venue and what Hawthorn said were mistakes
by the judge in jury selection.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen defense witnesses, including
African-Americans, testified that Berry was not a hate-filled
person. District Attorney Guy James Gray several times told the
jury that he did not consider the defendant a racist, instead
arguing that he participated in the torture slaying for the sheer
fun of it. Then Gray produced footprint evidence that, he
contended, showed that only Berry could have driven the pickup when
Byrd was being dragged.
</P>
<P>
   In the punishment phase, Berry cried and asked to be excused
after he listened to a friend describe him as a loving father to a
2-year-old named Montana and as a man who would not be dangerous in
the future. The session briefly adjourned; when it resumed, Berry
returned to his seat between his lawyer and sobbing fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   But at no time did Berry express remorse for Byrd's murder, a
point that the prosecution repeatedly stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Berry was asked on the stand on Thursday if he was remorseful.
At first, instead of answering the question directly, he referred
to a psychiatrist's testimony that a defendant who denies
culpability rarely expresses remorse.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Berry finally said, ``I feel very sorry for what
happened to Mr. Byrd, and I've said so from Day 1. I wanted to
speak to the Byrd family but couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   To show that Berry did not represent a continuing threat, Berry
testified that he had a black cellmate and was given trusty status
in Jasper County Jail after his arrest as a capital murder suspect.
He was allowed to walk freely to a jail area that leads outside and
even once informed jailers the door was unlocked, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hardy, an assistant district attorney who is a former karate
champion, thundered the jury in his raspy, high-pitched voice:
``Shawn Allen Berry chose to move in with Bill King. Shawn Berry
chose to pick up Mr. Byrd, chose to take him to a remote area,
chose to chain him like an animal to the back of a pickup and drag
him three miles. He chose to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Byrd did not choose to be left decapitated in front of a
church.''

BONFIRE IS THE GRANDADDY OF A&AMP;M TRADITIONS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not ``a bonfire'' or ``the bonfire.'' It's Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   It dates to 1909, making it a Texas A&AMP;M tradition older than the
rousing Midnight Yell Practice. Older even that the first official
A&AMP;M mascot, the beloved collie Reveille I.
</P>
<P>
   The autumn blaze symbolizes what half a dozen Aggies described
Thursday as Texas A&AMP;M's ``burning desire to beat the hell out of
t.u.,'' known outside College Station as the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For Aggies, Bonfire is so much more than a football rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Schellenbach Bogle, A&AMP;M Class of '81, stood close to the
fire during her college days and remembers the flames and the
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat is intense,'' the Fort Worth free-lance writer
recalled. ``And it's an emotional thing, I guess because it's the
spirit of something that binds living and dead people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an emotional brotherhood and sisterhood there that
links you with everybody who was ever there and who will ever be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillard Stone felt that spirit. ``It is not an event,'' said the
former Texas A&AMP;M Corps of Cadets deputy commander, now a Fort Worth
financial analyst. ``It's an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Hub Baker's father felt it. So did Hub, a second generation
Aggie and the general manager of Cowtown Coliseum in Fort Worth.
And now Hub's daughter, a senior speech and communications major,
also feels the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   But for only the second time in 90 years, there will be no
Bonfire this year. The first time was in November 1963, after
President John F. Kennedy was slain on the streets of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   And now, another tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   As 60 to 70 students worked atop the pile early Thursday
preparing the framework for the Thanksgiving blaze, the 40-foot
tower of logs collapsed with a sickening roar, crushing some
students to death and injuring others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like pickup sticks. These logs are all intertwined,''
Bart Humphreys, a College Station Fire Department spokesman, told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Kristi Holban, alumni relations director at Texas Christian
University in Fort Worth, said A&AMP;M students and alumni ``are
probably stronger in tradition than any school I've seen
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Holban said that dedication to school spirit may stem at least
partly from A&AMP;M's fierce rivalry with UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, their ring is a big deal. When an Aggie sees
another person with a ring on, they will cross the room to
introduce themselves,'' Holban said. ``They are just a strong,
well-connected alumni group.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandra Pate of Fort Worth, who attended A&AMP;M during the
mid-1970s, says the school's strong traditions are linked to its
military roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any of these military schools. Their traditions are
kind of set in stone,'' she said. ``Down there, there's not a patch
of ground that's not sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou Obdyke, Class of '67 and president of the Capital City A&AMP;M
Club in Austin, was a freshman in 1963 when Kennedy was shot. He
said he hopes this year's tragedy does not mean the end of Bonfire
because the project has such a unifying effect on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his Bonfire days, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We all participated in some way. The most experienced groups
did the stacking on campus, because it was recognized that it was
hard work and dangerous. The juniors and seniors did the cutting of
the tree with axes or chain saws, and the underclassman carried
those logs out of the woods to the trucks that transported them to
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety has always been a concern. This is just a tragic
accident...''
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the tradition was mixed with profound grief
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a horrible, horrible thing for all these kids and
their families, and the whole community,'' said Fort Worth attorney
James Creel, a trustee of the A&AMP;M Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even know what caused it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the tragedy renewed a debate over the future of
Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bonfire is not worth one Aggie's life,'' said Lee Bradley,
Class of '61 and director of the Fort Worth Water Department. ``But
it's not a tradition we would like to see go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who once stacked logs for the fire, says he has two
daughters who have worked on the annual project.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling was really for the loss of the kids and their
parents,'' he pointed out. ``I realize it could happen anywhere;
people have car wrecks and die...
</P>
<P>
   ``But you just hate to have it associated with one of the good
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Haltom City lawyer Bill Ray, Class of '81, worked on the bonfire
for five years, helping guard it on occasion and sometimes
struggling to the top to tie logs. The project begins as early as
September, and some say it requires 125,000 hours of student labor.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry traces its roots back nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when it got started, people who went to A&AMP;M were ranchers
and farmers, the cowboys, because it was cheap,'' Ray said. The
University of Texas ``was looked on more as the upper crust.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hub Baker: ``Every Aggie is heartbroken over this tragedy,
because they all relate to the bonfire. My dad was an Aggie, and
the great stories he told about the camaraderie and the spirit and
the kinship among the students, all these guys working together to
put up that great bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition of Bonfire needs to stay at A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   A night or two before the annual UT game, the Aggie Corps of
Cadets traditionally stands at attention as the Fightin' Aggie Band
plays ``The Spirit of Aggieland'' and flames and sparks light up
the darkened sky.
</P>
<P>
   The crowning touch is an orange outhouse perched atop the pile
of logs, placed there by a crane. Constructed and painted by band
members, the outhouse is decorated with signs identifying it as
``t.u. frat house'' and ``Austin City Limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such lightheartedness, Abilene author Glenn Dromgoole, a
former editor of the campus newspaper and the Bryan-College Station
Eagle, says he was concerned for years about the potential for
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid it would start from the bonfire and catch some
houses on fire,'' he said. ``But I never thought, never dreamed,
something like this would happen.''

<P>
   &QL; 
``MY MOVIE BUSINESS'' &QL; 
By John Irving (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, New &AMP; Notable has had occasion to talk with a
number of good writers whose books have been made into movies,
including Alice Walker (``The Color Purple''), Michael Ondaatje
(``The English Patient''), Sue Miller (``The Good Mother''),
Russell Banks (``The Sweet Hereafter''), Anna Quindlen (``One True
Thing'') and David Guterson (``Snow Falling on Cedars''). Almost
without exception, the happiest among them were those who had
relinquished control, who recognized from the start that they were
writers of novels, not screenplays. They took the money, handed
over their books and waited to see what came of it. Over the years,
John Irving has chosen a different path. He declined to write the
screenplay for ``The World According to Garp,''but he was involved
enough in the filmmaking process to rankle under the changes that
Steve Tesich made in his novel. He also declined to write the
screenplay for ``The Hotel New Hampshire,'' then watched as Tony
Richardson made a farcical exaggeration of the book. Irving did not
decline to write a screenplay for ``The Cider House Rules.'' In
fact, he wrote many of them, draft after draft for director after
director. Over the course of 13 years, he worked with four
directors and wrote so many versions of the script that he learned
how to do it right. His first draft, written when he still believed
a film should be true to a novel, would have made a nine-hour
movie. The final script whittled a 500-page novel down to 136
pages. By that time, Irving knew that ``a screenplay, as a piece of
writing, is merely the scaffolding for a building someone else is
going to build.'' This memoir of his moviemaking experiences is
unabashedly self-indulgent, a chance for Irving to talk about his
novels, his children and friends, his grandfather (whose work as an
obstetrician influenced the story of ``Cider House'') and his
success. It's also a chance to plug the movie, which is set to open
here next month. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE ART OF THE STORY'' &QL; 
Edited by Daniel Halpern (Viking, $40) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This international anthology of contemporary short stories
includes work from 78 contributors from 35 countries. All of the
writers were born from 1938 to 1970 and were chosen by Halpern to
represent a greater sensitivity to popular culture than those
included in his earlier volume, ``The Art of the Tale.'' These
stories, he says, are ``less in `the classical mode' and more
reactive to the media in all its venues. These younger writers have
distanced themselves _ sometimes subtly, sometimes less so _ from
the influential writers practicing during the first two or three
decades of the 20th century.'' Raymond Carver just made the cut, as
did Margaret Atwood, Richard Bausch, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates,
Amos Oz, Kenya's Ngugi Wa Thiong O (EDITORS: how it's listed at
amazon.com ) and Argentina's Luisa Valenzuela. Among the younger
writers are Lorrie Moore, Ben Okri, Salman Rushdie, Bobbie Ann
Mason, Tobias Wolff, Barry Hannah, James Kelman, Richard Ford,
Deborah Eisenberg, Banana Yoshimoto, Martin Amis, Turkey's Murathan
Mungan, Ghana's Ama Ata Aidoo and Lebanon's Hanan Al-Shaykh. Also
here are writers from Cuba, Nigeria, Martinique, India, Haiti,
Vietnam, Russia, Hungary, Somalia, Uruguay, France, Tanzania,
Poland, Scandinavia, South Africa and China. &QL; 
``ENCHANTED NIGHT'' &QL; 
By Steven Millhauser (Crown, $17) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the night of revelation. This is the night the dolls
wake. This is the night of the dreamer in the attic. This is the
night of the piper in the woods.'' This passage is a sign of
ethereal things to come. Millhauser, who won a Pulitzer Prize for
``Martin Dressler,'' has written an otherworldly story in brief
passages that portray people in a Connecticut town one hot summer
night. There is Havershaw, a 39-year-old man who lives in the attic
of his mother's house and struggles to find some justification for
his life. There are ``the outlaws,'' a gang of teenage girls who
break into houses and steal unimportant things (refrigerator
magnets, toothbrushes), always leaving behind the same note _ ``We
Are Your Daughters.'' There is Janet Manning, a young woman with
sensuous thoughts of the handsome stranger she met on the beach
that day, and William Cooper, a young man with a crush on a lovely
mannequin in the window of a department store (a mannequin that
will, on this magical night, come to life). And all across town,
the old, forgotten dolls stored in attics begin to wake up and
shake their dusty limbs. Some town, huh? Millhauser's dreamlike
tale _ a mere 109 pages long _ is grounded in the familiar longing
of his characters and played out under a big, white moon on an
enchanted summer night. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FRONTIER CHILDREN'' &QL; 
By Linda Peavy and Ursula Smith (Oklahoma, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was sadder to see than the graves of children who died
along the westward trail as their families traveled with the wagon
trains of the mid-1800s. And nothing was more triumphant than news
of children who made the journey and began a new life. Peavy and
Smith, whose previous collaborations were ``Pioneer Women'' and
``Women in Waiting in the Westward Movement,'' offer a clear-eyed
view of what frontier life was like for youngsters of Chinese,
Hispanic, Native American, African-American and European
backgrounds. Because the experiences of these children were largely
undocumented, the authors have relied on stories handed from one
generation to another, the few existing letters and diaries written
by frontier children, journals kept by explorers and missionaries,
and, most important, photographs. Their text is accompanied by 206
black-and-white images, and some of them will break your heart. &QL;

 &HT;    `Conversion': Loss of identity has meaning for Jews
 &HT;    By Joel Engelhardt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEVASSERET ZION, Israel _ Aharon Appelfeld _ round-faced,
balding and professorial _ sits in his pleasant apartment in the
suburban hills outside Jerusalem, and explains in the way of a
grandfather why he writes haunting tales of Jews spurning their
religion in the years before the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his well-regarded novels, ``The Conversion,'' most of
the Jews in an Austrian town have converted to Christianity,
leaving only a small circle of merchants to adhere to the old ways.
Even those who convert will die, however, since the Nazis are still
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is about escaping Judaism and how you cannot escape
it,'' Appelfeld says, choosing his words carefully. ``And this is a
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Appelfeld knows tragedy well. As an 8-year-old, he witnessed his
mother's murder during the Holocaust and spent time in a
concentration camp. But his novels aren't full of black-booted
Gestapo. They are set in idyllic European cities and villages long
before or after the threat of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a disintegrated society,'' he says of his
characters. ``They have lost their Jewishness. It has just
evaporated and the young people don't know why they are Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious questions hang heavily, like dirty laundry, in the
novels of Appelfeld, 67, whom Newsweek has called a writer worthy
of Nobel Prize consideration:
</P>
<P>
   Can the Holocaust happen in America? Can Jews just decide to
stop being Jews? Is the greatest threat to the Jewish people the
Jewish people themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Conversion,'' in which an adult Jew joins most of his
generation in converting to Christianity but is destroyed by his
lost identity, takes place in turn-of-the-century Europe but, on a
larger level, could be America today. Appelfeld sees in America a
Jewish culture disappearing through its own misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Jews do not face the threat of European Jews. There's
been too much intermarriage. But the threat is that the culture
will disappear _ not totally, but it will shrink. You can see it in
every community,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Conversion'' and ``The Retreat,'' the story of Jews who
remove themselves to a mountain resort to learn to act like
Gentiles, capture that shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy of the Holocaust is that it came in a moment when
Jewishness was no more dear to Jews,'' Appelfeld says. ``Up to the
end of the 19th century, most (Jews) were ready to sacrifice
themselves for their Jewishness. Then suddenly, the Jew doesn't
want to be a Jew. The community doesn't have meaning. He wants to
be an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 40-plus books, of which 13 have been translated from
Hebrew to English, he writes about the periods before, during and
after the war, a time he calls ``100 years of Jewish loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions he asks mirror the questions the author wrestled
with as he came to grips with a childhood torn by Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   He was the child of urban Jews who forgot they were Jews. They
did not master the prayers or attend services on holy days.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nazis came to Czernovitz, Appelfeld's home city in what
is now part of the Ukraine, they did not take his family's failure
to observe the Sabbath into account. They killed Appelfeld's mother
and sent the 8-year-old boy and his father to separate
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   He escaped. He survived by denying his identity, first alone,
living in the Ukrainian woods, and then marching through Europe as
a kitchen boy with the Russian army. He snuck into Palestine after
the war, fought for Israel's independence, and found himself in a
new land, with a new language and, by the age of 18, still no
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came with a lot of terrible experience of the camp and the
ghetto and I wanted to understand what happened to me because I was
too young during the Holocaust,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Hebrew University and only in his early 20s began to
wonder about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disoriented. Not born here. No parents. It was only late
that I began to ask, `Who am I? Where are my parents?'
</P>
<P>
   ``These existential questions became the drive of my writing.''
</P>
<P>
   He began publishing his novels in the early 1960s but his work
was not translated to English until 1980 with ``Badenheim 1939,''
the story of what happens to people when their summer resort is
converted to a prison ghetto under the efficient watch of a
faceless bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Appelfeld creates an absorbing world of idiosyncratic,
self-absorbed types, but draws his characters through
understatement. His writing is clear. His ideas are wrapped in
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rule is always less is more,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He writes at home, at a desk in his basement study, for five to
six hours a day. ``If you can sit everyday five to six hours in
front of a blank page, you are a writer,'' he says. ``It's a lot of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles when told his Spartan style reveals a debt to
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to say something, say it. If you don't, don't say
it. And it should be understandable. Every sentence should be
understandable. Writing is not fog. It should be transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   He will retire next year after 25 years as professor of Jewish
literature at Ben Gurion University, a 90-minute bus ride from his
home.
</P>
<P>
   He is working on a new novel, as yet untitled, and he won't
reveal its plot. But it is sure to raise questions.
</P>
<P>
   Appelfeld won't go as far as to say the Holocaust could happen
again, in America. But his novels won't let readers forget that it
happened once, and the victims living their lives didn't see the
signs, didn't know what to do.

 &HT;    Powerful vision force behind `Issac's Storm'
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This book goes on the shelf alongside
``The Perfect Storm,'' each as powerful as the storms described on
their pages, each an outstanding example of the rather odd modern
publishing phenomenon _ the nonfiction weather disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The true power and terrible beauty of ``The Perfect Storm'' was
contained in its human drama: men against nature, against God even,
the story of hubris and folly and technology, all humbled before
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, with ``Isaac's Storm,'' the story of Isaac Cline, a
weatherman stationed in Galveston, Texas, in September 1900. That
was the month and year the deadliest hurricane in history scrubbed
Galveston and 6,000 of its residents from the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas few of us will ever find ourselves aboard a Gloucester
fishing boat north of Nova Scotia, as in ``The Perfect Storm,''
many of us live in hurricane alley. Even as the monster Floyd
approached in September, even as TV forecasters spoke in terms of
Category 4, we lacked a true sense of the power of these storms.
Few have lived through a big storm. Even Andrew was a tight little
fury, localized.
</P>
<P>
   The TV-news video camera can do its job well both before and
after a storm. But action shots of bending palm trees in the
gathering storm do not convey the fury of sustained winds of 150
mph, with gusts up to 200. Conditions during a storm of such
hideous magnitude are so dangerous there can be no action shots.
Only word-of-mouth recollections and reflections, survivors' tales
in the hands of a masterful writer can convey the terror.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what Erik Larson does in ``Isaac's Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm hit Galveston during the afternoon of Saturday, Sept.
8, 1900. But it might as well have been midnight; Galveston was
caught sleeping. What followed was an event that had been waiting
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The new National Weather Service, of which Isaac Cline was a
charter member, had grown out of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. In
1882, somebody had decided that knowing the weather would be of
military value. Isaac Cline signed on. By 1900, the country was
full of itself, full of faith in science and technology. There was
even blindly optimistic talk of changing the weather, harnessing
nature.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, Galveston had grown to a city of more than
30,000, occupying a barrier island between the Gulf of Mexico and
Galveston Bay. Galveston's highest point was just 9 feet above sea
level. But optimism reigned supreme when it came to tides and
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1899, when a northeast storm blew the water out of
Galveston Bay, no one deduced that southeast winds could blow the
Gulf of Mexico into the bay, over the city. All was right on the
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sept. 8, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the storm had been forwarded to Galveston by Cuban
weather-watchers. But, in tune with the times, U.S. weather
forecasters dismissed the Cuban warnings, not because of any
perceived fault in data but because the warning had come from Cuba,
which was thought a lesser place where lesser minds dwelled. The
shallow pride of manifest destiny had a hand in Galveston's death.
</P>
<P>
   As the waves increased, so, too, did Isaac Cline's concern.
While tourists and children played in the Gulf surf, Cline began
warning anyone who would listen. At first, few did. Barometers were
scarce, understanding of the instruments scarcer still. The water
rose. The wind rose.
</P>
<P>
   Larson has scoured old first-person accounts, telegrams,
testimony before Washington committees. He doesn't have to
embellish recollections with speculations on what people might have
been thinking. The facts speak _ scream _ for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Galveston had built strong houses, capable of
withstanding hurricane winds. But when rising waters floated these
houses from their foundations, they made terrible boats. The
recollections of families who spent the night of Sept. 8 lashed to
their beds and chimneys as their homes crashed down around them are
as terrifying as anything in print.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, chapter by chapter, hour by hour. Death by
death. Ninety orphans died when nuns tethered them together in
lifelines. The lines became tangled, the children drowned.
Eighty-five passengers on a train elected to stay aboard as the
water rose. They thought nothing could blow a locomotive over. They
were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   And Isaac Cline, along with his brother and children and wife,
suffered their own form of divine punishment. Even those who were
spared were not spared. The book's section on the cleanup, the
burning of bodies, the smell of death, should be read while wearing
a surgical mask and gloves. Photos of the destruction exist, but
Eric Larson makes a word worth a thousand pictures.
</P>
<P>
   This is a book every Floridian should own. Keep it wrapped in
plastic, because if a hurricane of Floyd's ferocity ever hits, it
might be all that remains.

 &HT;    Another fast-paced, bluntly told killer thriller
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In his latest assault on the forests of
America, James Patterson attempts to channel Hannibal Lecter. With
Geoffrey Shafer, a minor British diplomat/spy posted in Washington,
D.C., Patterson creates yet another audacious evil genius who gets
away with things that might not be so easily replicated in life as
they are on the page.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Harris is a baroque, rather entertaining stylist,
whereas Patterson is a straight-ahead crafter of basic declarative
sentences. This is not in itself a major problem; that comes with
Patterson's concept for Shafer. In a word, he's too obvious _ not
the suave, controlling psychopath that is Lecter, but an erratic,
sweaty, fullbore loon zoned out of his skull on all manner of
mood-altering drugs courtesy of his shrink, with whom he's having a
thankfully undramatized S&AMP;M relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer is entirely too ragged to successfully navigate home and
career while maintaining a burgeoning career as a serial killer
spawned by a computer game. Also, Shafer's modus operandi is
borderline comic _ he dresses up in blackface and goes out in his
gypsy cab to murder people _ a homicidal Al Jolson.
</P>
<P>
   The accoutrements of Patterson's plot are modern, but actually
it's a variation on the old Richard Connell short story ``The Most
Dangerous Game,'' in which a big-game hunter goes daffy and decides
to hunt the biggest game of all _ man.
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle from Shafer is Patterson's Good Cop, Alex
Cross, who is, not to mince words, a little dull. Without Morgan
Freeman to shade him in, there's nothing particularly interesting
about him. He's just a good, honest, hard-working cop, without any
leaps of deductive brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson keeps the pot boiling not by introducing plot twists
from left field but by doing double reverses with his already
established characters.
</P>
<P>
   His storytelling is blunt, at times reminiscent of the lurid
thrills of Sax Rohmer and Mickey Spillane _ as much typographical
as linguistic: ``An agent at the FBI had investigated the e-mail
address and found that it didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   And he tends to tell us things rather than show them, as in this
brief recapitulation of Cross talking about his murdered wife:
``We'd been married four years and had two small children. The case
has never been solved and that's what still tortures me. Maybe
that's what drives me to solve every case I can, no matter the
odds.''
</P>
<P>
   A less courageous writer, having killed off Cross' wife in a
previous book, might want to lay off putting his fiancee in peril _
really, what are the odds? _ but Patterson boldly plows ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the basic storytelling function, the key to
Patterson's success is pace _ one damn thing or another is always
happening, in a nonstop succession of very short chapters (``Pop
Goes the Weasel'' has 123 of them).
</P>
<P>
   Although Patterson's books are, on the surface, pitch-perfect
beach reads, he has successfully managed to transcend that category
and become a brand-name writer, hence the fall publication date,
suitable for gift-giving ... assuming, of course, that your idea of
a gift involves multiple murders via throat-slitting.

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Hitchcock Poster Art'' (Overlook, $35)
is just about what it says _ a comprehensive selection of posters
and lobby cards from the films of Alfred Hitchcock, beginning with
his earliest silent films such as ``The Pleasure Garden'' and ``The
Lodger,'' all the way through ``Frenzy'' and ``Family Plot.''
</P>
<P>
   The interesting thing about movie posters is they don't
necessarily have much qualitative connection to the film they're
advertising _ a great film can have indifferent posters, and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   In Hitchcock's case, the poster from a quasi-great film like
``Vertigo'' (I know I'm flying in the face of modern critical
opinion, but the central plot gimmick has always struck me as too
ridiculous to take seriously) is all right, but the lobby cards are
downright ugly, red duotone things that nobody in his right mind
would collect if it wasn't Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, a very valuble book for poster collectors, and a
very entertaining one for Hitchcock fans.
</P>
<P>
   And, on another subject entirely, Abbeville has released ``The
Vence Chapel'' ($49.95), a compendium of correspondence and artwork
by Henri Matisse about the project on which he spent four years at
the end of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the Vence Chapel was Matisse's friendship with a
Catholic nun who nursed him after a near-fatal illness in 1942.
Matisse volunteered to design a chapel for her Dominican order as a
means of repaying the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Matisse designed all aspects of the intimate, quite beautiful
structure, from the building itself to the stained glass to the
handles on the doors. ``The Vence Chapel'' contains the complete
archive of the project, with voluminous correspondence, and some
beautiful color art of all stages of the project.
</P>
<P>
   It's a beautiful chapel and a beautiful book.

   Best-selling author Andrew Vachss has started Red 71 Press, a
publishing house for writers who don't fit into more commercial
publishers' plans. (The name stems from a short story written by
Paul Cain, a particularly interesting pulp author of the '30s and
'40s.)
</P>
<P>
   Vachss has a couple of investors and told Publisher's Weekly
that he intends to publish two to three books a year. The first
offering is a novel entitled ``The Beggar's Shore,'' by Zak Mucha.
The house's Web site is at www.Red71.com.

maintain a cartel that keeps the price of milk there artificially
high keeping out milk from other states. This works to the

RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to delete `Jr.' after George W. Bush in 8th graf; no other

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is quietly reassessing
whether to slow two major loan programs to Moscow as the war in
Chechnya accelerates and the two leading candidates for the
Republican presidential nomination call for a cutoff of aid to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In public, White House officials have said that they continue to
favor modest economic support for the Yeltsin government and that
termination of the aid could further destabilize Russia before two
major elections there. Sandy Berger, the national security adviser,
reiterated that position on Monday when he told reporters that
despite the Russian military offensive in Chechnya, it would not
``make sense for us to affect'' a forthcoming loan from the
International Monetary Fund, ``assuming the economic and
transparency criteria are met.''
</P>
<P>
   But within the administration, divisions on the question are
growing; advocates of both views say there is a movement to go slow
on two major loans _ one from the International Monetary Fund and
another from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a debate brewing in our government over
engagement versus disengagement for a year now,'' one senior
administration official said Thursday. ``But in recent weeks it has
gotten much more intense, and there are some strong voices for
disengagement.''
</P>
<P>
   The first issue is whether the United States should allow the
International Monetary Fund to release a long-delayed payment of
$640 million to keep Russia from defaulting on past monetary fund
loans. The money, part of a $4.5 billion program, would actually
never enter Russia; it would simply be transferred from one IMF
account to another.
</P>
<P>
   But its delivery would take economic pressure off Russia's
central bank, which officials in several departments of the
administration fear could send a political message that Moscow will
not have to pay a price for its continued military action in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that they are making the decision
on the merits, and are ignoring the political impact on Vice
President Al Gore, who played a major role in the development of
the administration's economic support program for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's staff appears increasingly worried about his
vulnerability on the issues, especially because Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the Republican front-runner, has said he will call for a
complete cutoff of the aid to Russia in a foreign policy speech he
is expected to deliver on Friday. And Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
Bush's leading challenger for the nomination, has already opposed
the loan while the war in Chechnya continues.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger issue is the Export-Import Bank loan, a half a
billion dollars for the export of U.S.-made oil equipment to
Russia. Unlike the monetary fund loan, this money would come
directly from an agency of the U.S. government. Again, it would not
go directly to Moscow but rather to U.S. companies supplying
Russian oil companies with equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it would constitute the first resumption of direct
U.S. aid to Moscow in more than a year, and officials say the
semi-independent Export-Import Bank has come under pressure from
the administration to put the loan on ``administrative hold,''
perhaps for a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   In both instances the administration is making the case that, at
the moment, the loans should be slowed for economic reasons that
have nothing to do with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   That enables it to avoid the question of whether it should seek
to cut off the money as an act of political protest over the
Chechen military campaign, as it did to Indonesia during the
violence in East Timor earlier this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the case of the monetary fund loan, lengthy negotiations with
Russia have yet to resolve some issues of ``transparency'' _ public
explanations of how Russia is spending money and regulating its
banks. The fund is insisting, for example, that Russia commit to a
public audit of Sberbank, a major bank owned by the government, and
make a series of amendments to its bankruptcy laws, among other
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time Russia has not met the economic criteria,'' said
one senior administration official deeply involved in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But asked whether Russia's behavior in Chechnya would be
considered in coming weeks, the official added, ``These things are
always complex and there is a desire to maintain flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two Export-Import Bank loans pending, both of which
have received preliminary approval from the bank's board of
directors and were referred to Congress for a 30-day review period,
now complete. The board is now free to approve the loans whenever
it feels ready. But that moment still seems weeks or months away,
and could be longer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deals involves $203 million in financing for the sale
of equipment and services by ABB Lummus Global Inc., a Bloomfield,
N.J., company, to update the Ryazan Oil Refinery near Moscow. The
second is $292 million in financing for exports by Halliburton Co.,
of Dallas, to rehabilitate the Samotlar oil field.
</P>
<P>
   The loans were controversial before the Chechen fighting because
the Russian company that will benefit, Tyumen Oil Co., is a player
in a complex takeover effort that involved the bankruptcy of
another oil company. The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, 10 percent controlled by the U.S. government, is a
major creditor of the bankrupt company.
</P>
<P>
   The European Bank has been involved in a long-running dispute
involving Tyumen. The case has already been in the Russian courts,
and it has involved charges that the bankruptcy was manipulated by
Russian oligarchs. Because of the on-going dispute, some
administration officials have argued against aiding Tyumen.  &QL;

 _ SF CHRON  
 Pac Bell to Raise Home Rate on Information Calls  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Pacific Bell can almost double the cost of calling 411 from a
residential phone, state regulators voted yesterday.
<P>
   Despite receiving 42,000 messages from citizens mostly opposed
to the rate increase, the state Public Utilities Commission allowed
Pac Bell to raise the charge for local directory assistance from 25
cents to 46 cents per call. The board voted down a compromise plan
to allow a charge of 35 cents per call.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell also will slice the number of free 411 calls for
residential customers from five to three per month and eliminate
the two free 411 calls per month given to business customers.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost of checking to see whether a line is busy will jump
from 50 cents to $1.20, while the charge for interrupting a call in
an emergency will rise from $1 to $1.25.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell plans to put the new rates into effect in two to four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said they would appeal the PUC decision,
which they said would put an extra $100 million in annual revenues
into Pac Bell's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sellout to Pac Bell,'' said Thomas J. Long, an attorney
for The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco ratepayer advocacy
group. ``They're putting $100 million on the backs of captive
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   And Commissioner Joel Hyatt, who voted against the proposal,
called the increase ``outrageous,'' saying directory assistance is
a vital service for millions of Californians, especially with the
proliferation of new area codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're about to do is absolutely, intolerably
unacceptable,'' said Hyatt when it became clear the commission
would vote 3-to-2 in favor of the 411 increase, the first in 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Directory assistance is part of basic local telephone
service,'' he said. ``I believe millions of Californians rely on
directory assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote capped a heated debate that began in May 1998 when Pac
Bell asked to raise the directory assistance rate to 50 cents
immediately and by as much as $1.10 per call as needed. The company
also asked permission to charge $2 for each busy-line verification
call and $4 for each emergency interruption.
</P>
<P>
   The phone company said it was just trying to recoup the money it
loses providing those services. Including labor and equipment
costs, directory assistance costs Pac Bell an average of 48 cents
per call, said spokesman John Britton.
</P>
<P>
   TURN disputed Pac Bell's estimate, saying its analysis showed
that the company was spending just 25 cents for each 411 call.
</P>
<P>
   And Commissioner Henry Duque said a PUC analysis found that Pac
Bell was spending 39 cents per call.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Hot Topic
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been a hot-button topic for California consumers.
Duque noted the PUC has received 42,000 calls and letters ``and few
of them said, `Please raise our rates and prices.'''
</P>
<P>
   In August, a state administrative law judge recommended capping
411 rates at 50 cents per call, which consumer advocates complained
was still too high.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC approved a compromise offered by Duque to allow a
21-cent per call increase, which would still make directory
assistance in California the third lowest of any state in the
country. &UR;  &LR; Long-distance companies such as MCI and Sprint charge
about $1 for each local directory assistance call.
</P>
<P>
   Duque defended the application to raise rates as necessary to
maintain the quality of directory assistance service and to help
ensure that he 1,800 jobs of operators, who handle 411 calls in
California, are not shipped to other states or handed over to
machines.
</P>
<P>
   According to Duque, about 80 percent of customers make three or
fewer 411 calls per month, so they would not be affected by the
rate change.
</P>
<P>
   ``No price lower than 46 cents is reasonable,'' Duque said.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Carl Wood offered an alternative that would have
capped the charge at 35 cents per 411 call and kept the number of
free calls at five per month for residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wood argued that the PUC was acting under the assumption that
411 callers were mostly ``lazy yuppies who don't want to go to the
phone book to look up a number.''
</P>
<P>
   The PUC had no firm demographic information available, but Wood
said there was enough anecdotal evidence that 411 callers are
mostly people with limited English reading skills or those who have
are visually impaired.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``with the proliferation of new area codes, more
and more customers are going to find it necessary to access this
service.''
</P>
<P>
   The final vote pitted the three commission members _ Duque,
Josiah Neeper and Richard Bilas _ appointed by former Gov. Pete
Wilson against the two new members appointed by Gov. Gray Davis _
Hyatt and Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Hyatt also joined a 4-to-1 vote against Wood's compromise,
saying that alternative did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   The final outcome did please seven directory assistance
operators in the audience representing their union, the
Communication Workers of America, even though there were still no
job guarantees in the PUC decision or their own collective
bargaining agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to allow us to do better in our jobs as well as
keep us in California,'' said Jeff Downey, a 14-year veteran 411
operator.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC vote does not affect directory assistance calls from pay
phones. Those rates are regulated by the Federal Communications
Commission.

   IRAQ: `OIL FOR FOOD' PROGRAM
</P>
<P>
   Unable to agree on a resolution continuing the Iraqi ``oil for
food'' program in its present form for another six months, the
United Nations Security Council is likely to roll over the existing
resolution for two weeks, diplomats said. Council members say the
program may be dealt with at the same time that the full council
debate begins on setting up a new arms inspection system in coming
weeks.

   IRAQ: U.S. ATTACKS
</P>
<P>
   An American Navy FA-18 from the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy
attacked a radar site in southern Iraq. Officials said the strike,
near Basra, was a response to Iraq's violation of the ``no flight''
zone the day before, when three fighter jets darted into the zone
and quickly left.

maintain a cartel that keeps the price of milk there artificially
high keeping out milk from other states. This works to the

 Spin-Off Gives HP, Dow a Jolt  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hewlett-Packard shareholders enjoyed a $13.6 billion bonanza
yesterday, thanks to an unexpectedly favorable earnings report and
the rousingly successful initial public offering of the company's
Agilent subsidiary.
<P>
   The Palo Alto computer-maker, with more than 1 billion shares
outstanding, soared $13.31 to $94.31 in New York Stock Exchange
trading _ its highest close in more than seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   HP's performance sparked a strong surge in the overall market,
with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index climbing 14.23 to a record
1,424.94 and the Nasdaq composite index also hitting a new record _
up 77.72 at 3,347.11
</P>
<P>
   A component of the Dow Jones industrial average, HP
single-handedly accounted for 84 points of yesterday's 152.61-point
gain in that widely followed blue-chip indicator, which closed at
11,035.70. The Dow now stands less than 300 points below its
all-time  &LR; high of 11,326.04, set on August 25.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $8 billion of the $13.6 billion leap in HP's market value
was attributable to the spin-off of 72 million shares _ or 16
percent _ of Agilent, an operationally independent subsidiary, also
based in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   The shares were sold to the public yesterday at $30 and soared
to $42.75 by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   HP, which still owns 380 million shares, gained $4.8 billion
from that increase, plus $3 billion from a 36 percent eleventh-hour
boost in the IPO price, which originally had been pegged at $22.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a second spin-off of the remaining 380 million
shares in about six months, with HP shareholders getting all of
them in proportion to their HP holdings. At that point, Agilent
will be entirely independent of HP.
</P>
<P>
   If the present share ratios persist, HP shareholders will
receive 37 Agilent shares _ current value, $1,581.75 _ for every
100 HP shares (current value, $9,431.25) they own.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent is made up of HP's old-line instrument business _
testing and measuring devices used in the semiconductor, health
care and telecommunications industries, among others. HP spun it
off in hopes of focusing investor attention on its supposedly
sexier businesses: computers, printers and the like.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, at least, the Agilent tail wagged the HP dog.
Experts say the company will benefit from the strong
telecommunications market, a recovery in the chip market, and
improvements in the economy of Asia, where it does substantial
business.
</P>
<P>
   John B. Jones, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in San
Francisco, said it is fairly common for companies to spin off only
a small minority interest in a subsidiary at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You create an independent entity, give them the opportunity to
leverage an independent business focus, then the shareholders of
the originating company get the benefit,'' Jones observed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, after the stock market closed, HP announced
earnings per share of 75 cents, excluding special charges, for the
fiscal fourth quarter ended last month. It beat analyst estimates
by 2 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   That helped give the stock its big jolt yesterday, as did
comments by Carleton S. Fiorina, HP's president and chief
executive, who said the company's goal in the current fiscal year
is to raise revenues and earnings by 12 to 15 percent.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Banks Ready to Roll Into the New Year  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Banks have readied their computers for the year 2000 and should
cruise into the new year with few problems, a top federal regulator
said in San Francisco yesterday.
<P>
   At a briefing for The Chronicle, Donna Tanoue, chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., noted that regulators had examined
all 10,300 of the nation's banks and thrifts at least twice and
found only five that had not adequately prepared their computers
for the date change.
</P>
<P>
   Those cases mainly involve documentation issues rather than
hardware or software problems, she added. None of the five
institutions operate in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're increasingly confident that it's going to be business as
usual'' after January 1, Tanoue said.
</P>
<P>
   The five institutions whose Y2K preparations regulators rate as
less than satisfactory are a sharp improvement from 16 months ago,
when 774 banks and thrifts had such ratings, Tanoue said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, along with airlines and electrical utilities, have been
widely viewed as among the institutions most vulnerable to the year
2000 problem, which arises because many old computer programs use
two digits to indicate years.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs cannot distinguish between the years 2000 and
1900. Unless they are updated, date-sensitive financial records
could be thrown into chaos next year. Alarmists predict that ATMs
will stop working, account information will be lost and payment
posting will be garbled.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have given top priority to ensuring that financial
institutions update their computers. Under the supervision of state
and federal agencies, banks and thrifts have spent billions of
dollars rewriting software and testing systems.
</P>
<P>
   While those efforts have reassured regulators, large segments of
the public have been wary.
</P>
<P>
   Officials still predict a surge in demand for currency as
consumers and businesses hoard cash to protect themselves against
breakdowns in the banking system. The Federal Reserve has stocked
$200 billion in currency in its vaults _ about $50 billion more
than usual _ to meet demand for cash, said Robert Parry, chief
executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, who
accompanied Tanoue.
</P>
<P>
   The FDIC released results of a Gallup survey conducted in
October and November that showed some waning of public worry.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of 10 ten  &LR; people responding said they were either very
confident or somewhat confident that their financial institutions
were prepared for 2000. That compared with 76 percent of
respondents in a March survey who said they were confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not as concerned as they used to be,'' Tanoue said.
</P>
<P>
   While the FDIC chief predicts business as usual for bank
customers come January 1, it won't be that way for bank regulators.
The FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies plan to keep their
offices open throughout the New Year weekend, as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be here in case people have concerns,'' Tanoue
said.

RUSSIA OFFERS TO BARGAIN ON CHECHNYA, USING IRAQ AS ITS BAIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With EUROPE-TALKS) 
(js) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia has suggested for the first time that it might support a
weapons inspection system for Iraq that would be acceptable to
Western nations if Washington gave Moscow a free hand in Chechnya,
administration officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed link was contained in an informal document that
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov gave Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright during a meeting Wednesday of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, in Istanbul. Administration
officials seemed eager Thursday to reject even the possibility of
such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   After restating Russian demands for changes in U.S. policy
toward Iraq, the two-page paper asked the Clinton administration to
agree not to raise Russia's military actions against Chechnya in
the U.N. Security Council, which the paper stated ``is unacceptable
to us.'' Russia could then offer progress on Iraq, the paper
suggested, saying, ``We are ready to instruct the Russian
representative to the Security Council to be flexible on Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has said it would not accept the proposals now being
considered in the Security Council for keeping it from acquiring
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the diplomatic paper caught them off guard,
the more so because Thursday in Istanbul, neither Ivanov, in his
meeting with Albright, nor President Boris Yeltsin, who met with
President Clinton, brought up such a trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said: ``If Russia
did seek such linkage, we would find it wholly unacceptable. We
will pursue our interests in both areas without regard to any
attempt by Russia to link them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Russian paper, parts of which were read to The
New York Times by an administration official, led to a debate
within the administration over how it should be interpreted,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One question was whether Russia was really prepared to move away
from Iraq to gain U.S. acquiescence for its operations in Chechnya,
or whether the suggestion was made in the knowledge that Washington
would reject it.
</P>
<P>
   Another question was why Russia would be anxious about Chechnya
coming up before the Security Council. According to several U.N.
diplomats, neither the Security Council members nor even many
Islamic states seem inclined to criticize Russia formally at the
United Nations, much less sanction it, for a campaign in a republic
that is still part of the the Russian federation.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.N. members, facing secessionists and rebels in their own
lands, remain reluctant to take up an issue that many regard as
undue interference in a country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Security Council, Russia and the United States have
been deeply divided for months over how to monitor Iraqi weapons
programs and when, or if, to begin removing sanctions against
Baghdad. There have been no U.N. inspections in Iraq since
December, when inspectors were withdrawn in advance of punitive
airstrikes by Britain and the United States, and President Saddam
Hussein barred them from returning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of the new Russian paper restated old Russian positions on
how the United Nations should handle Iraq. Officials said the paper
reiterated Russia's demand that the United Nations, in effect,
should be more lenient in insisting on Iraqi compliance with the
disarmament pledges it made after the Gulf War in exchange for the
lifting of sanctions. The paper also cited Russia's well-known
position that the suffering of the Iraqi people should be
alleviated by permitting Baghdad to sell as much oil as it likes.
It also called on the United States to end its frequent airstrikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the paper called on Washington to release the holds it
has placed on Russian sales to Iraq in the U.N. sanctions
committee, where the United States has frequently challenged items
that Iraq wanted to buy abroad. A U.N. official said Thursday that
holds had been placed on 389 contracts worth a total of $1.042
billion, but he said he did not know how many of those sales were
Russian.

MARTINEZ DIPLOMATIC IN HIS MVP SHUTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite having more first-place votes than the winner,
Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez was more diplomatic Thursday about
losing the American League's Most Valuable Player Award to Texas
Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez than the sports minister of his
native Dominican Republic, Juan Marichal.
</P>
<P>
   Marichal, the Hall of Fame pitcher who briefly played for the
Red Sox at the end of his career, called it an ``injustice.'' He
was not alone in that sentiment, as Red Sox fans throughout New
England reacted negatively to the news that Martinez, who earlier
in the week won the American League's Cy Young Award as the
league's outstanding pitcher, fell 13 points shy of adding the MVP
award to his trophy case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the MVP to the fans of Boston,'' said Red Sox general
manager Dan Duquette, offering his condolences in a media
conference call to the Sox ace who fell short in his bid to become
the first starting pitcher to be named MVP since Roger Clemens won
the award for Boston in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez, left completely off two ballots cast by the 28
voting members of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America when two
fourth-place votes could have made him the winner, did not begrudge
Rodriguez, the first catcher to win the award since the Yankees'
Thurman Munson in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the pile was good enough to be MVP,'' said
Martinez, alluding to a crowded field that included at least eight
legitimate candidates, including teammate Nomar Garciaparra, who
finished seventh in the balloting after a second-place finish in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hold it against anybody,'' Martinez said. ``If they
don't want to vote for me, there's nothing I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   George King of the New York Post and La Velle Neal of the
Minneapolis Star-Tribune did not list Martinez among the 10 players
for whom they were allowed to vote. Fourteen points were awarded
for a first-place vote, 9 for a second, 8 for a third, etc.
</P>
<P>
   King, who covers the New York Yankees for the Post, was on
vacation and unavailable for comment. Neal, who covers the
Minnesota Twins for the Star-Tribune, was inundated with calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I'm not a pitcher-for-MVP guy,'' Neal said, echoing
a view expressed by numerous baseball people _ including Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams earlier this season _ that pitchers who
perform just once every five days do not deserve the same
consideration as everyday players. ``I believe whoever wins that
award should be on the field every day, helping his team win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he had a tremendous season. I know he may be an
exception. But there were other good players on that team. You may
have the best shortstop out there in Garciaparra. Jimy Williams did
a marvelous job running that team. It wasn't just Pedro alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for field players. That's just my belief and I'm
sticking with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez became the seventh AL catcher to win the award, the
first since the Yankees' Thurman Munson in 1976. He hit 35 home
runs, a record for American League catchers, and his batting
average of .332 was the highest by an AL catcher since the Yankees'
Bill Dickey hit .362 in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez last week also won his eighth Gold Glove for defensive
excellence, a total eclipsed among catchers only by Hall of Famer
Johnny Bench, who has 10. He threw out 39 of 72 base-runners
attempting to steal, a 54 percent success rate that was the highest
of any catcher this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But curiously, the two beat reporters assigned to the Rangers
who cast votes for MVP rated Rodriguez's teammate, designated
hitter Rafael Palmeiro, higher than they did Rodriguez. Evan Grant
of the Dallas Morning News voted Palmeiro first, followed by
Martinez. He had Rodriguez ranked sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Paul of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram also voted Palmeiro
first, with Martinez fourth and Rodriguez fifth.

FRIENDS REMEMBER A BRILLIANT STUDENT AND FAITHFUL FRIEND
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KELLER, Texas _ The news of his death blared across Keller High
School's loudspeakers, followed by a moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Then came tears for a brilliant teen-ager who had earned
numerous awards _ including the honored title of friend.
</P>
<P>
   Chad A. Powell, 19 _ Eagle Scout, track team member, tutor,
guitar player, National Merit Scholar and 1999 Keller High School
valedictorian _ was among the students who died when a log stack
collapsed Thursday at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been going in between absolute rage and bawling,'' said
former classmate and neighbor Ruth Huston, now an 18-year-old
freshman at Columbia College in South Carolina. ``Whenever anyone
felt bad, he'd start singing a weird song or quoting the Simpsons
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, every student, neighbor and teacher mourning his loss
spoke of Powell's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was president of Keller High School's National Honor
Society and a stand-out member of its state academic decathlon
team, winning four gold and four silver individual awards in
regional and state competitions. He was one of 11 Texas students on
the Fina all-state academic athletic team.
</P>
<P>
   He was voted Keller High School's ``most likely to succeed,''
and classmates expected his success to be stunning. Powell hoped to
own start his own company specializing in the design of operating
systems for computers. Those who knew him believed he was most
likely to put Microsoft mogul Bill Gates out of a job, as Powell
sometimes jested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except with him, you got the feeling that he could do it,''
Keller track coach David Park said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seemed out of his reach, because of his ability and
determination, others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked hard and gave everything he had. If he did it, he
was putting everything into it,'' track coach David Coker said.
``He wasn't a naturally gifted athlete, but he made himself an
athlete through determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell was more valued, though, as a friend who was always
upbeat and willing to help others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a brother to everybody,'' said Juan Tatum, Keller High
School junior.
</P>
<P>
   Keller High Principal Randy Baker agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly a loss not only for Keller High School, but the
entire district and community,'' he said. ``He was a true leader.
He was a friend, both to the students here, the faculty and
administration. He was a great kid to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell taught everywhere he went, and not only by example. In
study hall, any student could call on him for assistance,
regardless of their age or the subject, teachers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very sweet, intelligent, wise beyond his years. He had
a very quick wit,'' district spokeswoman Julie Zwahr said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's helpfulness reached even into Keller school district's
central office. He started helping program computers in the Keller
central administration in seventh grade. Over the years, he also
helped set up the district's cable TV programming and its Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything Chad did, it was done not only with excellence but
with integrity and character. He was just a real outstanding kid,''
said J.D. Tomlin, student minister at First Baptist Church of
Keller, where Powell was a member.
</P>
<P>
   During his junior high and early high school years, Powell was
involved with the church's youth ministry programs and participated
in community outreach events, Tomlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad was a superfriendly guy,'' Tomlin said. ``He was
brilliant, but very humble about it. He loved education and
learning, but he also loved people. He was very relational and had
many friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Students filed out of Keller High on Thursday were subdued with
emotion and tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most unselfish people I've ever met,'' said
Daniel Pessing, a Keller High School senior and fellow track team
member. ``He's worked so hard his whole life, and he had so much
ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The school canceled extra-curricular activities Thursday night.
Friay, the district's emergency team will take over some school
duties, allowing teachers, staff and counselors to spend time with
Powell's family or grieving students.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's mother works as an assistant in the school district's
personnel office. His older brother, Jeremy, graduated from Keller
High and now attends Texas Tech. His younger brother, Josh, is a
senior at Keller High.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some teachers that are just distraught,'' Cocker said.
``There are some freshman on the track team that knew him for just
one season who are distraught. Tomorrow will be a long day.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker read a statement from Powell's parents Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died giving of himself just as he lived _ giving of
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A video of his valedictory address was a poignant reminder
Thursday. Draped in his blue graduation gown and sporting academic
medals, Powell spoke of saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say goodbye,'' he said. ``Goodbye teachers, who
helped to get us here today. Goodbye friends, who must go their
separate way. And goodby to the life we have known. To move on is
the price we must pay.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial fund will be established in his name, school
officials said. &QL;

IN THE E-MAIL AGE, A PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE IS STILL A MUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SPEND-CONGRESS.) 
(th) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In this age of computer simulation and instant
global communication, some things must be done the old-fashioned
way. Getting the president's signature on a piece of paper is one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   So when Congress passes continuing resolutions to keep the
government running until a budget is approved, someone has to take
that resolution in hand and give it to President Clinton for his
signature. With the president in Turkey, some people have had to do
a lot of flying this week.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress passed a continuing resolution on Wednesday to
keep several major departments going, a member of the White House
legislative affairs office boarded a plane that departed from
Washington around 9 that night. The trip to Turkey would normally
take about 10 hours, according to Jake Siewert, the deputy White
House press secretary, but difficulties with connecting flights
made this one a bit longer.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. The resolution was signed by Clinton shortly before
5 p.m. Washington time, with a good seven hours to spare before the
resolution expired.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, John Podesta, the White House chief of staff,
was to fly to meet Clinton and get his signature on a continuing
resolution passed Thursday that is good until early December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crisis averted,'' Siewert said, pointing out that all kinds of
diplomatic documents and other important papers are flown thousands
of miles, even in the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know why the president's actual signature is
required on a continuing resolution, except that the law providing
for such things has been on the books longer than computers have
been on desktops.
</P>
<P>
   And is there ever a worry that a pouch with a vital piece of
paper might be lost on the way, leading to a government shutdown?
``We give them to responsible adults,'' Siewert said.

PITCHERS VS. EVERYDAY PLAYERS? NO COMPARISON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now if they would only listen to me . . .
</P>
<P>
   . . . we wouldn't have this problem.
</P>
<P>
   Was Pedro Martinez the best performer in all of baseball this
year? Double duh. Was he the Most Valuable Player? I say no.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is very simple. Pitchers shouldn't even be
eligible for the Most Valuable Player award, not as it's presently
constituted. Ever hear of rendering to Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, and God the things that are God's? That's very sound
Biblical advice that applies very nicely to this baseball issue. An
everyday player cannot be properly and accurately and precisely
compared to a pitcher. So why bother trying?
</P>
<P>
   The Cy Young Award was created in 1956 to reward the man
designated as baseball's best pitcher. Why? There are only two
possible reasons. One is that people felt pitchers were not being
properly rewarded by the MVP process. The second is that people
felt it was an impossibility to weigh the contributions of an
everyday player vs. a pitcher. Can you think of any other reason?
</P>
<P>
   At that juncture, each league had produced four starting
pitching MVPs (reliever Jim Konstanty won the National League award
in 1950) in the official Baseball Writers Association of America
balloting, which began in 1931 with the selections of Frankie
Frisch in the National League and Lefty Grove _ yes, a pitcher _ in
the American. That very first Cy Young year, Don Newcombe (27-7,
3.06, five shutouts) also won the MVP. Sandy Koufax ('63) and Bob
Gibson ('68) in the National League, as well as Denny McLain ('68),
Vida Blue ('71), and Roger Clemens ('86) in the American, were all
starters, like Newcombe, who also won the MVP.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, but if voters wanted to be consistent, how do they
explain missing the most obvious pitching MVP of all-time? They
gave Steve Carlton the Cy Young Award in 1972 for winning 27 games
with a 1.97 ERA, 310 strikeouts, and eight shutouts. If you think
pitchers should be eligible for MVP, Player of the Year, or
anything you'd like to call the top performer, how did he not get
the MVP for winning 27 times on a team that only won 59 games?
That's not Most Valuable. That's MOST VALUABLE!!!!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the winner was Johnny Bench, who had 40-125 power totals
while being the best defensive catcher in baseball. Oops, almost
forgot. The Reds won the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Bench was a very worthy choice, and that, plus the Phillies'
last-place standing _ was Carlton supposed to pitch all 162 games?
_ made the difference. I guess. We'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that nobody on this earth can make a
compelling, definitive case for a pitcher, be he a starter or a
closer, as opposed to a man who is in the lineup every day. If
someone would like to re-word the award to ``Outstanding
Performer,'' as opposed to the newbulous ``Most Valuable,'' there
would be no problem. If we could do it retroactively, Carlton would
get his 1972 award and Pedro would have his prize today. Nobody in
baseball was more dazzling than Pedro _ when he performed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common sense issue. You are trying to compare a man who
is out there every fifth day with someone who is out there every
day. It's a ridiculous premise.
</P>
<P>
   The great example was 1978, when voters were asked to decide
between Jim Rice and Ron Guidry. This was like being a farmer
having the greatest crop of apples he's ever produced (46 homers,
139 RBIs, 406 total bases, etc.), as well as the greatest crop of
oranges he's ever produced (25-3, 1.74 ERA, nine shutouts). Both
crops were flawless. How to decide?
</P>
<P>
   This is far different than trying to make decisions involving a
position player vs. a position player and a pitcher vs. a pitcher.
This is nothing less than an existential question. Better the ghost
of Jean Paul Sartre decide than a member of the BBWAA.
</P>
<P>
   But pitchers are eligible till further notice, so what to do?.
Well, I say the first look must always be at worthy position
players. If none stand out, then look at pitchers. I'm sorry, but
pitchers should only win the award in a position player vacuum.
When Bobby Shantz won the AL MVP in 1952 by going 24-7 for a
fourth-place Philadelphia A's team, he benefitted from the fact
that no position player had a killer year. That's just one example.
When Denny McLain (31-6) and Bob Gibson (1.12, 13 shutouts) each
won in 1968, it was the nadir of 20th-century offense. As Reggie
Smith once said, Carl Yastrzemski ``saved the American League from
the embarrassment of not having a .300 hitter (Yaz hit .301).'' In
such a clear vacuum it may have been acceptable to select a
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   No such vacuum exists today. To the contrary, this may have been
the deepest crop of worthy MVP candidates ever. Finishing sixth
this year was an honor. With so many legitimate position player
candidates, there really was no need to tap a pitcher, even one who
had as spectacular a season as Pedro's.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to George King of the New York Post and LaVelle
Neal of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, the two gentlemen who left
Pedro off their MVP ballots entirely. They could only have done
this because they, like me, are philosophically opposed to a
pitcher winning the award (I give each the benefit of the doubt on
the sheer stupidity charge). But they are not operating in a
vacuum. They know very well that pitchers are eligible, and that
Pedro had a monumental year. Under the current rules of the game,
nothing justifies their actions. They may not like the rules, but
rules are rules. If they felt strongly about it, they should not
have voted at all. They knew what was at stake; they had to put
Pedro in there somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Again, no one should be forced to make this decision.
Unfortunately, people do. In the complete absence of any
competition, I would vote for a pitcher having a year like Pedro's.
But this year? Absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   I would have voted this way: 1. Pudge Rodriguez, 2. Manny
Ramirez, 3. Derek Jeter, 4. Roberto Alomar, 5. Pedro, 6. Rafael
Palmeiro, 7. Nomar Garciaparra, 8. Bernie Williams, 9. Shawn Green,
10. Junior Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   If Messrs. King and Neal had voted my way, Pedro still would
have finished second. That's fine with me. He should be very
satisfied with his Cy Young. The right man won the MVP.
</P>

UNCIVIL ACTION: A TOWN LEFT TO DIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ First, it killed some miners.
</P>
<P>
   Then it killed wives and children, slipping into their homes on
the dusty clothing of hard-working men.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mine is closed, but in Libby, the killing goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The W.R. Grace Co. knew, from the time it bought the Zonolite
vermiculite mine in 1963, why the people in Libby were dying. But
for the 30 years it owned the mine, the company did not stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the governments.
</P>
<P>
   Not the town of Libby, not Lincoln County. Not the state of
Montana, not federal mining, health and environmental agencies, not
anyone else charged with protecting the public health.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what is killing people in Libby:
</P>
<P>
   Along with the enormous deposits of vermiculite in the earth of
nearby Zonolite Mountain are millions of tons of tremolite, a rare
and exceedingly toxic form of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   For eons, the tremolite lay undisturbed and harmless beneath a
thin crust of topsoil. But mining the vermiculite has released the
deadly asbestos fibers into the air.
</P>
<P>
   A Post-Intelligencer investigation has shown that at least 192
people have died from the asbestos in the mine's vermiculite ore,
and doctors say the toll could be much higher. The doctors and
Libby's long-suffering families say that at least another 375
people have been diagnosed with fatal diseases caused by this
silent and invisible killer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Whitehouse, a lung specialist from Spokane and an
expert in industrial diseases, said another 12 to 15 people from
Libby are being diagnosed with the diseases _ asbestosis,
mesothelioma, lung cancer _ every month.
</P>
<P>
   It takes anywhere from 10 to 40 years from the time a person is
exposed to dangerous amounts of asbestos for the diseases to reveal
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So in Libby, the killing goes on.
</P>
<P>
   GRACE DEFENDS ITS ACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   The W.R. Grace Co. says it did no harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we feel we met our obligation to our workers and to
the community,'' said Jay Hughes, Grace's senior litigation
counsel. Hughes said Grace spent ``millions'' to upgrade safety
conditions and reduce dust at the mine.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1984, 187 civil actions have been filed against Grace
on behalf of Libby's miners and their families. There are 120 cases
pending. In the others, Grace has either been found liable and been
ordered to pay damages in a jury trial, or it settled out of court,
often shortly before the trial was to begin. Scores of new suits
are expected as more former workers, their families and other Libby
residents are diagnosed with cancer and other asbestos-spawned
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The district court in Libby is permitting only one civil action
against Grace every three months.
</P>
<P>
   The diseases do their work slowly, but not that slowly. Long
before they get their day in court, many more victims will die.
</P>
<P>
   A FAMILY'S NIGHTMARE
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Lincoln County are families torn apart by asbestos,
but none has paid a higher price than the Bundrocks. Six of the
family's seven members have been diagnosed with asbestos-related
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Bundrock worked at the mine for 19 years. He died last
summer on the front lawn of his house, having left his oxygen
bottle inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hated being tied to that green bottle. It let him live, but
took his freedom. He'd always sneak off without it,'' said his
widow, Helen.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Bundrock suffered for 21 years. His pain was not just
from the disease, but from the knowledge that the white, talc-like
dust he carried home from the mine every day had attacked the lungs
of all of his family but one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got it,'' said Helen, ``and so do Donna, Robin, Mary and
Bill. Only my youngest, Cindy, hasn't been diagnosed with it, and
we're all praying for her.''
</P>
<P>
   As one after another of his family became sick, Art's pain grew
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like tearing his heart out piece by piece,'' Helen
said. ``He never quit crying for two weeks when I found out that I
had it. And with the children, he just couldn't be consoled.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that managers at the mine told miners the dust was
harmless _ a claim echoed by other miners and denied by W.R. Grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lied, but they did worse than that,'' she said, talking
about when her son, now 46, went to work for Grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill had to get a chest X-ray before they hired him. That
X-ray showed he had asbestosis and they never told him. They just
let him go to work up there with all that poison. They never told
him for the 10 years he worked there.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Bundrock said she's fighting it as her husband did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's in store for me and my children, but I keep at
it. I force myself to walk the two blocks to the post office. I
can't give in.''
</P>
<P>
   But she's worried about the future of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I live is not far where they processed that stuff and
the sparkles (from the vermiculite) are all over the place,'' she
said. ``Lots of kids play around here. I hope they won't be the
next generation to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   HUGE AMOUNTS OF ASBESTOS
</P>
<P>
   West of Libby, the Cabinet Mountains rise more than 8,000 feet,
providing a beautiful and dramatic backdrop to the town of 2,700.
</P>
<P>
   Three miles east, as the winds blow, is a smaller mountain,
Zonolite Mountain, the life-and-death mountain. Life, because more
than 1,900 men and women earned their living at the mine. Death,
because of the way the mine was operated. Death, because of the
tremolite. The mine and mill processed an astonishing amount of
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   According to W.R. Grace records and court documents, nearly
300,000 pounds of asbestos a day went through the ``dry mill,'' the
primary ore-processing facility and the dustiest building on the
property. By 1975, Grace had built a new mill and production had
doubled, which means more than half a million pounds of asbestos a
day were processed.
</P>
<P>
   Tests in 1969 showed that 24,000 pounds of dust a day were
expelled from the large stack on the dry mill. The dust was about
20 percent asbestos, and had tested as high as 40 per cent. So even
at 1969 production levels, at least 5,000 pounds of asbestos a day
were spewed from the dry mill stack. And there were several other
stacks in operation as well.
</P>
<P>
   Dust from the stacks blanketed the nearby mine buildings, where
most of the workers were, and much of the mountainside. It did not
have to snow for Zonolite Mountain to be white.
</P>
<P>
   Some days, when the east wind blew, sheets on the clotheslines
of Libby would be covered in the dust, and children would write
their names in the dust on their parents' cars.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehouse, the Spokane doctor, specializes in lung cancers,
pneumonia and industrial diseases that affect the lungs. His
background is extensive and varied, and includes working for NASA,
where he ran a pulmonary laboratory for the Apollo moon-landing
project.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every doctor in and around Libby has sent patients the
180 miles to Whitehouse. He has evaluated and/or treated more than
200 of them for various diseases caused by exposure to tremolite.
More Libby patients suffering from asbestos-related disease are
being treated by other doctors in Spokane, as well as in Kalispell,
Boise, Portland, Salt Lake City and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   None of the ways of dying from asbestos is easy, or pretty.
</P>
<P>
   The main illnesses caused by airborne asbestos are mesothelioma,
or cancer of the pleural lining of the lung; cancer of the lung
itself; and asbestosis, a thickening and scarring of the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The microscopic asbestos fibers are so small they hang suspended
in the air for extended periods. When inhaled, they can penetrate,
then irritate the lung. The lung cannot remove an asbestos fiber
that has speared into its tissue. It cannot be coughed out or
washed out of the tissue by blood. So the area around the fiber
becomes inflamed, and eventually the site becomes scarred.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of years it becomes impossible to take a deep
breath. The tissue changes from the elasticity and thickness of a
balloon to that of a thick orange peel. When breathing is
restricted, oxygen cannot get into the lungs and carbon dioxide and
other impurities cannot get out.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of death by asbestosis is no secret in this town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all had family and friends die and we watched and held
them,'' Gayla Benefield said. ``The heart is the last organ to go,
so they're alive until the end, until the fluids fill their lungs
and they suffocate.''
</P>
<P>
   SHARPLY POINTED FIBERS
</P>
<P>
   Whitehouse has seen many examples of asbestos disease, but he
says the Libby cases are different.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the fibers of other types of asbestos, tremolite's fibers
are needle-like and sharply pointed and therefore penetrate the
lining of the lungs more easily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the various types of asbestos, tremolite is considered by
many researchers to be the most carcinogenic.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, when the miners and their families complained
to their doctors of respiratory problems, even when they coughed up
blood, they were often told they had bronchitis, or asthma or the
flu. Many say Whitehouse was the first to tell them the real nature
of their diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the latency period _ the time from the inhalation of
fibers to the onset of disease _ Whitehouse said that people
exposed to asbestos before the mine closed in 1990 will be dying
for decades to come. Also, he said, studies have shown that fibers
can remain in a house for 15 years after being brought in on dusty
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be seeing this until the year 2030,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   `THERE ARE MY FOLKS'
</P>
<P>
   The frost-covered brown grass crunches under Gayla's feet as she
walks slowly through wisps of fog at the Libby Cemetery. She goes
to the graveyard every Wednesday, because it holds so many of her
friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are my folks,'' she said, pointing to the markers
engraved with the names Perley Vatland and Margaret Vatland. ``Dad
was 62 and mom was 76. The mine killed them both.''
</P>
<P>
   She looks up from the graves and stares into the middle
distance, remembering. ``Dad came home covered in white dust and it
was all over the place. Mom was a fanatic about keeping the house
clean. She bought the newest Kirby vacuum but it would just suck in
the fibers but blow them right into the air. The filters couldn't
stop them. Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   She points to the next row of markers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butch and John worked up there and they both died of lung
cancer. Gladys was a secretary at the mine. The dust got her,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind her was another row of granite slabs, commemorating more
workers at Zonolite Mountain. More lay in the next row, and the
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the old men in this town,'' she said. ``The loggers
may be banged up and bent over but they're still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayla Benefield sued W.R. Grace for the death of her mother, and
won a damage award. She could not sue on her father's behalf
because his illness had been covered by workers' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me that we couldn't make the company accountable
for killing my father. They knew there was asbestos in that dust.
Grace's files are filled with hundreds of studies and reports of
the dangers and as many letters to and from Grace's headquarters
about what they should do about it. But they did nothing but cover
it up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grace acknowledged at trial that Gayla's mother had died because
of exposure to asbestos from the mine. The company lawyer said the
company was ``very sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending itself in cases involving Margaret Vatland's death
and the deaths of other miners' wives and children, Grace's lawyers
told juries that until 1973, neither state nor federal inspectors
had ever told them there was a danger to their employees' families.
In 1973, the lawyers recalled, a U.S. Bureau of Mines inspector
told the company, ``You should put some changing rooms in so that
people going home don't expose their families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched that dust kill my mother,'' Gayla said. She was ``a
strong, independent woman who always took care of herself, tied to
a green oxygen tank, too weak to walk 20 feet, dying the most
painful death imaginable. And now I'm worried about the same thing
happening to my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Her personal battle with Grace over, Gayla has become a
persistent, solitary voice pushing for people, especially the
government, to look at her town, to study what happened to the
miners and their families, and to examine what's happening today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people here just want me to let it all die,'' Gayla says.
``But that's what it's all about, people dying. I just want someone
to make sure that the next generation doesn't die of the same thing
that killed their parents and grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRST LINK IN 1900
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos has been used for centuries, but it wasn't until 1900
that a physician first linked the fiber to the death of a patient.
A London physician conducted an autopsy on a 34-year-old patient
who slowly lost the ability to breathe and eventually suffocated.
The doctor found massive scarring and asbestos fibers embedded in
the man's lungs. The patient had worked for 16 years in a factory
that made textiles from asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, the same year the Zonolite mine began operation, the
British Medical Journal published its first study naming asbestos
as a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-30s, pathologists at Presbyterian-University Hospital
in Pittsburgh reported finding asbestos in the lungs of 46 of 100
asbestos factory workers they had autopsied.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irving Selikoff, who headed the Environmental Science
Laboratory at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, is considered the
father of asbestos health research in the United States. He
reconfirmed the hazards of the fiber in 1964, when he published his
studies into the deaths of hundreds of asbestos workers in the
'40s, '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, production at the Zonolite mine was surging.
</P>
<P>
   To trace the mine's effect on Libby, the P-I examined 6,000
pages of company documents, medical records, federal and state
inspections and interviewed more than 110 safety, health and
environmental investigators, former employees and their families or
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, the Montana Board of Health, Division of Disease
Control, inspected the plant and found that ``asbestos dust in the
air is of considerable toxicity.'' Investigators found enormous
quantities of dust and inoperative exhaust systems'' and called for
broad improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years later, the health board followed up to
``determine if any of the components ... found to be detrimental to
the health of the employees in August 1956 had been reduced or
alleviated.'' The inspectors listed deficiencies on four
single-spaced pages, detailing areas where high concentrations of
asbestos-laden dust spewed from the pipes, chutes and machinery.
</P>
<P>
   They repeated a warning they had made in 1956: ``Inhalation of
asbestos dust must be expected sooner or later to produce pulmonary
fibrosis ... pulmonary asbestosis, once established, is a
progressive disease with a bad prognosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, workers were beginning to experience respiratory
problems. The first miner to be diagnosed with asbestosis was Glenn
Taylor. In February 1959, after he'd worked 19 at the mine, doctors
at the state tuberculosis hospital determined that the disease that
was robbing Taylor's ability to breathe was not TB, but asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Taylor's case and the ones that followed, many of the
mine's workers maintain that Grace waited at least 15 years before
it conceded that there was anything hazardous in the dust that
often covered them.
</P>
<P>
   `OF COURSE THEY KNEW'
</P>
<P>
   In its defense before various juries, Grace has maintained that
it, and the Zonolite Co. before it, was using the latest safety and
health information available to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even before Grace bought the mine, more than a dozen
reports by the Montana Health Department and the U.S. Bureau of
Mines cited the high concentrations of asbestos in the vermiculite
dust blanketing the operation. The 1956 state report warning of the
asbestos dust's ``considerable toxicity'' is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they knew there was asbestos up there,'' said Les
Skramstad, who worked at the mine for two years and is dying of
cancer from the fibers. ``They used to have us drive up to the mine
and fill up our pickup truck with piles of raw asbestos off the
mine face. We'd bring it back to town, where the researchers would
experiment with it, trying to find something they could make out of
it to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1969 internal report, directed to the desk of company
President Peter Grace, warned that ``tremolite is definitely a
health hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, the W.R. Grace senior attorney, said the company
monitored the health of its workers ever since it bought the mine
in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Little, a radiologist who did the first chest X-rays
of the workers in 1964, found a ``great deal of lung abnormalities
among the employees ... far in excess of what one would find in
examining the normal population.''
</P>
<P>
   Little said the situation was ``even more severe when
considering he was examining young, hardy workmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the X-ray results were sent to the miners' family
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of workers and their survivors acknowledged in P-I
interviews that the X-rays were taken. But all said that they were
never told the results.
</P>
<P>
   Grace correspondence from November 1967 said: ``The only persons
aware of the studies are (Grace) officials and Dr. Little.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers with lung abnormalities was frightening to
some of the doctors involved.
</P>
<P>
   A 1969 series of X-rays showed that almost half of the people
who had worked at the mine for 11 to 20 years had lung disease of
some type. Among the employees who had worked at the mine for 21 to
25 years, 92 percent were diseased.
</P>
<P>
   Even Grace's insurance company cautioned Grace about not moving
quickly enough to inform workers of the health problems the
company's medical surveillance detected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly when an X-ray picture shows a change for the worse,
that person must be told,'' said a December 1969 letter from
Maryland Casualty Co. ``Failure to do so is not humane and is in
direct violation of federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT PERMANENT SOLUTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, the Grace attorney, emphasized that the company's
issuance of respirators to workers was more evidence that the
company was taking the health threat seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Grace documents showed a different side of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respirators or other respiratory protective devices should not
be considered as permanent solutions to any processing procedures
which create contamination of the atmosphere,'' a Grace safety
officer wrote in January 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At least six state and federal inspection reports in the '60s
and '70s raised the same concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have respirators, but the dust was so heavy most of the
time that they clogged up within minutes,'' recalls Skramstad.
``You had a choice of wearing them or breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Thom, the last union president before the closing, agrees.
``If you had a respirator on ... pretty soon it was clogged up, so
you just took it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the company worked closely with the workers' union
on safety issues, especially the high levels of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Thom remembers it differently. ``We did have discussions on the
dust. But the story was always the same: `It's just a nuisance
dust. It's not a problem.' But (for years) the company never told
us it contained asbestos, or anything dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, they told us that the dust contained tremolite,
not asbestos, and that tremolite was not hazardous,'' said Thom,
who worked at the plant from 1974 to 1992 and was a union officer
for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until 1979 that Grace admitted to us that tremolite
was a serious health threat.''
</P>
<P>
   REPORTS STAMPED `CONFIDENTIAL'
</P>
<P>
   The documents collected by the P-I also raise questions about
the role of the federal health investigators. At times it becomes
difficult to determine whether they were trying to protect the
workers or the company.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1969, the U.S. Public Health Service asked that
Grace provide data for a mortality study of asbestos workers. The
author of the letter, the epidemiology director of the Bureau of
Occupational Safety and Health, promised that the ``data would only
be published if no significant differences with Montana death rates
were shown.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the state inspection reports, four a year, from the
Montana health department, were stamped ``confidential'' and said
they were ``not for distribution except to the management'' of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In internal memos, Grace lawyers said the confidentiality would
protect them from having the state reports used against them in
workers' compensation cases.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of confidentiality was the only way that state
inspectors could get into many industries at the time, according to
a Montana state employee who has researched the state's
environmental history.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the language in some of the reports showed
increasing frustration at the company's slow pace in getting the
lethal dust under control, there is not a single indication that
government inspectors ever threatened or even considered shutting
the plant down.
</P>
<P>
   A 1964 letter from Benjamin Wake of the Montana Board of Health
Division of Disease Control to Arthur Bundrock, then the union
secretary at the mine, offers some insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enforcement provisions of the Industrial Hygiene Act ...
are very poor and various opinions, over the years, from the
attorney general's office have not strengthened the act,'' Wake
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Bureau of Mines was dismantled in the early 1990s, but
three former inspectors interviewed by the P-I agreed that the
political clout of the mining companies and their lobbyists,
especially in Western states, made taking strong actions against
offending mines almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to have bodies stacked like cordwood and the
public screaming for someone's head before we could get the
government's lawyers to do anything,'' said Robert Jones, a former
Bureau of Mines inspector from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Other federal agencies, as far away as Washington, D.C., knew
there were problems in Libby.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, a deputy U.S. attorney general who owned a cabin near
Libby blew the whistle. He reported to the Public Health Service
that ``there is a dust problem at Libby ... affecting workers and
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1982 EPA investigation into asbestos-contaminated vermiculite
documented that significant levels of asbestos fibers were captured
by air samplers in downtown Libby.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned last week, health experts at the EPA and the U.S.
Public Health Service said they could find no indication that any
formal actions were taken or demands made to Grace while the mine
was operating about the asbestos conditions plaguing the workers.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of the asbestos to the miners' families could have
been halted in most cases by the simple installation of showers.
The request for showers went back long before Grace bought the
mine. The workers and their union often repeated the request.
</P>
<P>
   Even the federal government weighed in, but it didn't follow
through.
</P>
<P>
   An April 1973 U.S. Bureau of Mines report reminded Grace that
most employees wear their clothes to and from work and told the
company it needed showers so the workers could change out of their
dust-covered clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, when Grace opened a new, less dusty wet-process mill,
it had a shower room _ two showers for at least 60 men per shift.
</P>
<P>
   Workers wanted more, and they kept asking. In a February 1978
memo, Grace promised workers that ``there are plans for 1978 for
the installation of proper shower facilities for all employees.''
But no agency ever forced Grace to build those additional showers,
and the company never did so.
</P>
<P>
   John Wardell, the current coordinator of EPA's operation in
Montana, said there's a limit to what the government is responsible
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not responsible if the workers went home before being
properly decontaminated and brought asbestos into their homes.
That's a personal issue.''
</P>
<P>
   `KEEP THEM ON THE JOB'
</P>
<P>
   Early in its ownership of the mine, Grace sought ways to
minimize its financial obligation to asbestos victims. In an
internal memo marked ``personal and confidential'' written Jan. 5,
1968, Grace's safety chief, Peter Kostic, suggested reassigning 32
Libby workers whose X-rays showed disease to less dusty jobs. ``If
we minimize their exposure to dust ... chances are we may be able
to keep them on the job until they retire, thus precluding the high
cost of total disability,'' Kostic wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 1969 internal memo, another Grace executive wrote,
``The inclination of public agencies to protect the worker at any
expense (usually the employer's) ... should be of considerable
concern to us. Our recent experience at Libby ... may well create a
significant financial liability. We should also be concerned with
the obligation to our employees; namely, permitting them to perform
their services under working conditions which we have good reason
to believe are hazardous.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace's insurance carrier, Maryland Casualty Co. in Portland,
Ore., had told Grace two years earlier that its ``inability'' to
curb the asbestos contamination despite repeated warnings ``through
the years might be alleged at least to have constituted willful and
wanton conduct ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The insurer also urged Grace lawyers to prevent the entry of the
``confidential'' state inspection reports into evidence in a
workers' compensation case. The insurance company cautioned Grace
to ``keep them out of the hands of the Industrial Accident Board
and through it, the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   LIBBY'S ROUGH-HEWN ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   The Kootenai River, after flowing south from Canada, turns west
on its way to the Columbia. There at the bend, settlers, miners,
trappers and railroaders built the town in 1892, on the Great
Northern Railroad right of way.
</P>
<P>
   Libby is proud of its rough-hewn roots. On the grounds of the
town's Heritage Museum are an old loggers' cookhouse and a miner's
cabin, meticulously decorated by the Libby Women's Club.
</P>
<P>
   Today, like many Western towns, Libby is being forced to shift
its economy from those extractive industries, and the town is
trying hard to capture its share of new, supposedly healthier,
sources of income. Kootenai Falls was featured in the film ``The
River Wild,'' and the Chamber of Commerce is unabashedly and
successfully wooing tourists looking for outdoor adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the old remains: the well-worn frame houses on
tree-shaded streets, the old German Lutheran church, now fashioned
into the remarkable Hidden Chapel Restaurant _ and a persistent
pro-mining attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Some townspeople think too much is being made of the deaths and
illness. Some of the families who have sued W.R. Grace have been
ostracized by their neighbors. When the film ``A Civil Action,'' a
true story about a lawyer for families who sued W.R. Grace in a
Massachusetts case, played at the Dome Theatre, attendance was
sparse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental politics of the nation don't always go over
well in small towns,'' Libby Mayor Tony Berget said. ``The
environmental laws have hurt the logging industry, and that has
cost us a lot of jobs. Add that to Grace closing the vermiculite
mine and it's been a rough 10 years for a lot of our people. Our
unemployment is between 14 and 16 per cent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Libby is a very trusting community and we trusted the
company,'' Leroy Thom said. ``We never considered they would do
anything that would harm their own employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wrong.''

SEARCHING FOR GOLD, MINERS STARTED ON TRAIL THAT LED TO
VERMICULITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ Prospectors first put pick and shovel to Zonolite
Mountain 119 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many mining-claim records are missing or illegible, but what can
be made out indicates that in 1881, Robert Rannie and his partner,
while searching for gold along a creek, dug a 40-foot-long shaft
following a vein of quartz.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight years later, Edward Alley, a part-time miner and
the owner of the Libby Hotel, stood in the same partially collapsed
shaft. As he moved his flaming torch around the dark hole, the
flame, glittering off mica-like crystals, brushed the top of the
shaft. Popping sounds echoed off the walls, and he noticed that the
sparkly material, heated by the flame, had expanded into large
puffy clusters, weighing next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   When he held the flame beneath them, the clusters did not burn.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists told him that it wasn't mica, but a little-known
substance called vermiculite. Alley, a survivor of the
Spanish-American War who had taken a couple of geology classes at
the University of Nebraska, named it Zonolite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The raw material is but two feet under the cover of soil and
to a depth of 150 feet,'' Alley said. ``We've got a mountain of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Government scientists in Washington, D.C., told him he had
something unique and valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The chief mineral technologist at the U.S. Bureau of Mines
called the expansion of the vermiculite the most remarkable
phenomenon he had ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   By 1924, Alley had built a primitive roasting kiln that produced
four tons of Zonolite a day.
</P>
<P>
   On March 25, 1925, Great Northern Railroad shipped the first
boxcar of Zonolite from Libby to a Hillsboro, Ohio, company that
used it to insulate bank vaults, office safes and filing cabinets.
Also that year, a New York company developed a method of using
Zonolite to make building boards at half the weight and twice the
strength of wood. And a Billings, Mont., firm developed a new
``permanent'' roofing material using 70 percent Zonolite and 30
percent asphalt. They claimed it was fireproof and would ``last
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year Alley sold his hotel and several other
properties in Libby and mortgaged his ranch to increase the size of
the operation. By mid-1926, he was running a much larger plant,
producing up to 100 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
   The process was simple. The vermiculite ore was stripped from
the top of the mountain and hauled in huge trucks to a mill, where
it was separated into various commercial sizes through a dusty
screening system. Some of the ore was shipped untouched. Other
material was sent to an expansion plant, where it was run through
ovens at about 2,000 degrees, causing it to ``pop''to 15 times its
size.
</P>
<P>
   Before Alley died in 1935, he shepherded the obscure mineral
into thousands of products being sold around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Zonolite merged with another company mining the bottom
of the hill and became the Universal Zonolite Insulation Co. Nine
years later the name was changed to the Zonolite Co.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the company was sold to W.R. Grace and Co. Very
quickly, Grace expanded the operation and increased production.
</P>
<P>
   Through the '60s, '70s and '80s, a near-continuous line of
Burlington Northern rail cars hauled millions of tons of the
vermiculite ore to Grace plants and other companies in 30 states
and six foreign countries. The featherweight material was showing
up in dozens of new products, from lawn fertilizer to fireproofing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, 1,898 men and women worked at the mine, as many
as 332 at any one time, working two and sometimes three shifts a
day. At times, the miners were the best-paid workers in town.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 80 percent of the world's vermiculite came from Libby.
The rest came from South Africa and another Grace mine in South
Carolina. The workers were proud of what they were accomplishing.
In the history of the company there was only one strike. It lasted
27 days.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when Grace closed the mine citing economic reasons,
company documents contained estimates that ``another 80 or 100
years worth of vermiculite can be pulled out of that mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Grace sold the property to three men _ two local
loggers and Jack Wolters, formerly vice president of Grace's
construction products division. Plans for the 4,000-acre site have
not been decided, said Mark Owens, one of the trio and a
third-generation logger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really sure what we're going to do,'' Owens says.
``We may log and reforest it, perhaps build a wildlife area or
maybe some type of development.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his group might mine the mountain again, he would only
say, ``There's a lot of ore left in that hill.''

BIDS EXPECTED SOON FOR LOCKHEED'S N.H. UNIT, SANDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin Corp. is preparing to entertain bids for its
Sanders military electronics division, based in Nashua, N.H., and
for more than 30 years one of the Granite State's largest
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials worry a sale of Sanders could mean layoffs
among its 4,000 employees in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, but
Sanders president Walter P. Havenstein prefers to put a happy face
on the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is profitable, he says, with annual sales approaching $1
billion, and it would make sense for a buyer to keep it intact and
to continue its operational autonomy. ``We're committed to making
Sanders work, and to work here in New Hampshire,'' Havenstein said
in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Havenstein said he could only guess who might bid. But a person
familiar with the process said other aerospace companies, including
L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Northrop Grumman Corp., General
Dynamics Corp., and British Aerospace, have expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   No deal is expected for at least several months. Northrop and
General Dynamics declined to comment and L-3 Communications did not
respond to inquries. British Aerospace spokesman Phil Sousey
confirmed the company is mulling a purchase, adding that ``BA has
an interest in all goings-on in the aerospace industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Another option is a management buyout, but Havenstein said it is
too soon for him to discuss whether he might want to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future, Sanders would come with a built-in major
customer _ Lockheed Martin, which through its other divisions buys
30 percent of Sanders' output of antimissile devices, microchips,
and other defense-related electronics. Other defense contractors
account for most of the rest of Sanders' sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders might do even better out from under the parent's wing,
Havenstein said, by attracting more Lockheed Martin rivals as
customers. ``People who would normally consider Sanders . . .. as a
captured unit of Lockheed Martin might be more likely to look at us
as a merchant supplier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin's possible sale of the Sanders division is yet
another piece of the massive retrenchment among defense contractors
following a decade of industry consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Havenstein, who joined Sanders nine months ago, already had a
working knowledge of the company in his previous job as head of a
Raytheon Co. unit in Falls Church, Va. As often happens in the
shrinking defense industry, Raytheon and Sanders were sometimes
rivals for work and, at other times, partners.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is Lockheed Martin's largest operating subsidiary in New
England, with primary facilities in Nashua, Hudson, and Merrimack,
N.H. About 1,500 of Sanders' employees are engineers and another
1,000 are in manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin also owns an infrared imaging unit with 400
employees in Lexington, Mass., and has about 1,900 employees at
smaller units throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, at the height of the Reagan administration
defense build-up, Sanders had 9,100 employees. But even at less
than half that size it remains one of New Hampshire's largest
employers, and a cornerstone of the state's high-technology
industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin says Sanders is one of several aerospace
electronics units, including Fairchild Systems in New York, that it
might prefer to sell as a bundle. The decision to evaluate these
companies for sale was announced in September, following poor
performance reviews by the Pentagon, and a string of disappointing
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin share prices aredown more than 60 percent from
a late-1998 high of 55, closing Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange at 20 5/8, up 1 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanders division, once known as Sanders Associates, was
founded in Waltham, Mass. in 1951 by a group of 11 former Raytheon
Co. employees led by Royden C. Sanders. It moved to Nashua the next
year, and through following decades became known for production of
``countermeasure'' devices used to fool enemy missiles, either by
jamming their radio frequencies or by firing flares to confuse
heat-seeking sensors.
</P>
<P>
   The founder left in 1975 after pressing unsuccessfully to enter
computer production; he now owns design firms in Wilton and
Merrimack, N.H. Lockheed Corp. bought Sanders in 1986 for $1.2
billion, keeping its name and giving it relative autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to antimissile devices, Sanders makes computer chips
known as monolithic microwave integrated circuits, used in guidance
systems for missiles and satellites.

ANALYSIS: COMBAT ON SPENDING ENDS IN A DRAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SPEND-CONGRESS) 
(sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all of the partisanship and intense wrangling
of the past 10 days, the budget agreement between President Clinton
and the Republican-run Congress ended up being most remarkable for
its moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the temptations posed by an era of federal surpluses,
the package approved by the House on Thursday night contains no
expansive new spending programs, such as President Clinton's
proposal for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Nor does it
include the $792 billion tax cut over 10 years that the Republicans
tried to push through, only to be stopped by Clinton's veto.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over spending for the 2000 fiscal year showed that
both an impeached president and House Republicans, reduced to a
razor-thin majority, proved remarkably resilient. The outcome came
about because each side, in effect, fought the other to a draw. As
a result, both sides could take credit on Thursday for a spending
agreement that will take another step toward paying down the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   And the most far-reaching effect of this year's budget struggle
may well be a consensus that has emerged through two years of
political combat that Social Security payroll taxes should no
longer be used to pay for other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first used the ``save Social Security first'' refrain in
1998 to stop Republican tax cuts. But this year, with the size of
the surpluses growing almost monthly, Clinton softened his stance
to allow for new spending. He said that 63 percent of the total
budget surplus over 15 years should be used for Social Security
with the rest going to other programs.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the Republicans decided to trump Clinton and call
for the entire Social Security reserve to be protected. Many
Republicans said this week that their pledge had created a powerful
new political weapon to contain federal spending in a time of
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing was when it was obvious that we stopped the raid
on Social Security, we set a parameter that was impenetrable,''
said Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the idea of leaving Social Security revenue untouched
has now become so widely embraced that some version of it is
recited by presidential candidates across the political spectrum _
from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said, ``I think its going to be very
difficult for either party to go back at any time in the future and
acknowledge that they are using the Social Security trust funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately this idea could come back to haunt the Republicans as
much as the Democrats _ constraining tax cutting as well as
spending. ``We checkmated each other,'' said a senior Democratic
staff member. ``We said `save the surplus to stop tax cuts.' They
used it to stop spending programs. So it came out as a draw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican focus on Social Security, which has long been an
issue that Democrats wielded against Republicans _ was part of a
fundamental shift in tactics by the brash conservatives who swept
to control of Congress in 1994 on a pledge to reduce the scope of
government. It came in fits and starts across the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans began the year pledging fiscal restraint but
then blew past the spending limits set in the 1997 balanced budget
law by more than $30 billion. They approved a $792 billion tax cut,
but failed to generate much public enthusiasm for it.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of fighting after Clinton vetoed the tax cut,
Republican leaders made a pragmatic decision to adjust to the
limits of divided government and to the mood of an electorate that
is no longer dominated by the angry and economically pressed voters
who swept them into office.
</P>
<P>
   They borrowed, and sightly retooled, historical Democratic
campaign themes. They promoted education spending. They put more
money into the military and certain health programs than even
Clinton had asked for. They struck compromise after compromise with
the president, thus moving more in line with a time when their
preferred presidential candidate is running as a ``compassionate
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kept the bulls-eye off our forehead, unlike the last
four years,'' said Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   And oddly enough, after years of cacophony, the Republicans
found a unifying theme in Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily, Republicans pledge to keep the money brought in
from the Social Security payroll tax from being used to pay for
other government programs _ even though Democrats wield studies
from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that the
Republican spending bills are full of gimmicks and actually risk
eating into the Social Security reserve by $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The theme helped Republican leaders rally the party's moderates
who want to pay down the national debt and its conservatives who
believe that the refrain has created a powerful new political
firewall that will prevent both parties from increasing the size of
government now that deficits are no longer forcing reductions in
spending. Of the projected $3 trillion surplus across the next
decade, $2 trillion of the money would be in Social Security
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moment that's dripping with irony,'' said Marshall
Wittmann, director of congressional relations for the conservative
research group, the Heritage Foundation. ``We've reached the fourth
year of the Republican revolution and they are laying their
political future on defending the cornerstone of the welfare
state.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you ask Republicans what time it is, they say
`save Social Security.' If you ask what the weather is they say,
`save Social Security.' It's a kind of unity they haven't had since
they took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Republicans can really benefit politically from the
Social Security issue in next year's elections is another question.
Among the public at large, polls show voters still trust Democrats
far more than Republicans when it comes to issues relating to the
retirement fund.
</P>
<P>
   Irritated by Republican commercials accusing Democrats of
wanting to raid Social Security, House Democrats on Thursday
continued to showcase all the accounting gimmicks the Republicans
used to hide the true levels of spending they approved.
</P>
<P>
   Still each side could point to victories. Clinton received money
to pay for his signature programs to hire 100,000 more teachers and
50,000 more community police officers. He secured money to pay the
country's back dues to the United Nations and finance the Wye River
Mideast peace accord. And the White House fought off provisions on
mining and oil drilling that it had opposed as threats to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans got a foothold for their efforts to loosen federal
restrictions on how education money can be used. They put in place
language to limit federal financing of groups that promote abortion
rights overseas. They prevailed in increasing military spending
even more than Clinton wanted. And they won a largely symbolic
across-the- board spending cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a football game, the score would be pretty close
to a tie,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``This is a deal where
no one got a scalp, but everyone came back from the hunt with
something to brag about.''

IT'S MADNESS: CBS PAYS $6.2B FOR NCAA EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS locked up March Madness for the next 11 years by spending an
astounding $6.2 billion for the television rights to the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced Thursday night after CBS, Fox, and ESPN had
made presentations to the NCAA, comes on the heels of the equally
staggering $2.4 billion NASCAR package with NBC, Fox, and TBS.
</P>
<P>
   The three-week tournament represents one of most expensive
packages in sports television. The $17.6 billion, eight-year NFL
deal is still the gold standard. The NBA's $2.64 billion, four-year
deal with NBC and TNT is in its second year, while Major League
Baseball is in its last year of a $1.7 billion, five-year deal with
Fox, NBC, and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   The skyrocketing deals are fueled in part by advertisers'
willingness to reach the all-important male demographic between the
ages of 18 and 34 as well the networks' need to have a
cross-promotional platform to market its other prime-time
programming.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other network, CBS knows what it's like not to
have such a vehicle, a painful lesson learned in 1993 when it lost
the NFL to the then-upstart Fox network for what was then
considered an astronomical $1.56 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first blush, what seems to be an obnoxious amount of money
might make sense if you peel back all the layers of the
agreement,'' said David Carter, a sports business analyst at the
University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   In this particular case, CBS receives all of the television
rights, including over-the-air broadcasting, cable television,
satellite, digital and home video and Internet rights. CBS also
acquires all rights to related electronic commerce and various NCAA
Web sites. The deal begins in 2003 after CBS existing contract
expires. The new deal more than doubles the networks $1.73 billion
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The is the first sports deal in history to extend beyond our
traditional platforms into the world of new media,'' said Leslie
Moonves, president and CEO of CBS television.
</P>
<P>
   Long plagued by an aging viewership, CBS has transformed itself
into a younger, hipper network. Its merger with Viacom, for
instance, enables CBS to promote its sports programming on VH-1,
Nickelodeon, MTV, and other Viacom networks.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said the NCAA is potentially troubling, largely because
it calls into question the precarious balance between education and
big-time sports. ``The ethical implications are extraordinary,''
Carter said. ``Its more than just the money. Because of the NCAA
revenue-sharing process, you might see conference shakeouts where
schools jockey to get a bigger piece of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA opened negotiations early and ended CBS's exclusive
bargaining period in August. The network has broadcast the event
since 1982, when it acquired the tournament from NBC. It added the
early rounds, which had been broadcast by ESPN, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ABC-ESPN issued a tersely worded statement. ``The ABC-ESPN bid
offered the best opportunity for exposure and growth for the NCAA
men's basketball tournament,'' said ESPN spokesman Josh Krulewitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``With over 2,300 college basketball games, the woemn's
championship tournament, 277 other NCAA competitions and nearly 100
college football, ESPN remains the home of college sports.''

RANGERS' RODRIGUEZ IS AL MVP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ Ivan Rodriguez has long been considered the best
catcher in the American League. Now he's considered the best
player, period.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rodriguez earned that honor Thursday when he was named the
American League's Most Valuable Player, narrowly winning the award
over Boston Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a lot to me,'' Rodriguez said. ``It's a great
honor. The awards every player wants to win is Most Valuable Player
and a World Series. Now I've got the MVP award, the next one I want
to have is the World Series ring. But this is a great feeling. I
still don't believe it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   With Juan Gonzalez winning in 1996 and 1998, the Rangers have
taken home the award three of the past four years. Jeff Burroughs
also won it while playing for the Rangers in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty exciting for the franchise, winning three of the
last four years,'' general manager Doug Melvin said. ``I think
Pudge will look at this as an incentive to win another one. This
puts him further on the path to the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez received 252 points, edging Martinez by 13 points
among the 28 ballots cast. Rodriguez received seven first-place
votes, and Martinez received eight. But Martinez was hurt by being
left off two ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed at all,'' Martinez said in a conference
call with Boston reporters. ``Everybody that was in that pile was
good enough to be MVP, so I don't have anything against anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28 voters, two baseball writers from each of the 14 American
League markets, list 10 players. First place is worth 14 points,
second place is worth nine and then 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 in descending
order. Balloting is conducted by the Baseball Writers Association
of America.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Indians second baseman Roberto Alomar and outfielder
Manny Ramirez tied for third place with 226 points and Rangers
designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro was fifth with 193 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously disappointed, but I'm happy for Pudge,''
Palmeiro said. ``He had a tremendous year. He deserves it as much
as anybody else who could have won it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is the ninth catcher in major-league history to win
the award and the first since Thurman Munson won with the New York
Yankees in 1976. It's the fourth time since the award was started
in 1931 that a player won the MVP award despite not receiving the
most first-place votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys I was competing against all had a great year,''
Rodriguez said. ``They all had dream seasons. But that's baseball.
I felt I had a good season, I felt I had a good shot at the MVP,
and it came true.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez receives a $250,000 bonus for winning the award.
Palmeiro will receive a $100,000 bonus for finishing fifth. The
Rangers' standard policy is to give a $250,000 bonus for winning,
$100,000 for finishing second through fifth and $50,000 for
finishing sixth through 10th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Raffy,'' Rodriguez said. ``He
deserved to win the award, too. He had an incredible season.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro said: ``It's never been a goal of mine, but, since I
came this close, this is the kind of thing that will motivate me
even more. I think it will motivate Pudge, too. This puts him in an
elite class, and he's going to work even harder to stay in that
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was rewarded for having one of the greatest seasons
ever by a catcher. He hit .332, the highest batting average by an
American League catcher since 1936, when Hall of Fame player Bill
Dickey hit .362 for the New York Yankees. His 35 home runs are the
most by an American League catcher, and his 116 runs scored match
the second most by a major-league catcher. His 113 runs batted in
are the second most by an AL catcher since 1957, and he is the
first major-league catcher to hit at least 20 home runs and steal
20 bases in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also stood out defensively by throwing out a
career-high 54.2 percent of base runners attempting to steal,
leading the American League for the fifth consecutive year. He also
had only one passed ball and won his eighth consecutive Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the production he gives the Rangers in all
aspects of the game can't be matched by any of those other
candidates,'' said ``St. Paul Pioneer Press''' Scott Miller, who
voted Rodriguez first.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro hit .324 with 47 home runs and 148 RBI. But a knee
injury forced him to spend most of the season as the Rangers'
designated hitter, and that hurt him with some voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, people arguing that based on pure numbers that it
should be Raffy, didn't sell with me because he's a DH,'' said
``The Tampa Tribune'''s Joe Henderson, who voted for Roberto Alomar
and listed Rodriguez third. ``He put up some unbelievable numbers,
and maybe Texas wouldn't have been as good without him. But he's a
part-time player; the same with Martinez.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Palmeiro: ``There's nothing I can do about that. We played
with Lee Stevens at first base, and we were successful with that.
You can't go back and change it. It was the best way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Pudge had a great year. He deserves to win the award.''

NINE KILLED IN COLLAPSE OF BONFIRE FRAMEWORK AT TEXAS A&AMP;M
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By Chris Vaughn 
And John Moritz 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The pyramid framework for one of Texas
A&AMP;M's oldest celebrations _ the Aggie Bonfire _ crumbled in a heap
of cascading logs before dawn yesterday, killing at least nine
students and raising cries to eliminate one of college football's
greatest traditions.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen other Aggies were injured in the collapse,
several critically, and rescuers toiled into the night unstacking
logs one by one in hopes of finding alive two students still buried
in the timber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good, but there's always hope,'' Cindy Lawson,
director of university relations, said as nightfall enveloped the
saddened campus.
</P>
<P>
   University President Ray Bowen called the accident ``a great
tragedy'' and ``probably the single worst'' incident in A&AMP;M
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is broken-hearted about what happened,'' said Bowen,
who canceled the bonfire lighting, which was scheduled for
Thanksgiving night, on the eve of A&AMP;M's game with archrival
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Texas Aggie family and the world, this has been a day
of unspeakable grief and sorrow,'' Bowen said last night at a
40-minute memorial service attended by more than 16,000 people at
Reed Arena on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to cope with this tremendous loss of life and
the pain and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the service were Lt. Gov. Rick Perry and former
President George Bush, whose presidential library is at A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie Bonfire dates back to 1909 and annually attracts tens
of thousands of spectators. It has been canceled only once before _
after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November
1963.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen declined to say whether the bonfire will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important tradition to us,'' he said, ``but those
decisions must be made at a calmer time.''
</P>
<P>
   A group calling itself Aggies Against Bonfire has called in the
past for the abolition of the event, saying it wastes resources,
pollutes the air and contributes to dozens of injuries and
alcohol-related arrests each year.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Turner, editor of the student newspaper ``The
Battalion,'' said some of the university's 43,000 students
questioned about the bonfire yesterday said ``it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonfire is one of the most sacred traditions to Texas A&AMP;M's
campus,'' said Turner, 20, a Fort Worth high school graduate.
``It's one of the status symbols of our university. People say this
is historic because this is the end of Bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay Barrington, a 21-year-old senior, said the bonfire should be
lighted as scheduled next week as a tribute to those who were
killed building it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they died to build it,'' Barrington told The
Associated Press. ``They wouldn't want it to just get put away.
They'd want it to burn.''
</P>
<P>
   To erect what would have been this year's 55-foot tall bonfire
of about 7,000 logs, students spent several weeks cutting logs into
about 10-foot lengths that were hoisted with the aid of cranes and
tractors. The logs then were bound together, three at a time, with
baling wire to form what resembles a tiered wedding cake.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the students who were building the bonfire framework nor
the faculty adviser could explain why it collapsed with about 70
students on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out here about 10:30 last night and I did not see
anything that would indicate trouble,'' said Rusty Thompson, the
faculty adviser to the project. ``There was no indication to me
that there was anything different or unusual about last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M sophomore Diana Estrada told AP that she was about 200
yards from the stack when it fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just toppled over, and the wires snapped and the lights
started sparking and going on and off,'' she said. ``We ran over
there as fast as we could, and we could see legs sticking out and
hear people screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Jerry Self, a sophomore engineering technology major
from Arlington, Texas; Chad Powell, a first-year computer
engineering major from Keller, Texas; Jeremy Frampton of Turlock,
Calif; Bryan McClain from San Antonio; Christopher Breen from
Austin, Texas; Nathan Scott West from Bellaire, Texas; Jamie Hand
from Henderson, Texas; Lucas Kimmel from Corpus Christi, Texas; and
Christopher Lee Heard from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Three students were in critical condition, one was in serious
condition and three in fair condition at St. Joseph Regional Health
Center. Another 18 students were treated for minor injuries and
released.
</P>
<P>
   At College Station Medical Center, one student was in critical
condition and two were admitted with broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   Several students who had completed their shifts building the
bonfire framework said they heard about the accident after
returning to their dorm rooms and raced to the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really couldn't do anything,'' said Matt Heidrick, 18, of
Tyler. ``The fire department was already here.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidrick and Caleb Richers, 18, of Bryan said everything
appeared normal when they left the construction about midnight.
</P>
<P>
   `We were crawling all over it,'' Richers said. ``I would have
never had any idea that something like this was about to happen. It
all looked normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan McDaniel, a 19-year-old freshman from DeSoto, Texas, said
he was standing some distance from the construction when he heard a
snapping noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unmistakable,'' McDaniel said. ``You could hear the
creaking, snapping sound and then the screams. There were screams
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel's roommate, Adam Brzozowski, 19, from DeSoto, was
several hundred yards away when he heard the same sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a creak and then it just tipped over like a stack of
cards,'' Brzozowski said. ``If you were on the wrong side, there
was nothing you could do about it. You were just trapped.''
</P>
<P>
   The university's police department will head the investigation
into the accident, and a number of engineering and construction
firms statewide have offered help in analyzing how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Early speculation centered on the integrity of the so-called
center pole, the largest log, which is steel-reinforced, in the
middle of the structure. But officials said it was too early to
know whether the pole broke during the fall or whether a break
caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said there was no horseplay at the time of the
collapse, and he dismissed criticism that no full-time university
employee was at the site. (MORE)

USC BASKETBALL TEAM TO RELY ON SIX KEY VETERANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC basketball coach Henry Bibby was asked to
evaluate his incoming players this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have to?'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   That about sums up the Trojans this season, a team that will
rely on six players for almost everything. But Bibby is so pleased
with his six veterans that he has little doubt USC will improve on
last year's 15-13 record and NIT appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are shooting for the NCAA Tournament, and it should
be an attainable goal if two or three of those new players Bibby
didn't want to talk about contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be better than last year,'' Bibby said. ``It'll be
something different this season. You won't see 15 or 16 changes in
the starting lineup. Six or seven guys will play the majority of
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby has spent most of the previous three seasons shuttling
players in and out of games, but said mass substitutions are no
longer going to be a problem this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's team was tough to coach. I couldn't pick a lineup
because no one guy stood out,'' Bibby said. ``Last year, we had
guys that thought they should have been playing. Last year, we had
guys that thought they could coach the team.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bibby couldn't substitute if he wanted to. USC will
rely on six players: Center Brian Scalabrine; forwards Sam Clancy,
David Bluthenthal and Jarvis Turner; and guards Brandon Granville
and Jeff Trepagnier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have six guys that can do almost anything,'' Scalabrine
said.
</P>
<P>
   This six-pack gives USC a talented core group, and unlike last
season there should be relative harmony within the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was so different, with players being mad,''
Scalabrine said. ``This year, there's no gripes about playing time.
Everyone gets along with each other. It's a pretty mature group of
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be easy keeping everyone happy, because the top six
players should all get plenty of scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You figure there's 60 or 70 shots in a game, so every player
should get about 10 shots,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby is counting on maturity to help the Trojans avoid a
midseason lull, when they lost 10 of 13 games. Their fortunes
turned in February, when they upset No. 4-ranked Stanford 86-82 in
Maples Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think top three in the Pac-10 is realistic for us,''
Granville said.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for optimism lie in the relaxed nature surrounding
the program. No one is looking over his shoulder about playing
time, and Bibby is running more complex practices because most of
the players are accustomed to his system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, it's kind of laid-back,'' Turner said. ``He gives
us more leeway because everyone's more mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the players themselves. The 6-foot-9 Scalabrine
is one of the top players in the Pacific-10 Conference after
averaging 14.6 points and 6.4 rebounds last season. This year, he
will become a 3-point threat and try to improve his rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Brian Scalabrine has to step up his rebounding,''
Bibby said. ``He hasn't been a good rebounder because we depended
on him for so many things. This year has to complete the cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Clancy (6-7) could make the greatest impact, appearing
stronger and more dominating in USC's two exhibition games. He'll
be the muscle inside, along with Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam's range has improved dramatically,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are also expecting 6-7 sophomore Bluthenthal to
become an outside shooting threat, and Bibby has handed him the
starting small forward spot.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a senior, will be the sixth man and relieve all three
frontcourt players. He could even play some emergency point guard,
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could play four positions or maybe five,'' Bibby said. ``A
lot of people think I am crazy for saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting guards are Granville, who averaged nearly 28
minutes as a true freshman, and Trepagnier, a budding star in the
conference with a reputation for thunderous dunks.
</P>
<P>
   If Trepagnier can develop an outside shot, the Trojans could
make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working on it every morning, that's how much I want to
prove it to people that I can shoot,'' Trepagnier said.
</P>
<P>
   So what about those newcomers that Bibby refused to talk about?
Well, actually, he opened up slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five young players making the jump to major college
basketball, they're making it slow,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Junior-college transfer Rashad Jones will have to play because
he is the backup point guard. The Trojans hope he can play about 10
minutes a game without hurting the team. The other contributor
should be 6-11 center Konstantinos (Kostas) Charissis, from Athens,
Greece. He's been raw in the exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rashad Jones and Kostas, those two right there, are not very
consistent right now,'' Scalabrine said. ``Kostas can give us five
minutes and bang.''
</P>
<P>
   The other possible reserve who might play is freshman shooting
guard Malachi Thurston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really shoots the basketball, he can come in and give us a
breather,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   The tallest Trojan _ 7-3 freshman Luke Minor _ will redshirt
while freshman guard Nate Hair is just starting to practice again
after suffering a stress fracture in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about us rebounding the basketball. I'm
concerned about good defense at times,'' Bibby said. ``Can we hold
people to 65 points a game? That's something we have as a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through the war with young, unproven players. This
year, they know what's in front of them.''

COLLEGE STATION, Texas: xxx at the site.

   ``These students who work on the bonfire are adults,'' Thompson
said. ``They have a lot of background and experience. They have
on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Crowell, 19, of Houston was supposed to have been working
on the bonfire at the time of the accident, but said he had skipped
the first few hours of his shift to watch the annual Leonids meteor
shower.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was leaving his dorm room for the site about 3 a.m.
when he heard a siren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard one siren, which I just dismissed,'' he said. ``But
then I started hearing more as I was walking through campus. And I
topped that hill right there and saw it down. Dust was flying and
all the lights had been knocked out. I just tried to help people,
because it was just chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bowen canceled this year's bonfire, he said he feels
the need to come up with something else for the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're dealing with the loss of our students,'' he
said. ``But within the next 48 hours, we're going to have to take a
look at this. We need to think about an alternate event to bond the
Aggie community.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris DeChillo, a junior from Austin, worked through the
afternoon with members of his unit in the Corps of Cadets, moving
logs out of the way. He stopped long enough to consider whether the
bonfire was worth it and, like many students, he staunchly defended
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what A&AMP;M is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie football team canceled practice Thursday and showed up
to help clear the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more important than any game or any practice,'' said
Chris Valletta, a starting offensive guard.
</P>
<P>
   Head football coach R.C. Slocum toured the site about 4:30 p.m.
and said the entire team had helped in the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M is a special place. The loyalty that Aggies feel for each
other is what we're all going to have to rely on to get through
this tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum called the bonfire ``an exercise in young people working
together. It's something that's been very, very good for A&AMP;M.''

ABC'S QUIZ SHOW GETS ITS FIRST MILLIONAIRE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The ABC quiz show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' has its
first millionaire, a network source said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The source said a contestant won the show's jackpot during a
program taped Thursday in New York and scheduled to air at 8:30
p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The source was unable to provide the identity of the contestant
but said it's a man who correctly identified the only U.S.
president to appear on the TV show ``Laugh-In.''
</P>
<P>
   One contestant ``lifeline'' provided by the show _ a phone call
to a relative _ was used by the player to help confirm the winning
answer, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest previous ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' winner
was a lawyer named Michael Shutterly, who won $500,000 in August.

   EAST SELKIRK, Manitoba _ As an afternoon autumn light slanted
across a gray tableau of railroad tracks and power plant
smokestacks, a new joy infused a weather-worn trailer planted here
on the edge of a potato patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big win for us,'' said Bev Austen, a 51-year-old
government filing clerk who has not seen a lot of big wins since
her husband died from metal poisoning 23 years ago, leaving her
with two small children to raise.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the largest pay equity settlement in North
American history, Canada's government agreed late in October to pay
about $2.3 billion to 230,000 past and present federal workers,
overwhelmingly women. It will pay them back salaries, with
interest, to conform with a concept enshrined two decades ago in
Canada's Human Rights Act: ``equal pay for work of equal value.''
</P>
<P>
   Drafters of the law argued that women routinely end up working
in ``female ghettos'' _ as clerks, librarians, nurses, secretaries
and telephone operators. These jobs often pay less than ``male''
jobs that involve comparable education, responsibility, mental
demands and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Using these four criteria, committees made up of workers and
management devised a numerically based system for rating and
comparing ``male'' and ``female'' jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They compared us to painters, and most of us disagreed with
that,'' said Ms. Austen, who has been a clerk here for Canada's
immigration service for the last decade. She noted that the
government requirement for a painter is a 10th-grade education,
while clerks generally have high school diplomas, plus training in
accounting and word processing. ``Then we discovered that painters
made a lot more than clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   Paired by numerical scores, ``female'' jobs routinely won less
pay than ``male'' jobs. A chief librarian made $35,050, while a
dairy herd improvement manager made $38,766. A computer operations
supervisor made $20,193, while a forestry project supervisor made
$26,947. A typist made $10,531, while a sailor made $14,097.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison formulas _ the whole concept of equal pay for
work of equal value _ has been bitterly criticized by free-market
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come up with some concept, where a bunch of bureaucrats
arbitrarily decide, based on some abstract theory, that one job of
one kind that women dominate is somehow the same as another
completely different job that men dominate _ it's unworkable,''
said Monte Solberg, a member of parliament from the Reform Party,
the official opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Men who work in predominantly ``female'' job categories will
also receive checks as part of the effort to equalize pay scales.
With the pay dispute dating to 1984, most beneficiaries of the
settlement have retired or moved on to jobs in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``That they toiled at wages that were openly advertised and, in
fact, which often surpassed comparable pay in the private sector,
matters not a whit,'' complained Giles Gherson, political editor of
The National Post, a newspaper that has become the standard-bearer
of Canada's tax-cutting movement.
</P>
<P>
   The payment, critics argue, will delay moves to cut taxes here.
Canada already has the highest personal income tax burden among the
Group of Seven industrialized nations. After tax cuts go into
effect in Germany and Japan next year, Canada will have the highest
corporate tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Countering arguments that the payment will eat up Canada's
budget surplus, Daryl Bean, president of the federal civil service
union, estimated that over 40 percent of the $2.3 billion would be
returned to the government in the form of income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the white trailer, which she shares with her 23-year-old
daughter, Jacqueline, an artist, and her 25-year-old son, Michael,
a bartender, Ms. Austen estimates that she will get about $15,000,
with the first checks arriving next spring. ``This is so late,''
she said. ``This would have really helped when the kids were little
and we really needed the money.''  &QL;

ANALYSIS: U.S. BISHOPS ARE NOT NO EASY TO LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BISHOPS-REACT) 
(lh) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to many economic and social issues,
the nation's Roman Catholic bishops can put all but the most
liberal Democrats in the shade.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, for example, the bishops issued a statement calling
for an end to capital punishment, not least because it ``is often
applied unfairly and in racially biased ways.'' In September, they
joined other religious groups in a document that called access to
housing ``a sacred right'' and urged the government to do more to
help the poor find permanent shelter.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent annual meetings, the bishops have often taken
conservative positions in internal church issues, underlining their
gradual shift toward the right in the 1990s, a result of two
decades of appointments by Pope John Paul II. On Wednesday, for
example, the bishops voted to adopt a statement of new standards
for Catholic universities that would require theologians to be
certified by a bishop to show they were teaching ``authentic
Catholic doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, on the issue of abortion, which the bishops see as
a human rights issue, they pledged themselves to challenge
politicians, particularly Catholic politicians, who support
abortion rights to undergo ``a change of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   What explains the apparent difference in directions, some
prelates and authorities on the church say, is that the bishops
tend to be more conservative on the internal church issues, and
those have come to dominate meetings of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, by contrast, the bishops' conferences were
preoccupied by debate on sweeping pastoral statements about wealth
and poverty in America and the nation's role in preserving world
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, we were dealing with a lot of big, spectacular
issues,'' said Bishop Robert N. Lynch of St. Petersburg, Fla., in a
news conference after the bishops' meeting ended Thursday. In the
'90s, he said, ``it seems to be a lot of internal issues.''
</P>
<P>
   And on those issues, the bishops have felt pressure from the
Vatican to follow its direction. Three years ago, for example, Rome
sent back to the bishops for revision an earlier version of the
higher education document, which is titled, ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae,''
a Latin phrase meaning ``From the Heart of the Church.'' The
Vatican asked for a more legalistic approach to the relationship
between the church and the university classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting all kinds of instructions from the Vatican,''
said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine
America. ``And they're fairly deferential to the Vatican.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, church authorities in Rome ordered an
American priest and nun to end their longtime ministry to gay and
lesbian Catholics and their families. Despite hopes expressed by
some of the ministry's supporters, the bishops made no move to
question the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The shift toward the right is more apparent because the
conference lacks a consensus-building figure, who could unite
conservatives and moderates among the bishops, as it had in
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, the Chicago archbishop who died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor, who as archbishop of New York occupies
the nation's most prominent and influential see, did not attend the
bishops' meeting this week. But his presence was felt in two
letters he sent, both of which were read aloud. One expressed his
support for the document on higher education.
</P>
<P>
   The other bade an apparent farewell to his fellow prelates. In
that one, he said it would be ``the height of presumption'' for him
to expect that Pope John Paul II would allow him to remain in
office much beyond his 80th birthday, next Jan. 15. Who might
succeed him has been a matter of growing, if often private,
speculation, including at the bishops' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But as a body at least, the bishops will probably continue to
defy easy labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Reese said that looking beyond their opposition to abortion, and
their support of state aid to parochial schools, the prelates still
stand ``to the left'' on many issues. As examples, he cited the
bishops' support for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which was
defeated recently in the Senate, and their concern for the rights
and well-being of undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
   The conference's president, Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza, head of
the Diocese of Galveston-Houston, said the bishops were not
``pulling back in any way'' from addressing issues outside the
church. ``I think you will see us addressing more things like
assisted suicide, capital punishment, sanctions against Iraq and
Cuba,'' Fiorenza said. ``We will respond to those issues out of
what we believe, out of our faith.''

BIG THEFT SMALL THEFT: IS THERE A DIFFERENCE?

   Every Thanksgiving, as we prepare the dining room table, we get
out our Spode china, the Reed &AMP; Barton silverware, the antique
crystal and a small cloth bag that at last count held 36 mismatched
silver butter knives I've swiped from fine hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not particularly proud to admit that for the last 15 years
or so, I've been ``collecting'' butter knives as parting mementoes
of fine meals or pleasant stays. I know my actions are wrong, and
probably will raise tariffs for the rest of you law-abiding
citizens. But I also know that my actions are no indication that
I'm likely to wlk away from a hotel with one of its television
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Such a leap of theft hit me recently as I was winding my way
through one Web site after another, each devoted to employee theft.
The numbers bandied about on these sites are staggering: businesses
supposedly lose $52 billion to $120 billion a year. But forget
about trying to find solid support for these numbers or even
tracing them to an original source. And everything from vanishing
pens to ``stolen time'' to multimillion-dollar embezzlement is
lumped together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us are not completely legal,'' said Laura P. Hartman,
a professor of business ethics at the University of Wisconsin.
``There's no doubt that driving 57 miles an hour in a
55-mile-an-hour zone is illegal. But violating that law doesn't
make you the same as a child rapist. And when we categorize theft
in the workplace as one big category, we are doing just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Written policies at most companies draw no distinctions, barring
employees from taking or using any company property for personal
purposes, no matter how small, said Jay Hotchkiss, a Portland,
Maine., consultant who helps companies write employee handbooks.
But few try to enforce such policies down to the paper clip, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some business owners are resigned to petty theft by customers or
employees. ``I own a restaurant and we've got these creamers for
coffee that are cute little chickens,'' said Scott Adams, whose
main living comes from drawing the ``Dilbert'' comic strip. ``The
cream pours out of their little open beak. As soon as we got them
they were a big hit and started disappearing like crazy. We were
happy about it because anybody who steals a creamer obviously liked
the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adams, whose first Dilbert book was ``Build a Better Life by
Stealing Office Supplies,'' said analyses of employee theft were
always biased. ``They fail to take into account how much the
employer has stolen from the employee,'' he said. ``I don't know
anybody who doesn't do as much work when they're not on the job.
I've got a feeling the net of that is in favor of the employer.''
</P>
<P>
   But basing ethical behavior on a tit-for-tat model can spiral
out of control. Even the consultants hired to stem the tide of
theft say success depends on being reasonable, not puritanical.
Rather than looking for petty ``borrowing'' or Web surfing on
company time, said Michael G. Kessler, a forensic accountant based
in Manhattan, ``I'm looking for the person who's going to sit there
and run his business out of my computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, it is ludicrous to treat all infractions as if they
had the same ethical outcome. Clearly, they do not. Not only is
mutual respect lost if companies practice the petty rigidity of
assigning every wrong the same punishment, but it can also have the
perverse effect of provoking otherwise loyal, productive employees
to up the ante of what they will take from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable solutions can vary from company to company. American
City Journals, a chain of city business newspapers based in
Charlotte, N.C., states in its employee manual, ``Use of office
equipment such as copy machines is allowed for incidental personal
use and to further your commitment to nonprofit and community
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   But while rules may make it easier for employees and employers
to know what's allowed and what's not, no policy can anticipate
every situation. It is better to create an ethical climate where
employees see themselves as stewards trusted with some reasonable
discretion over their use of the company's resources.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I've decided to end my days of knife-lifting. As I
said, stealing is wrong. And who could possibly need more than
three dozen butter knives? &QL;

BUMPERS CAVE IN TO THE BUMP AND GRIND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   (af)  
 By CHERYL JENSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rammed a 1999
Mazda Protege into a pole in Virginia early this year, the impact
reached California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Mazda's North American headquarters in Irvine, officials
scrambled to clean up a public-relations mess. The '99 Protege
suffered $4,609 in damages in four 5 mph crashes _ the worst
showing, by far, of nine vehicles tested. It was also a turnabout;
a '97 Protege had suffered just $1,930 in testing damage.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stemmed from a redesign of the car. To trim about
two pounds, part of a broader effort to reduce weight and improve
mileage, Mazda had eliminated an aluminum bar and energy-absorbing
foam. After the test results became public, Mazda quickly decided
to return to the previous design for 2000-model Proteges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bumper tests like these can leave consumers scratching their
heads. How can a series of 5 mph impacts cause nearly $5,000 in
damage? Don't federal rules protect consumers' wallets from such
big whacks? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not really, consumer advocates say. The institute's bumper
bashing illustrates the continuation of a decades-long debate about
whether consumers are served or shortchanged by bumper rules.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the government required that the bumpers of all new
cars meet a 5 mph standard. That meant there could be no damage to
safety-related items (headlights and turn signals) or to exterior
surfaces (the body or sheet metal). It did allow damage to bumpers
and attaching hardware. The standard was later strengthened to
prohibit substantial harm to the bumper, allowing only minor
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during the energy crisis of the '80s, automakers
complained that the heavier bumpers reduced fuel economy. In 1983,
the government relaxed its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Cars must now meet this standard: A 2.5 mph crash cannot damage
safety-related parts or body panels. There can, however, be damage
to the bumper. Lots of damage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You could destroy the bumper,'' said Brian O'Neill, president
of the insurance institute, a lobbying and research group in
Arlington, Va., that is largely financed by the insurance industry.
The institute tests the bumpers of about 25 vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Why should consumers care? After all, the insurance companies
are the ones writing the big checks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers don't realize how much difference a good bumper
makes in terms of what they pay every six months or so to their
favorite institution, the auto insurance companies,'' said Kim
Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   That organization, which is also financed by auto insurers,
provides information to help those companies set rates. ``Premiums
are influenced by how frequently collisions occur and how much
money it takes to repair the damage,'' Hazelbaker said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since nearly half of collision claims are for $1,000 or less,
they have a big effect on insurance premiums. And minor damage
almost always involves bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are low-speed collisions that all too often are
generating high repair bills,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do flimsy bumpers mean that consumers pay higher
premiums, but the deductible comes directly out of the consumer's
pocket. The most common collision deductible is $500, Hazelbaker
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The financial penalty can be even larger for the millions of
people driving rough, tough light trucks, particularly sport
utility vehicles. The current bumper standard _ weak it is _
applies only to passenger cars. There is no standard for light
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people think they are in an invincible Goliath when in
fact their invincible Goliath has an Achilles' heel,'' said
Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Although the damage suffered by the Protege was high, it has
been worse for trucks, including minivans.
</P>
<P>
   The midsize sport utility vehicles tested by the insurance
institute suffered damage from $2,918 (1999 Mercedes ML320) to
$6,282 ('99 Mitsubishi Montero Sport). Four of the six had repair
bills of more than $5,000. Among pickups, the '98 Dodge Dakota had
$3,863 in bumper damage; the '98 Toyota Tacoma had $4,361. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the automakers are failing to design better bumpers, can they
be compelled to do so? The United States Department of
Transportation could impose stricter standards, although it has
declined to do so. That leaves groups like the insurance institute,
which uses the carrot and stick of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to embarrass the automakers that have bad
bumpers and praise the automakers that have good bumpers,'' O'Neill
said. He said he had seen some improvement.
</P>
<P>
   This may save money for the insurance companies, but O'Neill
says there is also a clear benefit to consumers. ``If you ask a
consumer would you like a car with a bumper that sustains expensive
damage or one that sustains no damage, I think the answer is
clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, consumer groups say, is that many automakers have
either forgotten, or no longer care about, the original purpose of
bumpers: to take the bumps and lumps and protect the rest of the
vehicle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although auto designers strive to blur the lines between where
the bumper ends and the car begins, O'Neill argues that bumpers
should be distinct and utilitarian, as they were when they first
appeared on automobiles in 1906. (The Wescott touring car was the
first vehicle with standard front and rear bumpers, in 1919.) In
his view, a bumper should be set away from the expensive sheet
metal and lights. It should jut out, making it hard for an impact
to reach the body. It should absorb the energy of a minor
collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bumper should bump,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the 1981 Ford Escort as a standard that manufacturers
should emulate: its bumpers sustained no damage in any of the four
tests. Like the bumpers of many past cars, the Escort's were
mounted to shock absorbers. And they stuck out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it was not one of the prettiest cars on the
road,'' said David Champion, auto testing director at Consumer
Reports magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Style and substance do not have to be incompatible. The chic
Volkswagen New Beetle had damage totaling only $134 from all four
low-speed crashes at the insurance institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beetle is the only car the institute has tested that
begins to compare with the 1981 Ford Escort,'' O'Neill said. &QL;

   ``These students who work on the bonfire are adults,'' Thompson
said. ``They have a lot of background and experience. They have
on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Crowell, 19, of Houston was supposed to have been working
on the bonfire at the time of the accident, but said he had skipped
the first few hours of his shift to watch the annual Leonids meteor
shower.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was leaving his dorm room for the site about 3 a.m.
when he heard a siren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard one siren, which I just dismissed,'' he said. ``But
then I started hearing more as I was walking through campus. And I
topped that hill right there and saw it down. Dust was flying and
all the lights had been knocked out. I just tried to help people,
because it was just chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bowen canceled this year's bonfire, he said he feels
the need to come up with something else for the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're dealing with the loss of our students,'' he
said. ``But within the next 48 hours, we're going to have to take a
look at this. We need to think about an alternate event to bond the
Aggie community.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris DeChillo, a junior from Austin, worked through the
afternoon with members of his unit in the Corps of Cadets, moving
logs out of the way. He stopped long enough to consider whether the
bonfire was worth it and, like many students, he staunchly defended
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what A&AMP;M is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie football team canceled practice Thursday and showed up
to help clear the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more important than any game or any practice,'' said
Chris Valletta, a starting offensive guard.
</P>
<P>
   Head football coach R.C. Slocum toured the site about 4:30 p.m.
and said the entire team had helped in the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M is a special place. The loyalty that Aggies feel for each
other is what we're all going to have to rely on to get through
this tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum called the bonfire ``an exercise in young people working
together. It's something that's been very, very good for A&AMP;M.''

DECODING A RADIATION-RESISTANT BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It thrives in deserts, medical autoclaves and food irradiation
chambers. It can withstand more radiation than the Incredible Hulk.
The Energy Department has used it to help clean up perpetually
boiling vats of radioactive wastes. Its place of origin is a
mystery, but some scientists wonder how it acquired all the hardy
properties required of a space traveler.
</P>
<P>
   It is just a tiny red bacterium, but in deference to its awesome
powers scientists have named it Deinococcus radiodurans, a
Greco-Latin amalgam meaning weird, radiation-resistant,
berry-shaped bug. Hoping to learn the secret of its origins and
amazing resistance to radiation, biologists at the Institute for
Genomic Research in Bethesda, Md., have decoded the 3,284,156
letters of its genetic message.
</P>
<P>
   And what have they learned?
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it has not given us the answer as to
why the organism is so radiation resistant,'' said Dr. Michael Daly
of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in
Bethesda and a co-author of a new report about it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J.R. Battista, a Deinococcus expert at Louisiana State
University in Baton Rouge, who was not involved in the genome
decoding, said, ``The part that is absolutely amazing to me is that
there is no obvious explanation for its ionizing radiation
resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sequence of the strange bacterium's genome, described
in Friday's issue of Science, hints at many of the little
organism's survival stratagems.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.1 million cost of the project was paid for by the Energy
Department as part of a program for sequencing industrially
important microbes. The department hopes the microbe will clean up
hot sites and yield information about protecting people from
ionizing radiation, said Dr. Ari Patrinos, a senior official.
</P>
<P>
   Deinococcus radiodurans was first isolated in 1956 from cans of
meat that had been sterilized, or so it was thought, with gamma
radiation. When Deinococcus is dried, some bacteria can survive
exposure to 12 million rads of radiation, Battista has found. One
thousand rads will kill a person.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation causes mutation _ damage to individual DNA units _ but
is deadly to cells because it can also cut both strands of the DNA
double helix. Most bacteria can repair a couple of double breaks
but cannot cope with more. Deinococcus can knit together its DNA
even after the genome has been blasted into more than 100 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Even more surprisingly, the bacterium somehow recognizes and
corrects all the mutated DNA units. ``It repairs double-strand
breaks and keeps the genome totally free of mutation; it truly is
extraordinary,'' Battista said.
</P>
<P>
   The genome sequencing team at the Institute for Genomic Research
has now found that Deinococcus' DNA is arranged in the form of four
circles, which between them code for 3,187 genes. The team, led by
Dr. Owen White, has identified the role of some 2,000 of these
genes by comparing them with genes of known function logged in DNA
data banks. The other thousand genes have no match and have unknown
roles.
</P>
<P>
   All bacteria have a kit of special proteins, known as enzymes,
which repair damaged DNA. White said Deinococcus seemed to have
much the same type of enzymes in its DNA repair kit, although in
several cases it possessed more copies of the enzyme genes.
``Deinococcus is like a Cadillac: it doesn't have any new features
the other cars don't have, it just happens to have all of them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   One special capability, though, is a family of proteins that
evict damaged DNA units from the cell. Eviction is a smart step
because it prevents the damaged units from being reincorporated
into DNA and reintroducing a mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Deinococcus maintains at least four copies of its genome in each
cell, and Daly believes that identical circles of DNA are stacked
up like lifesavers in a tube. When a double-strand break occurs in
one circle, the repair kit enzymes can refer to the neighboring
strand's sequence for mending the break.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution teaches that an organism will possess only the
abilities that it needs to survive. So where in the world did
Deinococcus live that required it to withstand 12 million rads of
ionizing radiation? Because natural radiation nowhere reaches the
barest fraction of this level, Battista believes that Deinococcus
evolved to withstand conditions of extreme dryness.
</P>
<P>
   Desiccation, he said, will produce the same double breaks in DNA
as radiation, and probably mutations as well. ``So radiation
resistance is just a fortuitous consequence of that evolutionary
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The completed sequence of Deinococcus' genome confirms the
suspicion that it is quite closely related to Thermus thermophilus,
a bacterium that lives in near-scalding water. This common ancestry
may have equipped Deinococcus to live in another kind of extreme
environment, that of high aridity. It has been found in the granite
of Antarctic mountains that have not seen rain for thousands of
years, Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   White sees Deinococcus as a scavenger, probably adapted to feed
off other bacteria. The microbe is found all over the world, yet
nowhere is it very common. Its strategy may be that of a survival
specialist. Other bacteria outgrow it but will eventually succumb
to drought or ultraviolet radiation; Deinococcus will always
outlast them, and dine on the carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, having no taste for people, this Incredible Hulklet
of a bacterium is entirely nonpathogenic.

VODAFONE WILL SWEETEN BID FOR MANNESMANN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Directors of Vodafone Airtouch PLC, the world's leading
wireless telephone carrier, decided Thursday night to sweeten their
all-stock bid for Mannesmann AG, Germany's engineering and
telecommunications giant _ raising it as high as $125.3 billion,
according to executives close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   While Mannesmann had previously said it was worth even more,
Vodafone will put its new offer _ nearly 18 percent higher than a
$106.4 billion bid Mannesmann rebuffed last Sunday _ to a meeting
on Friday of the German company's supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   The Vodafone board's decision came as Mannesmann suffered a
legal setback in its struggle against the British company. Its
lawsuit seeking to disqualify Vodafone's investment banker,
Goldman, Sachs, was thrown out by a London judge, who harshly
chastised Mannesmann for bringing it.
</P>
<P>
   If Vodafone's sweetened takeover offer to Mannesmann is
rejected, executives close to Vodafone said, the British company
could opt to make a hostile bid _ the largest ever _ challenging a
battery of German legislation and corporate bylaws intended to
prevent such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   A Vodafone takeover of Mannesmann would create a company with
near-dominance of Europe's principal wireless markets and a network
that stretches from the United States to Africa, Asia and the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's top executives began intense consultations with the
company's investors on Tuesday to sound them out about the level of
a bid they were prepared to back without diluting their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the discussions held Thursday night said
Vodafone's directors had agreed to offer as much as 240 euros, or
$247.20, a share. That would value the German company, whose chief
executive, Klaus Esser, is fiercely committed to independence, as
high as $125.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Such an offer would surpass the $115 billion acquisition of
Sprint by MCI Worldcom announced last month and the $82.4 billion
hostile bid that Pfizer Inc. made two weeks ago for a
pharmaceutical rival, Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, it would be the largest takeover outside the
banking industry, where deals are valued in deposits or assets, and
can run in the hundreds of billions of dollars or higher.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the board meeting, Vodafone shares rose 6.5
pence Thursday, or 2.3 percent, to 2.835 pounds ($4.58). Mannesmann
shares rose 10.85 euros, or 5.5 percent, to 207.50 euros ($213.56).
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the increasingly sour relationship between the two
companies, Mannesmann took out full-page advertisements Thursday in
leading European newspapers, arguing that its combination of
wireless, fixed-line and data operations offered far greater
prospects for growth than Vodafone's single-minded commitment to
wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   But a moment of drama in the battle took place Thursday in
Britain's High Court, where a judge dismissed the move by
Mannesmann to prevent Goldman from advising Vodafone in its
acquisition plans.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Gavin Lightman both set important precedents
for the legal defenses available to targets like Mannesmann and
also handed the German company a harsh rebuke, questioning its
probity on the eve of a board meeting that could determine the
company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann sought the injunction Monday barring Goldman from its
advisory role with Vodafone, arguing that the Wall Street
investment bank faced a conflict of interest because it had access
to confidential information from previous work for Mannesmann. It
also said that Goldman had promised Mannesmann that it would not
represent Vodafone in a hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   Lightman ruled Thursday, however, that Mannesmann's case was so
flawed that ``this application is completely hopeless and must be
dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should never have been brought,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mannesmann's legal moves represented ``totally
disgraceful and unacceptable conduct,'' the judge said. He was
referring to an affidavit sworn by a Mannesmann executive asserting
that he had been present at a meeting where Goldman reassured the
German company that it would not advise Vodafone in a hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   That affidavit was presented to Lightman on Monday and, as a
result, Goldman, Sachs volunteered to suspend its advisory role
with Vodafone. Subsequently, however, Goldman challenged the
affidavit, and the Mannesmann executive, identified as Kurt
Kinzius, then withdrew it and all the main assertions he had made
in it. The judge said the affidavit ``contained totally false
evidence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mannesmann's conduct, Lightman said in his 10-page ruling,
``calls for severe criticism'' because it offered ``false and
misleading evidence.'' A further ground for censure, the judge
said, was ``blowing away the froth _ the total lack of any
substance in Mannesmann's claim.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All these considerations,'' he went on, ``raise serious
questions as to the good faith of the claim in the first place and
whether it was indeed, as suggested by Goldman, Sachs, merely a
sporting exercise designed to rule out of play Vodafone's first
choice of advisers in the hostilities to come and pre-empt a bid by
Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is to be noted that the other leading firms are already
retained by Mannesmann. It is to be hoped that there will be no
repetition of this unseemly exercise in other cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the investment bank said the ruling ``confirms
that Goldman Sachs acted entirely properly in its efforts on behalf
of Vodafone Airtouch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We take our obligations to our clients very seriously,'' the
statement said, ``including safeguarding confidential information
and carefully vetting any potential conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's chief executive, Esser, said only, ``We believe we
were justified in seeking to protect the interests of Mannesmann,
and we are disappointed in the decision of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   During the hearings, Mannesmann's lawyer, Stanley Burton, had
told the court: ``This case is a battle in a war being fought on a
wider front.'' But Goldman's lawyers sought to depict the ruling as
defining an area where, in the words of its lawyer, Lord Peter
Goldsmith, ``this sort of serious application is not to be used as
another weapon in the armory'' of a takeover defense.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at New York
University, said that while the judge's opinion was a powerful
rebuke, it did not necessarily have implications beyond the
Mannesmann-Vodafone struggle because ``it turns on what is found to
be a fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the problem of the boy who cries wolf,'' he said.
``Mannesmann is going to meet a skeptical bench if it ever returns
with a similar claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers who discussed the implications of the case
seemed divided on its impact. Some said the ruling provided what
one called a ``seminal judgment'' because it offered corporate
advisers one more layer of protection against clients' conflict of
interest claims.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers, indeed, said the ruling might encourage
aggressive investment banks to decide to loosen their
conflict-of-interest policies, making it harder to compete for
business in an industry where firms fight aggressively for
blue-chip clients.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the case had created a backlash against
investment banks. Several bankers said they had received calls from
clients earlier this week requesting clarification of their firms'
conflict-of-interest policy, and in some cases asking for
confidential client lists and assurances similar to those
Mannesmann had requested.

BILL EXPANDS HEALTH BENEFITS FOR DISABLED PEOPLE WHO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., N.Y., Mass.)  (th) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress and the Clinton administration said
Thursday that they had agreed on a bill expanding Medicaid and
Medicare so that people with disabilities could return to work
without losing their health insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the legislation was the most important step by
the federal government to help disabled people since passage of the
Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990. It was also the most
significant health legislation to emerge from Congress this year,
the supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives approved the compromise legislation
Thursday night by a 418-2 vote, and the Senate is expected to
approve it within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing law, when disabled people go to work, they often
lose Medicaid and Medicare. Without such coverage, they often
cannot obtain the health care or medical equipment they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is thrilled. He sees this as one of the most
important initiatives emerging from this year's budget
negotiations,'' said Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans saw the bill as a way to help people who want to
work and pay taxes, rather than depend on federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., the chairman of the Finance
Committee, said, ``No one should have to choose health care over
employment. This bill will make that choice unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Advances in medicine have allowed many people with disabilities
to work. And with the unemployment rate at a 29-year low, many
employers are eager to hire them. Often the jobs carry no health
benefits and disabled people are unable to find or afford insurance
from private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Eight million disabled people of working age receive more than
$50 billion a year in cash benefits from Social Security and
Supplemental Security Income. Fewer than 1 percent return to work.
The number of people receiving disability benefits has risen in the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sailed through the House in October on a 412-9 vote,
after a similar measure was approved by the Senate in June, 99-0.
But the bill has been imperiled at every stage by one dispute after
another, most recently by disagreements over how to pay the cost,
about $800 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes an unrelated provision that would delay
federal rules to create a national system for allocating kidneys,
livers and other human organs donated for transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The whole package was bundled with legislation to extend
expiring tax breaks, including credits for research conducted by
technology and pharmaceutical companies. The package was separate
from the appropriations package that Congress was also considering
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton opposed delay of the organ
distribution system and hoped to delete it, but he was not
threatening to veto the underlying bill.
</P>
<P>
   Under another section of the bill, states could provide Medicaid
to workers who are not actually disabled, but have physical or
mental impairments that are ``reasonably expected'' to become
severe disabilities in the absence of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   This could be a boon to people who have been infected with HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, but have yet to develop symptoms of the
disease. Medicaid would help them get protease inhibitors and other
powerful drugs so they could fight off AIDS and continue working.
</P>
<P>
   The same section of the bill could help people with Parkinson's
disease, multiple sclerosis and other chronic or degenerative
conditions. States could also provide Medicaid to workers with
potentially severe physical or mental impairments that could be
traced to birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and a chief sponsor of the House bill,
said: ``The bill sends a message to people with disabilities. If
you go to work, you won't be punished, and you don't have to
impoverish yourself just because you want to become a taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and one of his aides, Connie
Garner, found ways to rescue the bill when it appeared that it
might sink under objections from conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would help disabled people in these ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ People who lose eligibility for Social Security disability
benefits because they return to work could keep their Medicare
coverage for eight and a half years. That is four and a half years
more than they get under current law.
</P>
<P>
   _ People with disabilities could buy Medicaid coverage even if
they took jobs and earned money that would otherwise disqualify
them. They could be required to pay premiums to cover some of the
costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ States could allow disabled workers to buy Medicaid coverage,
even if the workers lost eligibility for cash benefits because of
improvements in their medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would establish a way of providing employment and
training to people with disabilities. The government would issue a
voucher, or ticket to work, that could be used by a disabled person
to buy such services from either a state agency or a private
business.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of initiative would be offset by an assortment of
cutbacks and minor changes in other programs, including the school
lunch program, loans to college students and fees for lawyers who
represent Social Security beneficiaries.

JURY SENTENCES THIRD KILLER IN JASPER CASE TO LIFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
and RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Shawn Berry, who invited a drunken, disabled
black man into his pickup with two Klansmen and drove him into the
woods to be chained and dragged to death, was convicted of capital
murder Thursday, but the jury spared his life.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 24, expressed little remorse and blamed his co-defendants
for the torture and murder of James Byrd Jr., whose mangled,
decapitated corpse was dumped outside a black cemetery in the East
Texas woods. The June 7, 1998, killing was the most heinous racial
crime in recent Texas history and prompted armed black activists
and the Ku Klux Klan to march on this Piney Woods town of 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have voted for the death penalty,'' said Jasper County
District Attorney Guy James Gray. ``But a life sentence is
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry's co-defendants, Bill King, 25, and Russell Brewer Jr.,
32, were convicted earlier this year and sentenced to death by
injection.
</P>
<P>
   In Berry's case, the all-white jury deliberated 10 1/2 hours
over two days before convicting him Thursday morning. In the
afternoon, they took little more than an hour to give him a life
prison sentence. He will serve at least 40 years before becoming
eligible for parole at age 64.
</P>
<P>
   Berry showed no emotion as State District Judge Joe Bob Golden
announced that the jury did not believe he poses a future threat of
violence, which would have been required for them to give him the
death penalty. He kissed and hugged his sobbing girlfriend,
Christie Marcontell, before sheriff's deputies escorted him from
the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Byrd family also cried as the verdict sunk in and
the weight of three grueling trials began to lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can accept life,'' Byrd's sister, Clara Taylor of Houston,
said outside the Jasper County Courthouse. ``The jurors were
honest, capable people with a difficult decision to make. What was
most important to us was that he be convicted of capital murder so
that we could have justice for our brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said it was stressful to watch as Marcontell, Berry's
brother, Louis, and several friends pleaded for his life, but she
said it was only natural that they would do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I sat there and listened to them, I thought how James must
have pleaded with Shawn Berry for his life out there, and as his
family, we wish that we had also been there to plead for his
life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's family members said they believe all three men were
equally responsible for the murder, and while Berry was the only
one who was not a known white supremacist, evidence in his
seven-day trial indicated that he was the driver of the truck and
that it was his logging chain that was used to drag the 49-year-old
Byrd more than three miles.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny specks of Byrd's blood were found on the shoes of all three
killers, but Berry's jeans and shirt also were stained with his
victim's blood, which prosecutors contended was a sign he may have
played a bigger role in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   However, Berry did not have the racist tattoos and violent
rhetoric of his two co-defendants, and about 20 people testified as
character witnesses for him, including two blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Byrd's sisters waited outside on the courthouse lawn and
watched as Berry, amid tight security, was led to a car to be taken
to the state prison system's diagnostic unit in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Berry's friends yelled, ``We love you, Shawn,''
another woman, Ethel Parks, taunted, ``At least you got better than
Byrd.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks, an African-American, followed Berry to the car, shouting,
``One more thing, Shawn: Rot in hell, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors read a brief statement to the media before leaving the
courtroom, saying they had reached their unanimous verdicts after
``long hours of painful and prayerful deliberations.'' They refused
to answer any questions.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's defense attorney, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn, said he
was disappointed in the conviction, but happy that jurors had opted
for a life sentence. He described his client as relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who had taken the stand Thursday to ask the jury for his
life, at first remained defiant and refused to take any
responsibility for his crime. He told of his love for Marcontell
and for their 2-year-old son, Montana.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, however, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brit
Featherston, who assisted the local D.A., grilled him. If he were
such a good family man, Featherston asked, why was he partying with
King and Brewer the night of Byrd's murder, cruising Jasper looking
for women. Why hadn't he married Marcontell, Featherston asked,
instead of abusing her and then appearing on national television
and coming into court wearing a fake wedding ring?
</P>
<P>
   Featherston also confronted Berry with his lies to police and
with the physical evidence against him. However, Berry stuck to his
most recent story, that he had innocently offered Byrd a ride home,
and that he tried to defend him once he realized King and Brewer
intended to kill him. He backed off, he said, when they threatened
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Featherston said, ``Let's go on to another lie then.
When you picked up James Byrd Jr. and Bill King told you, `Let's go
kick (him),' and then Mr. Byrd asked you, `Man, where are we
going?' what do you tell him was going to happen?'' Featherston
shouted. ``What happened was you stopped and killed James Byrd Jr.,
didn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was that I stopped, and Bill King and Russell
Brewer killed James Byrd Jr.,'' Berry replied, adding that despite
the jury's guilty verdict, his involvement in the murder had not
been proved.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you look at this jury and look at the Byrd family and
explain why you have no remorse over this crime?'' Featherston
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very sorry for what happened to Mr. Byrd and I've said
that from day one,'' Berry said. ``And I would do anything in the
world if I could do it over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that include going home and going to sleep after dragging
James Byrd down the road?'' Featherston asked. ``In 40 years, if
this jury spares your life and you get out of prison, do you think
a black man would feel safe walking down Martin Luther King?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Berry answered.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another of Byrd's sisters, Mylinda Washington, said that even
after sitting through three trials, the family is still haunted by
questions about what happened the night her brother was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll ever know what role each of these men
played, but I know all three participated,'' she said, ``because I
don't believe my brother would just sit there and let himself be
beaten and chained like that. The autopsy results show he was
fighting, and I know my brother said something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to know what he said.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, the Byrd family plans to visit James Byrd
Jr.'s grave a few blocks from the courthouse. They will lay flowers
and a banner that says, ``Justice for James. Rest in peace.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ United by a desire to proclaim victory and leave
town, Republicans and Democrats in the House joined on Thursday
night to pass the final budget bill, seven weeks after the fiscal
year began.
</P>
<P>
   Congress then voted to keep the government running for two more
weeks while the Senate finished its work.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted, 296-135, for a package of five spending bills
containing $385 billion, sending the measure to the Senate. There,
an avalanche of oratory from three Senate Democrats seeking
benefits for their states blocked the bill's path and briefly
threatened a government shutdown, a threat that evaporated when the
Senate extended the budget deadline until Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the House passed a new continuing resolution, the
Senate did the same. A short time later, the White House chief of
staff, John Podesta, carrying the continuing resolution, left for
Athens so President Clinton could sign it.
</P>
<P>
   After the earlier House vote on the omnibus spending bill, in
which 170 Republicans were joined by 125 Democrats and one
independent in supporting the bill, both parties claimed political
victory in nearly identical language.
</P>
<P>
   After seven months of haggling over 13 spending bills, and after
10 days of negotiations between the White House and the Republican
leaders in Congress, both sides said the result represented the
essence of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called it ``a hard-won victory for the American
people.'' Podesta, simply said, ``We're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And the speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert of Illinois, said
Congress had ``basically turned the corner on how this town does
business'' by limiting spending in a booming economy, allowing the
government to pay down part of its $3.6 trillion debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans won a $17 billion spending increase for the
Pentagon, along with more money for politically popular health
research and education. They said they kept their promise to
refrain from using excess contributions to Social Security to pay
for the spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats and the White House were able to assert that they
had won the money for hiring more primary school teachers and
police officers, underwriting Middle East peace agreements and
finally paying $351 million of $926 million withheld by Congress in
dues the United States owes the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed to provide $12.8 billion over five years to
teaching hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers
who were suffering financially from cuts in Medicare imposed by
Congress in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The 84 Republicans voting no were protesting spending increases
won by the White House for programs like foreign aid and
environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
   The 51 Democrats who voted no, a quarter of their party in the
House, split with the president over the compromises the White
House made in its final negotiations with the Republicans. Some
rebelled over restrictions Republicans sought on aid to
international family planning groups in exchange for freeing up the
back dues owed the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to a ban on using such aid to promote abortions
to free nearly $1 billion that the United States owes the United
Nations. He can waive the restrictions, but then $12.5 million in
federal grants to women's health groups would be shifted to a
children's fund.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Angry at this trade-off, 19 House Democrats who are women
demanded that the White House make amends. Steve Ricchetti, a
deputy White House chief of staff, told them on Thursday that the
administration would ask Congress next year for more than $500
million in grants for the groups.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats protested what they called bookkeeping tricks
that allowed Republicans to claim that they had protected Social
Security surpluses. The Congressional Budget Office says the bills
dip at least $17 billion into the retirement reserves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The final deal, agreed to early Thursday morning, included some
of this sort of sleight of hand, such as delaying the last payday
of next September for Pentagon personnel and some civilian
government employees so it falls in the next fiscal year. That
saves no money, but eliminates expenditures in the 2000 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``These accounting gimmicks may appear to be funny,'' said Rep.
David Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee. ``But they're corrosive of democracy and
of our role in it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was not ready to pass the bill. with three Democratic
senators threatening to hold it hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., threatened to hold back the continuing
resolution over a law, stripped from the final spending package,
which would have required satellite television companies to carry
local stations in rural regions. When the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott of Mississippi, promised him the Senate would take up
such a measure by April, he relented.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., rose. He had threatened to block
any bill _ including a continuing resolution and the final budget
package _ over language in the spending bills that he said favored
dairy farmers in the East and hurt his state's milk producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the options we have is to vote against a continuing
resolution which would in effect shut down the government at
midnight, which is something I have considered,'' he said. ``It's
not a step that I'm going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering was necessary because Congress was operating
under a 24-hour continuing resolution, its sixth of the year, which
kept the agencies covered by the spending bills running without a
real budget. But the instant passage of a continuing keeping the
agencies going until Dec. 2 alleviated that problem.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will soon take up the final budget package, that
includes five separate bills in one:
</P>
<P>
   _ A $315 billion measure for the Departments of Health and Human
Services, Labor and Education. Of that sum, $229 billion is for
mandatory programs that Congress must finance, like Medicare and
Medicaid. The rest, $86 billion, is for programs like medical
research, special education and job training.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $39 billion measure for the Commerce, Justice and State
Departments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two $15 billion bills, one for the Interior Department, one
for foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $429 million bill for the District of Columbia. Added to the
bill was a $576 million emergency measure for the flood victims of
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the continuing resolution does not mean that the battles in
the Senate are over. Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, dean of
Senate Democrats, took the floor on Thursday night with a
three-page amendment in hand, seeking to protect his state's coal
miners from a court ruling ordering them to stop dumping debris
from mountainside strip mines into valley streams. He sought to
attach it to any legislation he could, including one of three
continuing resolutions then being considered. The White House had
threatened to veto any bill containing an earlier version of his
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate met into the night it had not adopt his amendment
so far, but Byrd seemed certain to continue his efforts.

AN INQUIRY FINDS ROE IMPERSONATING CAVIAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Conn.)  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine paying $75 for a one-ounce tin of Russian beluga caviar,
fresh from the belly of a giant sturgeon caught in the Caspian Sea.
If someone substituted roe from the prosaic American paddlefish, a
habitue of the Mississippi River whose eggs go for around $10 an
ounce, you would know the difference, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, according to federal prosecutors in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday a grand jury indicted three people associated with a
large Maryland wholesaler on charges of substituting paddlefish and
hackleback roe and other mislabeled fish eggs for authentic beluga
and sevruga caviar for sale to customers like American Airlines and
Fresh Fields, the natural foods chain that advertises its premium
quality.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accused the people of participating in an
elaborate four-year conspiracy by falsifying documents to sell
cheaper U.S. roe as Russian and Azerbaijani caviar and smuggling
authentic caviar into the country to avoid customs fees.
</P>
<P>
   Those charged were Hossein Lolavar, 45, president and owner of
U.S. Caviar &AMP; Caviar in Rockville, Md.; his sales manager, Faye
Briggs, 52; and Ken Noroozi, 41, a food importer and Lolavar's
brother-in-law. Lolavar and Ms. Briggs face up to five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine on each of 22 charges, and Noroozi faces
those penalties on each of six counts. All three were freed on bail
after surrendering their passports in U.S. District Court in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Philip L. Kellogg, the lawyer for Lolavar and the company, which
was also charged, said he could not comment on the substance of the
accusations. But he did say: ``When all the smoke clears, there are
no victims. Nobody got sick. No customer has ever complained. No
customer has ever sued them, saying they did not get proper
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Stofer, seafood coordinator for Fresh Fields' mid-Atlantic
region, said none of the chain's customers had complained about the
roe or returned it. In fact, Stofer learned of the charges while
attending a seafood tasting outside Philadelphia, where he said he
preferred paddlefish roe to Russian sevruga caviar.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, which helped investigate the case, said there was a
serious side to the profusion of black market caviar.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998 sturgeon were listed as a protected species under
a conservation treaty in an effort to stop the illegal flow and to
monitor legitimate fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The demand is greatest in the United States, the world's leading
importer of caviar. More than 80 tons of caviar, with a retail
value of $10 million, is imported legally each year. And uncounted
additional amounts come in illegally, officials say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two men connected with a Stamford, Conn., company that
distributed caviar to New York stores and restaurants were
convicted in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn this month on charges
of smuggling millions of dollars worth of caviar into the country,
some of it in luggage on commercial flights from Poland to Kennedy
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maryland case, prosecutors said the defendants imported
18,720 pounds of caviar, which the wholesaler claimed to be
Russian, from the United Arab Emirates in 1998 alone. Certificates
attesting to the authenticity of the caviar were actually
manufactured in the company's Rockville offices and stamped with a
seal that appeared to be Russian, according to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Caviar seized from the company was subjected to DNA testing,
which officials say can reveal whether a single egg is in fact the
grade, provenance and variety identified on its label.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also charged Lolavar and Ms. Briggs with

OVERSEAS BOX OFFICE RECEIPTS TOP $1 BILLION, CLOSE IN ON RECORD

   BURBANK -- With more than six weeks left in 1999, Walt Disney
Co.'s international box office receipts have topped $1 billion for
the fifth consecutive year, extending its industry record.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Buena Vista International operation crossed the
milestone Sunday, giving it a shot at topping its all-time mark of
$1.25 billion in 1997. 20th Century Fox posted the best-ever mark
last year with $1.95 billion, mostly due to ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' made the biggest contribution of 39 films with
$160.7 million overseas, followed by ``Enemy of the State'' with
$114.1 million, ``Runaway Bride'' with $110 million, ``Tarzan''
with $100 million, ``Armageddon'' with $82.9 million and ``The
Sixth Sense'' with $75 million. ``Tarzan,'' Disney's eighth
consecutive animated movie to top $100 million overseas, and
``Sense'' are still playing in major markets.
</P>
<P>
   Still due to contribute this year are ``Toy Story 2'' and Arnold
Schwarzenegger's ``End of Days.'' ``Runaway Bride'' was handled
domestically by Paramount and ``End of Days'' will be released in
the United States by Universal.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which also hit $1 billion overseas in 1997, is the only
other studio to achieve back-to-back years at the 10-figure mark.
Sony hit $1.25 billion in 1997 and Warner Bros. reached $1.07
billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is also within $25 million of going past $1 billion
domestically this year for the fifth time in six years while Warner
is $85 million away and Universal needs $150 million more.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic box office is 8 percent ahead of last year and
should finish around $7.5 billion. The National Association of
Theater Owners issued a forecast this week that 1999 admissions
will hit 1.6 billion, up from 1.48 billion last year. &QL;

PROFIT NEWS AND SPINOFF SEND HEWLETT SHARES UP SHARPLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares of Hewlett-Packard jumped 17 percent
Thursday, one day after the company posted stronger-than-expected
quarterly earnings, set an aggressive sales goal for next year and
began spinning off its test and measurement business.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard shares closed at $94.3125, up $13.3125, on the
New York Stock Exchange. Shares in Agilent, the test and
measurement business that Hewlett-Packard is spinning off, were up
$12.50, at $42.50, in their first day of trading, also on the Big
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard sold 72 million Agilent shares at $30 each on
Wednesday in the largest initial stock sale by a Silicon Valley
company and the ninth largest by a U.S. company this decade. The
sale represented a 15 percent stake and was $1 billion larger than
originally expected. Hewlett-Packard plans to distribute the
remaining shares to its shareholders next year.
</P>
<P>
   Of 21 analysts reporting to First Call/Thomson Financial, seven
raised their recommendations on Hewlett-Packard shares Thursday,
with four going to strong buy. The consensus estimate for the first
quarter of fiscal 2000 jumped to 78 cents from 73 cents, with the
full-year estimate moving to $3.37 from $3.27.
</P>
<P>
   After warning last month of an earnings shortfall,
Hewlett-Packard reported results on Wednesday that beat analysts'
revised estimates by 2 cents, not including charges related to the
spinoff of Agilent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Carleton S. Fiorina, who joined Hewlett-Packard in
July as president and chief executive, said in a conference call
with securities analysts that she was setting a goal for fiscal
year 2000 of 12 percent to 15 percent growth in sales and profit.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they liked what they heard on the call, referring
not only to Ms. Fiorina's ambitious goals, but to
stronger-than-expected sales of printers and high-end servers.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's PC business was strong and would have been
stronger had it not been constrained by component shortages caused
by the earthquake in Taiwan. Furthermore, she told the analysts,
the Hewlett operation was profitable, unlike some other
large-volume makers of personal computers. Storage systems also
have room for sales growth, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like this organization is clearly not broken,'' said
John B. Jones Jr., an analyst with Solomon Smith Barney. ``It's not
firing on all its cylinders yet, but Fiorina is aggressively
focusing them on segments of the market that can produce as much as
15 percent growth, or even higher, as they kick in,'' he said.
``Looking at the growth rate at other PC companies, or Sun
Microsystems, you can make the case that if she really fixes it,
there's a lot more upside here than 15 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most analysts, Jones could not comment on Agilent because
of his firm's involvement in the offering, but he said its success
probably helped increase investor confidence in Hewlett-Packard as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of confusion about how to value the Agilent
part,'' he said. ``It wasn't included in anyone's numbers and
people were trying to figure out how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said the
shares were due for a recovery after being overly beaten down in
response to the earlier warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What ended up happening is they did beat a number that had
been talked down,'' she said. ``But the stock had cratered, and
there were a lot of money managers who were underweighted on
Hewlett-Packard.''

HOUSE APPROVES $385 BILLION SPENDING PACKAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House gave its overwhelming approval Thursday
to a final $385 billion spending package for the 2000 fiscal year,
ending nearly seven weeks of contentious negotiations with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But a dispute over dairy price controls, coal mine waste dumping
regulations and rural loan guarantees for satellite television
ventures threatened to hold up passage in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators were so angry over not getting their loan, dairy
and mining concerns addressed in the final bill that they sought to
block consideration of a temporary spending measure that would keep
government offices open until the Senate holds its final vote on
the budget and adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   But after some last-minute deal-making promising that their
concerns would be addressed in future legislation, the lawmakers
dropped their objections and the Senate joined the House in
approving a seventh stopgap measure to keep the government
operating through Dec. 2, if necessary. The last temporary spending
extension, known as a continuing resolution, was to expire at
midnight Thursday, and another extension was necessary to continue
funding seven government departments.
</P>
<P>
   The deal cleared the way for the Senate to take up the budget
package containing the last five of the 13 annual government
appropriations measures, and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., said he was hopeful a final vote would be held Saturday or
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said he was prepared to
filibuster the final bill unless federal dairy price controls
favoring eastern and southern producers are changed.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote earlier of 296-135 in favor of the package came
after Clinton and Republican leaders signed off on the final
details of how to pay for increased spending in some programs
without tapping the Social Security Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Democratic and Republican leaders all hailed the final
bill as a winner for the country and for their own political
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget is a victory, and a hard-won victory, for the
American people,'' Clinton told reporters in Turkey, where he was
meeting with European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing ... is that we didn't dip into the
Social Security trust fund,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill. ``It changed the way that this town does business and it
probably will put an indelible mark on how this country will see
its fiscal and financial future.''
</P>
<P>
   Even House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., offered limited
praise for the bill. He had indicated only a few days ago that he
might not support it. But he ended up encouraging his Democratic
colleagues to vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This package has a lot of good in it, it has a lot of bad in
it. But on balance it has more to recommend it than not,'' Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote brought an end to months of intense political
wrangling over what to do with the first budget surplus in 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Congress, with Clinton's blessing, cobbled together
a $1.8 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 that includes about $610
billion in discretionary spending beyond the federally mandated
allocations for Social Security, welfare and other benefit
programs. The discretionary spending, including money Clinton
wanted for hiring new teachers and police officers, supporting the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and paying U.S. dues owed to the
United Nations, came in at about $30 billion more than the spending
limits Congress and the president set in 1997 for the 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that $30 billion was added by Republicans before they
even entered negotiations with Clinton early last month, hoping to
shut off further demands from the president for additional money.
But during the negotiations, they ended up giving him nearly $6
billion in additional funding, although they forced him to accept
several creative ways of paying for it to avoid siphoning off the
money from Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial cost-saving measures was an 0.38
percent across-the-board cut in federal spending, which will save
$1.3 billion. But in agreeing to the cut, which he had vowed to
fight only two weeks ago, Clinton won the right to implement it in
a way that is not expected to hurt important programs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton also agreed with Republicans to delay a
military pay day scheduled for Sept. 30 next year until Oct. 1, the
start of the 2001 fiscal year. That maneuver is expected to save
$3.5 billion by moving the payout, which includes a raise for
military and some civil service personnel, into the next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to find more cash to pay for Year 2000
programs, Clinton also agreed to expediting the transfer of $3.7
billion from Federal Reserve private accounts to the U.S. treasury.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to increased spending for some of his favored
programs, Clinton also prevailed in having a number of
anti-regulatory provisions removed from the bill that he believed
would have been harmful to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was an amendment that would have allowed West
Virginia coal mining operations to continue razing moutaintops and
dumping the wastes into nearby streams and valleys in violation of
court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans got a lot out of the negotiations as well,
including a provision limiting the amount of money the
administration can give to international organizations that perform
or promote abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Although mostly symbolic, the provision will limit the amount of
money available to those organizations to $15 million from a pool
of about $385 million dedicated to foreign family assistance
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also succeeded in winning more flexibility for
the states in using federal education money for teacher training
and other needs.
</P>
<P>
   But they boasted primarily of fulfilling their pledge not use
Social Security surpluses to fund government programs. However, in
order to make that claim the Republicans employed a number of
accounting techniques in order not to count about $17 billion that
will be spent in 2000 as part of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office says the money will actually
come from the retirement fund unless a revised analysis of federal
revenues scheduled for January shows a government surplus coming in
from non-Social Security sources.
</P>
<P>
   Although the budget package drew strong bipartisan support in
the House, some members complained about the creative accounting
they said was designed to ``cover up'' the Social Security
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill is replete with gimmicks. It contains $17 billion in
Social Security spending that simply won't be counted,'' said Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., who voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Other members who ended up opposing it complained before the
vote that they had simply not had time to read through the
2,000-page bill, which wasn't written up and distributed to members
until midday Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget contains who knows what,'' said Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee of Texas, who voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what is in it and what is out of it,'' she added,
holding up a copy that had some provisions blacked out and others
handwritten into the margins.
</P>
<P>
   Other members opposed the bill on grounds that it resembled, as
one lawmaker put it, ``a huge Christmas tree filled with ``big ugly
ornaments'' for special interests.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LUBBOCK _ The groundwork has been laid for a huge weekend of
sports, perhaps one of the biggest in the history of Texas Tech
University.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the competition will take place with a cloud over the new
basketball arena and the football program.
</P>
<P>
   The United Spirit Arena opens tonight when the Red Raiders host
Indiana and coach Bob Knight in a nationally televised (ESPN)
basketball game. The Lady Raiders, two-time defending Big 12
champions, follow Saturday night with the Four in the Fall Classic
doubleheader featuring UCLA, LSU and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But the $62 million arena comes with a price tag some have said
drained much-needed funds from the university's academic programs.
</P>
<P>
   The football team closes out the 1999 regular season Saturday
afternoon _ Parents Day _ against Oklahoma with a faint chance of
qualifying for a seventh consecutive trip to a bowl. And Wednesday,
Tech chancellor John T. Montford announced SBC Communications Inc.,
the parent company of Southwestern Bell, had donated $20 million
for the renovation of Jones Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the Thursday editions of the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal
sports section bore a blaring headline that indicated Tech athletic
administrators, according to unnamed sources, have been talking, or
intend to begin talks, with a Clemson assistant coach about
replacing football coach Spike Dykes, 61.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing so far has dampened the spirits of Tech athletic
director Gerald Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, this is the biggest weekend we've ever
had,'' he said. ``That arena opening up, that's something we've
been looking forward to for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sold out for Indiana; the football game, we're expecting
over 40 (thousand); we've got a chance to set an all-time
attendance record, average per game. We've got a lot of out-of-town
people coming in for the arena, the football game, and the Lady
Raiders the next night.''
</P>
<P>
   While not a sellout, Myers said he anticipates the new
15,000-seat arena will be full when Marsha Sharp leads the Lady
Raiders onto the floor for the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a big weekend for Texas Tech athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that varsity basketball at Tech would move out of
ancient, leaky, drafty Memorial Coliseum into a new arena have
circulated for almost as long as James Dickey has coached the
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's real excited,'' said Dickey, entering his 10th
season. ``We really felt like we needed a new facility. The
Coliseum has been good to the university, but it was time after
about 40 years (to move). We're real proud of the United Spirit
Arena; it's a special place. And we're hoping to create a lot of
great excitement and memories in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But certainly, Indiana is a tough home opener.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hoosiers are 3-0 all-time against the Raiders. And Knight is
the winningest active NCAA Division I coach with 743 victories.
</P>
<P>
   But the basketball assignment is no tougher than that facing
Dykes and the Red Raiders in the regular-season finale. The
Oklahoma Sooners and passing sensation Josh Heupel bring a 6-3
record (4-2 in the Big 12) into Jones Stadium on Saturday. Oklahoma
averages 37 points per game and, on the strength of Heupel, is
ranked among the nation's top 10 in passing.
</P>
<P>
   But it might not be the Sooners or their quarterback that is the
biggest hurdle for the Raiders. The last three weeks have been
filled with rumors that Dykes would resign or be asked to leave at
season's end.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche-Journal reported a school had contacted Clemson
officials for permission to talk with offensive coordinator Rich
Rodriguez about a head coaching job. According to the
Avalanche-Journal's sources, the school was Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, formerly offensive coordinator at Tulane, has
declined to talk about job possibilities until after the Tigers'
season finale at South Carolina on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, citing school practice that was reiterated by Montford,
wouldn't confirm or deny contact with Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to say the same thing that I told (the
Avalanche-Journal),'' Myers said. ``We're going to address all of
these things at the end (of the season). We're not going to address
any rumors or any speculation or anything. That's basically what
the administration, the board, everybody else (has said) when all
these things started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll address it when the season's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers said Thursday's report disturbed Dykes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it made him feel too good,'' he said. ``He's
trying to finish up the season. It's definitely a distraction to
the players. Nobody's said anything to the players. I think it's a
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good does it do? I guess you create some interest. But
you've got a coach who's trying to finish up a season, has a chance
to qualify for a bowl. You don't have to talk to (the players)
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers also shot down speculation that cost overruns of a
reported $10 million on the new arena had forced the athletic
department to siphon funds from other areas of the university
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' he said. ``It's not anything I know about.
None of those funds, as far as I know, and I pretty well know,
affected any academic buildings or anything else. That's absolutely
wrong. We're responsible for paying the bonds on the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers said it is illegal for state funds not allocated for
athletic expenditure to be taken from another area of the
university's operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't spend (state) money on athletic facilities,''
Myers said. ``We have to generate our own from the private sector,
ticket sales, marketing, TV, radio, conference revenues. You just
can't do it. You can't use state funds to build athletic
facilities. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what Dykes chooses to do remains the subject for
speculation. A decision will be made, Dykes said, after he conducts
a personal evaluation and the athletic administration conducts a
routine postseason re-evaluation of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what happens, if he wants to step down or
whatever happens, I'd like for him to feel good about it, and to
treat him right,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior quarterback Rob Peters said he's disappointed the
injury-plagued Raiders (5-5, 4-3) haven't fared better. But he's
more upset over the way the football world in West Texas has
treated Dykes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that's happened to him. Coach Dykes has done a
great job here,'' said Peters, who will sit out Saturday's game
because of a concussion. ``I don't think people really realize what
he's done for this program. He's taken us to another level where
we're competitive every year. We've got a chance to win every year,
every game. We didn't have that before he got here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that people are kind of wishing him out. And I
think once he's gone, people will realize how much they would like
to have him back.'' &QL;

U.S. TRADE GAP APPEARS TO BE STABILIZING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trade deficit appears to be stabilizing as foreign economic
growth picks up and the voracious American demand for imported
goods and services slows, Commerce Department figures showed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While the gap by which imports outpace exports widened in
September, to $24.4 billion, the third biggest on record, analysts
said it would have narrowed for the second consecutive month had it
not been for the surging price of imported oil and an off month for
exports of aircraft, which tend to occur in bunches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really seen some improvement'' since the deficit peaked
at $24.9 billion in July, said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of
Goldman, Sachs International and a former trade official in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He added that while the jump in oil prices would tend to mask
this trend in coming months, the United States was well positioned
to supply high-technology products to developing and newly
industrialized countries that are increasingly able to afford them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the deficit with China in September inched up
to $6.9 billion from $6.87 billion. This provides ammunition to
those in Congress who oppose the agreement reached Monday under
which China is to lower barriers to American exports in return for
support of its application for membership in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, including Hormats, counter that such large
imbalances show how important it is that Chinese markets be opened
and that China be admitted to the world trade group, which sets the
rules for international trade.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the amount of what the United States bought from
China was 6.3 times what it sold to China, up from 5.9 times in
September 1998. Exports to China edged up just $100 million, to
$1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit with Japan climbed to $6.6 billion in
September from $6.4 billion, with American purchases 2.5 times its
sales compared with 2.1 times in the month a year earlier. Exports
were virtually unchanged at $4.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Noland, senior fellow at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington, said the deficit with Japan, whose economy
is still weak, would most likely expand in coming months until
higher prices slow Japanese exports.
</P>
<P>
   But he called trade adjustment elsewhere in Asia on track.
``Those economies are pulling out of their recessions,'' Noland
said, referring particularly to Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, American exports amounted to $81.7 billion in
September, $700 million less than the record set in August. The
biggest factor was a $900 million decline in capital goods, which
the Commerce Department said consisted primarily of civilian
aircraft. By contrast, agricultural sales, which have been
depressed, rebounded to the highest level in almost two years, and
consumer goods also sold better in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Imports edged up to a record $106.1 billion, $700 million more
than in August, despite a $400 million decline in foreign motor
vehicles and parts. This is in sharp contrast to the first nine
months of the year, when automotive imports surged 22.5 percent,
compared with figures in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Swamping this was a huge rise in the nation's bill for imported
oil, a $6.8 billion jump reflecting higher volume as well as higher
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's deficit with the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries jumped to a record $3 billion in September from
$2.7 billion in August.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent stabilization, the American trade deficit so
far this year totals $191.6 billion, or 58 percent more than the
deficit in the period a year earlier. It is on a path to reach $255
billion.
</P>
<P>
   While this is already a record number of dollars, the deficit in
the past has represented a larger share of the American economy, a
more accurate measure of its importance. In 1987, the last time the
trade deficit set a record before this summer, it accounted for 3.3
percent of gross domestic product; it now represents 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report also showed that the deficit with Western
Europe shrank to $3.5 billion from $4.4 billion, while that with
Canada fell to $2.9 billion from $3.3 billion. The deficit with
Mexico was unchanged at $2.2 billion. Unlike the aggregate figures,
comparisons with individual countries are not adjusted for
recurring seasonal variations.

BROTHER'S SEARCH FOR HIS TWIN REVEALED HER MURDER AS A CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andre Carmichael always suspected he had a twin.
</P>
<P>
   There were old stories drifting through his family's lore about
a sister his own age, and there were troubling visions he sometimes
had of the child _ ``a baby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So in early October, filled with questions, Carmichael
approached the one sister he knew he had, Sabrina Carmichael, and
asked about the girl. At first, Sabrina denied there was a twin, he
said. But when Carmichael told her he would never give up his
search, she burst into tears and confessed a secret she had guarded
fearfully for 20 years: she said that in 1979, when she was 8 years
old, she had witnessed their mother and older brother beating their
3-year-old sister, Latanisha, to death.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn district attorney's office on Thursday charged the
mother, Madeline Carmichael, and the older brother, Gregory
Carmichael, with second-degree murder. They were also charged with
hindering a prosecution and tampering with physical evidence,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carmichael, 60, was arraigned Thursday in her bed at
Brooklyn Hospital, where she was admitted for chest pains last
week, and will undergo a psychiatric examination to determine if
she is fit to stand trial, the authorities said. Gregory
Carmichael, 37, was arraigned in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn
and remanded to the Cape Vincent Correctional Facility near the
Canadian border, where he is serving a two- to four-year sentence
for robbery.
</P>
<P>
   As Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes presented the
indictments Thursday, he said the case was ``straight out of a
Stephen King novel.'' Many of the macabre details were released
after Mrs. Carmichael's arrest Nov. 6, but the stunning revelation
that one of her daughters claims to have actually watched her
murder another has provided a fuller picture of the family drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double loss,'' Andre Carmichael said Thursday outside
the Harlem homeless shelter where he lives _ ``discovering the
death of my sister and the fact that I'll never have a relationship
with my mother. I have nothing to say to her anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The story began to unravel about a month ago, when Carmichael
finally decided to visit his mother for the first time since he was
put into foster care at the age of 9. But he said he was
disappointed when his mother recoiled at the sight of his own
3-year-old daughter, Andrea, who was with him.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, his disappointment turned into shock when an aunt
told him that his mother had blanched because his own daughter bore
a strong resemblance to his twin sister, who had vanished 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the legend at least partly confirmed, Carmichael confronted
his sister, Sabrina, learned of what she had seen, and, with her,
called police.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes said investigators from the New York Police Department's
Cold Case Squad obtained a search warrant for Mrs. Carmichael's
apartment in Brownsville, Brooklyn and knocked on her door late in
the evening on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, Mrs. Carmichael dashed toward a closet
in her apartment when police arrived, screaming: ``Please don't let
them take me. I don't want any more suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Police opened the closet and found Latanisha's body inside. The
body was swaddled in a baby blanket, placed in four plastic bags,
wrapped in yellowing newspaper dated Nov. 4, 1979, and hidden in a
cedar-lined footlocker, Hynes said. That locker was found in a
scuffed, rusting steamer trunk, which had been wrapped in
cellophane and left in the closet surrounded by piles of air
fresheners, camphor cakes, baking soda boxes and incense sticks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings County Medical Examiner conducted an autopsy on the
body this week and ruled Latanisha Carmichael's death a homicide,
Hynes said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Latanisha's disappearance had gone unnoticed for so
long because Mrs. Carmichael kept to herself after sending Sabrina
and Andre to foster homes in 1988 and telling relatives that she
was too poor to care for the girl and had sent her to ``live down
South.''
</P>
<P>
   Hynes said the city's former children's services department, the
Child Welfare Agency, was also at fault. He said Gregory and
Madeline Carmichael had abused all three children in the house _
Latanisha, Sabrina and Andre _ and had a long history of child
abuse complaints registered against them by schoolteachers and
caseworkers who knew the Carmichael children.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, once the police began to investigate the case, city
child welfare workers went back to old handwritten files and
discovered that at least eight complaints against Gregory and
Madeline Carmichael had been lodged from 1982 to 1988, said
Nicholas Scoppetta, commissioner of the city's Administration for
Children's Services.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Carmichael said he planned to file a lawsuit against
the city, charging that officials had allowed his twin sister to
fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city failed her,'' he said. ``I blame my mother, but I
also blame the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Carmichael still lives in a homeless shelter and works as
a security guard to support his daughter, his wife and her four
children, he said he wants to open a center for abused children one
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to try to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone
else,'' he said. ``I don't want any more kids to suffer like we
did.''

UCLA WARY OF USC'S SPEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sure, USC has a propensity for penalties,
squandering second-half leads and faltering in the face of its
crosstown rival.
</P>
<P>
   But the Trojans also have the great equalizer _ speed _ and
nothing scares UCLA's beleaguered secondary more than the prospect
of receivers R. Jay Soward and Kareem Kelly turning 10-yard passes
into 70-yard touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at their receivers' ability to make big plays with
the run and catch,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``Speed will be
very important to the game, and they have a lot of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have not seen speed like they'll see Saturday. Ohio
State isn't as fast as USC. Neither is Oregon State or Oregon or
Arizona. One stumble, one missed tackle could mean a USC touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really fast, and that's something that has given us
trouble,'' Bruins safety Joey Strycula said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way the Bruins can simulate USC's speed in practice,
but there are two ways to neutralize it:
</P>
<P>
   _Pressure quarterback John Fox. The more time he has, the more
time Kelly, Soward and Windrell Hayes have to run past the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blitz every down,'' UCLA defensive coordinator Bob
Field said. ``But if the quarterback's got all day, and he's got
fast receivers, that's a bad combination.''
</P>
<P>
   _Play conservatively. The Bruins probably will play a few steps
off the receivers and force USC to move the ball 5 yards at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be smart,'' Strycula said. ``We can't bite on the
hitch routes. We can't let them beat us deep.''
</P>
<P>
   How they stand: Safety Lovell Houston, who has started the last
three games, won't play because of a concussion suffered against
Washington. Sophomore Julius Williams, a converted cornerback, will
replace him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting ready as best I can so that hopefully I can step
in for Lovell,'' Williams said. ``I know the defense, but I'm
concentrating on understanding the offensive situations a little
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve safety Jason Stephens is questionable because of a
strained groin. If he can't play, struggling senior Eric Whitfield
will relieve Williams. Freshman Audie Attar, who's improving
rapidly but has little experience, is Strycula's backup at strong
safety. Junior Jason Zdenek has been pulled off the scout team in
case the Bruins need a fifth safety.
</P>
<P>
   Missing man: He has not played a game all season, and his name
is rarely mentioned on Spaulding Field. But chances are the Bruins
will miss suspended cornerback Marques Anderson on Saturday like
they have not missed him this year.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has a load of talent; he's fast, strong and physical.
And the two best games he's ever played are against USC. In 1997,
after Soward burned Jason Bell for an 80-yard touchdown on the
opening series, Anderson contained Soward the rest of the game.
Last year, Anderson had five tackles and forced two fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marques always got up for playing the tough games and the best
receivers,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: As for the key to victory, Toledo said: ``We need
to sustain some drives and score some points, and we have to keep
from giving up big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks it will be a high-scoring game, Toledo added:
``No. It better not be, because we can't score much.''

DOCUMENTS SHOW THE CIA SAW TROUBLE COMING FOR GORBACHEV 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Declassified government documents show
that analysts at the CIA were deeply pessimistic about the chances
of success for President Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to reform the
Soviet Union's communist system even in the final days of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   CIA experts in the late 1980s and early 1990s came to believe
that Gorbachev was genuinely interested in reform, yet the agency
remained concerned that political instability could lead to a
return to hard-line communist rule or anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the CIA released 24
intelligence estimates Thursday that show how the agency sought,
sometimes far too cautiously, to keep up with the incredible pace
of events between 1988 and 1991. The declassified reports provide
insight into an enduring debate over whether the CIA really
``missed'' the collapse of the Soviet Union, as critics charged.
</P>
<P>
   The reports were declassified by the agency in conjunction with
a conference being held here on the role that U.S. intelligence
played in the final days of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the rapid changes in eastern Europe and in the Soviet
Union had caught the CIA off guard and forced the agency to focus
much more on political developments within the Soviet Union than it
had ever done before. In 1988, for example, the chief of Soviet
analysis at the CIA told Congress that the agency had ``never
really looked at the Soviet Union as a political entity in which
there were factors building which could lead to at least the
initiation of political transformation that we seem to see.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, late in 1988, the CIA suggested that Soviet weaknesses
gave the West a wedge to achieve ``marginal bargaining advantages''
in arms control talks, but not to expect true reform.
</P>
<P>
   By April 1989, however, the CIA wrote an analysis that included
an unusually large section devoted to dissenting views. Clearly,
the CIA was divided over how significant Gorbachev's reforms were.
Still the report concluded that the Soviet Union would remain an
adversary.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's analysts worried that Gorbachev's hold on power was
fragile, and that Moscow still had an enormous military even though
its economy was cratering.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1989, for example, even as the CIA had become
convinced that Gorbachev was sincere, it still told President Bush
that Gorbachev's chances of remaining in power were ``doubtful at
best.''
</P>
<P>
   By November 1990, even after eastern Europe had gone through a
peaceful liberation, a CIA report outlined ``nightmare scenarios''
that could lead to civil war or chaos in the Soviet Union. The
paper stated that ``the old communist order is in its death
throes,'' and that the crisis of perestroika was threatening to
``tear the country apart.''
</P>
<P>
   That estimate seemed to overstate the extent to which a poor
economy was leading to unrest and a breakdown of political
authority, a new CIA history noted this week.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1991, the CIA found that ``anti-communist forces are
breaking down the Soviet empire and its system of governance,'' and
it listed conditions in which die-hards might move to reassert
control ``with or without Gorbachev.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in July 1991, the agency reported that ``the USSR is in the
midst of a revolution that probably will sweep the Communist Party
from power and reshape the country within the five-year time frame
of this estimate.'' The CIA was far too cautious. The next month,
the Soviet Union went out of business.

VENUS WILLIAMS DOESN'T LET NET OR OPPONENT GET IN HER WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Call it youthful exuberance, gamesmanship or a dollop
of showboating custom made for Madison Square Garden and its
partisan crowd: Venus Williams, turbo-charged at finding herself
three points from her first Chase Championships semifinal, indulged
a whim and leapfrogged over the net Thursday night as she and her
cowed opponent, Barbara Schett, switched sides for the first and
last time in their lopsided second-set tie breaker.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-seeded Schett took the conventional path around the
net. But Williams, in lift-off mode this week for her Chase debut,
took a more direct route. After she hurdled the net, she won the
next three points of the tie breaker, converting her first match
point by provoking a backhand return into the net from Schett, and
raised her arms to applaud the crowd, herself and her 6-4, 7-6
(7-2) victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like going around,'' Williams said of her flight
over the net. ``It seemed like such a long way to walk around, so I
was going to jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Schett, unable to beat the third-ranked American in all four of
their confrontations, chose not to find Williams' nimble maneuver
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she tried to impress me or something; I don't know,''
Schett said. ``But it's entertaining for the people. It's good. If
I would be as tall as her, I probably could do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Schett's mood was less than downcast after the loss, thanks to
some imminent vacation plans. Her season over, she intended to be
on Friday morning's first flight to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   As a favorite sparring partner of Steffi Graf during her final
year on the circuit, Schett was accustomed to dealing with baseline
power, but that did not give her the ability to consistently
counteract Williams' arsenal in this 1-hour-20-minute quarterfinal.
Her return was the shot that lost her the match, and not just at
match point: she earned only one break point against Williams'
serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's serving very well; it's very fast and I can't really
read it,'' Schett said. ``I had big troubles with her first serve.
Even her second serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams broke for a 4-3 edge in the first set and converted it
with a service winner. In the second, Schett kept up with her until
the tie breaker, then faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Schett opened the tie breaker by double-faulting and buried a
backhand in the net to set Williams up for her leap over the net at
4-2. The winner said she missed getting to prowl the city shopping
scene with her fourth-seeded sister, Serena, who withdrew Monday
with a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a rivalry,'' Williams said, as she cradled her
other best friend, her miniature Yorkshire terrier, Pete. But she
did not go so far as to wish her little sister back into this
event. ``It's good for everyone, I guess. They don't have to worry
about fighting against Serena. And I don't have to worry about
fighting against Serena.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's tough. Little sisters are mean,'' she said, paraphrasing
the post-match comment she had made to her sister just after having
been dethroned by her last month in Munich at the Grand Slam Cup
final.
</P>
<P>
   Williams indicated that, sister or no sister, she intended to
acquit herself impressively at this final tournament on the 1999
calendar, an event where she might rise to a career-best second in
the world if she can subdue its defending champion, top-ranked
Martina Hingis, in the semifinals and go on to claim the title.
Thursday night, Hingis encountered minimal resistance from
fifth-seeded Mary Pierce, and advanced, 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this year, in the middle of the year, I was suffering
from not being able to win my tough matches, which is not like
me,'' said Williams, who is 5-8 against Hingis, but victorious in
their last two matches. ``So now I'm doing better with that.''

U.S. SEEKS MURDERED STOCK PROMOTER'S ACCOUNTS

   NEW YORK _ Investigators are examining whether there is a link
between the deaths of two stock promoters found shot in a New
Jersey home in October and an account that one of the men may have
had at a small Manhattan stock trading firm that recently closed
its doors.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors investigating the killings served subpoenas
last week on Harbor Securities, seeking records that may indicate
whether Albert Alain Chalem had been trading there. Chalem was
killed the evening of Oct. 25 in his home in Colts Neck, N.J.,
along with Maier Lehmann, his partner in a Web site that promoted
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   According to several people who have worked at Harbor, Chalem
had been trading from home under an assumed name and had lost a lot
of money, some of which belonged to other people.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview earlier this month, Warren Sulmasy, Harbor's
president, denied that Chalem had had an account or any other
business relationship with the firm. He has not returned telephone
calls this week.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Chalem and the subpoenas, Thomas McCabe, a lawyer
for Sulmasy, would say only that Harbor is out of business. The
firm, at 5 Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan, had catered to the
self-employed speculators known as day traders.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are now analyzing the trading and business records
of an account at Harbor to see if they can tie it to Chalem. Among
the links is that the mailing address for the account was in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., where Chalem had a second home.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, at least one small stock that had been traded in the
account had been recommended on Chalem's Web site,
stockinvestor.com. Chalem was also known to have been involved in
the formation of another tiny company whose stock was traded in the
account last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The account suffered losses of about $800,000 in April,
according to people who have seen the firm's trading records, and
money was later moved out of the account.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are examining whether Chalem had secret accounts
at several brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Chalem turns out to have traded at Harbor, the
firm had troubles of its own. In October, it had suffered a big
trading loss unrelated to Chalem that put it in violation of
regulations on financial soundness.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators, who briefly closed Harbor because of financial
concerns late last month, continue to investigate the firm's
financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we discovered a problem, we effectively suspended
trading for 48 hours and sent in an auditor,'' said Meyer Frucher,
chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, where Harbor was a
member.
</P>
<P>
   A larger Wall Street firm that had agreed to back Harbor's
trades also became concerned and, after examining Harbor's books,
withdrew its support, forcing Harbor to close its doors.

BOEING AGREES TO SETTLE CASE CHARGING BIAS IN SALARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boeing Co. has agreed to pay at least $4.5 million to women and
minority employees who the government says are paid less than their
white male counterparts, according to people involved in the
settlement, the largest ever under a Labor Department affirmative
action compliance program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing agreed to examine the pay of all its
nonunion employees _ accounting for about half of its 202,000
workers _ over the next four years and make further adjustments if
it found evidence of pay disparities based on a formula agreed upon
with the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was signed Thursday and is expected to be
announced Friday. The deal comes after several months of legal
jousting between the Labor Department and Boeing and after the
settlement of a class-action discrimination suit against the
company.
</P>
<P>
   But Labor Department officials are praising Boeing for its
willingness to go further than any other company by agreeing to a
comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first agreement that obligates a federal
contractor to conduct self-examinations, make across-the-board
salary adjustments at every facility and then report its results to
the department,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said in draft
documents describing the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.5 million covers back pay and raises for about 4,400
women and 1,000 minority workers at 10 Boeing operations across the
country, the company said. Boeing said that it did not know
precisely how many of those employees would receive compensation
and that the $4.5 million could grow depending on its findings. One
Labor Department official described the figure as ``a floor, not a
ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal stems from investigations dating back to 1994 by the
Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs,
which audits the employment practices of companies that do business
with the federal government to ensure that they are complying with
federal antidiscrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Boeing did not acknowledge that it
engaged in discrimination. But it agreed that it did not meet the
Labor Department's standards for equal pay at some of its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   James B. Dagnon, Boeing's senior vice president in charge of
personnel, said that the settlement was a way for Boeing, which has
transformed itself with two multibillion-dollar acquisitions over
the last three years, to ensure that it was meeting its obligations
at all its far-flung operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have both agreed on the yardstick that is going to carry us
forward,'' he said. ``It is a yardstick we can live with and they
can judge us by.''
</P>
<P>
   Dagnon added that it was too early to determine how much money
the agreement would cost the company.
</P>
<P>
   Though the agreement is the largest so far for the Labor
Department, it is eclipsed by settlements of civil lawsuits
contending discrimination. Texaco, for example, settled such a
lawsuit in 1996 for $176 million.
</P>
<P>
   And in January Boeing agreed to pay $15 million to settle the
class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of minority workers who said
they were discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   Some Boeing workers subsequently challenged the settlement,
which was brokered by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. A judge approved the
deal in September, but his decision is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the Labor Department comes as something of a
surprise. In July, the department took the unusual step of suing
Boeing, which received $11 billion in government contracts last
year, after the company refused to meet its demands for employment
information at three of its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were later settled before they got to court, and
this agreement commits Boeing to begin compiling more data on job
applicants so that the Labor Department can better determine in the
future whether the company is discriminating against women and
minorities. Previously, Boeing kept records only of applicants who
were interviewed, not those who expressed interest in jobs and were
turned away.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing operations that will share in the $4.5 million are in
Philadelphia; Huntsville, Ala.; Tulsa, Okla.; Wichita, Kan.; Long
Beach, Calif.; Mesa, Ariz.; Stennis Miss., and Kingsville, Texas.

STUDENT'S FRANTIC CALL: `WE DON'T KNOW WHERE JOHN IS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM KIMBERLY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Eric Etheridge and John Comstock were
buddies from the Dallas suburb of Richardson, freshmen residents of
the same Aggie dorm and now co-workers on the growing Aggie
Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, they were assigned the grueling
midnight-to-6 a.m. shift, but they had grades to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge, 18, wanted to get some sleep before a test that
morning, and Comstock, 19, needed to study. They looked around to
see if they could sneak past the upperclassmen who were forever on
their case as they sat perched high in swings unloading logs that
were handed to them.
</P>
<P>
   About 2:30 a.m., Etheridge got down from the swing where he had
been handing logs over to workers on the stack. Comstock was still
up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and noticed it was leaning a lot. That's probably
when it started,'' Etheridge said. ``It just started to shift, then
there was a crash and then it fell.''
</P>
<P>
   The brightly lit site was suddenly dark. The light poles to
which guy wires were attached had been pulled by the toppling
stack.
</P>
<P>
   In the darkness, there were screams and cries.
</P>
<P>
   The senior members began to organize the students by dorms and
took a head count. At head count for Moses Hall, which had 19
residents at the site, Comstock was missing. He was trapped under
the logs.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge went back to his dorm along with other students and
called his mother: ``We don't know where John is.''
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge's mom called Comstock's mother, Dixie Edwards in
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards turned on the TV, and watched. ``I lost it, I thought he
was dead. I really thought he was dead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She called other mothers of classmates. At 7 a.m. she got a call
from Comstock's minister with Central Baptist Church. At 9 a.m. she
watched the rescue of a student, who had been administered
intravenous fluids even as he lay beneath the logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew it was him,'' she said. ``I didn't recognize him.
They had him all blanketed, but a mother knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening Comstock, a former soccer player for Dallas'
elite Jesuit High School, was at College Station Medical Center. He
had a broken arm and two broken legs, Etheridge said, and doctors
were trying to save his left foot.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ARLINGTON _ A string of Gold Gloves speaks to sustained excellence.
A reputation for embarrassing even the best of baserunners precedes
him as well.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even so, Thursday was special. At the end of his finest season,
Texas Rangers catcher Ivan ``Pudge'' Rodriguez could add one more
distinction to his glittering list of accomplishments _ that of
being honored as the 1999 American League Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the award players dream of always,'' Rodriguez said at
a late-afternoon news conference at the Ballpark in Arlington. ``It
finally came true.''
</P>
<P>
   Not by much. In balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association
of America, Rodriguez actually drew fewer first-place votes (8-7)
than runner-up Pedro Martinez, the brilliant Boston Red Sox pitcher
who already had picked up the AL Cy Young Award after finishing
23-4 with a 2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, however, finished with 252 total points to 239 for
Martinez, in part because two of the 28 voters _ George King of the
New York Post and La Velle Neal of the Minneapolis Star Tribune _
refused to list Martinez among their top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was the closest since 1996, when then-Ranger Juan
Gonzalez won the first of his two MVP awards in a 290-287 decision
over Seattle's Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Counting Gonzalez's 1998 MVP, this makes three times in the past
four seasons that a Ranger has won the AL MVP _ despite the fact
that the club has lost its last nine postseason games and has never
advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rodriguez enjoyed his best season, hitting .332 with 35
homers and 113 RBIs. That was the highest average for an AL catcher
since the Yankees' Bill Dickey hit .362 in 1936, and Rodriguez
became the first AL catcher to hit .300 and surpass 100 in both
runs scored (115) and RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   He threw out 39 of 72 would-be base stealers (54 percent), a
success rate that led all major-league catchers for the fifth
straight year. With 25 steals, he also became the first catcher
with more than 20 homers and more than 20 steals in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've recognized that he's been the best catcher in baseball
in all the previous awards that he's won,'' Rangers general manager
Doug Melvin said. ``This kind of tops it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who earned a $250,000 bonus for winning the award as
part of his contract, credited Rangers hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo
with helping produce his best offensive season, and cited work with
a personal trainer as a major factor in avoiding the second-half
burnout that had been a problem in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rico native also grudgingly admitted that skipping
winter ball may have aided his stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``In September, I always got a little bit tired,'' he said.
``This year, it was exactly the opposite. I felt stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Manny Ramirez and Roberto Alomar tied for third
place with four first-place votes and 226 points each. Rangers
designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro was next with four firsts and 193
total points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raffy's like my brother,'' Rodriguez said. ``He deserved the
MVP also. The way he played with a sore knee the whole year was
really something.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter was sixth, followed by Red Sox
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who just completed the second year of a five-year,
$42 million contract with the Rangers, expressed hope that he would
finish his career with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be here until I hang up my glove and say I don't
want to play no more,'' he said. ``This organization is special,
especially for the Latin players.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Gonzalez, no longer is around after being dealt to
the Detroit Tigers in a multi-player deal as the Rangers determined
they would not be willing to meet his salary demands when he
becomes a free agent after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Among the day's highlights for Rodriguez was a congratulatory
call from his old teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Any messages?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got two; I've got one,'' Rodriguez said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to enjoy this one for a little while now, and who
knows?''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Food and Drug Administration, while maintaining
that its policy regarding bioengineered foods is safe, opened the
first of three public meetings Thursday and was greeted with both
heated criticism and staunch support of genetically engineered
products.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and biotechnology industry officials argued Thursday
that the science behind genetically engineered crops was sound, and
that federal regulators had done an exemplary job in approving as
safe the introduction of such products in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of genetically engineered crops, which have been
endowed with abilities like producing higher yields or growing
their own insecticidal toxin, contend that the federal approval
process was inadequate. They also charge that the products have not
been proven to be entirely safe and could pose a danger to both
humans and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genetically engineered organisms released into the environment
pose risks that are potentially irreversible, untraceable and
uncontrollable,'' said Charles Margulis, a spokesman for the
environmental group Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   Bioengineered crops have been the subject of ferocious debate
for months in Europe, where public opposition to so-called GM foods
led to calls for additional research, labeling and even the banning
of such products altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Now environmental activists in this country have begun their own
effort to turn public opinion against such products, putting the
biotechnology industry on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by what they believe is a vicious public relations
campaign launched by a small group of environmental activists, the
biotechnology industry has been trying to mount its own campaign to
shore up confidence in a technology that it has spent billions of
dollars to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane E. Henney, the commissioner of food and drugs, led the
public meeting Thursday but said the agency would not comment on
the proceedings; it was in listening mode.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And listen it did. After a series of panels about the safety of
such products, the regulatory approval process and food labeling,
the FDA opened the floor to members of the public.
</P>
<P>
   The response was dozens of two-minute declarations for and
against bioengineered products delivered to a panel of about six
FDA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some speakers accused the FDA of being manipulated by giant
biotechnology companies bent on reaping billions.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Alexander, an activist, dismissed the notion that
traditional plant breeding was the near equivalent of genetic
engineering. ``Shooting a cassette of genes into a plant is not
like mating your best bull with your best cow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists, dieticians and industry officials said there
were tremendous benefits to be reaped from biotechnology, including
more nutritious foods, foods that can help fight disease, and crops
that do not require as much chemical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frankly puzzled by these allegations,'' said Jeffrey
Stein, an official at Novartis, a biotechnology company. ``I
contend that the charges that these products are unsafe are without
scientific merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Around lunchtime, about 80 activists rallied in Federal Plaza
here, holding signs that read, ``Dinner Shouldn't be a Science
Project'' and ``Fear the Genetically Engineered God.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a group of little girls, aged 2 to 7, dressed as
monarch butterflies danced near a man portraying a large stalk of
corn bioengineered to release genetically engineered pesticides.
All the children fell down, playing dead, on cue.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the biotechnology industry were also on hand,
dismissing what they termed the emotional ploys of their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence to support this stuff,'' said William
McLeod, a former director at the Federal Trade Commission and now
an attorney working with the Alliance for Better Foods, a
biotechnology group. ``What these guys are saying is that we should
go organic and take away our choice. They want to put worms back in
the food.''

RITE AID ANNOUNCES INQUIRY BY THE SEC INTO ACCOUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rite Aid Corp., the troubled drugstore chain, said Thursday that
the Securities and Exchange Commission had started a formal
investigation into its accounting practices and that its former
auditors resigned last week because they said they could no longer
believe management.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after the close of the stock market
Thursday, Rite Aid, which is based in Camp Hill, Pa., said it
intended to cooperate fully with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the resignation by the company's accounting firm,
KPMG International, and of the SEC investigation were laid out in a
Form 8-K filing with the SEC. Such filings are used to report
important events or corporate changes.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts said the disclosures came as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already been so surprised by the things going on there
that nothing is really shocking any more,'' said Mark Husson, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid's accounting problems stem from a three-year
acquisition binge that effectively doubled the size of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of the difficulties became apparent only
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   The company's results have fallen far short of Wall Street's
expectations, its results for the last three years are being
restated and its chief executive, the architect of its expansion,
has resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, the company warned analysts that it would fall far
short of quarterly earnings estimates, and then reported numbers
that were even weaker than it had led Wall Street to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Leonard I. Green, a Los Angeles investment banker who
is also a big Rite Aid shareholder, was named chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Rite Aid's stock price has plummeted since its
problems began to emerge. The stock, which in the last year has
traded as high as $51.125, closed Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange at $6.875, down 25 cents. The company is in the midst of a
search for a new permanent chief executive and chief financial
officer, posts it hopes to fill by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Finding capable candidates is proving difficult, Husson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the most attractive place to work right now,'' he
said. ``The new chief executive has a huge job in terms of
remotivating and regrouping a band of rather shell-shocked
troops.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 19:
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin of Russia growled this week at Western
leaders meeting in Turkey that they had no right to criticize his
nation's war against ``bandits and killers'' in Chechnya. On this
point, the Russian president is simply wrong. Yeltsin and his
allies in Moscow need to listen to warnings by those leaders who
tried during the European security conference in Istanbul to
explain that using bombs and tanks would not work, militarily or
diplomatically, to oust Chechen terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France, for example, said this war
to combat terrorism was ``a tragic error'' that was taking too many
innocent lives in the breakaway republic. President Clinton, who
had compared the earlier Chechen war, from 1994 to '96, to
America's Civil War, this time tried another tack.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reminded Yeltsin about the beneficial side of meddling
by outsiders. He noted that the West had rallied to Yeltsin in
August 1991 as hard-liners tried to take over the government and
the Yeltsin forces were in the streets of Moscow. ``If they had put
you in jail instead of electing you president,'' Clinton told the
Russian leader, ``I would hope that every leader of every country
around this table would have stood up for you and for freedom in
Russia and not said, `Well, that is an internal Russian affair that
we cannot be part of.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was the tougher words of the Europeans, the more
understanding tone of Clinton or other unrevealed factors in the
Istanbul meeting, the Russians did agree to allow the chairman of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to visit
Chechnya and help seek a political resolution to the conflict.
That, at least, is good news. It means that the leaders meeting in
Turkey will have both a political and humanitarian role in the
region. But Chechnya is still a raw battlefield that Russian
leaders are using to rally political support at home even as
criticism mounts abroad.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia's need to pursue terrorism is understandable,
Yeltsin and his government should take note of Gov. George W. Bush
and those in the Clinton administration who want to take a harsher
line against Russia. Bush has suggested cutting off aid until
Russia stops killing Chechen civilians. Such threats, aimed more at
the American voters than at the international arena, sound better
on the campaign trail than they would as policy. Aid to Russia is
in America's own interest _ not only to provide help in dismantling
Russia's nuclear weapons but also to foster economic and civic
stability in an emerging democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, however, must realize that good will in the West
and especially in America is in their interest as well. The stream
of refugees from Chechnya and the bombings in downtown Grozny are
images the American people care about. In the long run, these
cruelties add to American doubts, not simply about Chechnya but
about the willingness of Russia's leaders to move away from the
brutal methods of the past.

SUIT ON SONG, `ROSA PARKS,' IS REJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (th) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Many of the lyrics in the song ``Rosa Parks''
by Outkast, a rap group, are not words generally associated with
Mrs. Parks.
</P>
<P>
   In the song named after the woman whose refusal to move to the
back of a bus in 1955 gave birth to the civil rights movement,
expletives and racial epithets are mixed with occasional sexual
references. Mrs. Parks is never mentioned, although the refrain is,
``Ah ha, hush that fuss/Everybody move to the back of the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday a federal judge rejected a lawsuit by Mrs. Parks
against the rap group and its producers. Mrs. Parks had contended
that the group had defamed her and had violated her ``right of
publicity,'' which is the right of individuals to withhold their
endorsement of commercial products unless they are compensated to
their satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Barbara K. Hackett of the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan ruled that the song was ``an
expressive work'' and protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wrote that the song was at least partly about Mrs.
Parks and was not being used simply in a marketing or advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the necessary linkage between title and content is
easily satisfied here, plaintiff would be hard-pressed to
demonstrate that defendants' use of her name as the title to their
song is `simply a disguised commercial advertisement' to sell a
product, especially considering the song has received widespread
acclaim and was nominated for a Grammy Award,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The group did not ask Mrs. Parks' permission to use her name for
the song, which is on an album, Aquemini, that has sold 2.5 million
copies.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Beck of Atlanta, who defended Outkast, said the group
had meant to honor Mrs. Parks by naming the song after her. The
group told Rolling Stone magazine earlier this year that the
references to going to the back of the bus were intended to tell
other rap groups that Outkast had arrived on the music scene, and
did not allude directly to Mrs. Parks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Mrs. Parks, Gregory J. Reed of Detroit, said that
he would appeal the decision.

EDITORIAL: THE LAST CLINTON BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 19:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's ambitious domestic agenda, presented last
January at the height of the impeachment struggle, always faced an
uphill struggle in getting approved by a Republican Congress. The
Republican counter-demand for a $792 billion tax cut was similarly
destined to be blocked by Clinton's veto. After a year of
posturing, the budget for this year that is finally getting enacted
this week _ the last of Clinton's presidency _ is striking for its
stringency. There are modest spending increases in some of the
president's priority areas like education, but over all the
Republican approach of spending restraint has shaped this budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his presidency with a $290 billion deficit and is
ending it with a surplus of more than $100 billion, a remarkable
achievement. This page, along with many people in Congress, would
prefer that during one of the longest periods of prosperity in
history the nation spend additional funds to expand health care,
clean up the environment, extend educational opportunities and face
up to other unmet needs. But as a practical matter, given
Republican control on Capitol Hill, any bold steps in these areas
would almost certainly have been enacted this year as part of a
messy compromise, with unnecessary tax cuts, military spending and
pork-barrel programs tacked on _ all of it using the hard-won
surpluses lying ahead. The new budget is surely better than such an
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is an important marker for the vast political changes
of the last few years. When the era of budget surpluses began
dawning, Clinton challenged Congress to ``save Social Security
first.'' He insisted on deferring outsized tax cuts and spending
programs until steps were taken to assure that the Social Security
obligations could be met in the next century, when the baby-boom
generation starts to retire. Republicans, laboring to overcome the
public's longtime distrust of their intentions in this area,
responded by trying to outdo Clinton to ``save'' the retirement
system. They insisted this year on an end to the decades-long
practice of tapping Social Security tax revenues for regular
programs. They have largely won this argument, but the result is
that very little money is left over for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Within these restraints, Clinton scored well on a series of
skirmishes with Congress in the last several weeks. He has won
significant funding increases for teachers, police officers,
teaching hospitals, school programs in distressed areas, a ``new
markets'' initiative to encourage investment in poor communities
and a new drive to buy up undeveloped land. The deal that sealed a
budget agreement was the White House's willingness to adopt a
minuscule across-the-board budget cut, proclaiming that it is more
selective and less across-the-board than Republicans say.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is restrained fiscally, the budget leaves room for
more serious arguing about priorities in the next year, with
presidential candidates joining the fray. Republicans will continue
to argue that voters would prefer tax cuts above all else.
Democrats on the campaign trail and in Congress need to make the
case for using swelling revenues in future budgets to deal more
ambitiously with health care, schools and unmet social needs. &QL;

DEBATE ON CABBY BIAS EXPOSES RIFTS THAT GO BEYOND SKIN COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A public hearing held this week to examine the
difficulties that black New Yorkers face in hailing cabs was marked
by raw, emotional exchanges across a vast gulf that went far beyond
the bias of taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, black men and women took to the lectern in an
overheated, jam-packed room in the Harlem State Office Building and
wondered aloud how immigrants from the world over could regard them
all as would-be fare beaters and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to figure out how foreigners come to this country
and have such negative information before they get here,'' said
Donald Covington, 42, who recalled a time when a cabdriver sped off
just as he was putting one leg into the car. He said he chased
after the cab, with a mind to break its windows.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, drivers of many colors and many accents, some of
them dodging snickers about their long names and slippery English,
wondered aloud why no one understood their plight. The leader of
one drivers' group, Farooq Bhatti, an immigrant from Pakistan,
pledged, ``We will work with you people.''
</P>
<P>
   To which a woman in the back, an African-American visibly
offended by the phrase, spat back, ``You people!''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed attention on cabdrivers who refuse to pick up blacks
on the streets of New York City has unearthed far deeper
antipathies between black Americans and immigrants of color. In so
doing, it has pointed to apparently new terrain in race relations
in a city where racial rifts are driven not just by color, but by
language and national origin as well.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry once dominated by white men, two-thirds of the
city's yellow-cab drivers today are from South Asia, according to
estimates by city transportation officials, and a great many others
are from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes an issue that was once a classic confrontation
between blacks and working-class whites,'' said Philip Kasinitz, a
sociologist at Hunter College who studies immigration to New York
City, ``and makes it now a conflict between African-Americans and
immigrants of color, including a lot of black immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the faces are different, some scholars say the latest
tensions between new immigrants and native-born blacks is, in fact,
a lot like what was happening earlier in the century, when it was
Jewish, Irish and Italian immigrants struggling for acceptance.
Then, as now, blacks were a convenient target, said Roger
Waldinger, the chairman of the sociology department at the
University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're perceived as an outsider, one way to make yourself
an insider is to say `I'm not like them,''' said Waldinger, the
author of ``Still the Promised City? Africans Americans and New
Immigrants in Post-Industrial New York'' (Harvard University Press,
1996). ``I'm sure there's some of that going on here. I'm sure
that's not the only thing going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since actor Danny Glover drew new attention to
the issue of discrimination by cabdrivers, some unusual alliances
have emerged. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has been commended by some
African-Americans for having started a crackdown against cabbies
who refuse to pick up blacks; 150 police officers and taxi
inspectors on Friday will comb the streets for drivers who
discriminate. Among black New Yorkers, there are also damning
critiques of the mayor's crusade.
</P>
<P>
   And among South Asian residents, there are cries of
scapegoating. After all, some South Asians say, the problem that
black New Yorkers face with cabdrivers predates this latest group
of immigrant drivers. And second-generation South Asians who grew
up lionizing the black civil rights struggles bemoan being accused
of racism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps the most poignant testimonies at this week's hearing in
Harlem came from some of the cabdrivers themselves, who seem to be
as aware of the racist stereotypes they have inherited as they are
of those broad brush strokes applied against them.
</P>
<P>
   Samba Mbaye, an immigrant from Senegal, recalled telling a
friend back home of his plans to move to an apartment in Harlem.
The friend wrote back, he said, predicting that he would be killed.
``That guy's never been to this country!'' he cried. ``Where did he
learn Harlem is bad?''
</P>
<P>
   He then issued a simple appeal: ``Who wants respect gives
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But respect seemed to be in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers whose names and accents reflected their immigrant
origins were occasionally heckled. There were jokes about green
cards. At one point, Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia
Fields, who conducted the hearing to promote what she called
``constructive communication'' about blacks' problems with cabs,
gently admonished the audience and asked that they let everyone
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need your cooperation,'' she said. ``We really need
your respect.''
</P>
<P>
   A driver from Haiti, Yves Jules, grew increasingly emotional as
he spoke of how cabbies had taken a beating in recent weeks. ``You
are us, and we are you,'' he said. ``Most of you _ I like to give
you a taxi for one day and to experience our problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the lectern, a woman in the back said, to no one in
particular, ``Half of them drive without drivers' licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fields said Thursday that she would present several
recommendations to the Taxi and Limousine Commission. One is that
the map of Manhattan affixed inside every New York City taxicab be
extended beyond 96th Street, so as not to suggest that northern
Manhattan is, as she put it, ``a wasteland.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fields said she would also suggest that the commission
expand its diversity training. Currently, in their 80 hours of
required schooling, all prospective drivers take an eight-hour
class on diversity. Ms. Fields suggested that drivers be tested on
their knowledge of the city's diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi and Limousine Commission Chairwoman Diane McGrath-McKechnie
said there were no plans to amend the diversity training for
drivers. Of the 11 drivers who were picked up last Friday, on the
first day of the city's new enforcement initiative, 4 have pleaded
guilty and agreed to an additional eight hours of sensitivity
training, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Kazem, a cabdriver who emigrated from Iran, remembers
his own bewildering education into American race relations. He was
20 when he arrived in New York in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   When he started driving a taxi 14 years ago, what he heard among
veteran drivers stunned him. ``When they're trying to give advice,
among many of them, one is not to pick up black people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he said, he seizes on every opportunity to talk to both
sides. ``It's not that drivers are racist,'' he insisted. ``They've
been educated to think black people are dangerous.''

WHILE PEOPLE ARE DYING, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES PASS THE BUCK 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ They all say somebody should do something.
</P>
<P>
   City, county, state and federal officials agree that someone
should follow up. Inquire. Ask questions about the hundreds of
people from Libby who have either died or been diagnosed with fatal
diseases after being exposed to tremolite asbestos from a
vermiculite mine.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody, they say, should investigate disturbing indications
that Libby may still be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   But every official and every agency has a reason why, so far,
they have not been that somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Medical records, death certificates, doctors in five states and
the miners or their survivors say at least 192 have died and at
least 375 more have asbestosis or cancers from the lethal,
microscopic fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them contracted the terminal diseases years ago, when
the mine spewed more than two tons of asbestos a day into the air,
six days a week, in a fine white dust that settled over the
mountainside and often carried into the town of Libby.
</P>
<P>
   But Libby's nightmare did not end when the W.R. Grace Co. closed
the mine in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, asbestos-related diseases take a long time to
develop, so cases from earlier exposure will continue to crop up
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as more and more cases are being diagnosed in this
little northwest Montana mountain town, some townspeople are
finding the courage to ask the darkest questions of all, questions
none of the government agencies has dared to seek answers for:
</P>
<P>
   Are the tons of asbestos debris from the mine still killing
people?
</P>
<P>
   Are people being exposed today, breathing in death sentences
that will be carried out halfway into the next century, after
decades of agonizing illness?
</P>
<P>
   Are there dangerous levels of asbestos in the air, in the
ground, in the waters of the Kootenai River?
</P>
<P>
   Are the children and grandchildren of the sick and dying, who
never saw the mine in operation, going to die from its legacy?
</P>
<P>
   `BIG-TIME POLLUTANTS'
</P>
<P>
   The mine on Zonolite Mountain is dormant, its buildings
dismantled. The stacks that poured out so much dust are gone. The
Montana Department of Environmental Quality has already given Grace
back $400,000 of its $467,242 reclamation bond. The bond, which the
state called ``woefully inadequate'' 25 years ago, was supposed to
cover the costs of restoring the property to an environmentally
safe level if the company had gone belly up.
</P>
<P>
   The state says Grace spread yellow sweet clover and grass seed
and planted 150 pine seedlings on each acre of the mine it
reclaimed. Some have taken hold along the top of the mountain. But
only a scant stubble covers the pinkish waste of the tailings pile,
where thousands of tons of mine waste and asbestos dust were
dumped. A web of gullies has eroded the pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural landslides occur on the slopes in the area indicating
the unstable nature of the vermiculite materials,'' the state wrote
in a June 10 report.
</P>
<P>
   The state admits that ``the site would not meet reclamation
standards that exist today.'' The tailing pile would have to be
covered with clean soil. But the state says it is confident that
``no asbestos is blowing off the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's confidence may be misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Post-Intelligencer had two labs certified by the
Environmental Protection Agency test soil collected from five
locations along Rainy Creek Road. The road, once the main access to
the mine, is now used by elk hunters, huckleberry and mushroom
pickers, and others seeking access to the Kootenai National Forest
land surrounding the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Tremolite asbestos fibers were found in four of the samples. All
were higher than the levels considered safe by EPA and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. One sample, taken at
the curve on Rainy Creek Road, where youngsters from town often
party, was more than four times above the action levels.
</P>
<P>
   Using a vacuum air monitor, an air sample was also taken and
analyzed. Again, much higher-than-acceptable levels of asbestos
were found.
</P>
<P>
   ``More sophisticated testing would have to be done, but the
levels (found in the P-I samples) indicate that if it were a
workplace, the workers picking huckleberries in that area would
have to wear a respirator and a protective suit,'' said Armina
Nolan, who works for the EPA in Seattle and was the region's former
asbestos coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Watson, EPA's senior toxicologist in the Northwest's
Region 10, said the ``matter warrants a thorough examination. There
appear to be big-time environmental pollutants up there ... The
levels could be far more then the average person should be exposed
to.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether hazards remained on the mine site, a W.R.
Grace spokesman said the company did not have ``an in-house
reclamation expert'' who could answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   `HE DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW'
</P>
<P>
   Shane Whitmarsh says he just doesn't like sitting in doctors'
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not it,'' said his wife, Gina. ``He just doesn't want
to know if something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Her strapping, 34-year-old husband, a logger, has had pneumonia
three times in a year. ``That's a bad sign that something is wrong
with his lungs,'' Gina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never worked at the mine, so he thinks he's safe. There
are several other people here in their 30s who think they have
chest problems, but don't want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane shrugs off talk of his own health, saying, ``Once you've
got asbestosis, there's nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, then slams his fist on a coffee shop table. ``It's
our kids that I'm worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson is 5. Darby, 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``That old vermiculite is all over this town. Has anyone checked
to see what happened to the asbestos that's part of it? Are our
kids safe?''
</P>
<P>
   `THE STATE WOULD TELL US'
</P>
<P>
   Tony Berget, the mayor of Libby since 1996, agrees there is
vermiculite all over the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it sparkle,'' the mayor said. ``It was used as
fill. It covered the old ball parks, most of the town put it in
their gardens. It's used as insulation in most of the houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what happened in the old days, the miners coming home
covered with white dust. But I don't think there's anything to
worry about now. If there was a problem, I'm sure the county or the
state people would have told us. They haven't given us any
information so I'm sure there's not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Berget desperately wants that to be true.
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``I'm sure the county has tested for it, but they
haven't found anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kendra Lund, who does environmental testing for Lincoln
County, said she hasn't done any testing for asbestos ``for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the facilities to test for asbestos fibers.
These are not county issues, but state responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brad Black, the part-time county health officer, said,
``We're a very small health department with a very frugal budget.
If there was anything wrong the state would tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor (Mark Racicot) is from Libby,'' Berget said. ``If
there were a problem, he'd tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the state has not done anything, and some state workers are
concerned and frustrated. Patrick Plantenberg, acting mining
supervisor at Montana's Department of Environmental Quality, said:
``We keep hearing about all these people from Libby who are sick or
have died, but no one that I know of from the state has any real
information. Whenever I hear something, I call these people who are
supposed to deal with it, but nothing has ever been followed up
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Ramsey, an epidemiologist for the Montana Health
Department, added: ``Apparently, the state has not designated
anybody. It sounds like the asbestos problem in Libby may have
fallen between the crack of `whose territory is it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ellerhoff, an administrator for DEQ, said, ``We have lots of
entities who could get involved and help determine what's happening
in Libby,'' and he ticks off an alphabet soup of state and federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question becomes, who has the authority to do something?
The problem is that there hasn't been a murmur, let alone a public
outcry, over what's happening up there. It's unfortunate but
someone has to raise the issue, make it a hot topic, draw attention
to it,'' said Ellerhoff. ``That's the way to get the state
Legislature and the Congress to demand action and raise money for
the studies that should be done up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government seems equally unsure of who has the duty
to help Libby.
</P>
<P>
   John Wardell, the coordinator of EPA's operation in Montana,
initially responded to the P-I's questions about Libby by saying:
``A lot of folks are saying EPA should do this or that, but not one
of them, the town, the county or the state, has written us a letter
or called and asked for our help. We cannot go out there unless
we're invited.''
</P>
<P>
   Berget, the mayor, admitted he'd never called the EPA, but
added, ``This is not a big secret. They should know about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the EPA? It is their job to determine whether there
is a hazard in this town. They are on our backs all the time,
making people dig up old fuel tanks, after companies that drain
stuff into the river. Why aren't they out here? We'd welcome
someone looking at the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   After repeated queries, EPA's Wardell reconsidered his answer.
He said this week that ``based on concerns raised'' by the P-I, the
EPA would investigate the situation in Libby.

   `I HATE TO DIE'
</P>
<P>
   At 67, Carrie Detrick looks a lot better than she feels. She and
her husband, Bob, both have asbestosis. ``I never worked at the
mine,'' Carrie Detrick said. ``I just got it by living around here.
It's all over the town.'' She leans on a shovel in her garden,
freshly tilled by a friend. The black soil sparkles with pieces of
vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all the gardens in Libby have Zonolite in them. We
haven't used it for years, but it's still there,'' she said,
nudging a sparkle with her shoe.
</P>
<P>
   At night, she sits up in a chair ``because it's almost
impossible to breathe if I lie down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to die. I really do,'' she said, her voice dropping to
a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great-grandchild and six grandchildren and I want to
watch them grow up. But I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   She's worried about the health of her grandchildren and the
other children in Libby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermiculite is all over the place. Not just in the gardens.
It's in the roofs and walls of the houses. You can see it along the
river banks and on the roads and the old playgrounds. I don't want
my kids to get it. I don't want them to die from that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can accept it if these deaths end with my generation, but
what if it's ticking away in our children?''
</P>
<P>
   She's going to try to persuade her two sons, ages 42 and 48, to
get tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're afraid of finding out, but I think they have to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   She says most of the town just doesn't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all played in the piles as kids. I can't understand why the
government doesn't do anything and why the newspaper doesn't print
a word. It's like it's a dirty secret that nobody wants to talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   A STARTLING PARADOX
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if the EPA doesn't know there are problems at Libby.
In September 1994, Grace was fined and paid $510,000 for improperly
dismantling some of the asbestos-covered equipment at the old mine.
The penalty, one of largest Clean Air Act settlements in the
country, ``sends a clear message that violations of the asbestos
regulations will not be tolerated,'' said Lois Schiffer, an acting
assistant attorney general with the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said that during the demolition, asbestos was
released into the air that could have been inhaled by anyone
downwind.
</P>
<P>
   It is a startling paradox: The government took immediate action
because of the improper removal of some pipes and vats wrapped with
asbestos insulation, but has done nothing to evaluate whether the
millions of tons of asbestos-laced waste remaining at the mine and
the widespread vermiculite waste in town present a current hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA made an effort in 1992 to investigate contamination of
the same road where the P-I took its sample. Ron Rutherford, then
chief of the EPA's enforcement and compliance section in Region 8's
Denver headquarters, asked EPA lawyers in Washington whether the
road could be cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the tailings (on the road) are a product of vermiculite
mining, not asbestos mining, the tailings do not meet the
definition of asbestos tailings,'' said the headquarters in
refusing the request.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford, who is now senior enforcement coordinator, says
Washington's decision left him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that we had no regulatory authority to do anything.
These regulations have not always made the most sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand we talk about how a single fiber of asbestos
is not safe and can cause cancer down the road. But on the other
hand, we don't regulate a lot of asbestos. It's just frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Responsibility and authority are two different things. I would
hope that we have responsibility for it but it's not clear to me
that we have any authority. It's the way the environmental laws are
written. Ask Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt for a moment that there's asbestos in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   `NO WAY TO LIVE'
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Tennison lives in a house her father built. It's warm,
well-insulated with Zonolite, which was sold to the folks in town
at a discount during the heyday of the mine.
</P>
<P>
   She worked for Grace doing assays. She has asbestosis, as does
her former husband. She now works with AIDS patients in a
mental-health clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about the asbestos in this house, but I can't afford
to move,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stuffed as much new stuff as we could into the wall and
ceiling, but I'm terrified about my daughter getting it,'' Kathy
Tennison said.
</P>
<P>
   Salisha, 18, beautiful and wide-eyed, leans against a wall,
under a light switch covered with tape to keep the insulation from
coming out.
</P>
<P>
   She worries because her mother often has a hard time breathing.
She's also frightened about her future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it a lot, I worry that one day I won't be able
to breathe,'' Salisha said.
</P>
<P>
   She shakes her head. ``Having to carry around a tank of oxygen,
just to stay alive, is no way to live. No way at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Black, the county health officer, said, ``My real concern is
about the risks to those people who have the insulation from up the
hill in their homes,'' but added, ``I'm assuming that the risk of
asbestos contamination was well-studied years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither the county nor the state knows of any such studies,
and there is no indication in the Grace documents reviewed by the
P-I that the company ever studied what was in the walls and
ceilings of Libby's old homes.
</P>
<P>
   WATER POLLUTION CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   Other hazards may flow from Zonolite Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 70-year history of the mine, the asbestos and
vermiculite dust that could be captured, that didn't soar up the
stacks and into the wind, was dumped into the tailing pile.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of asbestos going to the tailing pile increased
dramatically in the '70s, when Grace shut down the dust-belching
dry mill and switched to a wet process. Much of the estimated 5,000
to 9,000 pounds a day of lethal fibers that used to go into the air
was being captured and dumped over the hill with the rest of the
vermiculite tailing.
</P>
<P>
   A 1981 internal audit of the mine by Grace acknowledged that the
tailing pond, where runoff from the tailing pile was collected, was
a storage basin for a ``significant amount'' of asbestos dust, ``up
to 40 percent.'' The auditors questioned whether this constituted
``hazardous waste storage which would require federal licensing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication in any of the thousands of pages of Grace
documents reviewed by the P-I that the matter was ever dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   But this fall, DEQ's Plantenberg found mention of the asbestos
in the water while reviewing the reclamation bond for the mine, and
he became concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, they dumped tailings into that drainage and the
whole drainage system is filled with tailings all the way down to
the Kootenai River,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next spring, if the spillway is full, we expect we are going
to get a lot of asbestos going down Rainy Creek into the Kootenai,
and I see that as a big issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the asbestos in the Kootenai presented yet another
health problem for the town, he said he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a water-quality standard so there must be health
concerns,'' Plantenberg said, then added, ``If there is a problem
with contamination to air or water from that site, I'm sure we
would go after W.R. Grace because the current land owners haven't
done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   `THE DAMN STUFF IS STILL HERE'
</P>
<P>
   A Grace internal memo reported in April of 1965 that company air
monitoring detected levels of asbestos ``in downtown Libby on many
dry days.'' An EPA inspection team reported the same thing in a
1982 report.
</P>
<P>
   Les Skramstad gingerly shuffles over the muddy field where
Libby's kids used to play ball. He pauses at a pile of dirt scraped
into the corner of the plot, stoops over and plucks up a glittering
bit of soil. Then another. And one more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what frightens me,'' he said, watching the sun bounce
off the vermiculite in his open palm. ``This stuff was here for
years and most of our kids played on it. The damn stuff is still
here and no one seems to care.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200 yards away from the old pitcher's mound are half a
dozen buildings and storage sheds that Grace used to process,
package and ship bags of expanded vermiculite. There was also an
experimental laboratory where they tried to turn Zonolite into
everything from cattle feed to high-rising bread, and the tremolite
asbestos into anything they could sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the scientists were done with their experiments, we'd
just shovel that stuff out on the ground and make room for the next
batch. These fields were piled with it,'' said Skramstad, who
stops, squeezes his eyes shut and struggles to catch his breath.
</P>
<P>
   He, his wife, Norita, and the two oldest of their five children
have asbestosis or cancer of the lungs. The Skramstads were the
first to go to trial against Grace, and they won.
</P>
<P>
   But his doctor tells him he has only a few more years to live.
</P>
<P>
   He accepts it with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can undo the disease we've got. We're all going to die
from it. But I'm going to spend every minute I've got left trying
to get people here to get serious about what's still on the ground,
in the water and the air,'' Skramstad said.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the railroad tracks, next to the old shipping
building, a half-dozen weathered bags of Grace's product are
stacked atop an old wooden pallet. One of the bags is split. The
others are still covered in heavy paper. The printing is faded but
could still be read: ``Warning Vermiculite Concentrate.
Overexposure to airborne fibers can cause a risk of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace knew there was the potential for trouble at the site.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1981 inspection report, Grace's company auditors said that
the town facility should be ``secured by fencing since it is
adjacent to a public ball playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   It was never done.
</P>
<P>
   A metal-roofed building a softball toss away from the ball field
was where Grace stored tall piles of vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Burnett, who owns the lumber yard that's there today, points
to ropes still hanging from the rafters where the town's children
used to swing and slide into the piles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that stuff is all over the place, but what am I
supposed to do? Close down?'' he asks with obvious frustration.
``That stuff is hazardous, but so is not eating.''
</P>
<P>
   Skramstad said, ``The politicians in this town don't want to
wake up to the problem. ... They say it's just some health problems
left over from the old mine.'' He stares at the vermiculite he
clutches in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death sentences are not just health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT LEGACY FOR KIDS?
</P>
<P>
   D.C. Orr worked as an excavator at the mine off and on for eight
years. He is not sick, but several of his family members are. He
says the danger has been covered up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all suppressed. Those who don't have the disease don't
want to talk about it or think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's got to be remembered is that stuff lasts forever.
You've got to wonder what kind of legacy we've left for our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Butch Hurlbert was a steelworker and a rodeo roper. But not
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of working at the mine, he was about to hop on
a treadmill for a cardiac test during a routine physical for a new
job when the doctor who'd just examined him came running up waving
an X-ray and told him to get off the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `You've got cancer and you've got it bad,'''
Hurlbert recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The retired cowboy said he's angry about the way the
``government types ... have covered up and downplayed the whole
problem. That whole town should be tested, if they care about their
kids, every square inch.''
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the sick people have little patience for
excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government says there is nothing wrong here, they're
crazy,'' Carrie Detrick said. ``I'm going to die. Let the
government come to my funeral if they need proof.''
</P>

`NO ONE EVER TOLD US THAT STUFF COULD KILL YOU' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ Darlene Joy Riley called her cancer ``George.''
Last year, George killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Before she died at age 52, she questioned why she got asbestos
fibers in her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I wind up with the disease? I didn't work there (at
W.R. Grace's vermiculite mine).''
</P>
<P>
   Darlene _ her friends called her Toni _ was an energetic woman,
almost to the end. Plaques and commendations on her living room
wall testified to how she lived life.
</P>
<P>
   She was a reserve deputy sheriff, worked on the town's ambulance
crew, was a trained rescue diver and helped out fighting forest
fires.
</P>
<P>
   She raised four children.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things on Toni's wall was a certificate showing she
was trained in how to remove asbestos from schools, homes and
businesses in a program sponsored by the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no way to remove it from her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she noticed she was always short of breath. A year
later, a doctor in Spokane told her that her chest was filled with
mesothelioma, an asbestos-caused cancer of the pleural lining.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation therapy was supposed to give her another couple of
years, but the treatment so weakened her that she had to stop
helping patients at accidents and fires.
</P>
<P>
   After she became very sick, she sued W.R. Grace to get them to
pay for an experimental anti-cancer drug she saw on television. Her
struggle with George can be traced in her own words from a
two-volume deposition she gave in the case.
</P>
<P>
   She went through surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up and I'm cut from here to here and I called my family
and told everybody that I was fine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just die. I mean I can't look at my family and tell
them there is no hope. So I tell them that I'm fine and I beat
George.''
</P>
<P>
   Her old ambulance squad and other friends threw a benefit and
raised $5,000 to pay for drugs, mostly painkillers. Others in her
family were also ill with asbestos-related diseases, she said,
including the man she was married to for 35 years, both her
parents, her sister, three cousins, two uncles and her
brother-in-law, who was a manager for W.R. Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Neither she nor her parents worked at the mine, but she said she
grew up surrounded by the vermiculite ore and dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wind blew in Libby years ago, there was dust
everywhere. Clothes on the line were white with dust. We used to
write in the dust on the cars,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She said there weren't any ``no trespassing'' signs on the mine
buildings near the ball fields, between the river and town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We climbed and slid on the piles of vermiculite. We picked up
little pieces and took them apart. The kids would light it and it
would puff up.''
</P>
<P>
   Until she took the EPA asbestos course, she said, she had no
idea that the fibers were dangerous, and only then did she learn
that the Zonolite used for insulation in many of Libby's homes,
including hers, contained tremolite fibers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insulation was falling all over the place,'' Toni said. ``It
was coming out of the ceiling. I'd pull the string to turn on the
light in the laundry room and the stuff would leak to the floor. I
just swept it up and threw it outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever told us that stuff could kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she learned too late, and she worried about others in
town who still didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, she was housebound. Toni listened to the calls on
the ambulance scanner and looked out her front window.
</P>
<P>
   ``The window is important to me, to be able to see the sunshine,
leaves, the snow,'' Toni told her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Grace made a cash settlement with her a few days before the case
was scheduled for trial, but Toni never got her experimental drug.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, she died.

W.R. GRACE STARTED IN THE BAT GUANO BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. had a not-so-fragrant beginning in 1854.
William R. Grace, who had fled the Irish potato famine to Peru,
chartered ships to trade bat guano and bird droppings.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, he moved his headquarters to New York and
set up a worldwide network trading fabric, fertilizer, machinery
and other products.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of World War II, William Grace's grandson, Peter,
took over control of the company and ran it for almost a half
century, until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company's focus remained on chemicals and
packaging, Peter Grace diversified Grace into everything from
sporting goods to tacos.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1995, Grace divested many of its larger businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Grace for
manipulating earnings in one of its divisions. To settle the suit,
Grace set up a $1 million financial education fund.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has gone through elaborate reorganization in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers handling the asbestos suits against Grace say the
shuffling was done to conceal assets and cloud the corporate lines
of responsibility. Grace denies the charges and calls the moves
``solid business decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it has downsized, Grace's sales are still about $1.4
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   But like other giant companies that sold asbestos products
during the heyday of the flameproof fiber, Grace is still plagued
by lawsuits filed by people allegedly harmed or killed by the
fibers in the insulation, garden products and other applications it
sold.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250,000 asbestos-related suits have been filed against
Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of them except the 187 involving the miners and the
families from Libby, are personal injury suits dealing with the
hazards of asbestos products, said Jay Hughes, Grace's top
litigation counsel.
</P>
<P>
   About 150,000 suits have been settled or dismissed. An estimated
102,000 cases remain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spotlight was thrown on one of Grace's darkest moments when
the movie ``A Civil Action'' was released in January.
</P>
<P>
   John Travolta and Robert Duvall dramatized the book of the same
name written by Jonathan Harr. The book told the story of families
living in the old New England mill town of Woburn on the outskirts
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Five Woburn children and one adult died of acute lymphocytic
leukemia from exposure to chemicals in their drinking water. Others
were sickened. Grace and another company were found by the
Environmental Protection Agency to be responsible for dumping the
toxic chemicals that poisoned two of Woburn's wells.
</P>
<P>
   Grace paid $8 million to eight families in return for the
withdrawal of lawsuits they had filed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Grace was indicted by the Department of Justice on two
counts of lying to the EPA in 1982 about the amount of hazardous
chemicals it used at its Woburn plant. In 1988, Grace pled guilty
to one count and was fined the maximum _ $10,000. Today, the
penalty for that charge is $500,000.

TRAGEDY AMID TRADITION: AT LEAST 9 DEAD, 28 INJURED AT TEXAS A&AMP;M 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
and ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ A 40-foot tower of logs, carefully
assembled by students to be set ablaze in Texas A&AMP;M University's
most beloved tradition, tumbled to the ground in an instant early
Thursday, crushing at least nine people to death.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight students were injured when the structure on a
corner of the university campus collapsed about 2:45 a.m. CST. An
estimated 50 to 70 students were working on top of the pyramidlike
stack of logs at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden ... the center pole snapped, and everything
went with it,'' said Nathan Knowles, a freshman from Alba, who
jumped 25 feet from the perch where he was wiring logs to the stack
as it buckled under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took five seconds, if that much, for the whole thing to
come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials identified the dead as Christopher Breen of Austin, a
1997 graduate; Jeremy Frampton, a senior psychology major from
Turlock, Calif.; Jamie Hand, a freshman environmental design major
from Henderson and the only female casualty; Christopher Lee Heard,
a freshman pre-engineering major from Houston; Lucas Kimmel, a
freshman biomedical science major from Corpus Christi; Bryan
McClain, freshman agriculture major, San Antonio; Chad Powell,
sophomore computer engineering major, Keller; Jerry Self, sophomore
engineering technology major, Arlington; and Nathan Scott West, a
sophomore oceanography major, Bellaire.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the nine confirmed dead, at least two students _
one male and one female _ were known to be buried Thursday night
under the mound of timber that was to have become fuel for A&AMP;M's
annual bonfire. Rescuers continued to carefully remove logs to try
to reach these victims, but hopes that they might be found alive
was dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good, but there's always hope,'' university
spokeswoman Cindy Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day two students were rescued, including one who
was administered intravenous fluids as he lay beneath the logs with
two broken legs and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   At least five of the nine confirmed dead were members of A&AMP;M's
1,962-member Corps of Cadets.
</P>
<P>
   University officials and police had not determined what caused
the bonfire to collapse, but witnesses said it happened quickly,
and then chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Harris, 19, a freshman from Longview, said he saw stunned
students turning to assist their injured colleagues as emergency
medical crews began arriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just crazy. It was chaos. Everyone was running around.
There were people lying around everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he clung to a log as the stack fell. He did not
remember hearing anything but the voice of a fellow Corps of Cadets
member, Jody Jacobs, yelling at everyone to ride the stack to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the tragedy, a pervasive sense of gloom
descended on the campus, and silence replaced the pre-bonfire
excitement and banter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hasn't sunk in yet,'' said Harris. ``I still find
myself talking about getting things for the bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie Bonfire, a 90-year-old tradition on campus, was being
built in anticipation of A&AMP;M's football game with its arch-rival,
the University of Texas, on Nov. 26. The stack of logs would have
been lit Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, students _ elaborately trained _ had been
working in shifts around the clock to assemble the structure.
University officials said the bonfire had reached a height of about
40 feet. When completed, it would have been 55 feet tall and
included 6,000 to 7,000 logs from trees in the area felled by
students.
</P>
<P>
   This year's bonfire, however, is canceled. And the future of the
event seems uncertain, although many students and alumni said they
believed the tradition should be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   No full-time university staff members were on site at the time
of the bonfire collapse, although Thompson had checked on the
construction at 10:30 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Aggie Bonfire is a student-run organization,'' said
Rusty Thompson, faculty adviser to the operation. ``And these
students who work on the bonfire are adults.''
</P>
<P>
   He said licensed crane operators were at the site at all times
during construction. The rescue efforts were tedious and
meticulous, as crane operators carefully picked logs off one by
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical that the dismantling of this stack be in an
orderly fashion,'' said Bart Humphreys, spokesman for the College
Station Fire Department, which was heading up the rescue operation.
``It's like Pick-up Sticks. These logs are all intertwined. We can
work on one side of an area, but once these logs become interlaced
we have to work from a different angle in order to get deeper in a
certain spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials had used sensitive listening devices, such as the type
used to find earthquake victims, trying to locate students. By late
afternoon, a golden retriever from the Austin Police Department was
brought in to help search for more victims.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen said notes and phone calls of
condolences had been pouring into the school from all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great tragedy,'' Bowen said. ``Everybody is just
broken-hearted about what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers from Houston, San Antonio and Austin were sent
Thursday afternoon to help relieve crews that had been working in
60- to 90-minute shifts since before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said engineering faculty members and other experts are
examining the logs as they are picked off the pile, hoping to be
able to determine what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Early speculation about the cause of the tragedy focused on a
possible break of the center pole, a key design feature. Several
witnesses reported having heard the pole snap, but Thompson said
this had not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The center pole is actually two poles that are spliced and
bolted together and then wrapped with 660 feet of steel cables.
While there were visible breaks in the center pole, Thompson said
it is too early to determine if that was the cause of the collapse
or if they broke after the logs started tumbling.

TRAGEDY AMID TRADITION: AT LEAST 9 DEAD, 28 INJURED AT TEXAS A&AMP;M

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ A 40-foot tower of logs, carefully
assembled by students to be set ablaze in Texas A&AMP;M University's
most beloved tradition, tumbled to the ground in an instant early
Thursday, crushing at least nine people to death.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight students were injured when the structure on a
corner of the university campus collapsed about 2:45 a.m. CST. An
estimated 50 to 70 students were working on top of the pyramidlike
stack of logs at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden ... the center pole snapped, and everything
went with it,'' said Nathan Knowles, a freshman from Alba, who
jumped 25 feet from the perch where he was wiring logs to the stack
as it buckled under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took five seconds, if that much, for the whole thing to
come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials identified the dead as Christopher Breen of Austin, a
1997 graduate; Jeremy Frampton, a senior psychology major from
Turlock, Calif.; Jamie Hand, a freshman environmental design major
from Henderson and the only female casualty; Christopher Lee Heard,
a freshman pre-engineering major from Houston; Lucas Kimmel, a
freshman biomedical science major from Corpus Christi; Bryan
McClain, freshman agriculture major, San Antonio; Chad Powell,
sophomore computer engineering major, Keller; Jerry Self, sophomore
engineering technology major, Arlington; and Nathan Scott West, a
sophomore oceanography major, Bellaire.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the nine confirmed dead, at least two students _
one male and one female _ were known to be buried Thursday night
under the mound of timber that was to have become fuel for A&AMP;M's
annual bonfire. Rescuers continued to carefully remove logs to try
to reach these victims, but hopes that they might be found alive
was dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good, but there's always hope,'' university
spokeswoman Cindy Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day two students were rescued, including one who
was administered intravenous fluids as he lay beneath the logs with
two broken legs and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   At least five of the nine confirmed dead were members of A&AMP;M's
1,962-member Corps of Cadets.
</P>
<P>
   University officials and police had not determined what caused
the bonfire to collapse, but witnesses said it happened quickly,
and then chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Harris, 19, a freshman from Longview, said he saw stunned
students turning to assist their injured colleagues as emergency
medical crews began arriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just crazy. It was chaos. Everyone was running around.
There were people lying around everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he clung to a log as the stack fell. He did not
remember hearing anything but the voice of a fellow Corps of Cadets
member, Jody Jacobs, yelling at everyone to ride the stack to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the tragedy, a pervasive sense of gloom
descended on the campus, and silence replaced the pre-bonfire
excitement and banter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hasn't sunk in yet,'' said Harris. ``I still find
myself talking about getting things for the bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie Bonfire, a 90-year-old tradition on campus, was being
built in anticipation of A&AMP;M's football game with its arch-rival,
the University of Texas, on Nov. 26. The stack of logs would have
been lit Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, students _ elaborately trained _ had been
working in shifts around the clock to assemble the structure.
University officials said the bonfire had reached a height of about
40 feet. When completed, it would have been 55 feet tall and
included 6,000 to 7,000 logs from trees in the area felled by
students.
</P>
<P>
   This year's bonfire, however, is canceled. And the future of the
event seems uncertain, although many students and alumni said they
believed the tradition should be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   No full-time university staff members were on site at the time

construction at 10:30 Wednesday night.
</P>

HACKETT, TOLEDO AREN'T EXACTLY BUDDIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just because UCLA coach Bob Toledo and USC coach
Paul Hackett are rivals, it doesn't mean they can't like each
other.
</P>
<P>
   It just so happens they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett speculated recently that maybe his getting hired at USC
might be something Toledo resents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bob and I both grew up with USC as the football school
in this city,'' Hackett said. ``Did he have a choice when he came
back (to UCLA)? He was out of work. He was fired at Texas A&AMP;M. Is
that a lot of choice?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked when he closed USC practice on Wednesday if he was copying
Toledo's tradition of closing Bruins practices the week of the big
game, Hackett answered:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to keep up with Bob, that's been one of my real focuses
of my whole career, to keep up with Bob,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toldeo has been able to hold his own in this verbal warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last year if UCLA's season was a disappointment because it
lost its final two games, including the Rose Bowl, Toledo fired
back, ``It's not like we got embarrassed by a 6-5 team or
anything,'' an obvious reference to USC's loss to Texas Christian
in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett wasted little time responding: ``You know what's
interesting about Bob? He keeps looking over here. I'm not looking
over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even someone as smooth and diplomatic as former USC coach John
Robinson, who hired both coaches as assistants in the 1970s,
couldn't deny the animosity the two have for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be something to it,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   So how would Robinson describe the relationship? ``I think it's
passable.''
</P>
<P>
   Quizzed directly about their relationship, both coaches offer
near-identical responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not that close. We're not bosom buddies,'' Toledo said.
``It's not like I get on the phone and call him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a bosom-buddy relationship,'' Hackett said. ``We
don't go out of our way to see each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The public saw first-hand the strained atmosphere between the
coaches following UCLA's 34-17 victory last season. Hackett was
incensed afterward because Bruins quarterback Cade McNown faked a
pitch in the final 30 seconds and reversed field for a 23-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what that last play of the game was about,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Did Hackett think it was uncalled for? ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Hackett is bothered about the incident. ``Was he
thinking, `Let's just rub it in?' It's unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   From whence does the animosity spring? One need only look at
their resumes. Both grew up in the Bay Area and played quarterback
for their high school teams. Toledo starred for Lincoln High in San
Jose, while Hackett led Miramonte High in Orinda, outside Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   A year apart in age, they became rival college quarterbacks
playing in the Far Western Conference _ Toledo for San Francisco
State, Hackett for UC Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But things didn't really get rocky until 1976, when both were
hired by Robinson as assistants at USC.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably only natural they became rivals. Hackett was
unyielding, arrogant and on his way toward becoming known as a
quarterback expert. He also held the job Toledo really wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo coached the secondary, a frustrated offensive specialist
coming to USC just to get his foot in the door at a major college.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hackett denies being aware of any jealousy from Toledo,
but his answer has an edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have come about from his side, but, hey, I had the
job,'' Hackett said. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, too, denies having a problem with Hackett, but he
acknowledges he will never ignore him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respond to comments. I try to use everything ' Toledo
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOTENSLEBEN, Germany _ This is a country of scars. Some are
evident, some lie deeply hidden, as the story of this village on
the former border between East and West Germany shows.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with the evident scars, stroll into the fields beyond
the village, where the quiet quickly gives way to the disquieting:
a wall, a watchtower and coils of barbed wire rise from the
undulating countryside and mark the Cold War's old frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin Wall fell on Nov. 9, 1989, but elsewhere on the
border between East and West Germany the end of Europe's division
came more slowly. At Hotensleben, it was only on Nov. 19 that the
heavily fortified wall was breached after repeated protests by
local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we watched what happened in Berlin, we thought it was a
one-day mistake,'' said Dieter Buchwald, the mayor of this formerly
East German town. ``We were certain the Russians would never
tolerate it. But then we gained courage, and about 300 of us went
every day to press for the opening of our wall.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days that opening came. Euphoria and emotional family
reunions followed. Then, as elsewhere, came the difficulties: a
sugar factory closed, a mine shut down, hundreds of jobs were lost.
Widespread unemployment was hard, but a deeper pain emerged when
the hidden scar of Hotensleben at last emerged.
</P>
<P>
   That scar stemmed from the story of Alfred and Eva Jaeckel, the
one Jewish family in the village. Owners of the Hotensleben textile
store, German patriots until Hitler decreed otherwise, they were
banished from history between 1945 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   East German history was a science in the service of the
Communist regime. Hitler, seen through this prism, was the last
spasm of reactionary capitalism, a man thrust to power by the
German bourgeoisie and resisted by the socialist worker-heroes of
the future East German state. In this vision, the Holocaust had no
place.
</P>
<P>
   So in communist, postwar Hotensleben, on the front line between
the Soviet and British sectors, the story of the Jaeckels simply
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The end of Europe's division also marked the release of buried
history. Sometimes this has proved explosive, as in the Balkans,
where the past has been manipulated again to serve
communists-turned-nationalists. Sometimes, as in this German
village, a result has been a belated push for truth and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The push began in 1990 with a property claim from Israel that
arrived at the town and amazed Buchwald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had grown up in this village, but nobody ever mentioned a
Jewish family,'' said the mayor, an engineer who took office in
1989. ``We heard about Hitler's fascist atrocities, but not about
the Jews, here or anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The claim came from Alfred's son, Reinhold Jaeckel. Intrigued,
the mayor decided to make use of a government-subsidized make-work
program to give an unemployed person the task of researching
whether a Jewish family called Jaeckel had ever lived in
Hotensleben.
</P>
<P>
   Responses from the town's 2,400 inhabitants were initially
evasive. People old enough to remember the war years seemed
reluctant to talk about the Nazi period; above all, they did not
want their own names linked with any testimony. But gradually the
lost story of the Jaeckels was pieced together.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Jaeckel opened his store in 1907 and fought for Germany
in World War I, earning an Iron Cross for bravery. After the war,
he returned to Hotensleben, where business was good until Hitler
came to power in 1933. Then banners began to appear saying:
``Anyone who buys from the Jews not wanted here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaeckel, like many patriotic German Jews, refused to believe the
worst. He tried to ignore the taunts of the Nazis gathering in the
Knopf hotel next to the store.
</P>
<P>
   But his Zionist son, Reinhold, who was born in 1908, left
Germany for Palestine in 1933, as soon as Hitler gained power.
Having worked most of his life as a teacher, Reinhold Jaeckel died
in Israel in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was always obsessed with what happened in
Hotensleben,'' said Reinhold's son Joram Jaeckel, who lives in
Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv. ``He wanted to know exactly what happened
to his family and he wanted to recover the property. He wrote
countless letters. But until the Cold War ended, we could not do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Cold War hid was the way German barbarism had destroyed
the Jaeckel family. On the night of Nov. 9, 1938 _ the same date in
November that the Berlin Wall would fall 51 years later _ their
store was smashed and ransacked in the Kristallnacht rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred and his wife, Eva, were arrested, taken initially to
Berlin, and then deported to Auschwitz in 1942, where they were
killed. Their son Albert was also arrested and killed by the Nazis
in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a half-century after these crimes, in 1990, that
Reinhold Jaeckel returned to Hotensleben for the first time,
accompanied by his son. ``We felt a terrible ambivalence,'' Joram
Jaeckel said.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, people were nice, helpful, overwhelmingly
polite. ``On the other,'' he continued, ``I knew that these were
the sons and daughters of my family's murderers, and that the older
people may even have participated in Kristallnacht.''
</P>
<P>
   The only trace of the family in the town was the grave of
Reinhold's grandmother Ernestine Lippmann. An 80-year-old woman in
1938, she was beaten by the Nazis during the Kristallnacht attack
and died 10 days later, on Nov. 19, 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Joram Jaeckel, 53, recalled meeting a woman old enough to have
witnessed these events, asking her about his great-grandmother's
death, and seeing a shadow of unease fall across her face. ``She
did not want to tell the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchwald, a devout Christian, is now deeply concerned with
historical truth, which he sees as the only basis for ending
Europe's 20th-century convulsions. His own family was uprooted from
Silesia after 1945 when the area became part of Poland, so he knows
the anguish of displacement.
</P>
<P>
   He played an important role in ensuring the restitution of the
Jaeckel home _ then a ruin _ in 1994. The preservation of the wall
outside the village as a memorial to Germany's division has also
been the mayor's work.
</P>
<P>
   In the hall outside his office, Buchwald has organized a
permanent exhibition of the Jaeckel family story made up of
photographs, letters from Reinhold Jaeckel and unsigned testimony
from local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old people alive at Kristallnacht are still too embarrassed to
sign their name,'' Buchwald said. ``Germans continue to complicate
their history. Some now say it was not really so bad for the Jews
under the Nazis, and so I exhibit these photos. Others say it was
not really so bad in communist East Germany, and so I want the wall
there as a reminder of what that state was.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even with history made so evident, its scars are not quickly
overcome. For four decades, East Germans learned they were the good
Germans, the anti-fascists during Hitler's rule. In this way,
honest confrontation with Nazi crimes was avoided.
</P>
<P>
   One result of this has been the much greater success of neo-Nazi
groups in the former East Germany than in the West. In the last
election in Saxony-Anhalt, the state in which Hotensleben is
situated, the extreme right took 12.9 percent of the vote. This
prominence of rightist groups, in turn, hinders east-west
integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I note that my children, who are in their 20s, are not
interested in the east,'' said Willi Heidemann, the top
administrative official in the nearby village of Jerxheim, which
was on the western side of the border. ``In part that's because
they are apolitical members of what I call a just-for-fun
generation. But they are also put off by right-wing violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Joram Jaeckel, who is now trying to rent out his recovered and
restored property, puts the neo-Nazism of skinheads down to the
follies of youth. Once, staying at an inn in the nearby town of
Schoeningen, he overhead chants of ``Heil Hitler!'' and shuddered.
But he is more deeply disturbed by meetings with older Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I always ask myself,'' he said, ``is `What are they
thinking? What is behind the faces?'''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After bowing to an objection by Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, the House passed a hard-fought measure Thursday that would
give satellite television companies the right to broadcast local
channels, providing cable companies with competition.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, part of a huge spending package, is now before
the Senate, which has a deadline of Dec. 2 for acting on that
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill cuts through much of the current static that has so
confused and frustrated millions of home satellite viewers,'' said
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who helped push the legislation. ``For
the first time ever, it will usher in an era of head-to-head
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the budget bill, the measure is expected to be signed
by President Clinton, preparing the way for viewers in New York and
Los Angeles to begin receiving local programs on their dishes
almost immediately. Once the measure is approved, satellite dish
owners in other cities should be able to tune into local affiliates
of NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox within six months. In all, 10 million
households own satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Christmas this year, consumers across the nation will have
a real choice,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., who heads the
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of tinkering and compromise, the
legislation nearly lost its footing in the Senate over one
provision.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who is known for his parliamentary savvy, threatened a
filibuster when he discovered that his colleagues had inserted a
provision to extend loan guarantees of $1.25 billion to satellite
companies as an incentive to serve rural viewers. The companies say
it is too expensive to launch satellites to reach sparsely
populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise was struck Thursday morning, and the final bill was
resubmitted to the House without the contentious measure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, agreed that the
Senate would take up the issue of rural loan guarantees again no
later than April 1, which appeased lawmakers from largely rural
states.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give satellite companies a six-month grace period
to work out agreements with the networks, during which time they
would be entitled to broadcast local channels to all viewers. After
six months, deals between satellite providers and networks would
have to be in place for satellite companies to continue carrying
the channels. The legislation also requires that by 2002 those
satellite companies that carry some local stations would have to
carry all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Armand Musey, an analyst at Banc of America Securities,
estimated that local stations would charge satellite broadcasters
several times as much as they do cable stations, because satellite
systems have a lower market share. ``A local broadcaster has to be
on the local cable system, or they don't have any audience,'' he
said. Still, he said, because the satellite companies will offer
only a handful of local stations in each city, they will be able to
charge an additional $5 a month and still make a good profit.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kaimowitz, an analyst at ING Barings, said the satellite
companies would want to offer local stations inexpensively because
it is a service intended to attract new customers. And
broadcasters, he said, will want their channels carried on
satellite because satellite subscribers tend to be the young and
well-off viewers that advertisers seek.
</P>
<P>
   He said that about 30 percent to 40 percent of satellite
subscribers also subscribed to cable television, mainly to get
local channels. Some will now drop cable, saving about $15 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The small but growing satellite dish industry has spent three
years lobbying lawmakers to change a law that prevents them from
offering subscribers local programming. The law, company executives
argued, was seriously undercutting their ability to compete with
cable, which serves 70 million households, mostly because
subscribers did not want to give up local programs or settle for
fuzzy reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an impediment for people to subscribe to satellite
channels,'' said Bob Marsocci, a spokesman for DirecTV, the
dominant satellite company. ``They walk into a store and find out
they can't get local TV, and they walk out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill was ultimately supported by the cable industry
and broadcasters, officials for one satellite company, Echostar
Communications, objected, saying the bill favored DirecTV, which is
owned by the Hughes subsidiary of General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Watson, a lobbyist for Echostar, said the bill did not
give smaller companies the leverage to secure reasonable
retransmission contracts from the networks. This, she argued, could
discourage start-up companies from getting into the business and
would dilute competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to pay more than cable pays, we are going to have
to pass that on to the consumer,'' Ms. Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   It is an argument backed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the
chairman of the Commerce Committee. McCain called the bill
anti-competitive for failing to protect satellite companies from
lopsided agreements that he said could still benefit cable
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But executives for the National Broadcast Association and
senators from both parties discounted that theory.

IDENTITY OF BRICK-ATTACK SUSPECT STILL UNKNOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUAN FORERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Detectives searching for the man who smashed a
27-year-old midtown Manhattan office worker with a brick took to
the subways and knocked on doors on Manhattan's East Side Thursday
in an intensive effort to find anyone who could identify the
assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Using 60 detectives and dozens of patrol officers, the police
focused on the area stretching from the East 30s to the East 70s,
paying particular attention to one location: Madison Avenue and
East 75th Street. It is at the spot that investigators now believe
the attacker found the brick used in the attack, removing it from
the base of a tree, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After being shown sketches of the attacker, some people in the
area told the police they believed they had at one time seen the
assailant.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was able to give the police a full name or lead
detectives to where the man could be found, police officials said.
As a result, investigators were having a hard time narrowing their
search.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Nicole Barrett, who was struck from behind on
Tuesday afternoon for no apparent reason as she prepared to cross
Madison Avenue at 42nd Street, has once again reminded the city
that despite the drop in crime over the last few years, random
violence can easily shatter the perception that the city is safe.
As a result, the police force has devoted extraordinary resources
to finding the attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, who last year moved with a friend from Texas to New
York, was transferred Thursday from the surgical recovery room at
Bellevue Hospital Center to the neurosurgical intensive care unit,
where she remained in critical but stable condition, said Lorinda
Klein, a hospital spokeswoman. After the attack, Ms. Barrett
underwent two operations to relieve the pressure on her brain
caused by a skull fracture she suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's still critical but improving. She's not out of the woods
yet; she's unconscious but she's not in a coma,'' said Ms. Klein,
attributing the assessment to Dr. Patrick Kelly, the chairman of
the Neurosurgery Department at Bellevue. ``We're cautiously
optimistic that things will work out and she'll continue to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett's parents, Sharon and Arlen Barrett, who on
Wednesday flew to New York from their home in Athens, Texas, and
were taken to the hospital by city officials, remained there
throughout the day. Ms. Klein said the couple were overwhelmed by
the outpouring of support from New Yorkers, several of whom had
sent flowers and called in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family has deep faith that Nikki will make it through,''
the family said in a statement released by the hospital. ``God will
see our family through this. We appreciate your prayers and good
wishes.''

NOW STONEMAN CAN FOCUS ON FINLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Now that he has a manager in place, Anaheim
Angels general manager Bill Stoneman can focus on re-signing
pitcher Chuck Finley.
</P>
<P>
   But will he?
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman would like to hire a scouting director as soon as
possible and wants to delve into discussions with other teams about
possible trades. As for Finley, Stoneman had a 10-minute telephone
conversation with him Wednesday, just before Finley left on a trip
to talk with representatives of the Seattle Mariners and Arizona
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Chuck I still want to meet face to face,'' Stoneman
said. ``I have to determine what Chuck Finley really wants. Does he
want to go to a club that's been a proven contender in recent years
so he can get that ring he doesn't have? Or is it important for him
to be an Angel the rest of his career and form part of the winning
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who turns 37 this month, will command as much as $9
million per season for as many as three seasons in the free agent
market, something the Angels seem unwilling to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``If another club comes along and makes an offer to him that
blows him away that we can't match, we won't,'' Stoneman said. ``We
won't go beyond our means to retain him. Are we interested in
having him back? Sure, we want him back. But you have to live
within your means. We're not going to design our payroll around
what a player wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, though, has said that money isn't the most important
aspect of a contract to him. And in fact, in past years he has
taken less from the Angels than he could have gotten on the free
agent market.
</P>
<P>
   Finley or no Finley, Stoneman says his primary focus is on
obtaining starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already got a couple of old guys in (Tim) Belcher and
(Ken) Hill, and we've got a few young guys (Jarrod Washburn, Ramon
Ortiz and Brian Cooper),'' Stoneman said. ``We'd like to get some
guys that fall in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Never say never: Toward the end of the 1999 season, Angels
president Tony Tavares said he wouldn't hesitate to trade all 25
players if it were possible. Wednesday, he was asked if Mo Vaughn,
who just completed the first year of a six-year, $80-million
contract, is untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never say never to anybody'' Tavares said. ``If Wayne
Gretzky can be traded, anybody can. Who knows.''

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 EDITORIAL: A NEW FRONT IN THE PCB WAR  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Nov. 19:
</P>
<P>
   New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who has been suing
big corporations right and left recently, has now charged General
Electric with impeding navigation along a stretch of the Hudson
River and thus preventing the river from reaching its full
potential as a commercial and recreational waterway. The suit
represents a novel attempt to speed a resolution of the 25-year
controversy over PCB contamination in the Hudson River. If
successful, the suit may also establish a precedent for claims
against other companies whose activities can be shown to have
restricted economic development along New York's waterways.
</P>
<P>
   But the furor surrounding Spitzer's announcement inflates its
immediate importance. The real battle is still the struggle between
the company and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which
will decide late next year whether to require GE to undertake an
expensive dredging operation to rid several contaminated ``hot
spots'' in the river of PCBs. GE has never denied responsibility
for the chemicals, which were discharged from two now-defunct
plants north of Albany years ago. The EPA regards PCBs _
polychlorinated biphenyls _ as a health risk to wildlife and to
people who regularly eat fish caught in the upper Hudson. PCBs are
also among the biggest remaining obstacles to the ecological
recovery of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's suit does not address environmental or health risks.
Instead it argues that the costs associated with removing and
storing toxic sediments are so high that the state has been unable
to dredge an important navigable waterway that stretches from Lake
Champlain to Waterford, about 30 miles south of the old GE plants.
As a result, Spitzer asserts, economic activity has suffered. His
suit seeks to force GE to pay the extra costs of dredging the PCBs,
a sum that could be at least $10 million. At his news conference,
Spitzer openly invited other communities up and down the Hudson to
bring similar actions if his strategy turns out to be successful.
His hope is to achieve what one of his associates called a
``critical mass'' of lawsuits that will force GE to undertake
widespread dredging, whatever the outcome of the EPA investigation.
</P>
<P>
   GE, which called the suit absurd, was not alone in questioning
Spitzer's approach. To begin with, there was much confusion over
whether the channel actually needed dredging, with the New York
State Canal Corp. saying no and several local officials saying yes.
The Canal Corp., a division of the state Thruway Authority,
controls 524 miles of canals. It would presumably have to put up
part of the money if a judge rules in favor of dredging the
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Cahill, Gov. George Pataki's environmental
chief, warned that the depositions and other requirements
associated with the suit would siphon valuable resources from the
environmental agency's study and from a state investigation. The
Pataki camp, unduly sensitive to any challenge to the governor's
claim to be the state's top environmentalist, is clearly annoyed by
Spitzer's intervention. Compared with the EPA's investigation of
health and ecological damage along the entire river, Spitzer's suit
seems too narrow to get the job done. But the war to rid the Hudson
of PCBs is an important one, and Spitzer has every right to join
it.

N.Y. REPUBLICANS SEEK EXPANDED STATE SUPPORT OF DRUG COVERAGE FOR
ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Republican leaders in the state Senate called
Thursday for expanding a state program that subsidizes prescription
drug purchases for elderly New Yorkers, proposing to more than
double the number of people eligible for the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for spending $235 million a year, roughly
doubling the amount that the state now pays to provide prescription
drug coverage for the elderly. That would increase the number of
people enrolled in the program to 229,000 from 110,000.
</P>
<P>
   New York is among 14 states that are running a host of programs
intended to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs, mainly by
focusing on low-income people who do not qualify for Medicaid,
according to health care experts.
</P>
<P>
   But New York's prescription drug program would become among the
most generous in the nation if the proposal announced Thursday was
enacted, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bruno, the Republican majority leader in the state
Senate, said the proposal was urgently needed to help elderly New
Yorkers keep pace with the soaring costs of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rising prescription drug costs are forcing too many seniors to
choose between eating and staying warm or buying life-saving
drugs,'' he said. ``This plan changes that.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan received tempered support from both the Republican
governor, George Pataki, and Democratic leaders in the state
Assembly, increasing the likelihood that some version of it will
eventually be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which would take effect next year, is intended to
cover New Yorkers who are at least 65 years old. It seeks to
broaden the pool of elderly people eligible for drug coverage by
expanding the income eligibility limits that now exist.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would provide coverage for single people with gross
incomes under $35,000 a year, compared with the current annual
income limit of $18,500. It would also help married couples with
annual incomes under $50,000, compared with the current limit of
$24,400.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also seeks to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for
enrollees by at least 20 percent. For example, a married person
earning $17,000 a year now pays an annual premium of about $130 for
unlimited drug coverage, along with co-payments and a $542
deductible.
</P>
<P>
   But under the plan proposed Thursday, that same person would pay
an annual premium of $119, along with co-payments and a $425
deductible. The proposed co-payments would range from $3 to $20,
depending on the type of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was praised by organizations representing elderly
people, including the American Association of Retired Persons and
the New York Senior Action Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obtaining affordable drug coverage for older people is a
national priority for AARP,'' said Bill Ferris, one of the group's
lobbyists in New York. ``The Senate proposal is a strong step in
that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno, the Senate leader, said the additional $125 million
earmarked for the program would come from the state's share of the
national tobacco lawsuit settlement. The settlement is to be paid
over 25 years, but the Senate plan would be adopted permanently,
with the costs recurring each year.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno did not specify how he intended for the rest of the
tobacco settlement to be spent beyond saying that the money should
be used for health-related expenses, like providing coverage to
people without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   His comments represented his opening bid in what is widely
expected to be a lively debate over how to divide the tobacco
settlement. His position was cheered by Democratic lawmakers and
health care advocacy groups, both of which want the money to go
toward health care programs, like helping the uninsured and
reducing the number of people who smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that Republicans in the Senate have now
joined the Assembly in arguing that 100 percent of the tobacco
settlement should be used for health care,'' said Blair Horner, the
legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research
Group. ``Unfortunately, we are left without a lot of critical
details.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco money comes from last year's settlement of lawsuits
filed by the states against tobacco companies to recoup money spent
treating people with smoking-related illnesses. The tobacco
companies agreed to pay the states $246 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   New York's share would be $800 million a year at the start,
growing to $1.2 billion, for a total of $25 billion. The money will
be split up, with the state government getting half and the rest
going to New York City and other local governments.

HORST P. HORST, PHOTOGRAPHER OF FASHIONABLE, DIES AT 93 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horst P. Horst, a master of light and deep shadow whose
photographs of fashion and fashionable creatures like Coco Chanel,
Marlene Dietrich and Noel Coward evoked the glamorous 1930s as well
as his own chic circle in Paris, died Thursday at his home in Palm
Beach Gardens, Fla. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer, who was known from the beginning of his
expansive career as, simply, Horst, had been in failing health
since suffering from pneumonia last year, said Richard J. Horst,
his manager and archivist, who also became the photographer's
adopted son.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for his classical images of models and society
figures posed in dramatic, often Greek-inspired settings, Horst
started taking pictures in 1931 as a protege of the aristocratic
photographer George Hoyningen-Huene, and continued to work until
1991, photographing subjects as diverse as Jean Cocteau, Harry
Truman, Maria Callas, Gertrude Stein and Andy Warhol, as well as
settings like the Iranian deserts and interiors of Irish castles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really was the 20th century,'' said the photographer Eric
Boman, who met Horst in 1978, when both were assigned to photograph
the French fashion collections, and who subsequently became a
regular visitor to the Horst home on Long Island. Many of the
furnishings there were from his friend Chanel, and a portrait of
Jacqueline Kennedy, leaning against a White House pillar, hung in a
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The people he knew, the clothes he photographed, conjure up a
world where elegance and manners still mattered, and indeed Horst
was himself a specimen of prewar savoir-faire, with blond hair and
a trim, muscular body. His settings were often highly stylized, and
he preferred to work in a studio, where he could use artificial
light to impose an unreality on his subjects, elevating them to a
glamorous ideal.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1984 biography by Valentine Lawford, a former British
foreign service officer who became Horst's companion, Horst
recalled a photo session in 1935 with the Comtesse de la Falaise
for French Vogue: ``To get this shot, it took two days. It was the
idea that counted then, not the sort of nervous rush they work in
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Horst also had an exquisite, if slightly eccentric, eye for
detail, and in his early years as a photographer for French Vogue
would shoo away overly fastidious fashion editors who tried to make
immaculate his settings _ fussing with a stray flower, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best pictures always have a little mess _ a dirty ashtray,
something,'' he said. And when he was asked by Diana Vreeland, the
editor in chief of American Vogue, to photograph interiors, he was
equally adept at recognizing the details that brought out the
inhabitants' personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cravats around the carafes of wine at the Rothschilds'
house in Mouton,'' mused Mrs. Vreeland in 1984. ``The Duke of
Windsor's red leather dispatch box marked `The King.' When those
pictures came in, I went berserk. I'd be intoxicated for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger of two sons of a well-to-do hardware merchant, Horst
Paul Albert Bohrmann was born Aug. 14, 1906, in the eastern German
town of Weiseenfels-an-der-Saale. Although he seldom bothered to
use his surname even as a fledgling photographer among an
expatriate crowd in Paris in the early 30s, he formally dropped it
in 1943, after he had become an American citizen, so as not to be
confused with the Nazi official Martin Bormann. He legally changed
his name to Horst P. Horst.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat indolent youth who gravitated toward artists and
actors, Horst initially wanted to be an architect, and was accepted
by LeCorbusier as an apprentice in the Bauhaus architect's studio
in Paris. But in Paris he soon met Hoyningen-Huene, whose father
had been chief equerry to Czar Nicholas II, and his life took a
different course.
</P>
<P>
   Through Hoyningen-Huene, Horst met Cecil Beaton, who in turned
introduced him to Charles James, the Chicago-born dressmaker. Horst
was to spend a productive decade in the glittering orbit of the
interior designer Jean-Michel Frank, the writer Janet Flanner, the
set designer Bebe Berard, and, course, Chanel, whom Horst called
``the queen of the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He left for America in the late summer of 1939, shortly after
taking what would be one of his most enduring images _ of a model,
bathed in deep shadows, wearing an unraveling corset. He said the
picture summed up his feelings about an era's end. ``While I was
taking it,'' he said, ``I was thinking of all that I was leaving
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to have a successful career as a photographer for
American Vogue, though, in the 1960s, when editors demanded more
lifelike shots of models running and skipping, he fell out of
favor. Still, he continued to find work, shooting interiors as well
as portraits and advertising images for Seventh Avenue designers
like Bill Blass and Calvin Klein, for whom he used his sense of
drama and elegance to light socks.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his son, Horst had no survivors.  &QL;

LONDON COMPANY TO BUY REGAL HOTELS IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A London real estate company has agreed to buy the 28 Regal
hotels in the United States for about $253 million plus the
assumption of $387 million in debt from Regal Hotels International
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The hotels include the Regal U.N. Plaza in Manhattan, the Regal
Biltmore in Los Angeles, the Regal Bostonian in Boston and the
Regal McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale, Ariz. Regal is a unit of
Paliburg Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate company, Millennium &AMP; Copthorne, which is traded
on the London stock exchange, is 52.4 percent owned by CDL Hotels
International, which is headquartered in Singapore and listed on
the Hong Kong exchange. CDL is a unit of the Hong Leong Group.
</P>
<P>
   Kwek Leng Beng, the chairman of both CDL and Millennium &AMP;
Copthorne, said, ``The Regal purchase enables the group to acquire
in a single stroke a substantial presence in the world's largest
hotel market, thereby fulfilling our publicly stated ambition of
becoming a truly global hotel operator.''
</P>
<P>
   Millennium and Copthorne already owns 42 percent of the Plaza
and has interests in the Millennium Broadway and the Millennium
Hilton, all in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Other hotels in its latest acquisition are located in Chicago,
Minneapolis and St. Louis, among other major business centers. All
of those hotels, which eventually will be renamed Millennium, are
upscale properties with conference rooms, fitness clubs, swimming
pools and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   An additional eight hotels in the package announced Thursday are
full service hotels operating under such brand names as Comfort
Inn, Clarion and Four Points. The remaining eight properties are
limited service hotels. David Cook, the finance director of
Millennium &AMP; Copthorne, said in a telephone interview that the
company would assess the performance and standards of each hotel
and would probably sell some of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the year ended Dec. 31, 1998, Regal hotels in the United
States had after-tax profit of $22.5 million on revenue of $265.9
million. Millennium &AMP; Copthorne's profit in 1998 _ a year in which
it owned only 24 hotels _ was $98.2 million on revenues of $360.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Including the pending Regal acquisition, Millennium &AMP; Copthorne
will have spent more than $1 billion in less than a year to acquire
hotels, more than doubling their number to 117 and doubling the
number of rooms to 30,571. Among its acquisition were 43 hotels in
Asia and the Pacific, acquired from its parent company, CDL.
Earlier this month it acquired the 673-room Seoul Hilton Hotel for
$228.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we knew if we wanted to be a truly global player,'' Cook
said, ``we would have to play in the biggest market in the world,
and the biggest market is the USA.''

 LANOUE DAVENPORT, 77, EXPERT IN EARLY MUSIC AND INSTRUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LaNoue Davenport, a pioneering figure in the revival of early
music and period instruments and a former leader of the acclaimed
ensemble New York Pro Musica and the American Recorder Society,
died on Nov. 4 at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. He was
77 and had been suffering from emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   Little in Davenport's youth suggested that he would one day be
involved with medieval and Renaissance music. Born in Dallas on
Jan. 26, 1922, Davenport began his musical career playing the
trumpet in small jazz bands. He earned a double scholarship in
basketball and music to Texas Christian University. Later he
enlisted in the Navy, serving in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   During these years he was recruited to play the trumpet in
Claude Thornhill's band, which toured from ship to ship
entertaining crew members. After the war he moved to New York,
where his elder brother, Pembroke, a director of musicals (``Kiss
Me, Kate'') helped him get work in Broadway pit bands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Davenport enrolled in the New York College of Music,
where he became a protege of the German composer and musicologist
Erich Katz, who introduced him to early music. In 1953 he began
playing with the newly formed New York Pro Musica, directed by Noah
Greenberg. He assumed the directorship after Greenberg's death in
1966, though in 1970, he formed his own ensemble, Music for a
While, taking some Pro Musica players with him.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's association with the American Recorder Society began
in the late 1940s. He edited the society's newsletter during the
1950s and became its first national president in 1960.
Concurrently, in 1957, he founded and directed the Manhattan
Recorder Consort.
</P>
<P>
   Atypically for champions of early music on period instruments,
Davenport encouraged his musicians to include contemporary works on
programs. Under his leadership, concerts by the Manhattan Recorder
Consort often included music by Hindemith, Britten and other
20th-century composers along with medieval and Renaissance works.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He served on the faculty of Sarah Lawrence College and was also
a noted arranger and editor of early music.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is survived by his wife, the soprano Sheila
Schonbrun-Davenport of Stony Point, N.Y.; their two sons, Stefan
and Chester; two sons from his first marriage, Darius and Mark; and
six grandchildren.

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ As scores of students were busily
constructing a wooden tower for Texas A&AMP;M University's traditional
football bonfire, the massive 40-foot structure collapsed early
Thursday morning, killing at least nine students beneath a deadly
rubble of logs, some as large as telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
   Even as rescuers continued working into the night, the death
toll seemed likely to rise; officials said that two missing
students, a man and a woman, were buried beneath the pyramid-shaped
wreckage, apparently dead. Throughout the day, more than a hundred
students wearing hard hats and local firefighters carefully picked
through the rubble, rescuing several students who had been trapped
for hours. At least 28 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where football is often described as a secular
religion, the news prompted immediate and widespread grieving as
many television and radio stations interrupted regular programming
to broadcast the rescue efforts. The bonfire is a 90-year-old Texas
A&AMP;M tradition held on the eve of the school's Thanksgiving weekend
game against its archrival, the University of Texas, and this year
it had been scheduled for Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 2:28 a.m., an hour that might seem
unusual, but traditionally students work round-the-clock on the
tower during the week leading up to the game. Officials said the
logs collapsed during a shift change by the student workers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ray Bowen, the university president, said investigators had
not yet determined the cause of the accident, and officials refused
to confirm reports that a 55-foot center pole had snapped, saying
that experts would work into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great tragedy,'' said Bowen, noting that the bonfire
will now be canceled. ``Everyone is brokenhearted.''
</P>
<P>
   Late into the evening, hundreds of people at the floodlit site,
waiting for news of those missing, silently watched as cranes
methodically plucked logs off the pile.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, campaigning out of state for the Republican
presidential nomination, expressed his sadness and offered his
condolences to the families of the dead. His father, former
President Bush, whose presidential library is on the campus, joined
university officials to lead a memorial service Thursday evening
inside the school's basketball arena. More than 10,000 people
listened to the school's singing cadets sing the school song.
</P>
<P>
   Though most universities enjoy the allegiance and loyalty of
their students and alumni, few schools elicit the sort of lifelong
passion common at Texas A&AMP;M. Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a Texas A&AMP;M
alumnus who worked on the construction crews as a student, said the
bonfire was a symbol of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary coming together of the student body
to build this bonfire,'' Perry said, in explaining the sentiment
many Aggies, as students and alumni are known, hold for the
bonfire. ``It is very much a part of Aggie lore and traditions and
values. It represents great teamwork. It represents friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Students at the scene described a horrible collapse in the
early-morning hours when much of the campus was sleeping. Tommy
Balez, 20, an electrical engineering student who started working on
the pyramid around midnight, had taken a break about 50 yards away
when he heard a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a loud crack, then another loud crash when it went
over,'' Balez said. He spent more than 12 hours as part of a rescue
team. ``I'm staying until I know everybody is out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Lawson, an acting university spokeswoman, denied any
speculation that carousing by students might have contributed to
the collapse. ``There was no horsing around,'' she said. ``This is
very serious business. They were working, not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Thompson, a Texas A&AMP;M staff member assigned as a student
adviser on the bonfire project, who visited the site at about 10:30
Wednesday night, said he saw no indications at that time of any
problems. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, he said,
``There was no indication of anything unusual. It apparently
collapsed without warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students apparently told rescue officials that the center
log snapped at the beginning of the collapse. Thompson said the
center pole is actually two poles bolted together and wrapped in
about 600 feet of steel cable.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a day plagued by heat and dust, hundreds of rescue
workers labored as cranes and bulldozers picked delicately through
the wreckage. ``We're not sure what might be holding up what, and
the crew has to be meticulous at what they're doing,'' said Dr. Kem
Bennett, director of Texas Task Force One, a statewide emergency
rescue unit. ``This is far worse than in a building collapse in
that the structure twisted as it collapsed and all of the pieces
are tangled together.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams of about a dozen male and female students in hard hats
worked quietly, hoisting logs the size of telephone poles onto
their shoulders and moving them away from the collapsed structure.
At different times rescuers detected tapping noises and followed
the sounds toward trapped students. Officials said the last rescue
occurred at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a game of pick-up sticks. The logs are all
intertwined. It's a slow process, very meticulous,''' said Bart
Humphreys, public information officer for the College Station fire
department.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the yellow police tape, several hundred students hugged
and consoled one another, their dust-streaked faces also streaked
with tears. Several female students pinned white ribbons to shirts,
while others stood in a circle saying prayers. Everyone seemed
shocked and horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine what I saw when I came here last night,''
said Will Hurd, the student body president. ``Bonfire started as a
symbol of our burning desire to support our football team and
defeat our rival in the state, the University of Texas. It has now
turned into an act of kinship, an act of love, and an act of
friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for Texas A&AMP;M, the nation's third-largest public
land-grant university with more than 43,000 students, the bonfire
is a revered tradition, and some students said Thursday that it
should be held despite the accident. The first was set ablaze in
1909, and until now the tradition had been interrupted only once,
after the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. In 1994, the
structure collapsed after torrential rains caused the ground to
shift, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   University officials estimate that harvesting the logs and
building the bonfire structure involves 125,000 work hours by about
5,000 students. Students take training classes to participate in
the harvest _ or the cut, as it is known on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Cranes and tractors lift the logs, which are then tied together
with baling wire. The structure, which this year would have
included about 7,000 logs, is designed to twist inward and collapse
on itself as it burns.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1970, when school officials limited the height of the
structure to 55 feet, students had built towers as high as 110
feet.
</P>
<P>
   This year, construction began on Nov. 5 when the guiding center
pole was placed in the ground. In keeping with tradition, student
guards have since patrolled the site 24 hours a day. Traditionally,
the week before the bonfire is known as Push, as in pushing to
finish the job, and students were working in round-the-clock shifts
to complete the tower. Before the accident, students had erected
about 40 feet of the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Often teased for its traditions by outsiders, particularly
anyone affiliated with the University of Texas, Texas A&AMP;M students
and alumni say traditions like the bonfire create a bond and a
kinship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to view the world through maroon-colored glasses,''
said Brent Adam, a New York stock trader who oversees an alumni
group known as the Wall Street Aggies. He said news of the accident
had quickly spread among alumni everywhere. ``I've had people from
all sides of the planet e-mail today,'' Adam said.

MCCAIN ON STUMP MISSES SENATE VOTES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain wasn't there when the Senate voted on raising
the minimum wage and cutting business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't around to vote on an African and Carribean trade
package, or to weigh in on the use of leg traps in wildlife
refuges, or restricting credit-card ownership by people under 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator missed votes on whether to condemn President
Clinton for granting clemency to Puerto Rico nationalists, or to
symbolically endorse the ``Roe vs. Wade'' decision legalizing
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigns hard for the GOP presidential nomination, McCain
is missing votes more frequently than anyone in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He is proving the adage that you can't be two places at once.
Quite often, he's opting to be in New Hampshire, South Carolina and
other key primary states instead of on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has a history and tradition of solid attendance, and
McCain, until this year, was no exception. In 1998, senators
participated in an average of 97.4 percent of 314 recorded votes,
and McCain came in at 94 percent, according to ``Congressional
Quarterly.'' Sixteen senators didn't miss a single vote last year.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this year is different for McCain, who has emerged as
the leading alternative to GOP presidential front-runner George W.
Bush. From July 1 to Oct. 1, a particularly busy campaign period,
McCain missed 41 of 108 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever possible, he tries to make it back for the major
legislative votes, but unfortunately that's not always feasible,
given the hectic travel schedule and demands of a presidential
candidate,'' McCain spokeswoman Nancy Ives said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain missed the opening of his South Carolina campaign
headquarters so he could be in Washington to vote on a GOP tax
bill, Ives said. He also was absent from several town meetings in
New Hampshire so he could vote on a partial-birth abortion ban, and
his wife, Cindy, hosted the meetings in his place.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is doubtless receiving few accommodations from Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, the key player in the scheduling of
important votes. Lott and McCain have disagreed for years over
McCain's legislation to reform the campaign-finance system, and the
battle seemed to turn personal this past year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the absences, McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, has shepherded through legislation encouraging
businesses to correct Y2K problems and helped negotiate an
agreement for a TV ratings system, his staff said. He pushed for
congressional approval for an environmental and habitat restoration
project along the Salt River.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who lacks Bush's large campaign bankroll, is often away
because he is relying on campaigning and television appearances to
compensate for the Texas governor's huge money advantage.
</P>
<P>
   This year, McCain has appeared more frequently than any of his
colleagues on the Sunday news shows, so far with 24 appearances,
according to ``Roll Call,'' the Capitol Hill newspaper. He has
undertaken two national book tours to promote his bestseller,
``Faith of My Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether McCain will come under criticism
for his Senate absences, or whether voters will be understanding.
</P>
<P>
   He is not up for Senate re-election until 2004. His 1998
campaign opponent, Democrat Ed Ranger, unsuccessfully sought to use
McCain's presidential ambitions against him, suggesting he would
abandon voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what he's doing? He's running for president,'' Ranger
said last October, a few months before McCain announced formation
of a presidential exploratory committee. ``He's going to roll all
that money into a presidential fund the day after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain easily defeated Ranger in the election. McCain did
eventually transfer $1.9 million in leftover contributions from his
Senate campaign into his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the votes McCain missed were not close enough, at
least in the final tally, for McCain's absence to have made an
appreciable difference.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the votes he missed were on lightweight issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the minimum-wage debate, for example, the Senate voted on
Nov. 9 for a package of business tax cuts, and raised the hourly
wage by $1 to $6.15. The vote was 54-44.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier the same day, the Senate rejected, by a vote of 50-48,
an alternative Democratic plan that would have raised the minimum
wage more swiftly than the GOP intended.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was steaming mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how members who voted for their own pay increase
but against our minimum-wage proposal will be able to face their
constituents and explain their actions,'' Kennedy said, according
to the ``Washington Post''.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, there was a different sort of problem. He has to
explain not how he voted on the minimum-wage bill, but rather why
he didn't vote on it. &QL;

ELEVEN KILLED IN COLLAPSE OF BONFIRE FRAMEWORK AT TEXAS A&AMP;M

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The pyramid framework for one of Texas
A&AMP;M's oldest celebrations _ the Aggie Bonfire _ crumbled in a heap
of cascading logs before dawn Thuursday, killing at least eleven
students and raising cries to eliminate one of college football's
greatest traditions.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen other Aggies were injured in the collapse,
several critically.
</P>
<P>
   University President Ray Bowen called the accident ``a great
tragedy'' and ``probably the single worst'' incident in A&AMP;M
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is broken-hearted about what happened,'' said Bowen,
who canceled the bonfire lighting, which was scheduled for
Thanksgiving night, on the eve of A&AMP;M's game with archrival
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Texas Aggie family and the world, this has been a day
of unspeakable grief and sorrow,'' Bowen said last night at a
40-minute memorial service attended by more than 16,000 people at
Reed Arena on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to cope with this tremendous loss of life and
the pain and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the service were Lt. Gov. Rick Perry and former
President George Bush, whose presidential library is at A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie Bonfire dates back to 1909 and annually attracts tens
of thousands of spectators. It has been canceled only once before _
after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November
1963.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen declined to say whether the bonfire will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important tradition to us,'' he said, ``but those
decisions must be made at a calmer time.''
</P>
<P>
   A group calling itself Aggies Against Bonfire has called in the
past for the abolition of the event, saying it wastes resources,
pollutes the air and contributes to dozens of injuries and
alcohol-related arrests each year.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Turner, editor of the student newspaper ``The
Battalion,'' said some of the university's 43,000 students
questioned about the bonfire yesterday said ``it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonfire is one of the most sacred traditions to Texas A&AMP;M's
campus,'' said Turner, 20, a Fort Worth high school graduate.
``It's one of the status symbols of our university. People say this
is historic because this is the end of Bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay Barrington, a 21-year-old senior, said the bonfire should be
lighted as scheduled next week as a tribute to those who were
killed building it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they died to build it,'' Barrington told The
Associated Press. ``They wouldn't want it to just get put away.
They'd want it to burn.''
</P>
<P>
   To erect what would have been this year's 55-foot tall bonfire
of about 7,000 logs, students spent several weeks cutting logs into
about 10-foot lengths that were hoisted with the aid of cranes and
tractors. The logs then were bound together, three at a time, with
baling wire to form what resembles a tiered wedding cake.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the students who were building the bonfire framework nor
the faculty adviser could explain why it collapsed with about 70
students on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out here about 10:30 last night and I did not see
anything that would indicate trouble,'' said Rusty Thompson, the
faculty adviser to the project. ``There was no indication to me
that there was anything different or unusual about last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M sophomore Diana Estrada told AP that she was about 200
yards from the stack when it fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just toppled over, and the wires snapped and the lights
started sparking and going on and off,'' she said. ``We ran over
there as fast as we could, and we could see legs sticking out and
hear people screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Jerry Self, a sophomore engineering technology major
from Arlington, Texas; Chad Powell, a first-year computer
engineering major from Keller, Texas; Jeremy Frampton of Turlock,
Calif; Bryan McClain from San Antonio; Christopher Breen from
Austin, Texas; Nathan Scott West from Bellaire, Texas; Jamie Hand
from Henderson, Texas; Lucas Kimmel from Corpus Christi, Texas;
Christopher Lee Heard from Houston; and two students whose bodies
were recovered late Thursday night and whose identities were not
released.
</P>
<P>
   Three students were in critical condition, one was in serious
condition and three in fair condition at St. Joseph Regional Health
Center. Another 18 students were treated for minor injuries and
released.
</P>
<P>
   At College Station Medical Center, one student was in critical
condition and two were admitted with broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   Several students who had completed their shifts building the
bonfire framework said they heard about the accident after
returning to their dorm rooms and raced to the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really couldn't do anything,'' said Matt Heidrick, 18, of
Tyler. ``The fire department was already here.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidrick and Caleb Richers, 18, of Bryan said everything
appeared normal when they left the construction about midnight.
</P>
<P>
   `We were crawling all over it,'' Richers said. ``I would have
never had any idea that something like this was about to happen. It
all looked normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan McDaniel, a 19-year-old freshman from DeSoto, Texas, said
he was standing some distance from the construction when he heard a
snapping noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unmistakable,'' McDaniel said. ``You could hear the
creaking, snapping sound and then the screams. There were screams
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel's roommate, Adam Brzozowski, 19, from DeSoto, was
several hundred yards away when he heard the same sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a creak and then it just tipped over like a stack of
cards,'' Brzozowski said. ``If you were on the wrong side, there
was nothing you could do about it. You were just trapped.''
</P>
<P>
   The university's police department will head the investigation
into the accident, and a number of engineering and construction
firms statewide have offered help in analyzing how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Early speculation centered on the integrity of the so-called
center pole, the largest log, which is steel-reinforced, in the
middle of the structure. But officials said it was too early to
know whether the pole broke during the fall or whether a break
caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said there was no horseplay at the time of the
collapse, and he dismissed criticism that no full-time university
employee was at the site. (MORE)

FORMER N.Y. CITY OFFICIAL CHARGED WITH SETTING OFF STINK BOMBS IN
PLANES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former New York City health official was charged on
Thursday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn with assaulting and
intimidating Trans World Airlines crew members last year after
detonating stink bombs on a flight taking off in New York and one
departing from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The former official, Victor E. Botnick, 45, set off a stink bomb
under his seat on TWA Flight 925 during takeoff from Charles De
Gaulle Airport on Aug. 1, 1998, according to court papers. The
searing fumes made crew members and passengers teary-eyed, forcing
the plane to return to the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days later, court papers said, Botnick set off another
stink bomb as TWA Flight 924 took off from Kennedy International
Airport. This time, two crew members checked beneath Botnick's seat
and found glass shards and a wet area reeking of burning rubber,
according to the papers.
</P>
<P>
   The court papers said that Botnick, a frequent flyer on TWA, had
become angry after the airline inadvertently canceled his family's
reservations on a flight to Israel to celebrate his son's Bar
Mitzvah in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Botnick, a resident of Yonkers, N.Y., was released yesterday on
$150,000 bond. Federal Magistrate Roanne L. Mann instructed Botnick
to stay away from airports and airplanes unless he received
specific approval from the court.
</P>
<P>
   Botnick, who was accompanied by his wife, Lee, glared at
reporters as he left the courtroom and said ``no comment'' to
questions. When a reporter tried to follow him, he turned around
and said ``Did you understand? No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 80s, Botnick served as a special assistant and confidante
to Mayor Edward I. Koch. He resigned as the head of the municipal
hospital system in 1986 after admitting that he had falsely claimed
to be a college graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Gina L. Mendola, Botnick's lawyer, said the charges against him
were ``trumped up'' to support a separate federal investigation in
New Jersey. ``There is not a great deal of evidence against my
client,'' she said in court, but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia M. Monaco, the assisant U.S. attorney who is handling
the case against Botnick in Brooklyn, confirmed that he was being
investigated by the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey on a
separate matter, but denied that there was any connection. Michael
Drewniak, a spokesman for the attorney's office in New Jersey, said
there were no charges against Botnick at this time, but declined to
comment further.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's hearing, Ms. Monaco requested that Botnick, who is
unemployed, undergo a psychiatric evaluation. The court denied the
request after Botnick's lawyer objected, but ordered him to
continue psychiatric counseling with his own doctor.

   ``These students who work on the bonfire are adults,'' Thompson
said. ``They have a lot of background and experience. They have
on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Crowell, 19, of Houston was supposed to have been working
on the bonfire at the time of the accident, but said he had skipped
the first few hours of his shift to watch the annual Leonids meteor
shower.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was leaving his dorm room for the site about 3 a.m.
when he heard a siren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard one siren, which I just dismissed,'' he said. ``But
then I started hearing more as I was walking through campus. And I
topped that hill right there and saw it down. Dust was flying and
all the lights had been knocked out. I just tried to help people,
because it was just chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bowen canceled this year's bonfire, he said he feels
the need to come up with something else for the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're dealing with the loss of our students,'' he
said. ``But within the next 48 hours, we're going to have to take a
look at this. We need to think about an alternate event to bond the
Aggie community.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris DeChillo, a junior from Austin, worked through the
afternoon with members of his unit in the Corps of Cadets, moving
logs out of the way. He stopped long enough to consider whether the
bonfire was worth it and, like many students, he staunchly defended
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what A&AMP;M is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie football team canceled practice Thursday and showed up
to help clear the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more important than any game or any practice,'' said
Chris Valletta, a starting offensive guard.
</P>
<P>
   Head football coach R.C. Slocum toured the site about 4:30 p.m.
and said the entire team had helped in the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M is a special place. The loyalty that Aggies feel for each
other is what we're all going to have to rely on to get through
this tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum called the bonfire ``an exercise in young people working
together. It's something that's been very, very good for A&AMP;M.''

NBC'S `Y2K' A REAL DISASTER FOR VIEWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Reviews of CBS' ``Sarah, Plain and Tall: Winter's End,'' 
 HBO's ``RKO 281'' and PBS' ``Shooting the Past'' follow. Check 
 local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Olin should be enjoying his fourth season as the star of
``EZ Streets,'' but instead he's made a garbage movie for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, airing Sunday, is ``Y2K,'' a typically artless
disaster movie in which the villain is the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Olin is a government computer expert and rugged action hero who
is shocked, appalled and yet strangely laid-back when all hell
breaks loose on New Year's Eve 1999.
</P>
<P>
   An F-18 crashes in the Marshall Islands, bodies pile up at a
Swedish nuclear power plant, the Champs-Elysees and Times Square go
dark, computer-controlled cell doors swing open at maximum-security
prisons, an airliner is in trouble over Washington, D.C., and it's
minutes to meltdown at a nuclear plant near Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I suspect, it's tough logging onto AOL.
</P>
<P>
   So the producers and writers have assembled their inventory of
everything that can go wrong, Y2K-wise, and made it all go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Not that NBC would want to alarm anybody. ``This program does
not suggest or imply that any of these events could actually
happen,'' says a cautionary warning at the movie's start.
</P>
<P>
   Given the level of believability on TV shows today, the warning
should be superimposed over most shows.
</P>
<P>
   But only a perfect imbecile would get revved over a movie this
horridly unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, in one moment Olin is at Dulles airport in Washington
to save the airliner. It's several minutes past midnight, Eastern
time. A scene later, he's in Tacoma, Wash., before midnight Pacific
time.
</P>
<P>
   I figure he's had 2 1/2 hours, tops, to fly 2,400 miles, east to
west, with or without in-flight beverage service.
</P>
<P>
   Possible? Yeah, but a viewer might expect some rudimentary
explanation. There is none. Did you know that TV movies in the
1990s are written by monkeys? Is that a secret?
</P>
<P>
   The final words spoken in this predictable sweeps month
monstrosity: ``I think something's wrong in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh really.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-0- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While NBC implies and suggests Mach speed, CBS slows time for
Sunday's Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation of ``Sarah, Plain and
Tall: Winter's End.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the third installment in the popular ``Sarah'' saga,
stretching back to the original TV movie in 1991. Glenn Close is
back as the mail-order bride of a taciturn Kansas farmer
(Christopher Walken).
</P>
<P>
   By ``Winter's End,'' she's his longtime wife. It's March 1918.
The Great War drums on in Europe, and the influenza epidemic rages
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Enter a stranger (Jack Palance) who claims to be Walken's
long-lost father. And, in fact, is. The dramatic conflict is that
Walken despises him because the father walked out on his family
when Walken was a child.
</P>
<P>
   The movie belongs to Palance. The big galoot is bent, scrawny,
white-maned and craggy-faced, but he remains a formidable screen
presence. In a deftly turned performance, he's a man willing to own
up to his flawed past, but unwilling to sacrifice his pride.
</P>
<P>
   This movie might even give Palance a chance to do for the Emmys
what he did for the Oscars in 1993, though one-armed push-ups might
be out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter's End'' is the kind of low-key, wholesome entertainment
that clicks best with the approach of the holidays. It won't
challenge the brain. But it'll warm the cockles. It might even cock
the warmles.
</P>

<P>
   HBO's ``RKO 281,'' showing Saturday, is a pretty picture with a
splendid cast and not a lot to say. Still, it's entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a 1996 PBS documentary about the battle
over ``Citizen Kane,'' and the HBO title refers to the production
number of ``Citizen Kane'' at the RKO studio.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's based on a documentary, the first significant scene
in the movie is a fabrication. It places Orson Welles (Liev
Schreiber) at a San Simeon dinner party in 1940. A little verbal
joust with his host, William Randolph Hearst (James Cromwell),
leads to ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfectly suicidal,'' Welles' friend and future ``Citizen
Kane'' collaborator Herman Mankiewicz (John Malkovich) says of the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll scorch the earth,'' Welles tells him. ``We'll astonish
them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie also features Melanie Griffith as Hearst's mistress,
Marion Davies; Brenda Blethyn as Hearst gossip columnist Louella
Parsons; and Roy Scheider as RKO studio head George Schaefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``RKO 281'' was filmed, of all places, in London. Studio sets
and London locales, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, were
used to re-create the Hearst castle at San Simeon. Really, there
aren't many locales in the film, but the San Simeon knock-off is
sumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   The cast and visual treats keep ``RKO 281'' interesting, so much
so that viewers might not even notice the absence of a point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   Welles is bratty; Hearst is arrogant, though with a tender side
toward Davies. We knew that, and the movie amounts to an
eye-catching but ultimately dry retelling of a familiar story.
</P>
<P>
   And where did ``Rosebud'' come from? The story has been around a
long time, and ``RKO 281'' seizes on it. It was rumored to be
Hearst's pet name for his favorite part of Davies' anatomy. Hearing
that it'll turn up in ``Citizen Kane'' is what really burns
Hearst's toast in this film.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting the Past,'' written and directed by British dramatist
Stephen Poliakoff, posts a wonderful first installment on ``Mobil
Masterpiece Theatre'' Sunday on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The last half, a week later, droops narratively and strains
credibility. But ``Shooting the Past'' is a divertingly offbeat
little story about a clash between settled values and modern life.
</P>
<P>
   It takes place at a quiet photo archive in London, where an
oddball staff preserves a mammoth collection of 10 million
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble ensues when an American entrepreneur (Liam Cunningham)
buys the building to convert it into a business college. Most of
the photos will have to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The staff, headed by a thoroughly civil manager (Lindsay Duncan)
and an eccentric genius of a curator (Timothy Spall), has one week
to thwart the plan or find a new home for all those photographs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a delicious story with all sorts of symbolic ramifications.
And Spall (``Secrets and Lies'') drips with conspirational sabotage
as he takes viewers into his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But there are drawbacks. Poliakoff takes liberties in resolving
his story, and there's a piece of sore-thumb casting. Cunningham is
a British actor hog-tied by an American accent, or approximation of
one.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him try to inhabit the ill-fitting role is, by itself,
sardonically entertaining.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In this age of computer simulation and instant
global communication, some things must still be done the
old-fashioned way. Getting the president's signature on a piece of
paper is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   So when Congress passes resolutions to continue government
operations until a budget is approved, someone has to take those
resolutions in hand and give them to President Clinton for signing.
With the president in Turkey, some people have had to do a lot of
flying this week.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress passed a continuing resolution on Wednesday to
keep several major departments going, a member of the White House
legislative affairs office boarded a plane that departed from
Washington around 9 that night.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was delayed, but the resolution was signed by Clinton
just before midnight on Thursday night in Turkey, or shortly before
5 p.m. Washington time, with seven hours to spare before the
resolution expired.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the White House chief of staff, John Podesta,
was to fly to Greece, where the president will be on Friday, to get
his signature on a continuing resolution passed on Thursday and
good until early December.

 &HT;    Makings of bonfire tumble down on Texas A&AMP;M students, killing 9
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Caleb Hill was on the stack when it all
came down and with it, possibly, an end to the most venerated
tradition at the core of Texas A&AMP;M University: the ceremonial,
Texas-sized bonfire built and set ablaze before the big game
against the University of Texas every year.
</P>
<P>
   Nine students died, 28 were injured, three critically, after the
unfinished 40-foot pyramid of post oak and cedar elm collapsed here
about 2:30 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two more people remained buried in the pile late Thursday as a
large crowd, a mix of the mournful and the curious, turned out to
watch on a windy, dusty night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know whether they are dead or alive,'' said Cindy
Lawson, A&AMP;M's executive director of university relations. ``It's
going to be a long night, guys. They're trying to be very careful
for people who are inside the stack. They have not been able to
communicate with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse recast an exuberant school activity bursting with
anticipation and intrastate gridiron rivalry as an unfathomable
tragedy that leaves a pair of looming questions the community was
too stunned to even contemplate answering: How could it have
happened, and is this how the bonfire ends?
</P>
<P>
   There will be none this year, only the second time since 1909 _
the other being 1963, following the assassination of John F.
Kennedy in Dallas. Traditionally, scores of students work
throughout the fall on the project, cutting and loading logs,
installing the center pole, constructing the cakelike stack slowly
before ``Push'' (when the effort becomes out of necessity a
24-hour-a-day affair), followed by the installation of an outhouse
at the top, and finally, after a season of waiting, the lighting of
the fire. Much of this proceeds with the knack for exaggerated
ceremony and esprit-building for which Aggies are both admired and
made the butt of jokes.
</P>
<P>
   News of the accident shot through one of the nation's most
obsessively in-touch alumni networks at Internet speed.
</P>

   ``The tentacles of Texas A&AMP;M go into practically every
community,'' said Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a 1972 A&AMP;M graduate and a
yell leader and bonfire stack leader in his senior year. ``There is
a lot of grieving in Texas today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, a Yale undergrad, became emotional during a
CNN interview, saying, ``It's sad, it's tough.'' The presidential
library and museum of Bush's father, George Bush, is on the A&AMP;M
campus.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, blood-donors, many of them in Aggie colors, descended
on the Blood and Tissue Center of Central Texas in triple the
number on a typical Thursday. And More than 300 people gathered for
a vigil on the south steps of the Capitol on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the scene, witnesses described the normal work proceeding
apace, then, in the blink of an eye, bedlam as tons of logs _ the
finished structure, at a planned 55 feet, would have weighed at
least 5.4 million pounds, or 2,700 tons _ collapsed on the working
students.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was atop the lowest level, tethered by ropes to the center
pole when the stack fell. His job had been to straddle a new log
and to guide it into place as a pulley lifted it up. Then he would
wire the log with baling wire at the top to keep it in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just wired the log,'' Hill said. ``Twenty seconds later,
I heard a large, thundering crack.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked up and saw that the center pole to which he was he was
tethered was leaning away from him. The force of the quaking stack
jerked him up towards the top. He was slammed into the pile,
cracking a wrist and breaking his nose. Students _ about 70 of them
at the time, either on the stack or the perimeter _ scrambled or
jumped. Typically, the only nonstudents working on the site are
crane operators from local construction companies that donate both
machinery and manpower.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after rescue workers arrived, so did hundreds of
students.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn, the first 25 injured students had been carried to
hospitals. Four were already confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then began the delicate and exhaustive search through the pile.
Using three cranes, emergency crews gingerly removed the logs one
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like pick-up sticks,'' said Bart Humphreys, with College
Station Fire/EMS. ``All of the logs are intertwined.''
</P>
<P>
   At mid-morning, the scene was uncommonly quiet as mute students
gathered outside the yellow crime-scene tape. Some wept. Some
prayed. Some whispered to one another. Some called family and
friends on cell phones. Others sat alone, away from the
destruction, just waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 9 a.m. two students, still alive, were removed
from the rubble and taken to the hospital. It had taken workers
four hours to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, workers began using sonar equipment
used in earthquakes to locate people in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson implored onlookers to be still to avoid disrupting the
motion detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you care about these kids, stop walking,'' Lawson shouted.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 minutes, the only noise was the whir of television truck
engines, helicopters overhead and the wind flapping the crime-scene
tape.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference minutes later, Lawson choked a little as
she declared: ``Yeah, there are some sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   She said authorities had heard moaning and tapping but they
couldn't discern if it was one person or two. At the time, five
remained unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   As the logs were peeled off the pile, somber squads of helmeted
bonfire builders carried them away.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the builders who survived stayed for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get them to go home, get something to eat and
rest,'' said A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted student, head on helmet, slept in the fetal
position as reporters and on-lookers walked around him.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the university began its official investigation into
what caused the accident, independent theories were advanced
throughout the day. Hill believes the structure's center pole
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Thompson, the faculty bonfire adviser since 1990, said
there are two visible cracks but no evidence yet that the center
pole snapped first, turning a carefully constructed pile into
deadly debris. He said everything appeared fine when he last
inspected the stack about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras on two campus buildings were Webcasting the
construction, university officials said, but one of the pair broke
about two weeks ago and it was unclear if the second recorded the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The local religious community responded with no fewer than three
prayer services Thursday, while area hospitals treated young people
who ought to have been the picture of physical well-being. Bryan
and College Station's two hospitals worked on the wounded. Bruised,
dust-covered students waited in hospital lobbies with anxious
parents, awaiting treatment and news.
</P>
<P>
   A large knot jutting rudely from the side of her head,
20-year-old Lauren Scanlan sat outside the St. Joseph Regional
Health Center struggling to remember what happened in the moments
before the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a swing on the first stack and I realized the logs
were swaying and I thought just one log was out of place. I looked
up and more were moving, and I thought it would stop but it
didn't,'' said Scanlan, a sophomore who suffered a broken nose and
several large cuts and scrapes on her face and arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking I needed to push my swing away from the
stack but I don't know if I did. The next thing I knew I couldn't
see. One of my contacts had fallen out and I was bleeding. I was
stumbling around and one of my friends grabbed me and walked me
out. Other than that, I don't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, freshman Rachael Hines, 18, was wiring logs at ground
level when the stack gave way. The logs tumbled away from where she
was working. ``The logs started to move so I looked up to my rig
man to tell him to stop the logs from moving and then I realized it
wasn't just my logs moving. Then, we heard a loud crack and it fell
right in front of me,'' Hines said. ``I took off running around to
the right side because my whole dorm was on the side that it fell
on. One of them (a fellow dorm resident) was walking around and one
was unconscious on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of Hines' friends was still unaccounted for as of noon.
</P>
<P>
   The two hospitals in the Bryan-College Station area went on
alert about a half hour after the crash. By early morning, the
hospitals had received more than two dozen students.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire tradition goes back 90 years, although the school
didn't officially sanction it until 1935 _ and only then the
university jumped in because enthusiastic students used an
unfortunate farmer's log barn for materials. Over the years, the
structure was built higher, reaching 109 feet in 1969. The size was
limited to 55 feet high and 45 feet wide. According to ``A
Centennial History of Texas A&AMP;M'' by Henry Dethloff, the bonfire
``symbolizes every Aggie's desire to beat the hell out of Texas on
Thanksgiving Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The only incident that hinted at Thursday's accident was in
1994, when the structure collapsed on one side. No one was hurt,
and university officials determined that the ground, sodden and
unstable from rain, was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   But after the stack claimed nine lives, including one student
who turned 19 only this week, some here openly question the price
of the school's resolute adherence to tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Robert ``Woody'' Peel, a junior who was working on the bonfire,
has had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside looking in, it's one of those hard things to
explain. It's an Aggie thing,'' Peel said. ``But if it costs lives,
I'm not going to be for it unless they find a way to make it 100
times safer. It's too dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the site Thursday afternoon after being patched up, Hill
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is a tragedy that no amount of foresight could
have prevented,'' Hill said. ``Bonfires unite Aggies young and old.
It's a tradition that should not stop.''

 &HT;    UPS charged with insurance fraud
 &HT;    By Rob Modic
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ United Parcel Service customers who bought
insurance for packages for the past 16 years filed a class-action
lawsuit Thursday seeking $42 billion from the country's largest
shipping company.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Montgomery County Common Pleas Court,
claims the Atlanta-based company fraudulently collected fees to pay
insurance for packages with values of more than $100 when the
company was self-insured and that the money collected as insurance
payments was directed to an offshore business owned by UPS
stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   UPS, registered as a corporation in Ohio and New York, acted
illegally as an unlicensed insurance company, according to the
lawsuit, which seeks to invoke Ohio's Corrupt Activities Act and
its triple-damage penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit stems from documents obtained from a federal
government victory against UPS in U.S. Tax Court on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   UPS recently took a $1.44 billion charge in the second quarter
and made a $1.3 billion payment to the government to stop interest
penalties while it considers an appeal of the tax case, said Norman
Black, UPS national spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A Tax Court judge found that UPS must pay taxes on money sent to
a Bermuda-based corporation that was set up as an insurance
company.
</P>
<P>
   Black, who said he had not seen the local lawsuit, countered
that UPS had used Pittsburgh-based insurance company National Union
Fire Insurance Co. to write the insurance for its packages.
</P>
<P>
   National Union Fire Insurance, a co-defendant in the lawsuit,
used Overseas Partners, Ltd., in Bermuda to reinsure what it had
written. OPL is owned by holders of private UPS stock but it is not
a UPS subsidiary, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we followed every state regulation and rule
interpretation and application at the time we were exiting the
insurance business (in 1983),'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Tax Court ruling that found the procedure to
be a ``sham,'' since Oct. 1, UPS has been using a subsidiary,
licensed to write insurance in all 50 states, to write its
insurance on packages it ships.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit details how UPS operated the alleged scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS, in concert with the other defendants herein, instituted a
practice whereby UPS charged . . . a fee which it promised to use
to purchase shippers' property insurance to cover the declared
value over $100 of parcels, but UPS did not remit the fee to an
insurance company for the purchase of insurance,'' the lawsuit
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead . . . the fees paid for insurance premiums . . . were
deposited into UPS accounts and the profits were shared with and/or
invested in an enterprise directed and controlled by UPS and the
other defendants,'' the lawsuit shows.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also shows that the defendants were motivated by an
intent to deprive the shippers of money, and tried to hide the
proceeds by transferring those proceeds out of the United States to
avoid paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Swaim, a Dayton attorney who is one of six Dayton and
Louisville, Ky., attorneys who filed the lawsuit, declined comment
on the allegations in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also cites statements provided in the Tax Court case
that show that in 1984, UPS billed its customers $99.8 million for
insurance and paid out claims of about $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks ``in excess of $14 billion'' in compensatory
damages, but it does not spell out specifically how that amount was
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs include Robert and Melinda Allen and Video Aire
International, all of Fort Worth, Texas; Keilson-Dayton Co., and
Gregg T. Wellinghoff, all of Dayton; Francis A. Bonanno, Inc., and
James G. Bonanno, of Springboro; OH/Penn Inc., and Nicholas J.
Siroki, Springboro.
</P>
<P>
   Also listed as plaintiffs are Randd &AMP; Associates Printing &AMP;
Promotions Inc., and Richard H. Dobson Jr., of Moraine; Marsha J.
Copher; Peterson Electric Supply Co., Louisville, Ky.; Falls City
Electric Supply Inc., of Jeffersonville, Ind.; and J.W. Russell
Electric Co., of Louisville Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants include American International Group, of New
York; AIG Risk Management Inc., of New York; Frank B. Hall
Insurance Brokers of Paramus, N.J.; Prometheus Funding Corp., of
New York and Aon Group Ltd., of Bermuda.

TEN YEARS LATER, CALIGIURI'S FAMED GOAL STILL MEANS A LOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Los Angeles Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri had
no idea that his ``shot-heard-around-the-world'' goal 10 years ago
today would become the most significant moment in American soccer
history.
</P>
<P>
   But without Caligiuri's goal that beat Trinidad &AMP; Tobago 1-0 on
Nov. 19, 1989 _ qualify the United States for the 1990 World Cup _
America probably would not have been allowed to host the 1994 World
Cup, Major League Soccer probably would not exist and scores of
Americans might never have had an opportunity to play professional
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri, preparing for Sunday's MLS Cup championship against
D.C. United, still gets chills when he recalls his miraculous,
30-yard dipping left-footed volley that beat Trinidad &AMP; Tobago in
front of more than 35,000 red-clad fans packed into Port of Spain's
National Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first start in three qualifying matches and we had
only scored one goal in three games prior,'' Caligiuri said.
``Trinidad was unbeaten at home and we knew scoring a goal was
going to be a huge chore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the goal came, Trinidad was getting the best of us at the
time. It was instinctive. I received the ball about 40 yards out,
pushed it forward, but a defender closed me down. I beat him to my
left and just hit it. When I saw it dipping I knew it had a chance.
When it went in, we were all just thrilled to death because a
zero-zero tie meant Trinidad would have advanced instead of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the game was over, what I had done, or what we had done,
started to settle in.''
</P>
<P>
   That lone goal gave the Americans the victory, sending them to
the World Cup in Italy. It was America's first Cup appearance in 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that victory, the U.S. was able to host the 1994
World Cup, which paved the way for Major League Soccer's berth in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what the immediate impact of that goal meant,'' said
Caligiuri, a product of Walnut High and UCLA. ``We were aware of
the fact that Brazil and Mexico were alternative sites for the 1994
World Cup if we didn't qualify in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized a lot of sponsorships were pending on us
qualifying for the World Cup. We also knew that our jobs were on
the line and our salaries would be over in a week or so if we
didn't advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing a few trading cards and posters for fans following
training Thursday in Boston, Caligiuri is still moved by the
effects of that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never changed me as a person,'' he said. ``I never thought
the focus should have been on me. It should have been about what
our team accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to look back and see the impact it's had on soccer here,
it's amazing. To know that I played such a critical role in sports
history ... you can't explain that feeling. It gives you the
chills.''
</P>
<P>
   Others know what it meant for them. D.C. United defender Jeff
Agoos, a three-time MLS All-Star and U.S. national team regular,
might have been working somewhere else had the U.S. tied or lost
that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the goal that set pro soccer in motion
here,'' said Agoos. ``It had huge significance to soccer in the
U.S., propelling us to being a bigger mainstream sport. The three
World Cup appearances since are due to that moment. Cal's goal has
been a catalyst for a lot of things that have happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. was beaten soundly in Italy the next summer, but
qualifying opened doors for rising standouts such as Tab Ramos and
John Harkes to earn contracts overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least half of the things that have happened in U.S. soccer
since would never have occurred if Paul didn't score that goal,''
said Ramos. ``I signed in Spain because somebody saw me play in the
World Cup. If we didn't go to Italy who knows how prepared our team
would have been for the 1994 World Cup? And the impact that our
team made in 1994 (reaching the second round) provided the push to
get this league (MLS) started.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goal was probably the most important moment that we've
had here, at least since I've been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 U.S. team was a collection of unheralded young
Americans with limited financial support. Caligiuri recalled a
memorable conversation in a Coco Beach, Fla., hotel with U.S.
goalkeeper Tony Meola three days prior to the Trinidad &AMP; Tobago
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bunked in beds together, had to use pay phones and had to
share a television in the main hall,'' said Caligiuri. ``I was
sharing the television with Tony the night before we were leaving
to Trinidad. He's hogging the couch and I'm sitting on the floor.
He said, `I can see it, Tony Meola gets the shutout and Paul
Caligiuri gets the game-winning goal.' I looked at him and, it
seemed so far-fetched. But to this day, it's something him and I
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were inexperienced, young and didn't know what we were
getting into, but it was literally in our dreams to play in a World
Cup. You could see how important it was to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   They realized how important the game was in Trinidad &AMP; Tobago
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were declaring a national holiday for the game,''
said Caligiuri. ``The plan was to get there at midnight so we
wouldn't be distracted. But there were 10,000 screaming
Trinidadians there to greet us at this small airport. There they
were, beating their drums as loud as they could. We said `Wow,
we're taking on an entire nation.' To this day, I can't compare it
to anything I've ever played in.''
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri had already been a pioneer of sorts. After graduating
from UCLA in 1985, he became one of the first Americans to excel
abroad, signing with Hamburg of the well-respected German
Bundesliga. In 1986, Caligiuri was selected to play in the FIFA
World All-Star game, playing alongside Diego Maradona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a career I wouldn't change. The script is fine how
it is,'' said Caligiuri. ``But don't call me a pioneer. That team
in 1989, we were all pioneers.''
