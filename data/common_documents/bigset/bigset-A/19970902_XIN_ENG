the pursuing of Diana after she left a luxurious hotel in central

<HEADLINE> Algeria Bans Activities of Islamic Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Algeria has decided to impose
a ban on the activities of Abbas Madani, leader of the Islamic
Salvation Front (ISF), Radio Algiers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Madani will be confined to the house where he currently lives
and his guests will be limited to his family members, Algerian
Interior Ministry announced the decision through the Radio.
</P>
<P>
Madani has been informed that any new violation of the
conditions upon which he was released will send him back to prison.
</P>
<P>
The ISF leader was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1992 in a
military-backed government crackdown on Islamic fundamentalism. He
was set free on July 15 this year under conditional release
measures which were intended by the Algerian authorities to ease
the tension caused by escalating violence.
</P>
<P>
Following a horrifying massacre in Sidi Moussa in which more
than 300 villagers were killed by Islamic militants, Madani
addressed an open message to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on
August 30 expressing "his readiness to make an appeal to stop
bloodshed immediately, preparatory to embarking on a dialogue that
may lead Algeria to the realm of security."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Carrier Launches Two US Simulation Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Long-March rocket
carrier, containing two simulation iridium satellites owned by the
American electronic giant Motorola, was successfully launched in
Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi Province, at 10:00 this
evening.
</P>
<P>
The carrier, which was based on the Long-March-2-III and was
the first of its type launched, sent the two satellites into the
preset orbit from the Taiyuan Satellite Launching Center.
</P>
<P>
It is the 47th flight of the Long-March carrier family.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the Xi'an Satellite Sensing and Control
Center in Xi'an, capital city of northwestern Shaanxi Province,
the second section of the rocket separated from the distributor
after 11 minutes of flight.
</P>
<P>
The distributor brought the two simulation satellites into a
holding pattern at a perigee of 181.8 km and apogee of 674.7 km,
slid for over 40 minutes, and finally changed track to discharge
the two satellites at the preset orbit.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the launch is to check the performance and
quality of the Long-March-2-III carrier and the Taiyuan Launching
Center, a preparatory step before the future official launch of
two Motorola iridium satellites.
</P>
<P>
Iridium satellites are a new type of personal
telecommunications system developed by Motorola. A total of 66
iridium satellites will be sent into the orbit at six levels.
</P>
<P>
The 66 iridium satellites will be sent spaceward by rocket
carriers manufactured in the United States, Russia and China, at
22 per country.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the United States and Russia are carrying out
launches of the iridium satellites with US-made Delta rocket
carriers and Russian-made proton carriers.
</P>
<P>
The China Rocket Carrier Technology Research Institute
developed the upgraded model of the Long-March-2-III especially
for launching iridium satellites.
</P>
<P>
The three-stage rocket carrier is 40 m in length, 3.35 m in
diameter and weighs 213 tons when launched, and has an additional
distributor to send satellites from the initial holding pattern to
the final, elliptic orbit, discharging them in succession,
according to Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract signed with Motorala, the Taiyuan center is
scheduled to begin official launch of the iridium satellites later
this year and the 22 satellites will be sent into the orbit in the
coming few years.

multi-billion-dollar agreement between the two countries, reports
reaching here from Saudi western coastal city of Jeddah said.
</P>
<P>

the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that Britain supplies Saudi Arabia
with highly sophisticated military equipment including Tornado
jets and minesweepers in two phases.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Rejects Lawsuit Against Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A Cairo court today threw out a
lawsuit filed by an Egyptian lawyer against Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for his alleged part in the desecration of
Islamic and Christian symbols by Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo district court dismissed the case citing lack of
direct personal interest, and ordered the lawyer to pay litigation
expenses, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer, Mustafa Ashoub, sued Netanyahu in July, holding him
responsible for drawings that insulted the Prophet Mohammed and
the Virgin Mary, and maintaining that the posters have deeply hurt
religious feelings of Muslims all over the world.
</P>
<P>
He demanded 10 billion U.S. dollars in compensation which he
said would be spent to build mosques and churches and help the
families of Palestinians died in the seven-year-old Intifada
(uprising).
</P>
<P>
He was well aware that even if he wins, there would be no way
for the Egyptian court decision to be enforced in Israel, not to
mention that the case is of only moral value.
</P>
<P>
However, it is a legal and peaceful way to express his hurt
feelings, according to the plaintiff, who said the case was based
on Article 163 of the Civil Code, which stipulates that anyone who
causes harm to any other must pay compensation.
</P>
<P>
Violence raged across the West Bank in June after an Israeli
woman put up in Hebron offensive posters depicting Mohammed as a
pig stomping on the Koran, the Islamic Holy Book. Several days
later, a picture with Virgin Mary painted with the head of a cow
appeared in an Israeli magazine.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli woman who drew the insulting leaflet is now facing
trial.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Supreme Leader Against US Cultural Dominance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today warned against U.S. attempts to dominate the world
intellectually and culturally.
</P>
<P>
Addressing officials in charge of Iranian culture abroad,
Khamenei said, "gone is the time for application of military and
political methods or economic sanctions aimed at dominating the
world."
</P>
<P>
He said that a nation's identity is characterized by its
culture, adding that Westerners try to dictate their criteria and
standards to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader warned that the West's cultural assault
should be taken seriously. "This assault against the Islamic
system and the regions which the West deems dangerous is very
serious although this has not been understood well," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the West sees all officials in this country
reject the Western culture, it will realize that it is at odds
with the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
He said "this explains why the West is constantly urging the
Islamic system to return to the world community while it really
means that the system should accept the culture of the West."
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Khamenei's statement sounds a tough warning
that Iran will not undergo dramatic changes in politics and
culture under the relatively moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
who was sworn in August 4.

<HEADLINE> Africa's AIDS Fighting Urged to Go With Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Anti-AIDS fighting should be
intergrated into family planning efforts in Africa where
heterosexual contacts are the primary reason behind HIV
infection, worldwide aid organizatin, the Pathfinder
International urged today.
</P>
<P>
The second-placed mode of HIV infection in Africa is through
the mother to the new-born, said Daniel Pellegrom, the President
of the Boston-based worldwide aid organization.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Pellegrom said, integration of the prevention of
sexual transmitted diseases (STDs) and family planning services
will be a key factor in improving reproductive health and
reducing HIV transmission in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Pellegrom made the remarks when launching a book on the topic
published by the Pathfinder.
</P>
<P>
The rapid spread of HIV-AIDS and continued high population
growth are inter-related problems posing serious challenges to
Africa, which hosts at least 60 percent of HIV carriers in the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ideally, such integration should take place in an environment
where, depending on clients' needs, a comprehensive selection of
STD/HIV-AIDS/family planning services is provided to clients by
one service provider during the same visit, the book explained.
</P>
<P>
Thus can minimize missed opportunities for screening for and
treating STDs, avoid wasting resources, and become more cost
effective and more convenient for clients, said the book.
</P>
<P>
The book is titled as "An African Response to the Challenge of
Integrating STD/HIV-AIDS Services into Family Planning Programs."
</P>
<P>
An estimated 27.9 million people worldwide had been infected
with HIV by mid-1996, of which 19 million people from sub-Saharan
Africa.

</P>
<P>
Egypt has so far signed a free trade agreement with Jordan and
is in the final stages of concluding similar pacts with Tunisia,
Morocco, Lebanon, Kuwait, Syria and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that the scope of current inter-Arab
trade does not exceed 8 percent of the total amount of their
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
And there exists a huge trade deficit in the Arab countries'
dealings with the rest of the world - their imports amount to 150
billion U.S. dollars but non-oil exports stay at 2 billion dollars
per year, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a committee supervising the implementation of Great
Arab Free Trade Zone (GAFTZ) held its premier meeting here today
which was attended by chief delegates of member states of the Arab
League (AL).
</P>
<P>
The GAFTZ committee is entrusted to map out annual customs and
taxes reduction programs and settle commercial disputes among
member states. It is required to submit its report to the AL
Economic and Social Council in November.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to the common market, the AL Ministerial Council
adopted a resolution in 1996 calling for the GAFTZ to be
established by 1998.
</P>
<P>
The resolution stated that non-tariff barriers should be
eliminated and tariffs gradually reduced until complete
liberalization was reached by the end of the year 2007.

<HEADLINE> France Appeals for Political Solution in Congo Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- France today again appealed to
the warring sides of the Congo Republic to "renounce military
option" and continued to recognize Pascal Lissouba, whose
presidential term expired mid-night Sunday, as the country's
president.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the parties to renounce military option and call for
a return to cease-fire, badly needed for creating the conditions
of a lasting solution," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Jacques Rummelhardt, who called Lissouba "president".
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court of Congo has decided to prolong the
mandate of Lissouba, because the fighting between government
forces and militia-men of former president, General Denis Sassou
Nguesso, had blocked the holding of presidential election
originally scheduled for July 27.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was rejected by Sassou Nguesso, who now considers
the power in the country as "vacant".
</P>
<P>
"The persistent shooting of heavy weapons in Brazzaville
remains very worrying," said Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman welcomed the summit held last Saturday in
Gabonese capital Libreville by Lissouba and Gabonese President
Omar Bongo, who has been mediating the conflict in Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Sahnoun, the envoy of the United Nations and
Organization of African Unity, issued the communique after the
summit, which said that Lissouba and Bongo had agreed upon some
new proposals aimed at "establishing a climate of confidence and
reconciliation by gathering the political forces of the country
to the administration of the transitional period."

<HEADLINE> Belgium Experiences Hottest August in Recorded History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Belgium has just experienced
its hottest Summer in recorded history as the month of August came
to an end to the joy of otherwise sun-chasing populace here.
</P>
<P>
The average mean temperature in the past August was 21.2
degrees Celsius, the highest since record-keeping started in 1833,
according to the Belgian Royal Institute of Meteorology.
</P>
<P>
The previous record for hottest August was posted in 1911 when
the average mean temperature soared to 20.9 degrees. The average
temperature for August is 16.8 degrees in this country.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday before rain storms set in as the prelude of autumn,
the temperature shot up to 31.9 degrees for a hottest single day
in the month.
</P>
<P>
Yet the hottest single day registered a thermometer reading of
37.4 degrees Celsius on July 27, 1947.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist De Bondridder at the institute explained that
Belgium was in the past month under an unsubdued influence of two
high-pressure masses, one coming from the African coast while the
other from the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched in between, Belgium had a rather hot summer caused
by a subtropical air which scared tourists away to seaside resorts
instead.
</P>
<P>
Though neighboring France has been blaming the depletion of
ozone caused mainly by the exhausts from motor vehicles for its
unusually hot summer, Belgian meteorologists held the two
high-pressure masses responsible to their hottest August in
history.
</P>
<P>
Ozone is believed to serve as a protective layer in the
atmosphere by absorbing solar ultraviolet radiation. It not only
helps produce a maximum temperature but also effectively blocks
all solar radiation of wavelengths less than 290 nanometers from
reaching the Earth's surface, where it would injure or kill most
living things.

JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police and security
forces arrested eight Palestinian protesters this afternoon at the
Jordan Valley, according to Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center (JMCC) based in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Palestinian farmers conducted today a sit-in at
Al-Fara'h Agricultural Testing Station in the Jordan Valley to
protest against Jewish settlers' raid on the station on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Warning that the station and its nearby area is a military
zone, Israeli security forces and police entered the station this
afternoon to disperse the farmer protesters. During the clashes
between the two sides, eight protesters were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Jawad Saleh, minister of agriculture of the Palestinian
National Authority who led the protest, said that the Jewish
settlers were preparing to plant and farm at Al-Fara'h area on
Sunday but the Palestinian farmers were not allowed to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian farmers therefore decided to stage the
demonstration, he said.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa today stressed all-round education approach not merely
passing of examination in schools.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a function in a secondary school in Dar es Salaam,
Mkapa said that schools should not try to program a machine that
passes examinations and instead strive to produce educated and
socially well developed human beings.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "Some of our schools provide narrow-based education, an
education geared principally to passing examination and not the
all-round development of the academic, artistic, physical, social,
psychological and personality profile of the students."
</P>
<P>
Mkapa in his speech also called on non-governmental institutions
and the private sector to participate in providing education to the
children, saying, "Preparing our children for tomorrow's world by
providing them with a good solid education is too heavy a stask to
be shouldered by the government alone."
</P>
<P>
He said that anyone with means and possibility to play an active
part is welcome and greatly encouraged to promote education of
children for a better Tanzania tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Kromah Denied Involvement in S. Leona Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's former warlord Alhaji
Kromah today denied accusations that fighters of his defunct
faction were involved in the current civil war in the neighboring
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The new President of Liberia Charles Taylor allegedly accused
of late that some ex-fighters of Liberia's United Liberation
Movement (ULIMO) were fighting along with Sierra Leone's
traditional hunters known as Kamajors against soldiers of the
military government.
</P>
<P>
The move would lead to destabilization in Liberia where peace
has just emerged at the end of a seven-year civil war, Taylor
warned, according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
However, Kromah, a major rival of Taylor, denied the
allegation, saying that it was too early to be making this kind
of accusations.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know from where he (Taylor) is speaking, but to the
best of my knowledge I'm not aware of any ULIMO personnel
involved in any kind of war anywhere," Kromah said, quoted by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The former key warlord said he had no intention to bring
destabilization into the country, which has been ravaged in the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
"We have repeatedly declared our commitment to the fact that we
will not allow anybody to bring war into this country or to bring
any fighting into this country any more," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is our solemn commitment," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Kromah was not sure whether some of the former ULIMO men
were fighting in Sierra Leone beyond his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
During the Liberian civil war, there were some ULIMO
militiamen fighting in Sierra Leone in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
"All what you think of could be possible. But at this moment,
all we know is there are fightings between the Kamajors and the
government forces" in that country, Kromah said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kromah, he now has good relations with Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Only three or four days ago, " He (Taylor) talked to me on the
telephone line from Abuja and we had a very good conversation,"
Kromah said, adding that nothing of ULIMO was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
To maintain peace in Liberia is now one of the major tasks for
leaders in west Africa, who put special emphasis on the issue in
the just-concluded sub-regional summit two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in Sierra Leone, a result of the May 25 coup which
overthrew the legitimate government of that country and has posed
threat to the peace and security of the sub-region, is also high
on the summit agenda.
</P>
<P>
The leaders have decided to impose comprehensive sanctions and
embargo on Sierra Leone to force the military junta to step down.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia is very satisfied with
the development of the Russian-Chinese relations, that are "more
vigorous than any time before," Chairman of the Russian State Duma
(lower house) Gennady Seleznyov said today.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Huo Yingdong, Vice-Chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Council,
Seleznyov said in recent years close ties were created between the
Russian State Duma and the Chinese People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the domestic situation, Seleznyov noted though
Russia remains in serious economic crisis, Russian people could
overcome the difficulties. The State Duma will make efforts to rid
Russia of the crisis and raise the living standard, he added.
</P>
<P>
Huo Yingdong said China and Russia are two great countries
which have important influence in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese part is very satisfied with the good
relations between the two countries, in particular, the frequent
contacts between the Chinese and Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Huo noted that it is of historical importance that China
resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, which has the
"one country, two systems" principle and high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the Chinese reform and economic development, as well
as the hard work of the Hong Kong's people, Hong Kong with fewer
resources has developed greatly in economy in last ten years, Huo
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same day Huo also separately discussed with Deputy
Chairman of the State Duma Mihail Uriev and Chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee of the State Duma Vladimir Lukin the
Chinese-Russian economic and trade cooperation, including the
economic cooperation between Hong Kong and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation headed by Huo Yingdong arrived in Russia
on August 28 for an official visit and left for Beijing this
night.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriot Trade Unions Call for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Greek and Turkish Cypriot
trade unions today reaffirmed their adherence to the principles
of peace and their determination to work for consolidating peace
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a joint declaration issued today, 15 Greek and Turkish
Cypriot trade unions expressed disappointment at the failure of
the initiatives undertaken by the U.N. in the search for a lasting
solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was issued after a peace rally at the Ledra
Palace Hotel in the U.N.-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia,
marking the International Day of Peace.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions called on all the parties involved, the U.N.,
and other organizations and countries to expedite their efforts to
ensure that the course of peace is safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions reiterated their firm belief that a just
and viable solution to the Cyprus problem will serve the cause
of peace in Cyprus and the region.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the solution should be based on
U.N. resolutions and with "full guarantee on the human and trade
union rights and a unitary economy, without any form of
discrimination."
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration was handed over to Peter Schmitz,
U.N. peace-keeping force senior political advisor, who
represented U.N. at the peace rally.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the declaration, Schmitz called it a very encouraging
sign for the future, which makes the U.N. feel very much heartened
to continue with its work to bring about a peaceful settlement to
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said he will convey the declaration to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in New York.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Trade Union Coordinating Committee,
General Secretary of the Cyprus Workers' Confederation
Michalakis Ioannou stressed that on the occasion of today's
International Day of Peace, Greek and Turkish Cypriot trade
unions join force in demanding from the U.N., the international
community and the island's leadership to "hear the voice of the
majority of the people and work toward a fair solution which
will bring peace to the island."
</P>
<P>
Ioannou stated that only if peace is achieved can the trade
unions work constructively and effectively to improve people's
living standards on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and took
over the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed
coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> G-77 Calls for New Strategy for South-South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Group-77 Chambers of Commerces
and Industry (CCI) Chairman Tariq Sayeed today called on G-77
states to adopt a new strategy to boost South-South cooperation and
evolve a balanced, just and equitable global economic order.
</P>
<P>
"The current global behaviors indeed calls for evolving a new
strategy," Tariq Sayeed told a CCI trade meeting opening here
today, citing a 2,100-billion-U.S.-Dollar foreign debt of the
third world in 1996 and trade barriers by developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Facing the situation, the developing countries first "should
unite ourselves and forge cooperation to address the crucial
issues emanating from trade barriers, conditionalities of IMF,
prolems of trade deficit and mounting trade burden," he said.
</P>
<P>
The G-77 members should boost their contacts "in a big way
through various means" such as setting up a development bank, an
insurance company, an exhibition authority and an information
network, he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the G-77 states "should try to improve our system by
adopting modern techniques both for production and investment" so
as to enter into negotiation with the North and "to evolve a
balanced, just and equitable economic order," Sayeed noted.
</P>
<P>
The G-77 should "make collective efforts" to remove invisible
trade barriers like anti-dumping, environment, child labor and
form groups of experts to help strengthen their quality control,
professional management and worldwide marketing, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
This is " a two-pronged strategy" the developing world has to
do, he said.
</P>
<P>
The development of the third world needs support from
developed nations and also in the larger interest of the latter,
Sayeed said, urging more frequent contacts and dialogues between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries now account for about 25 percent of
the world trade, compared with 20 percent a decade ago, according
to the date available at the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Karachi-headquartered G-77 group, comprising 132
developing countries from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the
Pacific and Carribean region, was founded at the first U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development meeting in Geneva in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The group set up CCI in 1986 in a bid to mobilize the
participation of their private sector for economic development.

will be the temporary constitution during the interim period, he
said. Those draft laws will be discussed when the PLC opens its
session on September 15, he said.
</P>
<P>
As most parliaments of other countries have specific
committees, the PLC also has the Refugee Committee, the Jerusalem
Committee and the Land and Settlement Committee because of the
unique Palestinian situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt has agreed to send five experts to the PLC
to assist in the drafting of legislation.

<HEADLINE> Nile Water Not Polluted: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian official said today
that the Nile water is not polluted by phosphate carried by a
barge that sank into the river Sunday after a collision.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of water samples taken from the site where the barge
sank has shown that the water was not affected by the phosphate
and there will be no adverse effect on fish, plants or drinking
water, said an official at the Ministry of Public Works.
</P>
<P>
The barge ferrying 370 tonnes of phosphate sank into the Nile
Sunday after it collided with another barge in Beni Suef, some 90
kilometers south of the capital. All six crew on board were
rescued.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Ismail Sallam said his ministry has taken
all precautions to ensure that Nile water was not polluted.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohammed Raga'i Shatla, director of Prevention
Medicine Department in Beni Suef, citizens in the region had been
provided with temporary sources of water before it was proved that
there was no leakage of phosphates in the water.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces and frogmen lifted the barge out of the river
and the movement of river boats and ships is back to normal, said
an official from the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
The phosphates were tightly packed in huge plastic bags
impermeable to water, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian authorities closed several outlets on the lower
branches of the Nile to forestall any pollution immediately after
the accident.
</P>
<P>
The 6,700-kilometer Nile River is the longest in the
world. Running 1,530 kilometers inside Egypt, it is the lifeline
of Egyptians on whose banks and delta up to 95 percent of the
population are living.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Refugees Protest UNRWA Budget Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian refugees in
Lebanon went on strike today in protest of a U.N. organ's decision
to cut 7 million U.S. dollars from its 1997 relief budget.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official National News Agency said the protesters
burnt tires at the entrance of their camps, closed their shops and
staged a sit-in in front of the offices of U.N. Relief and Works
Agency (UNRWA), the International Red Cross Committee (IRCC) and
the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
</P>
<P>
The refugees, coming from eight of the 10 camps in Lebanon,
stated in a memo presented to these organizations their
difficulties that the budget cut would bring about and called on
UNRWA to help them return to their homeland as stipulated by UN
General Assembly resolution 194.
</P>
<P>
This was the second strike of the Palestinian refugees since
UNRWA announced its reduction of this year's total budget of 54.7
million U.S. dollars on August 20 as a result of a 20 million
dollar deficit and lack of contributions from donor nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lebanese government criticized the UNRWA's
decision as an attempt to shift responsibilities to host
countries for solving social and economic problems of the
Palestinian refugees, who mainly live in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, classified as "temporary
residents", are kept away from the government services of Lebanon
and largely dependent on UNRWA for schooling, health care and camp
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA, set up in 1950, is to care for the social welfare of the
3.3 million Palestinian refugees in the world, of whom 360,000 are
residing in Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian official today that
Iran is dismayed at the recent outbreak of violence in Algeria and
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi condemned the
recent massacre of the civilians in Algeria and called on the
international community to deal with the "unprecedented crimes"
against innocent people in the north African country.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Algerian government to pave the way for
peaceful realization of the wishes of the Algerian nation.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified armed group perpetrated a horrible massacre
Thursday night in the town of Sidi Moussa, about 20 kilometers
south of the capital Algiers, killing more than 300 villagers.
</P>
<P>
The massacre was the gravest terrorist act witnessed by Algeria
since insurgency began five years ago when the military-backed
government canceled a parliament election in which the Islamic
Salvation Front appeared to win.

The spokesman also expressed concern over the recent carnage in
Tajikistan and denounced the recent "kidnaping" of the Mufti, the

"The Tajik nation has endured many hardships on the path to the
recent cessation of hostilities in the country," Mohammadi said.

<HEADLINE> 12 Arrested for Instigating Protest in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish police today
arrested 12 people in protest of the recently adopted eight-year
compulsory education law in Turkey's largest city of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
They have been accused of stirring up a group of 150 Islamists
to attack the ATV, a leading Turkish television station, on Sunday
night, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters stormed into the downtown television studio,
disarming a guard, smashing windows and television equipment. They
fled before anti-terror police arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
Police said the protesters had shouted slogans against the new
eight-year compulsory education law, which was passed in the
Parliament last month.
</P>
<P>
The conservative Islamists have been greatly angered by the
new law, initiated by the government led by Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz to demand students finish eight years of compulsory
education before they are permitted to start religious study.
</P>
<P>
The law has actually forced the closure of a large number of
religious schools.
</P>
<P>
Since the Education Ministry worked out the reform bill, the
conservative Islamists have staged anti-government demonstrations
around the mosques in major cities, especially in Istanbul,
following their routine Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government, with the support of the military,
launched the education reform program aiming to curb the rapidly
growing fundamentalist force in the country.

LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all suspended last week's decline and recovered today, boosted by
a stronger dollar and faded worries on higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
On the London market, the FTSE 100 index ended more than 50
points ahead in quiet trading, with business subdued due to the
Labor Day holiday in the US.
</P>
<P>
Softer-than-expected consumer credit data today boosted the
market earlier by easing fears of an imminent interest rate hike.
The blue-chip index stood at 4,870.2, a gain of 52.7 points by the
close.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt rose on the back of a firmer dollar
and stronger futures and bond prices. The DAX-30 index closed with
a rise of 83.93 points at 3,989.96.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that volumes were thin due to a holiday in the US.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, stocks ended firmer, with takeover news in
the retail sector helping to give the market a boost. A stronger
dollar also provided support. The CAC-40 index finished 35.35
points up at 2,805.84.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that the current rising trend was
unlikely to last into Tuesday, with further falls in New York
likely and turbulence in Asia set to continue.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Asked to Meet EU Conditions for Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Jacques Poos, European Union
(EU) term president and foreign minister of Luxemburg, said here
today Turkey has to fulfill necessary conditions ahead of its EU
membership negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey should normalize its ties with Greece, change its
traditional policy towards Cyprus and improve its human rights
record," said Jacques Poos, who is on a one-day working visit to
Ankara, after a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot start to negotiate with Turkey for its bid for full
EU membership before these conditions are met," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he reaffirmed that Turkey is still a part of the EU
enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has earlier announced a report, known
as "Agenda 2000", excluding Turkey from the rank of prospective EU
membership candidates.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Cem, Poos had reportedly mentioned the
Kurdish problem, a highly sensitive issue to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He called for a political solution to the Kurdish issue,
adding that "the cultural autonomy of Kurds must be recognized."
</P>
<P>
In his part, Cem said that the Turkish government would make
efforts to overcome these difficulties in its full EU membership
drive, saying participation in the EU is part of Turkey's state
policy.
</P>
<P>
As for the humans rights issue, he said every country has its
own problems in this respect, and that Turkey would try to improve
its human rights record through practical means.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister, however, has repeatedly stated
that full EU membership is a target, not an obsession, for Turkey
and stressed that failure to become an EU member does not mean the
end of the world.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here pointed out that Turkey is not only annoyed at
not being considered by the EU, but also angered by the inclusion
of Cyprus in the EU enlargement talks to be held early next year.
</P>
<P>
Ankara said that the Cypriot government is not eligible to
enter the EU on behalf of the whole country composed of separated
Greek and Turkish communities.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into a Greek Cypriot south and Turkish
Cypriot north after Turkey landed troops on the east Mediterranean
island in 1974 following a pro-Athens coup. The Turkish Cypriots
have declared a breakaway republic recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been keen on becoming an EU member, but failed to
achieve the goal due to a number of controversial issues including
the Cyprus issue, a weak economy as well as its human rights
record.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's naval forces will carry
out large-scale military maneuvers in the Persian Gulf in October
to "display their might and capabilities," a commander said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Ali Akbar Ahmadian, commander of the naval force of the
Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps (IRGC) said that his force will
hold "Victory-7" war games in cooperation with the naval force of
the army.
</P>
<P>
But he gave no detail of the scheduled exercises.
</P>
<P>
The commander termed the presence of U.S. naval fleet in the
Gulf "unjustifiable and illegitimate." The fleet, he said, has not
only caused tension and crisis in the region, but also increased
the level of pollution by launching numerous maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The illicit U.S. presence has in fact ignited a fire that will
be harmful to all states in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran's new Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said last Saturday
that his country would like to have new strategic arrangements
with neighboring Gulf countries in a bid to push the U.S. out.
</P>
<P>
Increased "cordial and sincere efforts" through consultations
with the neighboring countries, Gulf emirates in particular, are
needed to formulate new security arrangements without the
involvement of foreign forces, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He called for dialogue with the littoral states to find answers
to the region's peace and security concerns.
</P>
<P>
"The Muslim Persian Gulf littoral states should seriously opt
for formulation of a stable and coordinated strategy to reach
sustainable security without foreign involvement," he stressed.

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The sudden death of
Britain's Princess Diana has thrown uncertainty onto a charity
gala for Action for AIDS scheduled to be held on September 23 in
Singapore, where more AIDS cases were detected in the first half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Local television reported today that organizers of the charity
gala had arranged for the princess to attend the gala dinner and
to visit AIDS patients here.
</P>
<P>
They had hoped to raise close to a million U.S. dollars to set
up a fund to subsidize medication for patients of HIV which causes
AIDS, the television report said.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, a total of 40 new cases of HIV infection were
reported between April and June this year, meaning a total of 73
Singaporeans have been infected during the first half of this
year. The figure is a little more than half of the new cases
detected for the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
Of those infected with HIV this year, most were males, who
accounted for 92 percent of all cases. Almost half, or 47 percent,
of the infected were between 30 to 39 years and this formed the
largest affected age group.
</P>
<P>
Of the 73 new cases this year, 69 were infected through sexual
transmission. The rest were through intravenous drug use and from
mother to child.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Health Ministry said the number of new
cases of HIV infections reported each year has been increasing
since the first case was detected here in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Since then, 631 Singaporeans have been found to be infected
with HIV and 211 have died.

WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Five people on a sky-diving
flight were killed in a crash at Bremerton National Airport in
Washington state Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Associated Press said today the victims, four men and a woman,
were on board of the single-engine Cessna 182, which crashed into
a ravine and burst into flames at the airport.

back to the airport.
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said the pilot made no radio calls before the
crash. The National Transportation Safety Board was to begin its

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Against British Official Document </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today lodged a protest
to the British government against an official document circulated
in the British Bases in this country that refers to the Turkish
Cypriot regime in the north as the "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing here, Cyprus government
spokesman Manolis Christofides described as "unacceptable" the
official document circulated Monday by the Commander of the
British Bases, Air Vice-Marshall Peter Millar.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cyprus government expects a "positive response"
from Britain to its representations and noted that Britain, as a
guarantor power of the Cyprus Republic and a U.N. Security Council
permanent member, should respect U.N. resolutions on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island in the wake of a failed coup of the Greek Cypriot
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared a breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus"(TRNC) in 1983, which was recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
U.N. resolutions have called upon "all states not to recognize
the purported state of the TRNC set up by secessionist acts and
not to facilitate or in any way assist the aforesaid secessionist
entity".
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Christofides said, the British acts were contrary to
the U.N. resolutions and for this reason a formal protest would be
lodged and relevant representations be made to the British
government through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the British Bases authorities in Cyprus
today issued a statement, apologizing for mistakenly referring to
the Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus as "the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that it is the "clear policy of the
British government" that it does not recognize the Turkish
Cypriot regime led by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the former colonial power of Cyprus, retained two
Sovereign Base Areas (SBA) on the island, Dhekelia SBA on the
southeastern coast and Akrotiri SBA on the southwestern coast,
after Cyprus gained its independence in 1960.

</P>
<P>
The number of women working in China has increased remarkably
since 1978, accounting for 46.6 percent of the total number of
workers in 1996, according to an official of the Chinese Ministry

period of economic transition and structural adjustment, he said,
noting that 59.2 percent of the laid-off workers are women.
</P>
<P>
China has taken active steps to protect women's rights and to
work for women's employment, he said. In Shanghai, the country's

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A five-disc CD-ROM set on the
late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's life and theory has just been

"As a great Marxist, an outstanding leader of our Party and
country, Deng was the chief architect of our country's socialist
reform and opening-up, and the founder of the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics," Ding said.
</P>
<P>
It has been shown that the theory solves the question about the

<HEADLINE> China's Vice Premier Calls For National Fight Against Soil Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Jiang Chunyun, who
is in charge of China's agricultural work, said today that the
success in controlling soil erosion and desertification in Shaanxi
province should be applied nationwide, and that it could have
great significance in the country's social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was addressing a conference on controlling soil erosion
in the Yulin and Yan'an areas of northern Shaanxi for officials
from Shaanxi and other parts of the country who are in charge of
agricultural work.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited the areas to inspect soil control work, and later
summarized the experience in a report.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have commented on the
report, backing Jiang's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Due to poor forest coverage in semi-arid land, Yulin and Yan'an
have long been vulnerable to sandstorms and soil erosion, which
has also led to serious poverty problems.
</P>
<P>
However, forest and grass coverage in the areas reached 39
percent by 1996, compared with 1.8 percent some 50 years ago, and
"The improvement of the environment has greatly increased grain
output and local farmers' incomes," the vice premier said in his
report.
</P>
<P>
"If the problem of soil erosion is solved in Shaanxi, where the
annual loss of soil accounts for one fifth of the national amount,
the province will be able to add five billion kilos of grain each
year, as well as forestry and animal husbandry products," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Jiang called for increased protection of
vegetation and a halt to deforestation. He suggested that some
areas plant more trees and grass. He also urged both central and
local governments to attach importance to the issue and give full
support.

<P>
MOGADISHU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Two humanitarian projects
were completed and inaugurated Monday in Jowhar town of Middle
Shabelle region, 90 km north of the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The projects, a water supply system and a 5-km-long tarmac
road, were opened by Nur Mohamud Mohamed (Nur Shirbow), governor
of the region with the presence of Theo Kasber, acting chairman
of the European Union (EU) office in Somalia, and Vasilis
Petrsides, head of EU rehabilitation projects.
</P>
<P>
The two projects, funded by the EU's Somalia office, were
implemented by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF0, and
an Italian aid agency CEFA.
</P>
<P>
The main project, the water supply system which took 14 months
to complete, will provide potable water to four quarters in
Jowhar town, while the tarmac road is already being used by the
traffic from Jowhar to Mogadishu. The road was earlier cut and
destroyed by floods.
</P>
<P>
The three agencies, the EU office in Somalia, UNICEF and CEFA
have collectively turned the responsibility of the projects to
the local authority of Jowhar town.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the Middle Shabelle region thanked them for
their unforgettable support to his people who have been suffering
poor land communication and lack of clean water.
</P>
<P>
"We used to drink straight from the river, but from now on, we
have confidence on what we're drinking," said Nur Shirbow, who
used to be a military officer.
</P>
<P>
The cost of these projects were not released publicly.
However, EU and UNICEF have entrusted the water project to a
local private agency called Farjanno for its sustainability.
</P>
<P>
Farjanno will sell the water to the public at a reasonable
price to maintain the equipments, fuel and the local staff
operating the system.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN, Europe Can Resolve Differences on Myanmar: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN and Europe can
resolve their differences on Myanmar's participation in the Second
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) through "honest, open and frank
negotiation," a high-ranking British official said here today.
</P>
<P>
It has always been the case for the two regions to settle their
differences through such means, British Parliamentary Secretary at
the Cabinet Office Peter Kilfoyle told a news conference at the
British High Commission here.
</P>
<P>
Kilfoyle made the statement while commenting on Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's statement last night that the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) may decide to
boycott the ASEM if the European Union bars Myanmar from
attending. He is here to get ideas about Malaysia's Multimedia
Super Corridor.
</P>
<P>
"If there is discrimination against Myanmar, it is a
discrimination against the ASEAN," Mahathir said in response to
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's statement in Singapore
yesterday that Europe's recent decision to deny visas to senior
Myanmar officials made their inclusion at the ASEM impossible.
"You may find other countries in the ASEAN also deciding not to
attend."
</P>
<P>
The ASEM meeting is scheduled to be held in London next year.
</P>
<P>
Kilfoyle hoped that like in any other differences of opinion,
normal and good relations would prevail, particularly between
Britain and Malaysia, and that any "difficulties" between the
ASEAN and Europe on the issue of Myanmar "will be resolved."
</P>
<P>
"We have a very close affinity which is being enforced over the
past couple of days and I hope that it will continue to be the
case," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kilfoyle said he was not aware of Cook's statement on Myanmar
yesterday, but added that it was "a reflection of the current
public opinion."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Drops to All-Time Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso today
dropped to an all-time low of 30.688 pesos against the U.S. dollar
as a result of eroded investor confidence prompted actually by the
country's high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
At the Philippine Dealing System, the peso fell to 30.81 to the
U.S. dollar at one point. The central bank of the Philippines sold
dollars in a bid to stabilize the exchange rate but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the peso was put under pressure mainly by
the high interest rates which many fear would be raised further.
</P>
<P>
Since the peso was declared floated within a wider band on July
11, the central bank has been taking a series of measures,
including a hike last week in the banks' liquidity reserve rate
from five to eight percent, to tighten the money market and defend
the peso.
</P>
<P>
However, these measures caused interest rates to rise and hurt
investor confidence at the local stock market, which fell to a
four-year low after an eight-day straight decline on Monday.
There were outflows of funds and trading at the foreign exchange
market was also affected.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the prospects for both the peso and the
stocks are far from rosy as the currency woes sweeping the region
have not yet shown signs of termination.

<HEADLINE> Finland to Increase Aid to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Finland is planning to
increase its aid to developing countries next year as part of its
long-term drive to boost cooperation with these countries.
</P>
<P>
The government said in its 1998 draft budget it will provide
1.62 billion Finland marks (300 million U.S dollars), or 0.36
percent of the gross national product (GNP), to developing nations
in 1998, an 11.2 percent increase over the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget, which was submitted to Parliament today for
debate, foresees a rise in the aid to GNP ratio of 0.4 percent in
2000, and ultimately 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Finland will continue to focus its aid on African countries
south to the Sahara, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique,
Namibia, Zambia and Tanzania. It will also give aid to Palestine,
Egypt, Vietnam, Nepal and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Finland will also allocate 226 million marks (41.5 million
dollars) to cooperation programs with middle and eastern European
countries, mainly to environmental protection programs in Russia and
Baltic countries.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Estonia to Cooperate in EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Estonia have
agreed to support each other for their bid to become members of
the European Union (EU), an official press release issued here
today said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached Monday during a visit to Estonia by
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, who started Sunday a
tour of six European nations, namely Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Germany, Luxembourg and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides had a meeting with Estonian Prime Minister Mart
Siimann and held talks with his counterpart Toomas Hendrick
Ilves on the latest developments in the protracted Cyprus problem
and assured him of the Cypriot government's political will for a
solution as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ilves briefed Kasoulides on the steps Estonia has
taken toward a free market and liberalizing its economy in view
of its preparation for EU entry.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed to have regular contacts and
cooperate closely to cope with problems each country faces during
their EU accession course. Kasoulides invited his Estonian
counterpart to visit Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Estonia are the first group of countries with which
the EU has recommended to begin accession talks in the first six
months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops landed
and seized the northern third of the Mediterranean island following
a short-lived coup seeking union with Greece by some Greek
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has not been solved despite repeated
efforts by the U.N. and international community over the past 23
years.

TOKYO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today stressed the importance of Japan-China ties,
saying that "the stable development of bilateral relations between
Japan and China is extremely important to peace and prosperity in
the Asian-Pacific region and the world at large."
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto spoke to a group of Chinese journalists ahead of his

</P>
<P>
It is a good time now for the two countries to enhance

understanding and promote trustful relations between the two
peoples, especially between the young people of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Approves Financial Raising for Asiad Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet authorised on
Tuesday the finance ministry to seek 800 million baht (23.5
million U.S. dollars) in funding for a sports complex for the
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The call for funding was to avoid further delays in
construction -- and also to avoid Bangkok being stripped of its
right to host the games -- after the contractor ran out of cash,
deputy government spokesman Amnart Chanawang said.
</P>
<P>
Amnart said the contractor, Bangkok Land plc, would take
responsibility for its debts, but said fresh funding had to be
sought because it was too late to change the embattled contractor.
</P>
<P>
The news of the government moving to avert the possibility of a
further blow to Bangkok's chances of hosting the prestigious
games, came after the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) threatened to
withdraw the games because insufficient preparations had been made.
</P>
<P>
OCA director-general Abdul Muttaleb Ahmed on Sunday accused
organisers in Bangkok of ignoring its calls to address problems
concerning preparations, warning the country could lose the 1998
Asian Games.

The decision will not stop athletes from Ecuador taking part in

<HEADLINE> Albania to Raise Value-added Tax, Some Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Albania will raise the
value-added tax rate from 12.5 percent to 18-22 percent from
October 1.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano, who took office a month
ago, announced the hike which was proposed by the International
Monetary Fund as a condition for providing economic aid to Albania.
</P>
<P>
In a speech last Saturday, he also announced that the ceiling
prices of petroleum products, the business tax on cigarettes and
liquor and tax on income from leasing will also be increased.
</P>
<P>
The exemption of some non-necessities from import and export
customs duties and value-added tax will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expected that this move will add billions of
Albanian lek (US$1 equals 155lek) to the financial income in the
last four months of the year, and increase the gross national
product in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In response to people's worries about price hikes, Nano pointed
out that the prices of some daily necessities will be controlled
under a level people could endure.
</P>
<P>
Albania experienced a national disturbance early this year due
to the collapse of a nationwide pyramid-scheme, which wiped out
two billion U.S. dollars worth of Albanians' money.
</P>
<P>
The current unemployment rate in Albania is 37 percent and 1.2
million of the 3.2 million population are living under the poverty
line.

necessary preparations for receiving Iranian visitors at the
Montheriya crossing bordering Iran, Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi General Customs, Passport and Residence Authorities have

Communication, mail, health and banking services at the

Iraq last month notified Iran that it would lift its travel ban
on Iranian pilgrims imposed since the 1980 when the eight-year
Iran-Iraq war broke out and would allow them to visit Shiite
Muslim shrines on its territory. The lifting will be effective on
September 4.
</P>
<P>
But Iran has dismissed the Iraqi offer and said it was
ambiguous and attempting to divert attention from unresolved
issues between the two countries, such as prisoners of war. Iran
argued that both sides should negotiate on the conditions of the
travelling of Iranians to Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President, Cardinal to Meet on Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said
today that he and Jaime Cardinal Sin have agreed to meet again for
the third time or as often as necessary as part of the process to
foster unity among the people.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told reporters in the southern province of Sulu that he
was glad that the outspoken cardinal has agreed to meet with him
because that will help heal the wounds in the past.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was in Sulu to attend celebrations of the first
anniversary of the signing of a peace agreement between the
government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
Ramos has met twice with the cardinal in a bid to persuade him
to call off a rally against the drive to change the 1987
constitution.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos failed to persuade the influential cardinal to change
his mind and not to lead the grand rally scheduled for September
21, which former president Corazon Aquino also said she will join.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has appealed to the cardinal and other church leaders to
call off the rally, saying it will only cause disunity and open
healed wounds in the past.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' supporters have sought to change the constitution to
lift term limits of all elective government officials, including
the president.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has voiced repeatedly his determination not to seek a
second term when his single six-year term ends in June 1998. But

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Criticize US Congressman For Indiscreet Remarks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- US Congressman Frank Wolf's
remarks about what he allegedly saw and heard in Tibet have
triggered an indignant response from various ethnic groups in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
People from political, legal, religious, cultural, education,
and tourism sectors gathered in Lhasa Monday to refute Wolf's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
In August, Wolf paid a five-day visit to Tibet and held a press
conference after he returned home, where he presented his "travel
notes" on Tibet. He talked about religion, culture, education,
justice, tourism, people's lives, and relations among minority
groups in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, he said that about a million people have been
killed in Tibet in the past 20 years and that Lhasa has become a
world of the Han people.
</P>
<P>
Lhada Ngawang Danzim, a renowned abbot in Tibet, said that
"Wolf's remarks are an insult to the Tibetan people. He described
Tibet as an inhuman world, something that deeply hurt the feelings
of the Tibetan people."
</P>
<P>
Cering Puncog, an official with the region's prison
administration, said that Wolf's remarks about prisons were wrong
and that the annual per capita living cost in Tibetan prisons was
2,500 yuan (about 300 US dollars), 1,540 yuan more than a Tibetan
farmer's average earnings.
</P>
<P>
He noted that prisoners enjoy free medical treatment and
receive health check-ups regularly. They are allowed to have free
time on national holidays, weekends, and traditional festivals,
and they have freedom of religion and the right to receive an
education. There are 1,170 prisoners now with education
certificates of various kinds.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Criticize US Congressman for Indiscreet Remarks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said that Wolf has never been to a Tibetan prison and that
what he said about them sounds like nonsense.
</P>
<P>
Wolf also said that "Tibetan culture has been destroyed." In
response, Qangngoiba, an expert on the Tibetan language, said that
before liberation, there was not a single school in the modern
sense in Tibet and the vast number of serfs did not have the right
to an education, and even in the early 1950s, over 95 percent of
the Tibetans did not know how to read and write.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 40 years, the central government spent 1.1
billion yuan on education in Tibet and Tibet now has 800 primary
schools, 100 middle schools, 16 secondary technical schools and
four universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Vjam Dbyangs, an expert on cultural relics conservation, said
that the central government has spent at least 100 million yuan on
the renovation of the Potala Palace and other famous temples, and
that this shows its concern for Tibetan religion.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the central government has spent 200 million
yuan repairing 1,700 monasteries and religious sites throughout
Tibet, which now has 46,000 monks and nuns.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Buddhism associations have been set up in the seven
cities and prefectures in Tibet, which also has a Tibetan Buddhism
institute.
</P>
<P>
These facts demonstrate that Wolf's remark that "Tibetans have
no right to freedom in religious belief" is but an outrageous lie.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qing, a guide from the Tibetan Regional Tourism
Administration, criticized Wolf's comments about the region having
a tight control on tourists. She said she is very busy during the
tourism season and often has to give up her weekends because of
the increasing number of foreign tourists visiting Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Wolf's remarks about what he allegedly saw and heard in Tibet
are absolutely groundless and he is just confusing black and
white, disregarding the tremendous progress that has been made in
Tibet. His anti-Chinese attempts are bound to fail.

PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Paris Public Prosecutor today
began legal proceedings for ``involuntary homicide and injury''
against seven photographers.
</P>
<P>
The French photographers who pursued the car of the late British
Princess of Wales Diana Saturday night in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The car crashed into a pillar in an underground tunnel in
downtown Paris after speeding 180 kilometers per hour, killing
Diana, Egyptian billionaire Dodi Al Fayed and the driver, and
seriously injuring the bodyguard of Diana.
</P>
<P>
The photographers were tailing the car on speeding motorcycles,
which are very common in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Investigation Judge Herve Stephan also charged the
photographers with ``non assistance to person in danger,'' as they
continued to take photos after the car crashed throwing Diana out of
the cabin, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The photographers, whose identities were not given, have been
detained by police since the accident took place.

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Guo Chaoren, president of
China's Xinhua News Agency, meeting with Solitoki Esso, the
Minister of Communications and Civic Training of Togo, here this
afternoon, said he believes the minister's visit will further

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Criminals Treated Leniently </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman from Tibet's Higher
People's Court pointed out here today that the central government
requires local courts to carry out a "light punishment" policy
when sentencing Tibetan criminals.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in response to US Republican representative
Frank Wolf's claim that about one million Tibetans have been
executed or sentenced to death in China over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Wu Junqing of the Higher People's Court in Tibet Autonomous
Region called Wolf's remarks "groundless and ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Wolf made up such sensational lies just to please the
public with claptrap," said Wu. "A simple comparison of population
figures will expose the lie."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Tibet's population stood at around one
million in the 1950s, but had shot up to more than 2.38 million by
1996, according to the results of a sample survey conducted last
year.
</P>
<P>
"How can the population double if there has been any kind of
genocide in the region?" Wu asked.
</P>
<P>
Tibet had implemented the old legal code until 1959, which was
notorious for its cruel and severe punishment of serfs. It was a
common practice then to sentence a serf to death for a minor
offense against the nobility.
</P>
<P>
"The situation was fundamentally reversed when the system of
the people's court was introduced to the region after 1959," Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
The files of the regional Higher People's Court suggested that
local courts have altogether passed sentences on some 10,000
criminals during the past 38 years. The court records from 1977 to
the end of August of 1997 show only 5,400 criminals were
convicted, many of whom were of Han and other ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
"We are very careful about meting out capital punishment," said
Wu, adding that the law on criminal procedure stipulates that
death sentences must be approved by the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, only some 1,000 criminals were
sentenced to death, death with a two-year reprieve, 20-year
imprisonment, and 10-year or above prison terms.
</P>
<P>
This does not mean crime rate in Tibet is lower than in other
parts of China, Wu pointed out. "The central government guideline
is to be lenient in meting out punishment in Tibet," he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Krajisnik Claims Outside Meddling Hampers Peace Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Serb member of the
Bosnian Presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, said Monday night that
interference in the internal affairs of the Bosnian Serb republic
by certain international mediators has severely hampered the
implementation of the Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
The Serb leader made the remarks in a meeting with Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky in Pale, the Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said he appreciated Moscow's stance on the political
crisis in the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
Afanasyevsky said Russia is very concerned about the crisis and
that Serbs themselves must find a resolution at any cost, he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community should and must provide aid for the
Serb republic, but should not interfere in its internal affairs,
nor use force against it, Afanasyevsky said.
</P>
<P>
Both international mediators and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO)-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) troops in
Bosnia were supposed to help implement the Dayton accords that
ended the three-and-a-half year civil war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Tensions rose sharply last week in Bosnian Serb areas between
the 3,500-strong SFOR and local residents loyal to their wartime
leader Radovan Karadzic, as his power struggle with Western-backed
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic was heated up.
</P>
<P>
In Brcko and Bijeljina last Thursday NATO operations
encountered resistance from local residents. Brcko people
reportedly attacked dozens of American peacekeeping soldiers,
comparing them with Nazi occupation forces during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Bijeljina spent the night on a square in front of
the police station to prevent SFOR troops from taking over the
police station and a television transmitter.
</P>
<P>
A crisis within the Bosnian Serb leadership began in early July.
</P>
<P>
Serb President Biljana Plavsic dissolved the parliament on July
3, but the decision was strongly opposed by parliament, and the
Serb government believed to be actually controlled by former
president Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court ruled last week that Plavsic's
decision was unconstitutional and invalid. Plavsic rejected the
verdict of the court.
</P>
<P>
Among the wrangling of the Serb leadership, western countries
led by the United States voiced support for Plavsic and were
trying to force Karadzic out of the political arena and bring him
to trial before the International War Crimes Tribunal in The
Hague.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, British and Czech troops of the SFOR surrounded
four police stations and one police academy in Banja Luka, a
northern Bosnian town, to help Plavsic boost her authority in the
town.
</P>
<P>
After the operation, police chiefs loyal to Karadzic were
removed from their posts.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls for Comprehensive Peace for Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
underscored the need for comprehensive peace in the southern
Philippines to allow the government time to turn Mindanao into a
centerpiece of development.
</P>
<P>
The government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
will continue to work together to promote peace and development in
the area once torn apart by nearly a quarter-century of armed
conflict, Ramos said on the first anniversary of a peace agreement
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is on track and we are happy to show our people
-- as well as the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference --
both of which supported the peace process, that the peace
agreement is working," he said in Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the government wants Mindanao to become within two
to five years an area of vigorous growth where the Filipino people
shall live in harmony in a culture of peace, unity and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He added that peace is being translated into growth as more and
more joint efforts by the government and the private sector are
attracting investments to the South.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the president said, the provinces and cities that
later comprised the Special Zone of Peace and Development in
Mindanao got only 5.4 billion pesos (207 million U.S. dollars) in
investments. The figure rose 164 percent to 14.26 billion pesos
(544 million dollars) by 1995 and would reach at least 46.32
billion pesos (1.54 billion dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
For economic development in Mindanao, the government also
carried out a series of flagship projects, investing some 16
billion pesos (570 million dollars) in the infrastructure
construction in the area.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, note that the Philippine government faces
another main block in bringing comprehensive peace to Mindanao,
where a 12,000-member rebel group called the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front still has sporadic clashes with government
troops.

Jiang is also President of the People's Republic of China. He
said that Sino-Nepalese friendship can be traced back a long way
and that the two countries could be called model neighbors, their
friendship based on the Five-Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>

At present, he said, Sino-Nepalese relations are characterized

Adhikari said that Nepal and China have traditionally had
friendly co-operation, and that the Nepalese will not forget the
Chinese government and its people for their aid in Nepal's

Tibet is an inseparable part of China and opposes foreign powers
meddling in China's internal affairs, using the issue of human
rights. He also wished the upcoming 15th National Congress of the

WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Basking in the accomplishment of its balanced-budget and
tax-cutting agreement with the President, Congress returns to the
Capitol this week to confront the mechanics of making the historic
deal work and to wrangle over several prickly issues, including
welfare, education and campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
-- Labor's visibility in American politics is greater than it
has been in years, and it will only intensify this autumn as
union-related issues rise to the forefront. This prominence is not
altogether beneficial because labor will be on the defensive on
several matters, trying to thwart initiatives from the White
House and from Republicans alike. Even so, the emergence of unions
in the political calculations of both parties is largely a
recognition of the growing vitality of the labor movement after
decades of decline.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- With the economy strong and the balanced-budget fight behind
them, Democrats and Republicans find themselves groping for
economic issues to argue about when they return to Washington this
week.
</P>
<P>
-- Hurling stones and swinging clubs, several hundred Bosnia
Serbs attacked nearly 300 heavily armed U.S. troops Monday in an
attempt to take back control of a key television transmitter
seized last week by the Americans.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) has said outside help is badly needed to
improve the severe shortage of potable water in the
U.N. sanction-ridden Iraq, Iraqi newspaper "Al-Jomhouriya"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the newspaper, Post Widmer,
commissioner of the ICRC Middle East Water and Hygiene Department,
said that more than 1,000 Iraqi water-clearing stations need
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
He added that what is being done by the ICRC for repairing
these stations is inadequate because of the limited means of the
ICRC.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the ICRC working plans in Iraq are being
prepared, and that the funds needed in the water and hygiene
sector in Iraq will amount to some 5.2 million Switzerland francs
(3.54 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Most Iraqi provinces, as well as many Baghdad residential
districts, are currently suffering a shortage of potable water,
especially in the summer.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused the U.S., a member of the U.N. Sanctions
Committee, of blocking the approvement of contracts signed by Iraq
for the purchase of 285 water pumps, 13 diesel pumps, four farm
pumps and 38 water sterilizers.
</P>
<P>
The contracts are within the framework of the oil-for-food
deal, which was signed by Iraq and the U.N. in May last year and
went into effect last December.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil
every six months to buy food and medical equipment badly needed in
the country. And each contract will be approved unanimously by the
U.N. Sanctions Committee, consisting of representatives of all the
15 Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Widmer also said that the oil-for-food deal
will not cater to the essential needs of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Foreign Debt Burden Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The foreign loan burden per
person in Bangladesh increased 19 times in the last 23 years,
according to the Bangladeshi Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita debt obligation rose from 6.59 U.S. dollars in
the 1973-74 fiscal year to 124.2 dollars in 1995-96, the ministry
said in an annual document published recently.
</P>
<P>
Since independence in 1971, foreign aid disbursement has
totaled 30.5 billion dollars, of which 48.7 percent is in grants
and 51.3 percent in loans. Of the total amount, 5.46 billion
dollars is in food aid, 9.38 billion dollars in commodity aid and
15.7 billion dollars in project aid.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the flow of food and commodity aid showed a
gradual declining trend, with food aid decreasing from 47.9
percent of total aid in 1971-72 to a mere 9.6 percent in 1995-96
while commodity aid fell from 50.8 percent to 15.9 percent during
the same period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, project aid jumped to 74.6 percent from a meager 1.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the share of bilateral aid decreased from
73.9 percent in 1971-72 to 53.5 percent in 1995-96 while
multilateral aid grew from 26.1 to 46.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the bilateral donors, Japan tops the list in terms of
cumulative disbursement, followed by the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's soft lending arm, the International
Development Association, is on the top of the list of multilateral
agencies, followed by the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's external borrowings mainly consist of medium- and
long-term debt on concessional terms with an average grace period
of 10 years and repayment period of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
They have mostly gone to the public sector, whose debt rose
from 501.4 million dollars in 1973-74 to 15.17 billion dollars in
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The debt service payment on total public sector loans jumped
from 19 million dollars in 1973-74 to 561.4 million in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise in debt service payment to
increasing debt, expiry of grace periods and exchange rate
fluctuations.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Expects Huge Infrastructure Requirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine infrastructure
requirement is estimated to reach five billion U.S. dollars a year
in the coming years, Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista
said today.
</P>
<P>
Bautista was quoted by the Philippine News Agency as saying
that the huge infrastructure requirement is an incentive to
sustain investors' interest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said it is difficult to invite big-ticket investments
into the country, especially the provinces, if necessary
infrastructures are not there.
</P>
<P>
Considering the government's limited resources, new and
innovative schemes must be pursued to finance the country's
infrastructure requirement, he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the use of regional cooperative initiatives and
provident funds as possible sources of financing.
</P>
<P>
At present, the government's availment of the official
development assistance (ODA) from foreign countries and some
multilateral financial bodies is limited.
</P>
<P>
To further increase investments, Bautista said, the Trade and
Industry Ministry will design an incentive package that will
encourage and enhance projects that are infrastructure-related.

<HEADLINE> Urban Residents Enjoy Higher Living Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China's urban residents have
witnessed a sunstantial improvement of living standards over the
past five years, with the average annual per capita income
increasing to 4,839 yuan in 1996, according to a survey report
from State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The residents' annual incomes in real terms stood at 4,377 yuan
per capita in 1996, 1.8 times the 1991 figure, the SSB report
shows.
</P>
<P>
A great change took place in the income mix of Chinese urban
people during the 1991-1996 period, while the ratio of the
earnings from state and collectively-owned sectors to the total
earnings dropped to 72 percent from 74 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the proportion of earnings from other economic
sectors, including individually-owned businesses, increased
from two percent in 1991 to five percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report said that the income distribution mechanism was
further modified, with the income gap between higher-educated
workers and manual laborers widened considerably. The ratio
between the earnings of workers with primary school education and
those with a college degree reached 1:1.7, compared with the
1991 ratio of 1:1.2.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country is becoming a more consumption-oriented
society. In 1996, food spending decreased to 48.6 percent
of urban people's incomes, 5.2 percentage points lower than in
1991. A slight drop also was seen in the proportion of spending
on clothing, household appliances and services.
</P>
<P>
However, the proportion of spending on medicare, transport,
telecommunications, entertainment, education, culture and housing
showed an upward trend during the five years, registering increase
margins from 0.8 to 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the per capita living space reached
11.8 square meters for urban residents here, up 19.2 percent from
1991. Great improvement was also recorded since five years ago in
the housing conditions, especially the availability of a
sufficient gas supply and kitchen equipment, the SSB report said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economic Condition Under Control: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today rejected calls by the business community to convene
the National Security Council to discuss the ongoing state of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said there is no need to convene the meeting as suggested
by the business community in a letter presented to him on Monday,
because the present economic condition is well under control.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen voiced their concern over the country's
economic growth, which slowed down to 5.9 percent in the first
half of the year compared with the 7.5 percent in the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Some economists earlier complained that the government
neglected economic growth by paying too much attention to amending
the country's constitution to extend the terms of elective
officials including President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos said today that he would instead meet with
government economic managers, members of the congress and business
representatives on Friday to discuss economic matters and exchange
ideas on how to sustain the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Among the topics to be discussed at Friday's meeting is the
state of the country's economic growth in relation to the current
currency problems being experienced by other Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it is almost impossible for the government to
achieve its 7-8 percent economic growth target for the year,
taking into account the economic slowdown in the first semester
and the currency woes sweeping the whole region in the third
quarter.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Graduate From IMF Supervision Soon:Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said
today that the Philippines will definitely "graduate" from the
supervision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) before the
year is over.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told reporters in the southern province of Sulu that the
Philippines' exit from the IMF will be achieved following the
passage of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP) by the
Senate on final reading.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who was attending a cabinet meeting in Sulu, thanked
Senate President Ernesto Maceda for supporting the passage of the
tax measure.
</P>
<P>
The CTRP, which is expected to raise the government's revenues
considerably, is the last major component the IMF wanted the
government to adopt before the country is given a good
housekeeping report card.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the CTRP will enable the country to have a
sufficient flow of revenues support for various government
infrastructure projects and Social Reform Agenda (SRA).
</P>
<P>
The Philippines was supposed to graduate from IMF supervision
earlier had Congress passed the measure earlier this year. The
Lower House passed the measure but it hit a snag when it reached
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
But the Senate, which passed its own version of the CTRP last
week, is expected to carry the bill soon. A bicameral committee
will then discuss, finalize and ratify the CTRP before submitting
it to Ramos.

<HEADLINE> Panda Gives Birth to Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A giant panda living in a
research center here gave birth to twins over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The panda siblings weighed 150 grams and 130 grams at birth on
August 29 at the China Giant Panda Protection and Research
Center. Mother and children are in "excellent condition,"
according to workers with the center.
</P>
<P>
Experts said giant pandas kept in a man-made environment have
difficulty getting pregrant, as the females tend to snub the
ardent males.
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 percent of the male pandas living in zoos or
breeding centers are capable of mating and the pregrancy rate
among female pandas kept in artificial environments is around 24
percent.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Chinese government and the World Wildlife
Fund, the China Giant Panda Protection and Research Center was
established in 1980 in Wolong Natural Reserve, in southwest
China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the center has artificially inseminated 13 female
pandas. Nineteen babies were born, but only 14 have
survived.

</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government supports the exchanges
between the parliaments of the two countries, which will enhance

noting that ties between the two countries set a fine example for
state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Ramdial on China's domestic situation.

Ramdial said he hopes that his trip will help promote friendly
relations between the two countries. He expressed the conviction
that China will eventually achieve its great reunification cause.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Junior Chamber
International (JCI), a worldwide youth organization, opened its
annual summit here today with the theme of "Hong Kong -- A gateway
to Develop Business in China".
</P>
<P>
More than 200 delegates from 80 junior chambers around the
world have flown to Hong Kong to attend the four-day event,
including seminars, meetings with government officials and
businessmen, visits to factories in Hong Kong and three southern
Chinese cities -- Zhongshan, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong became a natural choice as the venue for this year's
summit because of its return to China on July 1, and the potential
consumer market and robust economic growth in the inland areas,
according to the organizer, the Hong Kong Junior Chamber (HKJC),
an affiliated member of the JCI.
</P>
<P>
Henry U, HKJC's president, said today: "This is a great
opportunity for us to get the message across to the young people
around the world that Hong Kong continues to function as a dynamic
business and financial center and that the city will benefit
greatly from its strengthened links with the rest of China."
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated in 1950, HKJC is an association of young people
aged between 21 and 40, who in their spare time work for the
betterment of the community.
</P>
<P>
JCI, which helps the youth develop leadership skills and social
responsibility, has affiliated chambers all over the world with a
combined membership of 400,000. Every year it holds an annual
summit in different cities to focus on a different theme.

<HEADLINE> Banks Move Australian Share Market Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A sell-off of banking stocks
ahead of the Australian federal government's response to a report
on the country's financial system weighed on the Australian share
market today, with the bourse slipping to a three-month low.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries Index fell 8.9 points to 2581.9, its lowest
close since May 27 when it ended at 2578.9.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks reacted more positively after the government's
response after being marked down earlier in anticipation of that
response.
</P>
<P>
"The banks were down because of the thought of some revelations
from the Wallis report, but when it came they bounced back again
to a degree," a broker said.
</P>
<P>
Among the government's responses to the report was the ruling
out of mergers between Australia's four major banks.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank fell 14 cents to 18.75 Australian
dollars from a low of 18.7 Australian dollars, ANZ 9 cents to 9.66
Australian dollars and Westpac Bank 16.7 cents to close at 7.727
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank dropped 15 cents to 14.7 Australian dollars,
after hitting a low of 14.46 Australian dollars at one stage.
</P>
<P>
News Corp shares jumped 13 cents to 6.3 Australian dollars and
the preferred shares rose 6.7 cents to 5.337 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The All Industrials Index slid 13.9 points to 4160.4 while the
All Resources Index shed 5.1 points to 1350.3.
</P>
<P>
Jubilee Mining shares continued yesterday's spectacular rise,
with more than 20 million shares traded, to add another 18 cents,
or 50 percent, to 54 cents following promising drill results at
its Cosmos nickel project.
</P>
<P>
Resources giant BHP, the country's largest company, dropped
17.6 cents to 16.86 Australian dollars and Rio Tinto 22.3 cents to
19.897 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bullion prices declined marginally from an overnight 324.75
U.S. dollars per ounce to 324.6 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover for the day was 250.63 million shares traded
worth 638.77 Australian dollars (472.68 million U.S. dollars),
with falls outnumbering rises by 516 to 412.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Plans Breakthrough in Economic Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China is brewing up a major
breakthrough for its economic reform, hoping to enliven the torpid
state sector after more than a decade of gradual progress.
</P>
<P>
Bold explorations are expected to be made to seek diversified
yet effective patterns of public ownership, thereby pulling
unprofitable large-and medium-sized state-owned enterprises out of
the financial mire, sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The state plans to retain control over state ventures in basic
industries and those concerning state security and public
interests, the officials said. The rest of the more than 10,000
state-owned large- and medium-sized ventures in the nation,
especially those in competitive processing industries, will be
encouraged to switch to various forms of public ownership.
</P>
<P>
To this end, China is considering transforming some of these
enterprises into shareholding companies and companies with limited
liability, and also encouraging those with good prospects to list
on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
There are presently a total of 13,000 state-owned large- and
medium-sized ventures in China, accounting for only 3.4 percent of
the total number of the nation's industrial sector, but their tax
revenue represents 65 percent of the sector's total.
</P>
<P>
However, the financial dilemma of the state sector continues to
be the outstanding problem of the Chinese economy, in spite of the
initial success the nation has made in reforming the
macro-economic structure since 1992.
</P>
<P>
But hope returned when Chinese President Jiang Zemin called for
a powerful change in the economic reform in last May. Jiang
pointed out in a speech at the Party School of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) that public
ownership and state ownership are not the same thing, and called
for bolder exploration of new public ownership patterns that may
substantially boost the overall economy.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes at Two-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Rumors of an official rate
cut as early as tomorrow gripped Australia's financial markets,
causing the Australian dollar to lose half a U.S. cent in trading
and close at a two-year low.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended in Sydney at 72.65 U.S. cents, down
from 73.16 late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Market participants said they do not expect an interest rate
cut tomorrow, but sentiment for an easing has continued to weigh
on the foreign exchange market ahead of any announcement following
today's Reserve Bank of Australia board meeting.
</P>
<P>
They will be waiting tomorrow for any word from the bank.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was last at such levels in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
It finished at 88.31 Japanese yen from 88.45 and against the
Deutsche mark, it was at 1.3242 from 1.3289.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Plans Breakthrough in Economic Reforms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice-President of the Party School Wang Jiaqiu said that the
leading position of the state-owned enterprises in the national
economy is due to their control over the lifeline industries in
the national economy, rather than how many there are.
</P>
<P>
"The shareholding system has nothing to do with privatization
since the system only provides a pattern to achieve public
ownership and will bring no change to the present economic
structure where public ownership is in the leading position," Wang
explained.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed to the shareholding system as "an effective
pattern of public ownership that accords with the Chinese
characteristics and an option that may bring about a new
breakthrough in the state enterprise reform."
</P>
<P>
"Adopting the shareholding system in the state sector also
answers the need to speed up the Chinese economy which is still in
the preliminary stage of socialism," he added.
</P>
<P>
Economist Wang Jue echoed Wang Jiaqiu's view by saying that a
shareholding system could only strengthen instead of weaken the
leading position of public ownership, since it allows the state to
control a shareholding venture by taking 51 percent of its stake,
and will thereby increase the influence of the state assets to a
greater extent.
</P>
<P>
The effectiveness of the shareholding system on the state
sector has also been fully revealed in the 9,200 shareholding
ventures in the country, which have been set up on a trial basis
since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Official sources also predict that China will make new moves in
its enterprise reform, mainly in the state sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state is also expected to push forward reform
measures to readjust the role of the government, change the
government's mangement mode over the economy, and expedite the
transforming of financial assets into industrial capital.
</P>
<P>
The state enterprise reform, together with all other supportive
reforms, will push China a substantial step forward to reach the
goal of establishing a socialist market economy by the end of this
century, economists stressed.

ALMA ATA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister
Kasymzhomart Tokayev spoke highly of China's achievements over
recent years in his new book.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev also praised China in the newly-published book entitled
"Under the Flag of Independence" as his country's good neighbor
and important partner.
</P>
<P>
By adhering to the foreign policy of independence and peace, he
said, the Chinese government has been playing an increasingly

</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders stand for maintaining social and political
stability while working on economic reforms, and for strengthening
the Communist party's leadership, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The recent five years have seen China's gross national product
growing by an average 11 percent a year, inflation down, people's
living standards improving, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
With the country's foreign reserves increasing to over 100
billion U.S. dollars, China now enjoys higher ratings on the
international credit market, Tokayev said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Lags Behind in High-Tech Race: IBM Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia is left behind
other nations, including Thailand and Malaysia, in high-tech
industries and Internet commerce, IBM Australia Managing Director
Robert Savage said today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Australians are eager to adopt new
technology and the nation possesses an advanced telecommunications
system, the Australian information technology (IT) sector is
inhibited, Savage said.
</P>
<P>
"As a percentage of the Australian stock market, high-tech
industry is barely on the radar, accounting for little more than 1
percent in 1996," Savage told a group of company directors in
Melbourne today.
</P>
<P>
Australia's share of world IT and technology exports is less
than half a percent, compared to Thailand with over 2 percent,
Malaysia and the Republic of Korea with around 6 percent, and
Singapore with nearly 8 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our enthusiasm for technology and our highly educated
population, Australia is not in the forefront of successful,
innovative high-tech nations."
</P>
<P>
Having deeply impressed by the role the IT industry has been
playing in the U.S. economy during a U.S. visit earlier this year,
Australian Prime Minister John Howard and his cabinet have been
reviewing the country's IT industry policy in a bid to boost its
slowly growing economy.
</P>
<P>
Recent proposals on the country's IT industry policy call for
preferential policies including tax breaks for attracting overseas
investment in the industry.
</P>
<P>
But Communications Minister Richard Alston, who is in charge of
the country's IT industry, last week ruled out the possibility of
giving tax breaks to the sector.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Language Dominates Local Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Qamba Yang Dron was proud that
her excellent result in Tibetan language exam has helped secure
her enrolment in Beijing Tibetan Middle School this summer.
</P>
<P>
"You just cannot graduate from primary school if you fail the
language test," said the 12-year-old Tibetan girl, who could barely
speak or understand her native language years ago, living
with her parents in inland China.
</P>
<P>
However, she picked up Tibetan quickly after she attended a local
school in Lhasa, capital of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
According to a local educational official, Baima Tsering,
the Tibetan language is a compulsory subject throughout the
grade-school years in Tibet and other classes like mathematics,
history, music and drawing are all conducted in Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
"Students like Yang Dron will have to continue their Tibetan
language studies in Tibetan middle schools in inland China," said
Tsering. "We have kept sending good language teachers to these
schools."
</P>
<P>
He was raged against the rumor that students in Tibet are
forced to learn the Chinese language. He said the Law on
Compulsory Education stipulates that schools should ensure that
students from ethnic minority groups learn to read and write their
own languages as well as Chinese.
</P>
<P>
During their six years in primary school, students in Tibet
should spend at least 1,598 hours in learning the local
language. They begin to learn the Chinese language at Grade Three,
with 748 teaching hours altogether until graduation.
</P>
<P>
"The arrangement suggests the dominancy of Tibetan language in
local school education," said Tsering, adding that a junior high
graduate can read and write expertly in Tibetan language, a major
progress compared with old Tibet when over 90 percent of the local
people were illiterates.
</P>
<P>
"The worrying fact is that Tibetan children living outside
China find more difficulty now in using their native language,"
Tsering pointed out.

PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The inquiry into the fatal accident of Lady Diana and Dodi
Al-Fayed began on Monday. The Paris Public Prosecutor has
discovered an over high level of alcohol in the blood of their
chauffeur. The Mercedes he was driving was running at 160, if not
180, kilometers per hour. Meanwhile, the seven photographers who
pursued the car are still detained by police.
</P>
<P>
-- The Algerian press has strongly criticized authorities for
the negligence in transporting hundreds of bodies of those killed
on Friday morning by Islamic extremists to a cemetery in the
capital Algiers. The bodies, all transported on trucks and
ambulances for 25 kilometers, were lined up in the alleys of the
cemetery to let the families identify them, and the authorities
failed to provide enough plywood coffins, as a result two or
three bodies had to put into one coffin.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The press should beg pardon in the fatal incident of
Princess Diana, who would not have been killed if not harassed by
the chasers of image, who were employed by press agencies. The
media regarded Diana as their "creature" and would not stop until
they caught her. They devoured their prey, going as far as
photographing the last breaths of the adorable princess.
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with le Figaro, South African President
Nelson Mandela promised to "do his best to help his neighbors",
while in the Congo Republic, the partisans of Pascal Lissouba and
Denis Sassou Nguesso were fighting with artillery for the
presidential seat. But Mandela denied that he would monopolize the
job of mediator in African conflicts, including those of Congo
Republic and Sudan.

Kiptanui is the first man to break the eight-minute mark for

<P>
In Cologne, Kiptanui finished second behind Barmasai in 7:56.16
-- well inside the original record. And he said afterwards he was
confident of reclaiming the world's fastest steeplechase time.
</P>
<P>
Kiptanui's compatriot Daniel Komen, the newly-crowned world
champion and world record holder over 5,000 meters, will try to
erase Noureddine Morceli's name from the record books at Rieti.
</P>
<P>
Morceli is scheduled to run in a 1,500 meters field which also
includes world champion Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco and Venuste
Niyongabo of Burundi, which means that a serious attack on
Morceli's world record of 3:28.86, also set in Rieti, is
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
On the field, Cuban triple jumpers Yoelvis Quesada and Aliecer
Urrutia, fresh from their gold and silver medal successes at the
World Student Games in Sicily, are both due to compete.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The rehabilitation of
dilapidated water and sewerage schemes in Zambia will require 100
million U.S. Dollars, Financial Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper quoted head of the water sector development
group Dennis Mwanza as saying as a result of the low expenditures
for capital investments, operations and maintenance during past
20 years, most water and sanitation schemes in Zambia are not in
good shape.
</P>
<P>
"Financial resources are inadequate to meet the costs of
extending coverage of water and sanitation to the majority of the
population, and to meet the costs of essential operation and
maintenance of facilities. Consequently in spite of very
significant capital investments, most financed by external
support agencies, the new facilities rapidly deteriorated into
disuse," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since budgetary allocations from the central government have
been low, there is need to have private investments into the
water sector, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The operation and maintenance of the water sector has also
been hampered by the non-payment of water bill by water users,
Mwanza complained.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that only 50 percent of the urban population
and 30 percent of the rural population of the country have access
to clean water. The government has set a plan to provide clean
water to all Zambians by the year 2015.

<HEADLINE> Wanted Rasta Killed by Kenyan Police in Shoot-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The most wanted criminal
Bernard M.T. Rasta was shot dead by Kenyan police Monday at his
home in Murang's District, the "Daily Nation" reported today.
</P>
<P>
During a 30-minute shoot-out, two detectives of the Flying
Squad of Kenyan police were injured and sent to a Nairobi
hospital by a police helicopter, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A man believed to be Rasta's close associate was arrested and
a pistol and nine rounds of ammunition recovered.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Noah arap Too, Director of Criminal
Investigations, as saying that "we are sure he is the man (Rasta)
whom our officers shot dead".
</P>
<P>
Rasta, who reportedly shot dead several people, has been
wanted since 1995 with a 100,000 Kenyan Shillings (about 1,700
U.S. Dollars) reward on his head.
</P>
<P>
He first slipped through an ambush laid by more than 50
policemen from the Flying Squad at a rented house in Nairobi late
in July and survived a day-long operation to track him down.
</P>
<P>
Rasta and other two criminals were accused of masterminding
the crime wave in which several people including senior police
officers were killed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the past three weeks, Kenyan police in Nairobi have
arrested Rasta's two bodyguards and recovered two sophisticated
guns loaded with several rounds of ammunition.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Set Up Transitional Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may set up a
transitional government to supervise the transition to civil rule
program of the military government of General Sani Abacha, the
Nigerian Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted competent sources in Abuja as saying that
the government may announce the plan on October 1, the 30th
anniversary of Nigeria's independence.
</P>
<P>
Abacha may also announce his decision on whether or not he
will run for the next president in his routine national broadcast
on that day, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Abacha's meeting with the six most
influential members of the government last week may have
convinced him of the need to clear his position on the presidency
in time so that the whole transition program will not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
"Although the issue was still largely decided, the view has
been gaining ground that General Abacha may not run in the
election after all," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
There have been much speculations and debates both in and out
of Nigeria on whether Abacha will or should contest in the
transitional program designed by himself.

<HEADLINE> OIC Greets Ramos on Anniversary of Signing Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) today congratulated Philippine President Fidel
Ramos on the first anniversary of the signing of a peace accord
between Manila and a major Muslim rebel force in the country.
</P>
<P>
Exactly one year ago, the Philippine government and the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) signed a historic peace accord in
Manila, ending a 24-year-long bloody war between the MNLF and
government forces in Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In a message from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the OIC is based,
Azeddine Laraki, OIC secretary general, said he saluted the
"highly laudable" efforts, courageous sacrifices and concessions
by both Ramos and MNLF chairman Nur Misuari that resulted in the
successful conclusion of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Laraki said the peace process was conducted under the auspices
of the OIC Ministerial Committee of Six, chaired by Indonesia and
also composed of Libya, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Somalia and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Laraki said that the OIC has always advocated a peaceful, just,
comprehensive and lasting solution to the problem of the southern
Philippines "within the framework of the sovereignty of the
Philippine government."
</P>
<P>
In an earlier message, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
also paid tribute to Ramos for his "vigorous and constant" support
for the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the full implementation of the peace agreement will
be another important contribution of the Philippines to the
stability and progress in Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Feature: China's "Underground People" Disappearing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- In his novel "The Time
Machine," American science fiction writer H.G. Wells described a
futuristic society in a world where the sun and moon don't shine.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps unbeknownst to Wells, the villagers of Xi'niu, in
Pinglu country of north China's Shanxi Province, have existed in
such a place for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongqin, a farmer in the village, has been living
underground for over half a century. Gazing around her "basement
house" -- a huge pit with a square central yard and cave dwellings
on each side, adorned by several wild jujube trees and large
patches of moss in the corners -- Wang has mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
The pit covers a total area of about 0.67 hectares and is a
legacy from her ancestors.
</P>
<P>
Poverty and the rarity of stones on the Loess Plateau led to
the building of the underground houses, most of which were
constructed at least ten meters below ground level.
</P>
<P>
An earthen slope entrance led people down, and around the yard,
covering an area up to hundreds of square meters, were several
cave dwellings dug for family members.
</P>
<P>
A dry well was also needed to hold rain to prevent flooding in
the yard and to give the residents enough water to drink.
</P>
<P>
The "underground people," as they are called, go to work at
sunrise and turn in by the light of the moon, Wang says.
</P>
<P>
For many years, to live above ground was a long-cherished dream
of the poor farmers, she explains. Only the wealthiest people in
Pinglu County were able to live in traditional houses made of
stones and bricks from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
But over the past few years, more farmers in the village have
settled their families in above-ground houses paid for with
earnings from crops of fruit trees and tobacco.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wang now has to move out of her pit because of the pressure
from her daughter-in-law, who is excited about the idea of a
four-room brick house at ground level.
</P>
<P>
"I'm fed up with living in the cave dwellings that are dark all
day long and wet throughout the year," the young lady says.
</P>
<P>
"And I don't want to become humpbacked like my mother-in-law
and most of the old people here," she adds. The high humidity in
the underground house has left many of its residents with
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
Although Wang agrees that moving up has its advantages, she
still has some worries about the change. "I'm afraid that I will
not be able to get used to the weather in the upper world," she
says, explaining that this is because the underground houses are
cool in summer and warm in winter.
</P>
<P>
And like most older people there, she will grieve for the place
where most of the significant events of her life occurred.
</P>
<P>
The Pinglu government has been trying to talk all the residents
of its over 15,000 basement houses into moving above ground so
that the county can gain about 3,400 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that building brick houses on the ground
occupies less land than digging the pits and caves.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 10 percent of the county's population are still
living in the underground houses -- most of them are elderly.
</P>
<P>
"It is the trend of the times that all the 'underground people'
will say goodbye to their cave dwellings in the near future," says
the director of villagers committee of Xi'niu.
</P>
<P>
Some people have suggested that the most representative of the
underground houses should be made into tourist sites.

<HEADLINE> Australia Wheat Output to Reach 16 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government's chief commodity forecaster today slightly dropped its
wheat output forecasts for the current financial year to 16
million tons.
</P>
<P>
In its latest crop report, the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) forecast 16.208
million tons of wheat to be produced during the 1997-1998
financial year starting on July 1, 1997, marginally down from the
July forecast of 16.245 million tons.
</P>
<P>
ABARE said the seven million tons expected from the state of
Western Australia, buoyed by favorable seasonal conditions, would
help offset the overall production loss.
</P>
<P>
"Dry seasonal conditions in much of eastern Australia mean that
overall crop yields are likely to be below average in 1997,"
Stephen Beare, acting executive director of the bureau said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production for the previous financial year ending June
30, 1997, reached 23.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Beare said the latest meteorological data indicated below
average rainfall for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
"Based on this outlook, winter crop production in 1997/98 is
forecast to be 24.7 million tons, 28 percent below the record 34.5
million ton crop of the previous year."
</P>
<P>
Winter crops include barley, oats and sorghum.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The world number ones in
men's and women's singles had different fates in the U.S. Open
tennis tournament in New York on Monday, with American Pete
Sampras knocked out and Swiss Martina Hingis advancing.
</P>
<P>
Two-time defending champion Sampras battled three hours and 37
minutes but could not prevent himself being disposed of by Petr
Korda of the Czech Republic 6-7, 7-5, 7-6, 3-6 and 7-6.
</P>
<P>
Two light drizzles and a harder rain fall punctuated the match,
with the latter coming when Korda leading 1-0 in the fourth set.
After play resumed, Sampras took control and levelled the match by
winning the set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
But Korda came back strongly in the fifth set, breaking Sampras
in the fifth game.
</P>
<P>
Korda then exchanged powerful serves with Sampras as he
gradually gained the upperhand with his vaunted backhand drives.
</P>
<P>
Korda crushed an astounding 67 winners and drew 66 unforced
errors from Sampras.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter-finals, Korda would face Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman,
who beat Australian lefthander Scott Draper 6-3, 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 in
another fourth-round match.
</P>
<P>
Briton Greg Rusedski also entered the last eight, beating Czech
Daniel Vacek 7-6, 6-2 and 6-2, while Dutchman Richard Krajicek
beat Felix Mantilla of Spain 7-5, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
There was little surprise in the four women's matches as
Hingis, Jana Novotna of Czech Republic, American Lindsay Davenport
and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain advanced in straight sets to
the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Hingis thrashed Argentine Florencia Labat 6-0, 6-2 in 51
minutes and will next play her own doubles partner, Sanchez
Vicario.
</P>
<P>
Davenport and Novotna, also doubles partners, will meet in the
other quarterfinal match in the top half of the women's draw.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's government troops
have rescued 32 civilians from rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF), local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rescued, including seven children below five years,
arrived yesterday at Fort Portal in Kabarole District in the west
and most of them later returned to their homes in the district,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The 32 civilians are part of the residents abducted by the ADF
rebels in Kihondo Trading Center in the district last Friday.
Eight of the abductees have escaped earlier.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were to send the abductees to deep mountain areas
in western Kasese District, but the Ugandan army managed to close
in on the rebels and freed the civilians before the rebels
escaped and reached their destination, Francis Kato, one of the
civilians, said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said ADF rebels abducted civilians for
military training to fill their ranks.
</P>
<P>
The ADF, with some 300 members, is a rebel group haunting in
western Kasese District.

Lhasa, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of foreign experts on
Tibetan studies who are currently on an inspection tour in Tibet
have cast doubt on the validity of US Congressman Frank Wolf's
recent critical remarks about life in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Even though what I've learned is only a fraction of the entire
scope of Tibetan studies, I dare say that I know more about the
place than most westerners, like Wolf," said Prof. Colin
Mackerras, director of the Research Institute of Asian Culture at
Australia's Griface University.
</P>
<P>
Mackerras has been to Tibet three times, and to major Tibetan
communities in other provinces, including Qinghai province.
</P>
<P>
"What I saw in Tibet is entirely different from Wolf's
description," Mackerras said. "He who knows little about Tibet has
no right to discuss Tibet."
</P>
<P>
Responding to Wolf's remarks that all Tibetans support the
Dalai Lama, Mackerras replied, "I found that some do support him,
but they are in the small minority."
</P>
<P>
After six trips to leading Tibetan communities, Mackerras said
he believes that none of the Tibetan people want independence for
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Another expert, Susan Meinheit, said, "I found that Tibetan
medical skills are well developed." Meinheit visited the College
of Tibetan Medical Sciences based in Lhasa, and expressed her
satisfaction with the fact that many of the senior doctors use
traditional Tibetan healing methods.
</P>
<P>
Meinheit is fluent in the Tibetan language, which she said has
greatly enhanced her interaction with local residents.
</P>
<P>
Tibetologist Ellis Gene Smith, who works for the National
Library of Congress in the US, bought several books written in the
Tibetan language, including primers, during the trip.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Tibetologists Refute Wolf's Remarks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Strassberg, a professor of Eastern culture at
California State University in Los Angeles, noted that his
personal experiences in Tibet contradict Wolf's comment that "the
oppressed Tibetans are living under unimaginably barbarous
conditions."
</P>
<P>
"But I found many newly-built houses, which show that people
here have money to spare for the improvement of their life,"
Strassberg said.
</P>
<P>
The overseas scholars are in unanimous agreement that Tibet has
achieved progress in economic development as well as cultural
preservation. "Progress in these respects has been startling since
I last came here in 1990," recalled Graham Clarke, a British
professor at Oxford University who has visited Tibet six times.
</P>
<P>
"As many Chinese say, this has been brought on by Deng
Xiaoping's socialist policy with Chinese characteristics," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The scholars also expressed their belief that freedom of
religion is fully guaranteed in Tibet, and hoped that the
international community will understand this.
</P>
<P>
They said they have seen shrines for worshiping Buddhas set up
in almost every home, and such activities have not been blocked by
authorities.
</P>
<P>
As for the notion that religious freedom will be eradicated in
the region, Tibetan religious expert Ms. Robinson said, "That's
definitely out of the question."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the experts denied that the environment in Tibet has
been sabotaged. "It would need five days' ride away from Los
Angeles to find a place as beautiful as this," said one of the
experts. "Tibet is the least-damaged place in the world."
</P>
<P>
"I truly do not understand why Wolf made these groundless
remarks," Colin Mackerras said. "Possibly it is out of the wish of
some politicians in the United States who fear a strong
counterpart like China."

<HEADLINE> Fertility Rate In Australia Reaches Its Lowest Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Many women in Australia
remained childless all of their lives, a recent data from the
Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that childlessness among
women has reached an all time high of one in four women.
</P>
<P>
A study says the fertility rate in Australia fell to its lowest
level of 1.82 children per woman in 1995 from 3.6 children per
woman in 1961 and 2.9 children in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Since 1976 it had been below replacement level of 2.1 children
per woman, that means people are not having enough children to
replace themselves, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
"Incentives need to be provided if declining fertility of
Australian women is to be addressed," Dr. Shail Jain and Professor
Peter McDonald of the Australian National University said in their
study published in latest issue of the Australian Population
Association's Journal.
</P>
<P>
Fertility rates are lower for urban women, especially for those
with low family incomes and those with high level education.
</P>
<P>
The important changes in economic and social conditions have
increased the proportion of women participating in education and
the labor force and led to changes in family demography, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
These changes include a decrease in the proportion of married
people, an increase in divorce and one parent families, and an
increased need for families to rely on two incomes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Literary Classics Presented to St. Lucia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CASTRIES, St. Lucia, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China's permanent
representative to the United Nations, Qin Huasun, today presented
a collection of Chinese literary classics to the Library of Saint
Lucia.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin told his audience at a reception here that the
collection, known as the Treasure of Chinese Classics, literally
crystallizes the cream of China's 5,000-year culture.
</P>
<P>
Consisting of 123 volumes, it is the work by more than 3,000
Chinese experts and scholars over six years, and is the largest
cultural compilation project of this century, Qin explained.
</P>
<P>
"Both China and St. Lucia have a splendid culture and fine
traditions," he noted, expressing his hope to see a starting point
for cultural exchanges between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the Treasure of Chinese Classics will help
further enhance the understanding of China by the people of
St. Lucia," the senior Chinese diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Qin and George Odlum, St. Lucia's minister
of foreign affairs and international trade, signed a joint
communique on forging diplomatic ties between China and St. Lucia.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of official relations, Qin said at the
reception, "is a great joyous event for our two countries and two
peoples, as well as an event of historical significance."
</P>
<P>
China highly appreciates the clear-cut position taken by St.
Lucia to consider the government of the People's Republic of China
as the sole legal government representing China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to some 200 quests, Qin said China views its relations
with Latin American and Caribbean nations from the global
strategic perception and the perspective of the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Investors in Kenya Rush for Treasury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Investors in Kenya have
recently be rushing to put their money into Treasury Bills (TB)
to take advantage of the high yields on government securities.
</P>
<P>
Interest rate on the 91-day bill increased by seven percentage
points from 18 percent three weeks ago to 25.263 percent at last
week's auction, according to the latest report issued by the
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
The report said that the CBK had advertized for the sale of TB
worth 9 billion Kenyan Shillings (about 140 million U.S. Dollars)
at the auction held last week.
</P>
<P>
The bank received bids worth 11.5 billion Shillings (about 177
million Dollars) at an average interest rate of 25.831 percent,
said the report, adding that the CBK accepted bids worth 8.4
billion Shillings at an average rate of 25.263 percent.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, the Kenyan government announced that it
would allow interest rates on TB to rise in order to arrest
capital flight following the decision of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to suspend a loan package to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) was quoted as
saying that the high yields had caused a slump in activity at the
stock market as investors shift to the TB.
</P>
<P>
During the July 7 riots, the turnover at the NSE plummeted to
five million shares, the lowest traded in the history of the
market, and two weeks ago, volume of the market turnover dropped
to six million shares.
</P>
<P>
Following the rapid rise in TB interest rate, Kenya's
commercial banks are expected to start increasing their base
lending rates.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Barclays Bank in Kenya increased its base rate from
21 percent to 24 percent and the bank will also review its
savings and deposit rates, according to the bank's managing
director Peter Geer.
</P>
<P>
As a result, observers here said that the economic turmoil
caused by the IMF's loan stoppage had derailed the government's
plan of keeping inflation at single digit level.
</P>
<P>
The inflation which had earlier been estimated at 12 percent
is expected to escalate following the recent announcement of
price increases in fuel, food and other commodities.

JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The brush fire which
killed four Israeli soldiers last Thursday in South Lebanon
claimed fifth victim Monday, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Shumato Kasahoun, 21, died late Monday in Haifa's Ramban
Hospital from the serious injuries he suffered in the blaze
following heavy fighting with gunmen from the Amal Shiite
movement in the eastern sector of the Israeli-claimed South
Lebanon Security Zone.

Four Israeli soldiers were burned to death on the hill slope
and six others wounded, three seriously, when they were caught

Israeli News Agency Itim has reported that the blaze, which
quickly spread and engulfed the squad of soldiers on an ambush
duty, was in fact caused by the "friendly fire."

Meanwhile, Israeli army investigators continued their probe

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's foreign currency
reserves reached a record high of 18.25 billion U.S. dollars,
following a 258 million dollars increase in August.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Israel figures available today indicate that the
reserves increased in January-August by about 6.78 billion
dollars, a rise of 58.5 percent since last December.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the August increase in reserves to
government transfers and changes in the banks' deposits with the
Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Israel has not intervened in trading and has not
had to purchase foreign currency from the private sector since
June 20, due to the introduction of foreign currency
liberalization measures taken by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
But from the beginning of the year to mid-June, the Bank
of Israel was allowed to purchase a total of up to 7
billion dollars in foreign currency from the private sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Overseas funds could be a
major factor in developing the economy of Xiangtan City, an old
industrial base in south China's Hunan province, Mayor Jiang
Jianguo told Xinhua recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that overseas funds could help fund construction
projects and get the city more involved in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We have asked all departments to fully implement the
preferential policies made by the central, provincial and
municipal governments."
</P>
<P>
Xiangtan has 2.7 million people and is near the hometown of
late Chairman Mao Zedong. It has 58 big state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"At present, when the lack of funds hinders development, I
believe overseas investors will find many chances to succeed in
Xiangtan," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the year, the city had 20.5 percent
more funds than in the same period last year, and its total
industrial output and income of overseas-funded enterprises

<HEADLINE> S. Korean President Opposes Pardoning Ex-Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam today opposed pardoning two jailed former presidents by
the Mid-Autumn Festival holidays beginning September 15.
</P>
<P>
"I will consider the pardon sometime during my presidential
term. But now is not the time," Kim, whose term expires February,
said about the ex-presidents, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo.
</P>
<P>
By making his decision public, Kim is expected to turn down his
ruling New Korea Party (NKP) Chairman Lee Hoi-chang's proposal of
a pardon of the ex-presidents when they meet on August 28.
</P>
<P>
"Pardon for Chun and Roh is a grave issue which should not be
resolved by political considerations that ignore historical and
judiciary meaning," Kim was quoted as saying by aide Moon Jong-soo.
</P>
<P>
Debate flared last weekend when both ruling and opposition
leaders called for releasing the former presidents, now serving
jail sentences on mutiny charges, by the Mid-Autumn Festival.
</P>
<P>
The move is interpreted as a wooing gesture to Kyongsang
Provinces' voters, the hometowns of Chun and Roh, in view of the
coming presidential election in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
While talking to the press today, Moon Jong-soo ruled out the
possibility of suspending prison sentences for the two former
presidents instead of a pardon before the traditional holidays.
</P>
<P>
"If the time is ripe for a pardon, the president will make a
decision under full legal procedure," Moon said, "this does not
mean Chun and Roh have to live out their full jail sentence."
</P>
<P>
"As the issue of pardon has come out in public, although we
cannot specify when, it will be reviewed continuously and carried
out at a point when public consensus is reached," he said.

<HEADLINE> UNIP Says Government Should Pay Kaunda More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The opposition UNIP party led
by former President Kenneth Kaunda said the 238 million Kwacha
(about 183,000 U.S. Dollars) the government has paid Kaunda since
he stepped down in 1991 is far below his entitlement.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted Kaunda's press aide Muhabi Lungu
as saying here Monday that the government disclosure of the money
was meant to create the impression that it is not ill-treating
the former president, who had ruled Zambia for 27 years until
1991, when he was defeated in the elections.
</P>
<P>
"Why are they disclosing this information now? it is true this
money has been paid but Dr Kaunda is also entitled to a house,
office accommodation, four vehicles and a lot more," Lungu said.
</P>
<P>
He said Kaunda is by law supposed to have a house built or
bought in a place of his choice but the government has denied him
all those privileges.
</P>
<P>
The government Sunday denied claims that Kaunda has been
neglected.
</P>
<P>
chief government spokesman David Mpamba said Kaunda has
received a total of 238.5 million Kwacha in retirement benefits
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
"Zambians must know that the government is not as heartless as
the impression being created by Dr Kaunda. There is no way that
this government has wished or will ever wish Dr Kaunda dead,"
Mpamba said.
</P>
<P>
This referred to a light wound on the head of Dr Kaunda when
he was fired at by a policeman at a rally in the central town of
Kabwe last week. After that, people from the opposition United
National Independence Party (UNIP) considered the government as
heartless in treating the former president.

CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Syria are planning to introduce a system
whereby each side will gradually exempt the other from customs
duty on exchanged goods in implementation of a 1975 trade
agreement, semi-official Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Damascus and Amman are taking a preliminary step by preparing a
short list of goods exchanged by the two countries to exempt them
from customs duty, the paper quoted Jordanian Minister of Trade,
Industry and Supply Hani Moulki as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the two sides are expected to reach a
final agreement on exemptions during a meeting he will hold with
Syria's Minister of Economy and Trade Mohammad al-Imadi in Cairo
this month.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's gasoline prices have gone up by 1.2
percent, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The price of 96 octane gasoline rose by 1.2 percent to 3.37
shekel (about 0.96 U.S. dollar) a liter and the price of 95
octane (unleaded) gasoline also rose by 1.2 percent to 3.37
shekel a liter.
</P>
<P>
However, diesel fuel for commercial vehicles went down in
price by 1.5 percent and heating fuel's cost also dropped.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Israeli Infrastructure Ministry said that the
price changes were caused by the rising cost of oil products in
the Mediterranean area.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) need to invest more than 10 billion U.S. dollars in
industrial projects over the next two years to diversify their
income resources, according to a bank report.
</P>
<P>
GCC officials have begun discussions on projects worth some 18
billion dollars, but the 10 billion figure is more realistic,
said the report by Bahrain's Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report did not specify the projects, but it said the
investment is a move by GCC states to diversify their income
resources, which are heavily reliant on oil exporting.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait and Oman. The six countries control nearly 45
percent of the world's proven oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's foreign currency reserves reached a
record high of 18.25 billion U.S. dollars, following a 258
million dollars increase in August.

The Bank of Israel figures available today indicate that the

<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The commercial operation of the
Philippines' first satellite, Agila II, is targeted to start in
October, Mabuhay Philippines Satellite Corporation President and
Chief Executive Officer Cesar Reyes was quoted as saying today by
the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Agila II was launched on August 20 at Xichang, China, and
settled successfully into its 144 degrees east longitude orbital
slot. The satellite, worth 243 million U.S. dollars, remains in
perfect condition in that slot, the agency quoted Reyes as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said Agila II deployed its solar panels 190 minutes after
take-off and has since gone on to deploy its telecommunications
and broadcast transponders, antennae and other devices and to
employ its earth sensors and earth coverage horns.
</P>
<P>
After two maneuvers, Agila II is already in its station-keeping
box, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said full control of the satellite will pass on to the
Mabuhay Satellite Space Center at the Subic Bay Freeport Zone.
</P>
<P>
Payload in-orbit testing will then be immediately performed by
the center's Filipino satellite engineers, with technical support
from Canada, Reyes said.

</P>
<P>
With the grant, it said, the Philippine government will review
proposals for introducing a motor vehicle inspection system,
assess the capacity building, enforce air quality regulations and
analyze strategies required to mitigate deteriorating air quality
in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that Manila's air pollution has become
increasingly serious with total suspended particulates often
reaching five times the maximum tolerable limit established by the

<HEADLINE> China Revamps Old Cartoon Hero for Modern Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese artists have
revamped the image of an old cartoon star in an effort to compete
with the influx of hip cartoon characters from overseas.
</P>
<P>
"Sanmao," or "Three Hairs," is perhaps the country's most
famous cartoon character, created by Zhang Leping in the
1930s. The story of the street waif reflects the life of
old China.
</P>
<P>
Artists in the 1990s have decided to equip Sanmao, whose image
is protected by the Chinese patent law, with computers, cars and
fashionable clothes, to make him more attractive to young
fans.
</P>
<P>
So far it has worked. The new and improved Sanmao appeared at the
ongoing Eighth National Book Fair in Changchun, capital city of
northeast China's Jilin Province. Some 3,000 Sanmao cartoon books
have been ordered, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Li Mingci, the publisher from the Children's Publishing House,
said that even some Hong Kong publishing houses are interested in
buying the Sanmao copyright.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, official media have repeatedly
called for more Chinese-made cartoon stars in response to the
invasion of foreign heroes who they said "in some ways are not
suitable for children."

thousands of war evacuees in the southern provinces of Cotabato
and Maguindanao to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports cited that the evacuees refuse to go back to

<HEADLINE> SW China Panzhihau to Become Top Rare Metals Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Panzhihua Iron and Steel Co.,
set up in the mid-1960s in southwest China's Sichuan Province,
plans to become a major world producer of vanadium and titanium,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country's top producer of vanadium and titanium, the
company plans to continue expanding its vanadium and titanium
processing capacity in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The annual production capacity of vanadium pentoxide will reach
9,000 tons in 10 years, said the company's president Hong Jipi.
</P>
<P>
Panzhihua has 20 percent of China's iron reserves, 64 percent
of vanadium reserves, and 93 percent of titanium reserves.
Vanadium and titanium are rare minerals widely used in iron, coal,
military and aerospace industries.
</P>
<P>
China had to import vanadium products, as it could not process
vanadium-bearing ores. But things began to change in 1971 when the
company made a breakthrough in processing such ores.
</P>
<P>
China is now the world's fourth largest vanadium producer and
its vanadium products are exported to Japan, Europe and North
America, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
To improve the quality of its vanadium products, the company is
upgrading the current production facilities and will import a new
vanadium production line from Germany.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company, which incorporates 72 member units,
will push forward the shareholding system, the president said.
</P>
<P>
One of its member companies issued A shares last year on the
Shenzhen stock market, and raised 84.7 million yuan (10.2 million
US dollars). And another one is getting ready to issue H shares in

<HEADLINE> China Able to Protect Plants in Three Gorges, Experts Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese botanists say that the
plants in the Three Gorges in the middle section of the Yangtze
River will not face extinction as a result of the construction of
a reservoir there.
</P>
<P>
"We have built more than ten reserve areas and forest parks to
evacuate the valuable plants," said Xu Tianquan, a botanist from
the Chinese Academy of Sciences who is attending an international
botany meeting here.
</P>
<P>
"We have adopted various biological methods, including
establishing a gene warehouse, to ensure that we can have all the
DNA samples of the plants in the Three Gorges," said Huang
Hongsheng, another botanist.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of rare plants, some of them belonging to families
dating back 400 million years, have been found in the Three Gorges
area, which covers 62,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the Three Gorges Dam early next century, the
world's biggest hydro-electric project, will cause the rise of the
Yangtze River, which might change the environment and climate,
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Some people have expressed their concern that the diversity of
plants will be affected.
</P>
<P>
Xu revealed that the establishment of the Three Gorges
Botanical Garden in Yichang in Hubei province has been approved by
the State. Some species that cannot survive in the Three Gorges
will be protected in the garden.

<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese pharmaceutical
manufacturers will put more time, talent and money into
researching world-level, anti-cancer traditional Chinese
medicines, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine
(SATCM) is scheduled to develop several such medicines before the
turn of the century -- used to help alleviate cancer victims' pain
around the world, said Yu Shenglong, SATCM deputy director.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) statistics indicate more
than six million people died from various forms of cancer in the
world last year.
</P>
<P>
In China, 1.6 million cancer cases are reported
annually. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the
country, behind heart and brain vascular diseases.
</P>
<P>
More than two million patients currently suffer from malignant
tumors. One in 200 Chinese families is affected.
</P>
<P>
However, only 20 percent receive surgery, due to various
reasons, including financial and physical situations.
</P>
<P>
Between 10 and 15 percent are suitable for chemical and
radiation therapies, known to cause side effects, said Hong Jing,
SATCM official in charge of scientific research.
</P>
<P>
China began researching anti-cancer medicines from Chinese
herbs in the 1950s, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 herb varieties were tested. Of those, 200 were
deemed effective in improving patients' physical conditions.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 of the drugs have been approved and are being used
clinically.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have so far developed 20 preparations out of Chinese
herbs. Five have been recognized as new traditional Chinese
medicines by the State.

He said that although the region in collaboration with the
Department of Water is taking steps to treat the water, the only
solution to the problem is for the users to boil drinking water

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is targeting
to raise the rate of enrollment of primary school pupils to 85
percent by the year 2000, according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local press on Monday, Deputy
Minister of Education and Culture Bujiku Sakila said that the
recently published basic master plan for education in Tanzania
will enable his ministry to improve the quality and quantity of
primary level education in several aspects.
</P>
<P>
Sakila said that his ministry plans to improve the quality of
the teaching staff by introducing teachers' centers all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
Another aspect aimed to raise the standard of education
focuses on the special project to improve teaching of the three
basic subjects -- mathematics, English and science.
</P>
<P>
The present rate of primary school enrollment in Tanzania
stands at 77 percent. It reached 98 percent in 1981 but
drastically dropped to 65 percent later due to several factors
including the general fall in the standard of education,
according to Sakila.

<P>
HARBIN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China has produced intelligent
robots as advanced as those made by developed countries thanks to
new discoveries in technological research, according to scientists
from the Fifth Robotics Symposium.
</P>
<P>
Some universities and research institutes in China have
developed several kinds of intelligent robots with automatic
functions by adopting multi-sensors to handle information and
program the robot's capabilities. Among the new robots are the
"auto navigation mobile robot" made by the Shenyang Institution of
Automation, the "shopping guide robot" by Shanghai University, the
"automatic car" by Qinghua University and the tourism guide by the
Harbin Polytechnical University.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 experts across the country attended the symposium held
at Harbin Polytechnical University last week, discussing space
robots, robot dynamics, intelligent control and other robotic
technology.
</P>
<P>
"The industrialization of robot production has aroused great
concern among scientists, and the development in cloning
technology has led to discussion on basic topics in robotics,"
said Cai Hegao, vice-chairman of the symposium.
</P>

<HEADLINE> India Raises Prices of Petroleum Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- After months of waiting, the
Indian government has finally taken a decision on a hike in prices
of petroleum products with effect from midnight Monday, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision, reached after an hour-and-a-half-long cabinet
meeting late Monday night, took into account the objection of the
left parties and ensured that the price increase is relatively
moderate.
</P>
<P>
The left parties, which are the major constituents of the
ruling United Front, have been opposed to the price rise, which
they say would impose an additional burden on the poor.
</P>
<P>
According to the cabinet package, prices (excluding taxes) of
gas is up by 1 rupee (about 2.86 U.S. cents) per liter, diesel by
1.8 rupees (about 5.14 cents) per liter and cooking gas by 15
rupees (about 42.86 cents) per cylinder.
</P>
<P>
However, kerosene, "the fuel of the poor," has been spared.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also approved proposals for phased dismantling of
price and marketing controls over petroleum products and for
lowering excise and customs duties, details of which will be
announced within six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The price hike had become inevitable because of burgeoning
deficit resulting from huge government subsidies to the prices of
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated deficit, which stood at 155 billion rupees
(about 4.43 billion dollars) at the beginning of this financial
year (from April 1997 to March 1998), had reached 182 billion
rupees (about 5.2 billion dollars) by June 30, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to See Lower Tapioca Output Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Tapioca production
is predicted to be at 15.2 million tons next year, down about 14
percent from this year.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was made by the Thai Commerce Ministry after it
conducted a survey on major tapioca growing regions nationwide
last week together with leading tapioca traders and producers
associations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Planters are tending to cultivate other cereals that yield
higher returns such as sugar cane to survive the country's
economic crisis because they lack confidence in export prices of
tapioca, said Pracha Charutrakulchai, director general of the
Foreign Trade Department under the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Pracha said that the total cassava growing area in the country
will drop to 5.85 million rai (0.94 million hectares) next year
from the current 6.6 million rai (1.05 million hectares).
</P>
<P>
The yield per rai (0.16 hectare) will also fall to 2.26 tons
next year due to drought in some areas, Pracha said.
</P>
<P>
In northeastern Thailand, drought is expected to destroy 30 to
50 percent of tapioca crop next year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The department is also concerned that 1.5 million tons of
tapioca pellets exporters have in stock will face export problems
next year, Pracha said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are some 150,000 tons of tapioca flour
remaining in warehouses in Thailand, waiting for export by the end
of this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government and exporters are joining forces to accelerate
exports to reduce current stocks by the end of the year, he added.

BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- As many as two-thirds or about
12,000 employees in the finance sector of Thailand are expected to
lose their jobs in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
The 58 finance firms, whose operations have been suspended by
order of the government because of their deep indebtedness and
mismanagement, currently employ about 18,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Once the firms have completed their merger and acquisition
plans in the next few months, 12,000 employees would be laid off
immediately, according to Labor and Social Welfare Ministry
officials.
</P>
<P>
The high rate of job loss has caused concern to the ministry
because the laid-off employees will still have financial
commitments to meet, such as paying housing or car installments,
and the day-to-day needs of feeding their families.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will accelerate job expansion in the urban and
rural areas in preparation for the jobless, officials at the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Economic slowdown has forced many companies and factories in
the country to reduce the size of their staffs.

U.S. soldiers and a Turkish woman, judicial sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Mousbah Eter Abulgassem, 40, could be sent to Germany
within the next 20 days, although extradition from Italy normally
require 40 days, Italian judicial authorities added.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 people were also injured in the nightclub
frequented by U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Following the blast, then U.S. President Ronald Reagan ordered
reprisal bombing raids on the Libyan cities of Tripoli and
Benghazi.
</P>
<P>
Abulgassem agreed to be extradited during questioning by a
court of appeals judge at Regina Coeli prison, where he has been
held since police arrested him here last Tuesday on an
international warrant issued by Germany.
</P>
<P>
Abulgassem fled Germany in late July following his release from
custody, while awaiting trial on charges of involvement in the
La Belle nightclub blast.
</P>
<P>
Italian anti-terrorist police questioned Abulgassem last week
after a raid on a Rome apartment. The raid also resulted in the
detention of three other suspects, Libyans Hanna Ben Amer and
Khaled Ettir and Italian Nerina Bernabei.

WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will not attend the funeral of Princess Diana on Saturday, a White
House spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"The president will not attend the funeral for Princess Diana,"
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters accompanying Clinton on his
three-week vacation on Martha's Vineyard Island in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
"Consultations are ongoing to determine the appropriate
representation for the president and people of the United States,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Al Gore customarily represents the United States
at funeral services of foreign dignitaries.
</P>

In a condolence letter to British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Clinton wrote: "The British people, indeed all of us, have lost a
friend."
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the other condolence letters, which were sent via
diplomatic cable to Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles and Diana's
family, would remain private.
</P>

"We liked her very much. We admired her work for children, for
people with AIDS, for the cause of ending the scourge of land
mines in the world," Clinton said on Sunday after Diana died.
</P>
<P>
"We can only hope that her work will go forward and that
everyone who can will support her two fine sons and help them to
have the life and the future that she would want," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes Asian Banks' Investment: PM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin made this appeal
today at the opening ceremony of the 14th Conference of
Representatives of the Asian Bankers Association (ABS).
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that Russia's investment environment has been
considerably improved.
</P>
<P>
This year is a turning point to the country's economic
development with slumps in the gross domestic product (GDP) curbed
and people's income grown moderately. Russia has also seen a
stable financial situation, in which inflation has dropped
remarkably, bank loans increased and interests rate lowered.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that Russia is to make more efforts to
further improve investment climate in 1998. Measures to be taken
include cutting the financial deficit, lowering national debt
rates, carrying out taxation reforms and protecting investors.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government and the Central Bank should
help create favorable conditions for investments to go into
high-tech and strong and promising enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a letter of
congratulations to the conference on the same day. He expressed
the hope to further enhance the cooperation between Russian and
foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Bankers Association consists of more than 200 banks
in the Asian-Pacific region. This is the first time that the
association held its conference in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Third Generation of CPC Leaders, China's Reunification (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1990s, especially after the 14th CPC National Congress
in 1992, the third generation of CPC leaders, during the
complicated transitional period, applied the "one country, two
systems" principle to a range of issues related to the return of
Hong Kong, making Deng's principle a reality.
</P>
<P>
In consideration of the unco-operative and negative actions
from the British side, the CPC Central Committee developed a
policy of "taking ourselves as the mainstay" and dealt reasonably
with the British in accordance with National People's Congress
(NPC) and NPC Standing Committee decisions.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee then took a series of measures, such
as the establishment of the Preliminary Working Committee for the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) and the Provisional Legislative Council, to clear
away any obstables that might hinder a smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
In the process of recovering Hong Kong, the CPC Central
Committee had insisted on a policy of "catering to the Hong Kong
people and relying on them". This policy has been conducive in
drafting the Basic Law, inviting advisors on Hong Kong affairs,
establishing the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR and the
Selection Committee for the HKSAR's first government. It has also
been helpful in implementing a series of Hong Kong policies like
the principle of "one country, two systems", "the Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong", "a high-degree autonomy in Hong Kong",
and "maintaining stability and prosperity in Hong Kong." As a reult,
Hong Kong has eventually returned smoothly to China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin said that China's resumption of sovereignty over
Hong Kong is the first stop in the great cause of reunifying the
motherland, which is followed by the issues of Macao and Taiwan.

<P>
The CPC Central Committee has also placed great importance on a
smooth transition of Macao and on developing relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Portugese governments signed a joint
declaration on Macao in April, 1987. The Chinese government
declared that China would resume sovereignty over Macao on
December 20, 1999 and would use the "one country, two systems"
principle.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of Macao, which embodies this principle, was
officially published in March, 1993, after more than four years of
work. Negotiations have been held on three major
issues: the localization of public servants and laws and the
official status of the Chinese language. The Macao issue is
expected to be solved properly.
</P>
<P>
Since January, 1979, when the NPC Standing Committee issued the
"Letter to Taiwan Compatriots", the CPC has formulated a range of
policies toward Taiwan so as to develop relations across the
Taiwan Straits, promote economic cooperation and trade, and
increase visits and trust between the two sides under the basic
principle of "peaceful reunification, one country, two
systems".
</P>
<P>
On January 30, 1995, Jiang Zemin delivered a speech,
"Continuing the Struggle for a Fulfilment of the Great Cause of
Reunification of the Motherland", in which the principle of
"peaceful reunification, one country, two systems" was explained
and eight views and proposals on developing relations across the
straits were put forward.

<P>
Jiang Zemin proposed that the two sides, as a first step, hold
talks "under the principle of one China, formally putting an end
to hostilities across the Taiwan Straits".
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the two sides then do their duties in
safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and
make plans for the further development of relations across the
straits.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "political differences should not influence
or interfere in economic cooperation across the straits" and that
"steps should be taken for the realization of direct mail,
shipping and air links" between the two sides. Jiang's speech was
widely praised and well received by the people inside and outside
China.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the NPC Standing Committee and State
Council departments have issued major provisions and regulations
on Taiwan. And visitors have been increasing in number. In 1996
alone, 1.72 million Taiwan residents visited the interior areas of
China.
</P>
<P>
The development of relations across the straits and a peaceful
reunification of the motherland have become a historical trend.
</P>
<P>
It is reasonable to think that the CPC, which has successfully
resumed the excercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, will be able
to lead the Chinese nation to another victory in the coming
century. China's success in solving the Hong Kong issue by using the
principle of "one country, two systems" will certainly have a
profound impact on the return of Macao to the motherland and the
sovling of the Taiwan issue.

<HEADLINE> Laos Becomes AIPO's Seventh Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Laotian Parliament was
accepted Monday as the seventh member of the ASEAN
Inter-Parliamentary Organization (AIPO) at the organization's 18th
General Assembly held in Bali, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Laos now joins Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam as AIPO members, reports reaching here today
from Bali said.
</P>
<P>
Laos and Myanmar just joined ASEAN in July this year.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) now groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also adopted a resolution that admits another new
ASEAN member, Myanmar, as an AIPO special observer. Myanmar, like
Brunei, has not received full membership to AIPO because it does
not have a legislative body yet.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Indonesian House of Representatives Wahono said
that AIPO's decision to admit Laos was additional proof of ASEAN's
consistent policy in building the Southeast Asian region into a
solid group.
</P>
<P>
He said AIPO was looking forward to seeing a settlement to the
internal conflict in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The six-day annual forum, which started Monday, will discuss
economic, social and organizational matters.
</P>
<P>
Beside the member countries, observer delegations from
Cambodia, Australia, China, the European Parliament, South Korea,
New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Russia also attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
A member of the assembly's Steering Committee Taheri Noor said
the meeting was expected to draw up a resolution to help ASEAN
governments cope with the monetary turmoil in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said AIPO was likely to suggest that ASEAN governments make
use of a joint monetary institution already approved last month to
help countries which suffer from the overpriced U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Currencies in Southeast Asian countries have come under fierce
speculative attacks following de facto devaluation of the Thai
baht and the Philippine peso in July.

<HEADLINE> Third Generation of CPC Leaders, China's Reunification (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The reunification of China has
been the historical mission of Chinese leaders in the past, but it
is the present generation of Communist Party of China (CPC) leaders,
with General Secretary Jiang Zemin as the core, that has made the
idea of "one country, two systems" a reality.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan have been an inseparable part of
the Chinese territory since ancient times, but Hong Kong was
occupied by the British for more than 156 years, Macao has been
occupied by the Portugese, and Taiwan has been under the rule of
the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong and Macao and the solving of the Taiwan issue for the great
cause of the reunification of the motherland is the wish of all ethnic
groups, including the people of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China made a big step in this direction on July 1 this year,
when the return of Hong Kong became a historical feat of the
third generation of the CPC leaders.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s and 1960s, the first generation of the CPC
leaders, headed by Mao Zedong, while insisting on China's
sovereignty over Hong Kong, worked out a plan in line with actual
conditions to develop closer ties with Hong Kong and support the
economic development of the region, thus laying a solid foundation
for solving the Hong Kong issue in the future.
</P>
<P>
The second generation of the CPC leaders, headed by Deng
Xiaoping, with strategic insight, wisdom and bravery, put forward
the creative principle of "one country, two systems" and applied
it to the solving of the Hong Kong issue in the 1970s and
1980s.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Thailand to Fall Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The regionwide economic
slowdown would reduce international tourist traffic and foreign
tourist arrivals in Thailand in the next two years may not attain
the target, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) conceded.
</P>
<P>
TAT Governor Seree Wangpaichitr said Monday that it would be
unlikely for TAT to reach the target of attracting 17 million
foreign tourists in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
He said TAT would strongly promote tourism in the provinces as
part of the strategy to extend the stay of tourists.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will officially launch an "amazing Thailand"
promotional campaign in January for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, foreign tourist arrivals in Thailand are
between 6 and 7 million.
</P>
<P>
Although the depreciation of the Thai baht could make Thailand
a cheaper tourist destination, several other currencies in the
region have also depreciated, reducing Thailand's competitive
edge.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Tobacco Money's Influence on Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Legislators who received
contributions from tobacco companies were three times more likely
to have voted to block spending to help states fight cigarette
sales to minors, according to an anti-smoking group's analysis.
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested that 34
million dollars be distributed to states to enforce new federal
rules designed to prevent tobacco sales to teens.
</P>
<P>
An attempt to provide the full amount was blocked in July. A
Senate committee voted to provide just 4.9 million dollars, and
the full Senate voted 52-48 to turn back an amendment by Senator
Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, that would have added the
remaining funds.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of campaign contributions from tobacco companies
shows that senators who opposed Harkin's amendment had received 15
times more tobacco money during the last election year than did
supporters of the FDA funding.
</P>
<P>
The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said that of the 47 senators
who had received money from the tobacco industry, 83 percent voted
to table Harkin's amendment. Of the 53 senators who took no
tobacco money, 25 percent voted to table the amendment.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, in the House of Representatives, a committee that
voted to give the FDA 24 million dollars to fight teen smoking,
and an amendment for the full 34 million dollars was
defeated. Lawmakers who voted against the money took, on average,
five times as much money from the tobacco industry as their
colleagues, the financial analysis found.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Develops Livestock Breeding, Fishery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is making efforts to
develop livestock breeding and fishery, encouraging local private
and foreign investments in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the country's livestock and
fishery production registered a growth of 9.7 percent in the
1996-97 fiscal year ending March over the previous fiscal year due
mainly to increase in both meat and fish production.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the livestock breeding and fishery sector
 reached 269.54 million U.S. dollars in 17 permitted projects at
the end of July this year, according to the latest official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in the sector reportedly came from
Thailand, China, Japan, Bangladesh and Singapore. Companies from
these countries have been forming joint ventures with Myanmar's
state enterprises to engage in the production and export marketing
of fish, prawn and marine products in the country's coastal areas
including those in Tanintharyi division and Rakhine state.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar began granting fishing rights and initiated joint
fishery development programs and formation of joint venture
enterprises with both foreign and local companies in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Besides permitting foreign investors to undertake related
livestock and fishery industry such as cattle breeding, pig and
poultry farming, construction of ice, canning and fish meal
plants, and cold storage, Myanmar also allows local private
entrepreneurs to operate leasable fisheries and grants cultivable
waste and fallow land for them to undertake livestock breeding and
fishery on commercial basis as well as to import offshore fishing
vessels.
</P>
<P>
To promote private sector's activities in the industry, the
Myanmar government established in February 1996 the Livestock
Breeding and Fisheries Development Bank, partly capitalized with
private shares, extending financial assistance to the
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has a long coastal line of 2,832 kilometers and the
total area of swamps along the coast is about 500,000 hectares
providing a good basis for the development of shrimp and prawn
culture.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar exploited about 590,000 tons of marine products
annually in the past few years out of the maximum sustainable
yield estimated at about 1.05 million tons per year.
</P>
<P>
The freshwater fish and marine fish production of the country
registered an annual growth of 8.9 and 39.5 percent respectively
in the 1996-97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Total exports of the livestock and fishery sector in the same
period reached 121 million U.S. dollars with fish and prawn as
the major export items.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen here said that the livestock breeding and fishery,
one of Myanmar's productive sectors, showed vast potentials for
further expansion by effectively utilizing and sharing the rich
resources and attracting more foreign and local investments.

<HEADLINE> Japan Approves 4 Billion Dollar Loans to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of
Japan has signed an agreement with the Bank of Thailand to offer 4
billion U.S. dollars in loans to Thailand to help it prop up its
foreign reserves, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The loan signed Monday is the largest provided by an individual
country to Thailand in the rescue package led by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
It is also the largest financing offer parallel with the IMF
made by the Japanese bank, which extended 1 billion dollars in
loans to Mexico in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand Governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi said that the
funds from Japan will be used as standby credits to shore up
Thailand's official foreign reserves, which has dropped to 27.9
billion dollars as of August 14.
</P>
<P>
The funds match those extended by the IMF, with disbursement
conditional on Thailand's meeting IMF-set economic targets,
including keeping foreign exchange reserves at 23 billion dollars
for this year.
</P>
<P>
Funds from the Japanese loans are to arrive in Thailand by
September 10 and annual interest on the yen loans is 2.75 percent
with repayment terms set for five to seven years, Chaiyawat said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the World Bank Monday announced it
would lend 25 million dollars to Thailand for studying ways to
restructure the finance sector, including how to protect public
deposits.
</P>
<P>
The bank is expected to approve the funding on September 11,
Thai government spokesman Vorathep Rattanakorn said.

<HEADLINE> China to Upgrade Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China is making efforts to
upgrade its township and village to guarantee a healthy
development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo as saying
that one key way is to construct better coal mines in some 200
counties.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Ministry of Coal Industry revealed that it
would give priority to building and upgrading mines in the 200 key
coal-producing counties.
</P>
<P>
According to the same sources, the ministry and China
Agricultural Bank have jointly established special loans for the
construction of the mines.
</P>
<P>
Mines in the key coal production counties, with 1.2 million
employees, generated 1.4 billion yuan in profits and 1.2 billion
yuan in taxes last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is determined to further reform the
management system of coal enterprises. Establishing a
shareholding company system is a main goal. More than 10,000
shareholding companies, or 35 percent of the total, have been
established in the key counties.
</P>
<P>
It will encourage mergers and cooperation between coal
producers. By 2000, every key coal producing county is expected
to create one or two coal groups whose assets are over 100 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Coal mines are also urged to enlarge their production scale and
to speed up technical renovation to improve the production and
decrease the pollution.
</P>
<P>
Implementing the coal law is a good way to regulate the
development of township and village mines, especially in key
counties. According to law, coal producers must apply for the mine
license and the production license from the government.
</P>
<P>
To date, 89 percent of coal producers in key counties have mine
licenses, 20 percentage points higher than the average level of
total township and village mines.
</P>
<P>
China has shut down more than 2,000 illegal private coal
mines. Last year, it produced 1.4 billion tons of coal last year,
ranking first in the world.

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The acreage for grain
production in China has been dropping for the past five years, but
output hit a record of 490 billion kg last year, and science and
technology had a role in this.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology contributed nearly 40 percent to China's
agricultural development, helping increase per-ha grain output by
some 500 kg in the past five years, according to a recent State
Statistical Bureau report.
</P>
<P>
The central government had many key projects to promote
agriculture through science and technology during the period, and
more than 300 new varieties of crops have been developed,
increasing rice output by 10-15 percent and soybean output almost
100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The amount of chemical fertilizers grew 37 percent, and China's
per-unit output of rice, wheat, and corn is from 26 to 50 percent
more than the world average.
</P>
<P>
The influence of science and technology can also be felt in
other areas. In the past five years, the country has had an annual
average increase of 20 percent in science and technology spending,
amounting to 91.4 billion yuan last year. It now has more than 2.7
million people working in the field, 130 percent more than for
1991.
</P>
<P>
The strategic role of science research in economic growth
became more defined during the period. Three billion yuan was
spent on state natural science fund projects, key lab programs,
and key research.
</P>
<P>
The number of advanced state labs grew from 74 in 1991 to 153
by the end of last year.

Industrial enterprises have become the major users of
scientific and technological research development. Large and
medium-sized businesses have enjoyed an annual average rise of 18
percent in technological development over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Spending on technological upgrading added up to 430 billion
yuan during the period, an average growth of nearly 23 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
The successful launching of recoverable satellites, the
application of genetically engineered medicines, and some other
sophisticated developments have greatly helped the country's
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan, China saw an average annual
increase of 27 percent in high-tech foreign trade and had 31.9
billion US dollars of high-tech imports and exports in 1995, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China had more than 31,000 major scientific and
technological developments. And it received more than 100,000
patent applications, 20 percent of which came from abroad.
</P>
<P>
All these indicate that China is opening wider to the outside
world, that its investment environment is improving, and that it
is more attractive to overseas investors.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Education Ministry
has lifted the ban on Islamic religious dress in state-run
schools, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The change was announced by Deputy Education Minister Areepen
Uttarasin Monday, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
School authorities in the Muslim-dominated provinces of Satun,
Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat have been informed of the lifting of
the ban, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The move was made to end long-standing conflicts with Muslim
parents in the four southernmost provinces, where Muslim parents
usually sent their children to private or Muslim schools instead
of state-run schools due to the ban, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry will advise Muslim students to dress in
white and blue, the common school uniform color.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Chicken Exports Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of frozen
and processed chicken rose 10 percent in terms of both value and
volume during the first half of this year compared with the same
1996 period.
</P>
<P>
A total of 87,200 tons of the products, worth 6.3 billion baht
(247 million U.S. dollars), were shipped during the said period,
according to Foreign Trade Department figures available today.
</P>
<P>
The main market was Japan, which consumed as much as 65 percent
of Thailand's frozen chicken exports and 81 percent of its
processed chicken.
</P>
<P>
However, growth of frozen chicken exports to Japan dropped
slightly this year, as prices of the Thai products were higher
than those from China, Brazil and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Europe, the second largest export market for Thai frozen
chicken, showed promising increase in consumption, as two
diseases currently affecting the European Union's livestock
industry -- madcow disease and classical swine fever -- led to a
fall in beef and pork consumption in some European countries.
</P>
<P>
The increase was also attributed to the fact that 21 Thai
poultry producers had received EU quality standard certification
for imports.

BUENOS AIRES, September 1 (Xinhua) - Argentine soccer star
Diego Maradona said in an emotional phone call to local television
that a suspension would strip too much joy from him.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell all those who are already giving me up for dead
that I'm already carrying too heavy a cross with this addiction
for them to come along. They want me off the soccer pitch, which
is where I feel happy," Maradona said in the phone call.
</P>
<P>
He did not deny that he had taken prohibited substances before
failing a dope test last week.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "I don't know what the second test result is going
to be," he said. "And if it's negative, what happens? I've got to
play on Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Boca Juniors star tested positive in the first
doping test after a league match last week.
</P>

Contrary to the explanation by his agent Guillermo Coppola that
he had been framed, Maradona said, "I don't want the people to
say 'They planted this on Maradona, they planted that on
Maradona.'"

<HEADLINE> Record Dry Spell Threatens China's Autumn Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The worst drought in two
decades is threatening China's autumn harvest, and efforts must be
made to prepare for an extremely long period of difficulties
caused by the drought, the State Drought-relief Headquarters and
the Ministry of Water Resources warned.
</P>
<P>
This summer, large areas of north of the Yangtze River have
been hit by the worst drought since 1970s, affecting 23 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities, covering over two-thirds of
the country in the past two months, with the dry spell lasting
more than 100 days in some places, today's China Daily quoted
sources at the headquarters and the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
In late June and early July, a record 20 million ha of crops
were affected, the largest drought-stricken areas in the past two
decades, experts said.
</P>
<P>
"Although heavy rains brought by Typhoon Winnie between August
18-22 have eased the heat wave in Shandong and Anhui provinces in
east China, and in Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin provinces in
northeast China, some six million ha of crops are still suffering
from the drought," said one expert.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few weeks, water shortage has jeopardized a large
number of rice fields along the upper and middle areas of the
Yangtze River. Henan, Hebei, Shanxi and Hubei were the worst-hit
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Efforts taken so far have not only ensured the normal
irrigation of crops and farmland in the large-scale irrigation
areas but also met the irrigation needs of 33 million ha of
autumn crops.
</P>
<P>
An estimated six billion kg of crops and 360,000 tons of fruits
have been saved thanks to the widespread use of a
drought-resistant chemical preparation nicknamed "dragon of arid
areas", which can preserve soil and crop moisture under scorching
sunshine, said officials with the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
All government departments of water resources, agriculture,
finance, power, and weather forecasting should co-ordinate
drought-relief efforts, and extensive water conservation projects
should be built, the headquarters and the ministry demanded.

<HEADLINE> Interbank Rate Soars in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The interbank overnight rate
rose to a historical high of 40 percent Monday in the Philippines
as banks sought limited funds in the market to cover the higher
liquidity reserves required by the Philippine Central Bank,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a purely market-driven rate. The central bank's
borrowing rate is still at 12 percent," a trader at a medium-sized
bank was quoted by local newspaper Manila Bulletin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Liquidity is tight as banks tried to cover the higher liquidity
reserve requirement of the central bank, which has continued to
refuse lending overnight money, the trader said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the central bank raised liquidity reserves or the
amount of funds banks are required to park in government
securities to eight percent of deposits from five percent after
the peso-dollar rate hit a low of 30.45 pesos to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The peso was trading at an average of 30.267 pesos to a dollar
Monday, up 0.08 centavos from last Friday's average close of
30.352 pesos, after opening at 30.08 pesos to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
Treasury bill rates also soared to five-year highs Monday amid
central bank efforts to rein in liquidity that could be used for
speculation on the peso.
</P>
<P>
The average rate for the bellwether 91-day Treasury bills
surged to 19.326 percent Monday from 14.188 percent last week,
while the rate for the 182-day bill rose sharply to 20.083 percent
from 15.817 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, battered by prospects of higher interest rates
caused by the government's tightening of money in circulation to
support the peso, local stocks fell to another record low.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Manufacture Cars in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Daewoo will be able
to manufacture cars in Ukraine as it is expected to sign an
agreement on September 3 to establish a joint venture with the
Ukrainian automaker AvtoZaz.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo plans to invest 150 million U.S. dollars to modernize
AvtoZaz and install a new assembly line. Under the terms of the
draft agreement, the South Korean company has to reinvest its
profits in the joint venture in a period of ten years.
</P>
<P>
Annual production is expected to reach 150,000 cars in four
years, including 80,000 modernized versions of AvtoZaz's Tavria
cars, 25,000 Opel cars and 45,000 Daewoo sedans. The capacity will
finally climb to 250,000 automobiles per year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the joint venture will put out 300,000 car
engines, one third of which will be exported to European
countries, one third to CIS countries and the rest to be sold in
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between Ukrainian Prime Minister Valeriy
Pustovoitenko and Daewoo's Chairman Kim Woo Jung on August 29, Kim
set a precondition for the establishment of the joint venture --
to write off AvtoZaz's debts and exempt the plant from all taxes
for ten years.
</P>
<P>
Kim also urged the Ukrainian government to impose a 20 percent
import duty and a 10 percent excise duty on vehicles produced by
other foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament then adopted a law writing off
AvtoZaz's debts but declined to raise import and excise
duties. The parliament also refused to exempt the joint venture
from taxes.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko viewed the parliamentary rejection not as a
tragedy. He said the Ukrainian government is interested in foreign
investment in AvtoZaz as well as the presence of Daewoo in the
Ukrainian market.
</P>
<P>
After pledging assistance to the joint venture, the Ukrainian
prime minister asked Daewoo to invest in other sectors of the
Ukrainian economy such as the shipbuilding industry.

<HEADLINE> Maradona Was framed: Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Diego Maradona, who
tested positive for cocaine last week, could have been framed, his
agent Guillermo Coppola told local television on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is so simple...a little drop, a glass of water or a sweet
containing the substance," Coppola said.
</P>
<P>
Coppola said Maradona, who is with the Argentine side Boca
Junior, had sworn to him that he had not taken cocaine.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine Football Association announced last Thursday that
he had failed a random drug test after scoring a penalty in his
first match of the new season for Boca Juniors.
</P>
<P>
If a second test confirmed the doping result, the 36-year old
hero would be suspended.
</P>
<P>
Maradona has twice received 15-month playing bans -- for using
cocaine when playing for Napoli in 1991 and for use of
performance-enhancing drugs at the 1994 World Cup in the United
States.
